My name is Jay, and I will be your audio coordinator for today. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. I\u2019d now like to turn our presentation over to your hostess for today\u2019s call, Ms. Mary Finnegan. Please proceed, ma'am. Mary T. Finnegan: Thanks, Jay, and good evening, everyone. I\u2019m Mary Finnegan. I'm the Treasurer and responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo, and I\u2019m happy you\u2019re joining us tonight. I'm here today with Olivier Filliol, our CEO; and Bill Donnelly, our Executive Vice President. I need to cover just a couple of administrative matters. This call is being Webcast and is available for replay on our website. A copy of the press release and the presentation that we'll refer to on today's call is also available on our website.

I\u2019m going to now turn the call over to Olivier. Olivier A. Filliol: Thanks, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter, and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments on 2014. As always, we will have time for Q&A at the end. The highlights of the quarter are on Page 2 of the presentation. Local currency sales increased 4% in the quarter with very strong growth in Europe. We have solid growth in the Americas and improving demand in China, although as expected sales were down in the quarter. China sales results were offset by relatively good growth in all the regions of Asia / Rest of World. We executed well in the quarter and I\u2019m pleased with our growth in earnings per share, particularly given the challenging currency headwinds we faced in the quarter. We are benefiting from our values cost control and margin initiatives that we have enacted over the last few years. Let me turn it to Bill, to provide more details on the financial results and an update to our guidance for the year. William P. Donnelly: Thanks, Olivier, and hello, everybody. Let me start with additional details on sales, which were $550.6 million in the quarter, an increase of 4% in local currency. On a dollar base -- U.S. dollar basis, sales increased 5%, as currencies benefited by about 1% in the quarter. Turning to Page 3 of the presentation, we outlined sales by geography. In the quarter, local currency sales increased by 9% in Europe, 3% in the Americas and 1% in Asia / Rest of World. Without the impact of exited product lines, Asia / Rest of World increased by 2% in the quarter. For China specifically, local currency sales, excluding exited product lines, were flat with the prior-year. Exited product lines contributed a further 2% decline in China sales for the quarter. Sales growth by product line for the quarter is highlighted on Slide number 4. Laboratory sales increased by 7% in local currency, while industrial increased 1%. Adjusting for the China product line exits, industrials increased by 2%, food retailing increased by 8% in the quarter. Turning to the next slide, let me walk you through the key P&L items for the quarter. Gross margins were 53.1%, this compares to 53.2% in the prior-year. This was a little lower than we expected. We had benefited from pricing and lower raw material costs, which were offset by unfavorable mix, currency, and higher inventory charges. R&D amounted to $29.5 million, a 4% increase in local currency. The increase was principally driven by project development activity. SG&A amounted to $172.2 million, which is an increase of 3% in local currency. Increased sales and marketing costs and higher variable compensation were offset by cost savings initiatives and lower employee benefit costs. Adjusted operating income amounted to $91 million in the quarter, which is a 6% increase over the prior-year amount of $85.4 million. Our operating margins were 16.5%, that\u2019s a 20 basis point increase over the prior-year. Currency had a larger negative impact on operating profit than we had expected the last time we spoke. We estimate currency reduced operating profit by $3.7 million. Without this impact operating profit would have increased 11% and our operating margins would have grown by 100 bps in the quarter. Given this headwind, we\u2019re pleased with the growth in operating income and our margin expansion for the quarter.  A couple of final items on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $7.1 million in the quarter. Interest expense was $5.7 million, while our effective tax rate was 24%. Fully diluted shares for the quarter were 30.1 million, that\u2019s a 3% decline from the prior-year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted earnings per share were $2, a 9% increase over the prior-year amount of $1.84. Currency reduced EPS by approximately 5%. Given this headwind, again we\u2019re pleased with earnings growth in the quarter. On a reported basis, earnings per share was a $1.93, this compares to a $1.69 in the prior-year. Reported EPS includes pre-tax restructuring charges of $1.5 million or $0.04 a share, which are primarily employee-related charges. Reported EPS also includes $0.03 of purchased intangible amortization. Now turning to cash flow, free cash flow in the quarter was $34 million, and this compares to $9.6 million in the prior-year. We are obviously improved with that strong number. Working capital statistics were solid in the quarter with ITO at 5.1x and our DSO at 48 days; both of these are slight improvements as compared to the prior-year. Let me make some additional comments on our balance sheet before turning to guidance. We have about $350 million of net debt which is a relatively modest level resulting in a net debt to EBITDA ratio of approximately 0.6x. Given this solid capital structure and cash flow generation capability, we believe we can improve our cost of capital with modest increases in our leverage ratio over time. We\u2019ve evaluated different alternatives to achieve this objective. In consultation with our Board, we have decided to increase the level of our share repurchases in the coming quarters. We\u2019ve always believed that having an investment grade rating was appropriate for this business, but we can maintain such a rating with a larger debt burden than we have today. This is a gradual change that we expect to do in our capital structure and it will not have any impact on our ability to do bolt-on acquisitions. We also want to highlight that we do expect the changes in our leverage levels to be gradual and achieved over multiple years and begin to have a modest benefit to EPS towards the end of this year. Just one last item on the balance sheet and cash flow, given the strong start to the year, I think will likely our cash flow will come closer to the $310 million range and this compares to the $305 million we had discussed in the last quarter. Now let's turn to guidance. We are more optimistic about our Western markets as the conditions appear to be improving. Europe will face tougher comparisons in the second half, but we expect both Americas and Europe to perform well this year. Offsetting this is greater uncertainty and caution in emerging markets. Year-to-date China is pretty much playing out according to our expectations that we shared with you last quarter. While sales growth was a little bit better than we expected, there remains enough uncertainty to keep us cautious. We expect sales to be flattish in the second quarter and then see sales growth in the second half of the year, principally due to easier comparisons in China. As a reminder, we estimate exited product lines will reduce sales by approximately 2% for the full-year. In terms of our emerging markets macroeconomic conditions in Russia, Brazil and India are all weaker as compared to the last time we spoke. Taken altogether, we\u2019re slightly more positive about the developed world which is offset by a little more caution towards emerging markets. Given this outlook and the good start to the year with our Q1 sales growth, we are moving our full-year sales guidance to approximately 4%. This compares to our previous guidance in the range of 3% to 4%. We are also raising the bottom end of our adjusted EPS guidance by a nickel to $11.45. This reflects the Q1 results, some help at the end of the year from the increase in our share repurchase program offset by a little greater currency headwinds than previously thought. The top line remains at $11.60, which results in a growth rate of between 8% and 10%. Our previous guidance was $11.40 to $11.60 per share. For the second quarter, we would expect local currency sales growth to be in the range of 3% to 4% and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.50 to $2.55 or a growth rate of 6% to 9%. Similar to what we experienced in the first quarter, earnings per share growth is lower versus our full-year guidance as two of the headwinds we faced this year, higher Blue Ocean amortization and foreign exchange, had a larger impact as compared -- in the first half of the year as compared to the second half of the year. There is also more difficult comparison on sales as compared to Q1. As you're updating your models, let me also cover some additional specifics on guidance. First, currency. We\u2019d expect currency to have no impact on second quarter sales. It should also have no impact on Q3 sales, but will reduce Q4 sales by about 1%. These are all based on current exchange rates. For the full year, we\u2019d expect to have no impact on currency -- on sales due to currency. In terms of impact of currency on earnings, we\u2019d expect currency to reduce earnings by approximately 2% in Q2, 1% in Q3, and to be slightly negative in Q4. For the full-year 2014, currency is expected to reduce earnings growth by 2%. This is slightly worse than what we discussed last quarter. Okay, that\u2019s it from my side. And now let me turn it back to Olivier. Olivier A. Filliol: Thanks, Bill, and let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab increased 7% in the quarter with very good growth in Balances, Analytical Instruments and Automated Chemistry. Process Analytics and Pipette also had growth in the quarter. Industrial increased 1% in the quarter. We are happy to see core industrial returning to growth with 2% sales increase in the quarter. Product Inspection also had growth. Retail increased 8% in the quarter driven by project activity in Europe. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Europe was up very strongly in the quarter with a 9% growth, better than we expected. While comparisons were fairly easy, we did see good growth in most countries. Americas increased 3% in the quarter. We had good growth in Lab and Core Industrial offset by Product Inspection, which was up against very strong comparisons from a year earlier period. Asia / Rest of the World increased 1% in the quarter. Bill already made some comments on China, but let me add some additional ones. As mentioned, China is pretty much on track with our expectations. We recognized it is going to take some time to work through the weakness in industrial sectors, but I\u2019m pleased with the strong growth that we\u2019re seeing in certain markets. For example, our Lab business was up 6% in the quarter in China. However, if you look deeper, you\u2019d see that our Lab instruments sold primarily into life science and research environment was up strongly, in fact, up double-digits. This was offset however by our Lab business, which is sold into more industrial markets which was down significantly. Similarly, in industrial, while Core Industrial was down as expected, Product Inspection was up quite strongly. We acknowledge recent economic news has not been encouraging and we\u2019re being cautious for the second quarter and second half of the year, given its greater level of uncertainty. I\u2019d stress however, we\u2019re convinced of the strong growth opportunities in this market over the medium and long-term, given the growing GDP per capita, increasing number of scientists, and greater focus on quality. Now let me make a few comments on service, which had good sales growth in the quarter of 5%. Service and consumables represent 30% of sales with service representing about three quarters of the total. Service represents an even larger percentage of sales in the developed market due to the large installed base and the maturity of the markets. With all -- with almost 2,800 service personnel, we have the largest and most global service force as compared to our competitors. We invest a great deal in our service organization in terms of expensive training and value of tools to support their activities. Also our service technicians are specialized in the product areas, which makes them expert. Taken together, this attributes makes -- make our service organization a unique value proposition to our customers and a clear competitive advantage for us. We are currently making investments for growth in our service business, most recently as part of our field approval program that we discussed last quarter. Approvals are targeted additions of front end resources to pursue very specific growth opportunities. On the service side, we are adding some direct resources in our Lab and Product Inspection areas as well as support in a couple of regions to better leverage our service technicians. One last comment on service. With an installed base of a few million instruments, our service data base provides important information that is wanted for product development, but also for service marketing campaign, tailored to the product life cycle. We view this data as one of our most important intangible asset and in 2014 we will launch 100s of marketing campaigns to leverage this asset and deliver further growth. That covers my comments on the current business conditions. In terms of additional topics this quarter, I want to cover two new product offerings which illustrates how we continue to use product launches to target growth segments and margin enhancement to cost reduction. Let me start with our offering in Product Inspection. As background, this business represents about 17% of our total sales and customers are principally food and beverage manufacturers and pharma companies. We help to ensure the integrity and quality of packaged items with our checkweighers, metal detectors, X-ray vision and sterilization solutions. We are the clear leader in this business with the broadest product offering of anyone in the market today. We combine this with the most extensive service force, which is especially important to these customers as manufacturing uptime is critical. The dynamics of this business are very strong because of market concerns around quality in all consumer products. Given our broad product offerings, customers can gain synergies by using multiple products in their line to tackle rather complex quality hurdles. For example, a European food company recently purchased an integrated solution involving checkweighers, metal detectors and [ph] [column] vision inspection systems. In addition to ensuring accurate weight and no metal contaminants, the food manufacturer wanted to enhance the identification of products that does not meet quality level. In particular, they wanted the ability to isolate products that had a burned area, irregular shape, or insufficient amount of topping such as cheese. The vision inspection technology allows these defects to be identified and the product to be rejected before packaging. The vision system consists of five cameras, covering different angles and it is incorporated into the checkweighing conveyor line. This results in reduced space on the line and the more efficient man machine interface. While infield training and testing are needed to ensure accurate performance to specifications, the instruments are intuitive and easy to operate. This is just one example of the synergies within our product offerings and product inspection. Another example of our innovation is from our core industrial business. We recently launched our next generation of industrial weighing terminals. These terminals are used in manufacturing operations and capture data from our weighing instruments and integrated into manufacturing control systems. This new generation of terminals enhances operator productivity by providing cost effective reliable weighing. The display has outstanding readability under a variety of lighting conditions and function keys with graphical items, easily guide an operator. Software allows users to easily configure the terminal and backup files over multiple units within a facility, while the remote display provides additional operational flexibility. Communication options allow connectivity to devices such as printers, remote displays and PCs. The terminals are targeted to general manufacturing customers, particularly in the food segment. Completely designed and developed in China, these terminals provide a cost effective solution for our customers and improved margins for us. These are just two examples of how we use new products to target growth sectors and continue to drive margin improvements. Let me make a couple of concluding remarks before I open for questions. We remain cautiously optimistic in our Western markets and believe we\u2019re well positioned to capture growth opportunities in these regions. We recognize the conditions in emerging markets and in China, in particular, are more uncertain, but believe we\u2019re executing well and will see better growth as the year progresses. We continue to focus on execution and capturing more share. That covers my comments, and I want to ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Thanks, good afternoon. Olivier A. Filliol: Hi, Brandon. William P. Donnelly: Hi, Brandon. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Olivier, I think Mettler might be the only company on the planet raising revenue guidance at this point in the year. Can you give us a sense of like how the orders trended in the first quarter, was April better? And, particularly, what region do you feel more comfortable about in terms of the dynamics? Olivier A. Filliol: Okay. I mentioned on the call Europe certainly positively surprised us, and it was little bit better than we expected. And I would say in general, the West feels better than we talked last time on the call. When it comes to order of trend, I think we need always to be (audio gap) rather and talk about the year-to-date numbers and the year to May numbers, reflect the comments that we had on the call and give us kind of the confidence that we had a good start and allows us to modestly increase the midpoint of our sales guidance. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Thanks. And Bill, are you able to quantify the incremental buyback planned for the year now? And could you remind us how much cash, if any, is trapped overseas? William P. Donnelly: So in terms of quantifying it, I think we probably will end up by somewhere in the range of another $50 million, $75 million before the year is out. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that our goal is to catch up in -- I should say, our goal certainly is not to catch up on the capital structure side too quickly. We will do it gradually over a longer period of time. And then sort of the second part of your question? Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Just if you have any overseas trapped cash? William P. Donnelly: Oh, so in terms of trapped cash, we really don\u2019t have any. Our program is our tax rate reflects the idea that we got to fully repatriate our earnings. So in that sense, we don\u2019t really have any trapped cash. Sometimes, if I look at the $100 million, most of its related to kind of the idea that in certain countries you need to hand in the annual statutory accounts before you can remit the cash back. So it\u2019s never the idea of trapped cash and our tax structure doesn\u2019t really fit together these days. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Super, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. I\u2019m just wondering if you could maybe spend a moment on some of the less often discussed emerging markets, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe. Just give us some color or anecdotes there as to how those markets are doing? Olivier A. Filliol: Yes, okay. In general we commented that emerging markets are a little bit more challenging in these days. But there are -- there were some good numbers nevertheless, I start for example, with Russia. Russia was actually up for us in the quarter, but against easier comparisons. I would however, expect that Russia will be weaker in the near-term. I would also stress that all the emerging markets are actually the individual account, we saw less than 3% and for example Russia is only about 2% for us. Then going on the Eastern Europe, actually did perform very well for us, had good growth and partially against weaker comparisons, but still was very happy to see the numbers there. The part that was weaker was Latin America. I would say in general Latin America, but in particular also Brazil. The currency effects and the general economic conditions in Brazil are more challenging. Then we have in India certainly also currency topics, partially also government related topics that delay certain investments on our customers. Then Southeast Asia was also softer, I\u2019d say mostly impacted in China, but then sometimes you have also country specific issues going on, like in Thailand that we\u2019re also facing. But I would stress the point in all these countries, we really feel we have very strong local management, very experienced management, but also interesting is that all these country management and country managers have been around for many years. They have experienced us addressing the downturn, particularly in Europe and U.S. in the economic crisis. They know how to handle their own local crisis now and adapt to the circumstances and adapt also the cost structure, but I would say as much also applying Spinnaker techniques to go after the segments that still offer growth. So I feel like we\u2019re responding in a very good way in all these countries. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs : Very helpful. Thanks very much. And Bill, just a question on share repurchase in the context of your revised views on target leverage. If I heard you correctly, earlier you said that you\u2019re looking at, I think, a pretty modest pace of share repurchase for the balance of the year. I think you said -- I won\u2019t quote you, but I missed the number. But the point was that sounded like you might be -- maybe ticking up your annualized repurchase on an absolute basis. But the pace of repurchase for the rest of this year kind of sounded like you\u2019d more or less end up to be about in line with last year, effectively 95% or 100% of free cash flow. So can you just maybe clarify kind of the magnitude of share repurchase we should assume for this year? That would be helpful. William P. Donnelly: Yes. So sorry if I chose my words poorly so, we\u2019d incrementally add another $50 million, $75 million between now and the end of the year. I think it a little bit depends on how our free cash flow, but in terms of absolute dollars I think even at that level because of the higher cash flow as well, we will probably be closer to the $400 million range, whereas in last year we\u2019re closer to $300 million range. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs : Okay. That\u2019s perfect. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan : Thanks. First question on Europe, you called out strength in food retail and some of the other sub segments. Can you maybe just talk about the sustainability of the trend, in particular, food retail? I know you had an easy comp there, but how are you thinking about that business in Europe? Olivier A. Filliol: Okay. I\u2019d first state Europe overall did very well and it wasn\u2019t so much driven by food retail. Food retail was nicely contributing, but actually you have to say we did well in Europe across product lines and across countries. The food retail as you all know is for us very project driven business. In that sense also lumpy. I\u2019d not read too much into our performance of Q1 by food retail. Actually I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we\u2019re also going to have the quarters in this year where we will be down in food retail. So this is not a new trend. It\u2019s more reflecting the nature of the business. When I look for the overall European numbers, I don\u2019t certainly expect that we\u2019re going to experience this nice growth rates of Europe in the same way for the full-year. We\u2019re going to have more difficult comparisons in the latter part of the year, but I\u2019d say what was really good about this Q1 number is first the magnitude of the growth and then how consistent it was across countries. We had even France showing growth. We had Southern countries that has growth. We have the U.K. and Nordic which was for example very solid. This very encouraging signs and of course it\u2019s also very motivating for the teams and that will create additional momentum also for the rest of the year. Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan : And then thinking about China, I think you had previously talked about back half of the year getting back to mid-single digit growth. Anything changed in your assumptions given kind of the recent data, and any update on kind of how payment terms are trending? Olivier A. Filliol: I would agree the economic news have not been that promising, but at the same time I have to say we did really anticipate that things in China will remain challenging for us. The numbers should start to look better in the second part of the year, mainly because of comparison reasons. We feel like our numbers are showing that we\u2019re bottoming, but it\u2019s actually difficult to really say when the momentum comes back. What I\u2019m really seeing and the team is confirming that is that there are different areas of growth. I think the prepared remarks about our Core Lab in selling mostly to the life science industry is certainly encouraging and showing that point. There are different industry segments that we see life coming back, particularly when it\u2019s oriented to consumer goods. But even I got an update last week about specialty chemicals industry segment that were encouraging. There is certainly also geographic parts of China that are encouraging. Certainly markets will remain very difficult for a long time, talking about steel industry, service industry and so on. But all in all, we do see that things should gradually improve and then combining with the easier comparisons yet, we do expect growth in the second part of the year. How fast things will get -- come back to the high single-digit growth, low double-digit growth, that\u2019s the key part. So really difficult to forecast and anticipate. William P. Donnelly: In terms of the \u2026 Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan : It's not that we see -- go ahead, Bill. William P. Donnelly: Yes, maybe just a comment on the credit thing. So, you guys remember we talked probably about a year-ago about our concerns around credit topics, I think for us its not that we see more credit availability in the system, but its not incrementally worse in terms of our own balance sheet, our past due, our DSO type of statistics are actually now back to where they were before we started seeing this problem and so we feel good about that. Actually it\u2019s probably one of the reasons are -- probably it is one of the reasons our cash flow was good this quarter and so we don't see that situation getting worse. Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan : And then last one, Bill can you just talk about bookings versus revenues? Last quarter I think the delta was about 2% in any particular areas where the bookings were better than the revenues significantly? William P. Donnelly: I think if we kind of look at the Western world let\u2019s say or even excluding China, we\u2019re talking about mid single-digit kind of growth rates in terms of orders and sales. And then China was took both of those down. If I look at like absolute backlog levels, I think we\u2019re -- we\u2019ve a little bit more backlog than we did a year-ago and things started out reasonable in the first part of this quarter. Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jon Groberg with Macquarie. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is actually Harris on for Jon. Just a quick question around capital structure. Can you maybe comment on what your new longer term leverage targets are? William P. Donnelly: So we think it make sense to be remain in investment grade like company that probably implies net debt to EBITDA ratios in the one, no more than probably two level. And so we could gradually work there over a multi-year period. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Bryan Kipp with Janney Capital. Your line is open. Bryan Kipp - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Hi. This is -- just taking this one for Paul. Just to start off, I guess, to step back and look at the margins -- you did see a gross margin decline and there was some acceleration, some incrementals in 4Q. Did those not crossover? I know those were on material costs and a little bit of a pricing leverage. And then on that SG&A decline as a percentage of sales, is that attributed to anything specific ala the pull in consolidation that you guys saw at the beginning half of 2013? Was that pulled through or does it represent more of the benefits and initiatives you guys instituted in 2013? William P. Donnelly: Okay. So let me start with the gross profit side. So just to set the numbers, we -- our gross profit was down about 10 bps in the quarter. If I look at pricing, our pricing did well, our price -- net realized prices across everything was more than 150, slightly less than 200 basis points. Our material costs were down about a 100 and -- between a 100 and 150 basis points, let\u2019s say. And if you kind of dig deeper into okay, so why then was the margin not bigger because those are certainly numbers that would be inline with what we\u2019d expect for the full-year and should produce, lets say, 30 to 50 bps if we kept on that pace. We had kind of a funny mix within some of the details like so for example the mix within what we sold of Lab balances and a couple other topics. And then we had a currency headwind and then finally we just -- and that we had some inventory charge comparison topics between two periods. Our expectation will be that we will return to this some margin -- gross margin expansion for the remainder of the year. So I don\u2019t expect that trend that you saw here in the first quarter to remain. Maybe the second comment you made was on what were the specifics that led us to being able to have a pretty good cost control on the SG&A side. I think there are several factors there so and maybe some pluses and minuses, but overall a good picture. As a reminder, we have a headwind on the bonus side, so have some catch up to do this year and bonuses versus the prior-year. I think for the full-year, it\u2019s a number in the $15 million range. That\u2019s kind of being split now throughout the year. Second headwind is currency and then we of course have some cost savings as well associated with different programs that we had. Some of them relate to the shared service center, but other topics as well. So overall we feel like the cost structure is in pretty good shape as we start the year. Bryan Kipp - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : And just a quick follow-up on the new -- two new products that you guys highlighted earlier, just thinking about that in terms of your revenue guidance here, is there any benefit with those new products in those numbers? And I guess the other question, to back up is full utilization when you ramp up on something like that, is that 6 to 9 months or 12 months? Olivier A. Filliol: Either way we need to look at product launches in Mettler-Toledo is that we have such a broad product range and so many products that a new product launch makes -- has a very little impact on our top line. It\u2019s -- we have really in that sense very diversified across many different businesses. Continuous product innovation and product launches however is very important to maintain our technology leadership to be able to continue to expand our markets and all that. So in that sense, I\u2019m very happy about this product launches, but I do not expect that they have a big impact on the overall revenue. Bryan Kipp - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ross Muken with ISI Group. Your line is open. Ross Muken - ISI Group LLC : Good afternoon, guys. I just wanted to maybe dig into a little nuance on the China commentary and I appreciate a lot of the details you\u2019ve given. Any differential demand or order trend at different price points? We\u2019ve heard from various folks some of the higher end instrumentation, obviously, it\u2019s a little bit different for you guys, it\u2019s been less robust than maybe lower-priced or typical service or other types of revenues. And then, Olivier you commented on the industrial side, pieces like specialty chemical getting better, any other discernible trend among some of the other major industrial end markets where things either got materially better or materially worse or you were kind of surprised with the lack of reaction, and this is China-specific? Olivier A. Filliol: Okay. On the price point actually I would say surprisingly we don't have much differentiation. I would say the big difference is what goes well and what doesn\u2019t go well is more actually geography than anything else and if I look at the different business lines that we have, they were relatively consistent and even if I like -- take a product category like laboratory weighing, its not that the high-end or the low end did perform particularly in a differentiated way. William P. Donnelly: Just to clarify your question Ross, you were asking specifically about China? Ross Muken - ISI Group LLC : Yes. William P. Donnelly: Yes, so if we dig down actually what Olivier said would apply to China as well. If you look maybe to pick pipettes and balances as a proxy for lower cost, I don\u2019t want to hurt any of our Swiss engineers\u2019 feelings with the higher end of the balances. And then maybe analytical instruments and auto can be kind of \u2013 relatively higher end. Actually we had excellent growth in all those categories. Ross Muken - ISI Group LLC : Great. That was very helpful. Thank you. Olivier A. Filliol: In terms of industry segments, I think nothing particular to add, other than what I said. Its really everything that\u2019s closer to consumer related things is going well. And the industry that is linked to consumer demand and benefits of that and then things that are related to quality measurement, food safety and so on is also particularly healthy. And on the other side, everything that\u2019s related to infrastructure is particularly challenging. Operator : Your next question comes from of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research : Hi. Couple of questions. First, Bill, your comments regarding the impact from FX on margins, you made a comment about, something about 80 basis points. I was just wondering if that was the total impact from FX on margins or versus what you were expecting? William P. Donnelly: A year-on-year number. Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research : Okay. In total? William P. Donnelly: Yes. Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research : And then secondly, on the step up in share repurchases, should we also factor in some sort of step-up in interest expense, or is it going to be from working down cash balances? William P. Donnelly: Hey, there will be a step up in terms of interest expense. Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research : Okay. And then, I guess, just the final thing is if you could just comment on Japan in the quarter and then Japan maybe after the quarter, given the changes there at the end of their fiscal year? William P. Donnelly: So let me pull forward the Japanese numbers first. So, we had a good quarter in Japan, but it was against a relatively easy comp. Maybe to give you a feel that the two-year growth rate would get you mid single-digit kind of numbers. In terms of their outlook for the second quarter, I don\u2019t remember them sticking out particularly good or bad. And actually getting a -- yes, lets call it some modest growth in Q2 probably. Olivier A. Filliol: What might be interesting for you to realize that Japan is definitely skewed towards Lab business and you have heard us saying that Lab was strong across the world in the first quarter and that\u2019s actually also reflected here in Japan. In Japan we have less and less revenue in the industrial world and none for food or retail. William P. Donnelly: And as you guys know Japan is not nearly as big a market for us as it is for some of the peer group companies. But I think that there are also some tax things that took place in Japan that might have helped some customers who want to buy in Q1 versus Q2, if I remember correctly. Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc.: Yes, good afternoon. William P. Donnelly: Hi, Rich. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc.: Olivier or Bill, could you just kind of speak to the Lab growth rate of plus 7%? I guess, is the appropriate way to look at that again is kind of this two-year growth rate, which puts it more in the lower single digits or was there anything that really stepped out at you as driving a 7% core growth rate there? William P. Donnelly: Hey, we certainly think that multi-year growth rates are a good way to look at it. As we some times look at three-year growth rates too. Rick so on a three-year basis, it was maybe a nice move in a positive way. So while Q1 of last year was the easiest comp for 2013 in terms of the quarters if you actually look at 2012 and 2011, 2011 we grew 16% the Lab business in the first quarter and in 2012 8%. So there is some of why Q1 last year was weak was partly due to the comps of the prior-year. So -- but we\u2019re -- we think that -- we think in China -- or sorry in Asia, or sorry in Europe, we\u2019re certainly benefiting from that market being more stable economically not having things and there were some pent up demand as comps get a little tougher in the second half of the year from Europe, we wont be seeing those type of growth rates. But we feel very good and how we did vis-\u00e0-vis competitors in our Lab product lines in the last few quarters frankly. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc.: Sure. And do you get -- if price was 175 basis point kind of capture for all of Mettler in the quarter, would it be north of that for Lab, I presume? William P. Donnelly: Yes, I think that\u2019s a fair statement. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc.: Okay, yep. And then, I'm still maybe a little bit surprised when I look at the growth rates by Lab, Industrial, I\u2019m surprised that again that you didn\u2019t get more of a positive bump on the gross profit margin line. But you referenced kind of a weak lab mix of instruments, was that anything to do with material costs or one-timers or was that just \u2026? William P. Donnelly: Yes. I could take it through there is a little bit of a story behind multiple of them. AutoChem had one very large order that went through, there were some specifics on a couple of other product categories like the mix of business within processing analytics, a little bit less TOC versus some other topics. So there were different things that contributed to it as well as just kind of some inventory charge topics where we were unusually low in Q1 last year and a little bit above what we\u2019d expect on quarterly basis in Q1. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc.: Sure, okay. All right. And then, just the last question, I probably just missed this, but in terms of China, did you mention -- I think you had mentioned Lab was plus 16% in China. If I tried to weight that out, then maybe the industrial was minus kind of a high single-digit. Is that reasonable math? William P. Donnelly: Maybe just I think the word that Olivier used was quote unquote Classic Lab which would have included, excluded process analytics. So actually our Industrial business did a little bit better than what you described. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc.: Okay, I understand. Okay. Thank you. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Sung Ji Nam with Cantor. Your line is open. Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P.: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Hi, can you hear me okay? William P. Donnelly: Yes, we can hear you great. Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P.: Thank you. So I was wondering, you obviously had a good quarter for your Lab business, had more difficult comps for product inspection. Just curious, I know I think you guys have roughly a quarter of your business exposed to biopharma. And in light of all the announcements about mergers and potential mergers, I was wondering kind of how that might or if it all, impact your business going forward? Olivier A. Filliol: These merger activities that we see today in big pharma and partially also expected associated restructuring has been going on for quite a while. And we had that in the past few years in the West. In essence, we\u2019ve also learned from that that this can impact some of our Lab categories, but then all the lab categories might benefit. So to give you an illustration, while the number of scientist might go down, and this could impact the pipette business partially also the Lab -- balance business, but then the automated chemistry typically benefits from that, because these new companies want to invest in automation tools. Then what I also want to stress is that none of this big pharma customers are really representing a big part of our revenue, not -- we don\u2019t have a single customer that is representing more than 1% of revenue and in that sense we are particularly exposed to it. And then last, but not least this has been a continuous trend that we\u2019d see the pharma, biopharma more challenging in the West, but more than offset by the activities and the growth going on in the East. All the CROs and all the auto partially government driven investments in this biopharma industry sector. Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P.: Great. Thank you. And then just one more question on China. Obviously you\u2019re seeing the region playing out as you had expected thus far. I was wondering kind of if you could talk about the competitive landscape. I know you\u2019ve talked about in the past walking away from some of the project, and I also was wondering if there are further opportunities for pruning your -- or rightsizing your product portfolio there? Olivier A. Filliol: Yes. In terms of portfolio this was some thing that we did last year and then rapidly executed by absent of any major changes in the economic environment. I don\u2019t see that we\u2019ve additional steps that we\u2019d take. And in terms of competitive landscape, we keep our discipline on payment terms and so we still have cases where we see competitors accepting these payment terms that we\u2019d not. We are okay. We are okay; we definitely feel that keeping the discipline is more important. We don\u2019t have full transparency about market share on a quarterly basis, and we\u2019ve many competitors that don\u2019t publish numbers. But exchanging with the teams, I really don\u2019t feel that we are losing here market share, in contrary, especially against international players, we\u2019re very well positioned and I feel we continue to win market share even in this environment and even that we keep this very disciplined approach to payment terms. Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P.: Great. Thank you. Olivier A. Filliol: Thank you. Operator : There are no additional questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back to our presenters. Mary T. Finnegan: Hey thanks, Jay, and thanks everyone for joining us tonight. Of course, if you have any questions, don\u2019t hesitate to give us a call. Good night. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Pete, and I'll be your audio coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn our presentation over to your hostess for today's call, Ms. Mary Finnegan. Please proceed, ma'am. Mary T. Finnegan: Thanks, Pete, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Mary Finnegan. I'm the Treasurer and responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo. I'm happy that you're joining us today. I'm joined here by a Olivier Filliol, our CEO; and Bill Donnelly, our Executive Vice President. I've just one quick comment before I do the Safe Harbor. We're doing this call today from China. We've been here this week, and over the course of the week, we have experienced a dropped phone line once or twice when we're doing conference calls. I wanted to mention it because I hope it doesn't happen. But in case it does, just sit tight and the operator will work to reconnect us as quickly as possible. Let me just do a couple administrative things. This call is being webcast and is available for replay on our website. A copy of the press release and the presentation that we will refer to on today's call is also available at the website. Let me summarize the Safe Harbor language, which is outlined on Page 1. Statements in this presentation, which are not historical facts, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 and the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements.

All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed under Factors Affecting Our Future Operating Results and in the business and management discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations in our Form 10-K. Just one last item. On today's call, we may use non-GAAP financial measures. More detailed information with respect to the use of and differences between the non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided in our 8-K. I will now turn the call over to Olivier. Olivier A. Filliol: Thanks, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call. As Mary mentioned, we are making the call from Jiangsu, China, as we just completed a week-long visit, including management meetings and our board meeting. I will also visit some of our other Asian locations in the course of next week. I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Bill will provide details of our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments on 2014, including some thoughts from our China visit. And as always, we will have time for Q&A at the end. The highlights for the quarter are on Page 2 of the presentation. Local currency sales increased 4% in the quarter, with good growth in Americas and solid growth in Europe. We are pleased to have modest sales go in China, and Asia was in line with our expectations. Similar to what we saw in the first quarter, due to the benefit of various cost control and margin initiatives and despite negative currency headwinds, we generated good growth in earnings per share. Let me turn it to Bill to provide more details on the financial results and an update to our guidance for the year. William P. Donnelly: Thanks, Olivier, and hello, everybody. Let me start with additional details on sales, which were $608.8 million in the quarter, an increase of 4% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased 5% as currency benefited sales by 1% in the quarter. Turning to Page 3 of the presentation. We outlined sales by geography. In the quarter, local currency sales increased by 5% in the Americas, 3% in Europe and 3% in Asia/Rest of World, all as compared to last year. Without the impact of exited product lines, sales in Asia/Rest of World increased by 5% in the quarter. For China specifically, local currency sales increased by 2%. And excluding exited product lines, sales in China increased 6% in the quarter. The next slide provides details on first half sales, which increased by 4% in local currency. For the 6 months, sales increased 4% in the Americas, 6% in Europe and 2% in Asia/Rest of World. Asia/Rest of World had a sales increase of 4% if you exclude the China exited product lines. Sales growth by product line for the quarter is highlighted on Slide #5. Laboratory increased by 6% in local currency, while Industrial increased by 3%. Adjusting for China product line exits, Industrial sales increased by 5% in the quarter, while food retailing was down 1% in the quarter. For the 6-month period, which you see on the next slide, Laboratory increased by 6% in local currency and Industrial increased by 2%. Adjusted for China product line exits, Industrials would have increased by 3% in the first 6 months of the year. Food retailing is up 3% year-to-date. Now I'd like to turn to Slide #7 and walk you through the key items of the P&L. Our gross margins were 53.9%, a 50-basis-point increase over the prior year margin of 53.4%. We benefited from pricing and lower material costs, which were offset somewhat by unfavorable currency as well as mix. R&D amounted to $32.1 million, a 7% increase in local currency. SG&A amounted to $183.1 million, which is an increase of 3% in local currency. Increased sales and marketing costs and higher variable compensation were offset by cost-savings initiatives and lower employee benefit costs. Adjusted operating income amounted to $112.9 million in the quarter. That represents a 6% increase over the prior year amount of $106.4 million. Our operating margins were 18.6%, an increase of 20 basis points over the prior year. We estimate currency reduced operating profit by $2.3 million in the quarter. Without this impact, operating profit would have increased 8% and operating margins, 80 basis points in the quarter. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $7.3 million in the quarter, while interest expense was $6 million-even in the quarter. Our effective tax rate continues to be 24%. Fully diluted shares for quarter were $29.8 million, which is a 3.6% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.57 per share, an increase of 9% over the prior year amount of $2.35. Currency reduced adjusted EPS by approximately 2.5%. On a reported basis, EPS was $2.49, as compared to $2.24 in the prior year. Reported EPS included pretax restructuring charges of $1.9 million, or $0.05 per share, which is primarily employee-related costs. Reported EPS also includes $0.03 of purchased intangible amortization. The next slide provides details on our year-to-date results, which are similar to what you had in the quarter. Specifically for the 6 months, local currency sales increased by 4%, operating profit is up by 6% and adjusted EPS increased by 9%. For the 6-month period, currency reduced EPS by about 3.5%. Now turning to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter amounted to $95.7 million, a 22% increase over the prior year amount of $78.2 million. We are pleased with the strong cash flow, which benefited from good working capital management, offset to a degree by higher tax payments. Working capital statistics were solid in the quarter, with ITO at 5X and DSO at 43 days. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow is $129.7 million versus $87.8 million in the prior year. One additional comment on our balance sheet before turning to guidance. You saw in our June 8-K filing that we entered into a $250 million worth of fixed rate financing. One half of this financing will be funded later this quarter, and the remainder will be funded next year to coincide with the maturity of an existing fixed rate note. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as attractive rates to increase the percentage of our fixed-rate debt. Although the long-term rates are very attractive, the financing is about $0.025 dilutive to EPS this year. Now let's turn to guidance. Market conditions are about the same as we compared -- as compared to the last time we spoke. Conditions in the west a relatively solid, although we based tougher comparisons for Europe for the remainder of this year. Asia should continue to improve. Maybe some more about China specifically : We see our business here as generally on track with our previously described expectations. While sales growth in China was a bit better in the quarter than we expected, we still remain cautious on the region given the overhang in certain segments. As economic growth here continues, the overcapacity in certain segments will diminish and we expect to see more investments in new plants and new lines. While we see some signs of an improving investment climate, the return to the strong growth levels of the past is not yet on the immediate horizon. We expect China sales to be up modestly in Q3 and Q4, principally due to easier comps. As a reminder, we estimate exited product lines will reduce local currency sales by about 2% in China for the full year. So in summary, we're estimating mid-single-digit growth in China in the second half, adjusted for exited product lines. In terms of other emerging markets, microeconomic conditions in China -- or, sorry, in Russia are very weak. Brazil and India had good results in the quarter and are performing well. Given this outlook, we're making no change to our full year expectations of sales growth of approximately 4% for the year. We are also maintaining our current full year EPS guidance. Specifically, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $11.45 to $11.60, which is a growth rate of 8% to 10%. This is in the same range as we provided last quarter. For the third quarter, we would expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 4% and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.82 to $2.87, or a growth of 8% to 10%. As you're updating your models, let me cover some specifics on guidance. First, currency. We would expect currency to have no impact on sales growth in Q2 and reduce sales growth by approximately 1% in Q4. For the full year, we expect to have no impact from currency on sales. In terms of the impact of currency on earnings, we would expect currency to reduce earnings growth by approximately 1% in the third quarter and be slightly negative in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2014, currency is expected to reduce earnings growth by 2%. Okay, one final comment regarding models. With our Q3 guidance and full year guidance, you will likely be updating your Q4 numbers too. One question you may have is why we are maintaining our guidance range although we exceeded our guidance for the second quarter. We have 2 factors weighing on this. The first, as already mentioned, is we have this $0.025 headwind in Q4 due to long-term debt to be added via the private placement; and second is that given our expectation of a better growth environment next year, we are investing in some front-end resources in the second half. Our field turbo program, as we refer to it internally, has been discussed with you in the past. As a reminder, these are additional sales and service personnel to capture specific growth opportunities. As I look at the development of these turbo programs, we'll see higher expenses associated with them in the second half of this year, particularly in the fourth quarter. While this will help position us well for next year, we recognize the additional cost, our drag this year, as salesmen take some time to become fully productive. These 2 factors highlight why we didn't increase our guidance despite the beat this quarter. Okay, that's it for my side and I want to turn it back over to Olivier. Olivier A. Filliol: Thanks, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab increased 6% in the quarter, with good growth in balances, Pipettes Analytical Instruments and Process Analytics. Automated Chemistry was down in the quarter due to timing as the order entry was good and the outlook for the remainder of the year is quite positive. Industrial increased 3% in the quarter. Product Inspection had good growth, while Core Industrial was consistent with the prior year. As expected, retail was down slightly in the quarter. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Europe had sales growth of 3% and most countries reported growth, with the exception of Russia, which was down double-digits. While we faced more challenging comparisons in Europe for the remainder of the year, I'm pleased with how well we are competing in this region. Our strong product offering combined with our Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives are principal factors contributing to our solid performance. Americas increased 5% in the quarter. We have good growth in Lab and Product Inspection. Core Industrial was down slightly against strong comparisons from the prior year. Retail was also down in the quarter. Asia/Rest of the World increased 3% of the quarter. Let me now make some additional comments on China. Market conditions are developing as expected, and our business continues to be on track with what we outlined last year as expectations for this year. Specifically, our core laboratory instruments and our Product Inspection business continues to do very well, with growth in the double-digits range. Similar to what we experienced in the first quarter, Process Analytics was impacted by new GMP regulations surrounding water purity that went into effect last year and, as a result, was down double-digits. Finally, Core Industrial increased 3%, adjusting for the exited product lines. You heard from Bill that we expect to have growth in China for the remainder of the year. While we will benefit from easier comparisons, we are also making good progress on resource prioritization and reallocation to segments of the market where profitable growth exists. We are leveraging our Spinnaker sales and marketing tools to identify potential customers and then design sales and marketing strategies to penetrate these segments. We remain convinced about the long-term potential of this market. Our product portfolio is well positioned to benefit from many evolving trends in China, including the increasingly prosperous consumer, the many graduating scientists, the government's efforts to move up the value chain in manufacturing and the increasing focus on product quality and consumer safety throughout the economy. Specifically, our Laboratory, Process Analytics, Product Inspection and certain segments in core industrial all remain very well positioned to capture growth arising from this trend. One additional comment on our quarterly results before I cover some additional topics is Service. We had good growth in the quarter, with Service revenue up 7% as compared to the prior year. We had good growth in all geographic regions and in most product lines. We continue to benefit from our investments in Service, which I covered with you last quarter. Now let me turn to some product innovations, which continue to reinforce our market leadership. I have a couple of examples from our laboratory offering, starting with our new family of premium-end pipettes. Under the umbrella name of XLS Plus, these pipettes that's have our proprietary live touch system, which have an ergonomic focus by reducing the force of pipetting. Highly regulated customers who are sensitive to security issues and high throughput labs are prime customers for this instrument. While we already lead the market with our ergonomic technology, we have further enhanced our offerings in several ways. For our single-channel instrument, an improved ceiling system provides greater ergonomics and improved results, particularly, with more delicate experiments. The instrument can also address more customers due to its new sterilization capability. Our new high-volume multichannel instrument is smaller, at 25% lighter, and, therefore, provides greater productivity, accuracy and fewer handling errors. Finally, we have a new software system for our electronic pipette, which provides easier use, greater accuracy and better security. This allows customers to more easily adhere to their standard operating procedures and good laboratory practices. We now have an entire XLS Plus product offering with an attractive and modern design. Initial customer reception is positive, and we have an extensive marketing campaign that is supporting the launch. In addition to customer benefits, the new product line will also reduce manufacturing cost. Our pipette business remains very attractive, with solid growth dynamics, good margins and nice Consumable and Service stream. We also have some new offerings at our pH business. For those of you that attended our Investor Day last July, we demonstrated our high-end bench pH meters known as SevenExcellence. We are strengthening our market position with the launch of a new portable pH meter, the Seven to Go (sic) [SevenGo]. The instrument's simple menus and navigation can shorten measurement time and the new status light helps to ensure the quality of the ongoing measurement. The Seven to Go's (sic) [SevenGo's] ergonomic design provides utmost handling comfort and the graphic display allows operation even under difficult lighting conditions. Productivities further enhanced through our proprietary intelligent central management system that reduces overall errors and speed workflows. Finally, we have developed specific kits for several industry segments, which includes a meter, sensor and accessories, making it very easy to use for our customers. In order to further extend our pH offering, we also recently launched a more basic version of a bench-top instrument to penetrate emerging markets. The product has less features and models and its attractive pricing meets the needs of price-sensitive customers in our emerging markets and indirect distribution channels. The instrument's inherent intuitiveness and the ease-of-use make it an ideal for telesales. To further minimize overall cost, the market introduction, marketing and product training is heavily centered on the vet [ph]. These 2 introductions are examples of how we are leveraging our market positioned in pH to garner more market share. Our business is very solid, with good growth dynamics, attractive consumable stream and strong margins. We also continue to make great inroads with our Automated Chemistry offering. Over the last few years, we have worked with a large pharmaceutical customer to develop and implement their vision for the lab of the future. The lab is focused on sustainably decreasing time-to-market for new medicines and increasing the overall R&D productivity by automating many elements of process development. This is the step in drug discovery and scale up process in which the pharma company is trying to determine how most efficiently and safely a drug can be mass-produced. Because it is at the end of the entire drug discovery process, the quicker it can be developed, the sooner the drugs can be launched. Although under tremendous time pressure, most pharmaceutical companies lack a standardized automated approach to process development. The lab of the future incorporates our automated lab reactors, in situ probes and a common software platform to standardize and automate the entire process. We have successfully rolled out our solution in the initial pharma company, and several other companies are now introducing it to their organizations. We are very pleased with this development, which reinforces our leadership in this business. Let me make a couple of concluding remarks before I open it for questions. We remain cautiously optimistic in our Western markets with an acknowledgment of profit comparisons on the horizon in Europe. We're executing well and believe we can continue to capture growth opportunities in these regions. Emerging markets, in particular China, are developing mostly as expected. While certain core industrial segments are weak, we see good growth potentially in our Laboratory and Product Inspection businesses. We expect to see growth in China for the remainder of the year. Overall, we continue to focus on execution and capturing more share. That covers my comments, and I want to ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Sachin Kulkarni - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : This is Sachin in for Brandon. So as gross margins have steadily improved in recent years, what type of initiatives are under way to bolster the productivity of this Service organization? What do you perceive as the incremental opportunity for Service gross margins over the next 2, 3 years? William P. Donnelly: Okay. So maybe a few comments on what's been going on to date and also what we would expect in the future. So there's a number of different initiatives both on the cost side as well as on the pricing side. And on the pricing side, we are -- as part of our overall pricing program, see the opportunity of good pricing power within Service, particularly on proprietary spare parts. But in general, if we're providing value-added, we can get good pricing benefits. Maybe also on the sales side, we are benefiting from the volume increases, and a lot of that is driven by doing a better job of the point-of-sale selling service and capturing more and more of the Service business via service contracts, which allow us to plan better the service technician. We sometimes refer to reducing the windshield time of the service technicians as a good driver on the productivity side. So on the productivity side, we introduced -- we have invested a lot in IT solutions related to Blue Ocean and otherwise. And those solutions help our service technicians to be more productive, to have higher first-time fixed rates and more standardize the work as well. And then, I would -- in terms of maybe future margin expansion opportunities, I don't have a specific target that I want to give at this point. But if you name -- if you go back to the list that I just gave you, none of them have run out of headroom yet. They're still much like the Spinnaker story. On the sales side, there are many years of operating profit, gross margin expansion opportunities within our Service business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : So if -- could you talk a little bit about Russia in the sense that how big a business is that for you? Can you sort of estimate what that drag was on the business? William P. Donnelly: It's 2% and it's down in the low 20s. So I guess, 40 bps, 45 bps. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : So you're -- I mean, it's encouraging to hear that you're beefing up the infrastructure with your turbo program in anticipation of growth for next year. I guess, with that in mind, what -- can you give us a little bit teaser in terms what you're thinking or is it still too early in terms to talk about '15? Olivier A. Filliol: Derik, actually the way we started out early in the year, we did multiple analysis in terms of where we feel we have penetration gaps. We analyzed this, really, by the different product lines and different geographies. Some -- for bigger geographies, we even went within a territory level to looking and sub-segmenting the countries. And then, we overlaid that with the profitability of the different business lines. And that gave us then a priority, which areas we want to invest in the future. And we are currently working with the countries and the different business leaders to develop concrete plans and business cases. And then, we're going to roll that out throughout the next quarters. We, of course, are not going to do everything in Q4. We try to time it. And what we have seen from previous field turbo ways that have been running is, of course, it takes a little bit of time to onboard the people and then really do the thorough training. And we try to accelerate the payback time by supporting the salespeople with a lot of telemarketing activities, specific segment campaigns so that we can feed them with good leads and, in essence, accelerate the pipeline development. William P. Donnelly: Maybe in terms of I think you're also getting at the guidance question and we'll -- our intention at this point would be to give guidance in the next call. But sitting here today, our expectation is that we'll grow faster in '15 than we did in '14. But there's a lot of economic data and other things for us to digest before giving specific guidance. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Right, I guess that's what -- I guess what is -- you're typically a very conservative company. So the fact that you are doing all of these initiatives is encouraging. That's sort of where I was getting at. I guess on that note, I'll get back in the queue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : On the Southeast Asia part of the world, wondering if you could maybe put a little more color on what your expectations are on the back half of the year. William P. Donnelly: Okay, so maybe I give you a feeling from year-to-date basis. We're up low single digits. And the -- as you can maybe imagine, the weakest part is coming from Thailand, although Thailand was certainly better in Q2 than they were on a year-to-date basis. I would say, sorry, better in Q2 than they were in Q1. In terms of the comps for the region, we have a comp last -- in Q3 that will similar to the comp we had this past quarter, but I would, expect, actually, our growth rate to be slightly better. I think the one thing I would highlight is that Southeast Asia has quite a tough comp when it comes to Q4. We grew mid-teens in Q4 last year due to a couple of big orders. But our view is that the trend their overall is improving. I think Olivier would probably have more insight. He'll be there next week, but -- so probably no more next time. But other than this tough comp, we would say that things have bottomed out and are generally moving at a pretty good direction and we're making investments in that part of the world. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay, and then just maybe a follow up on the financial side of things. Last quarter, you talked a little bit about the board's decision to raise long-term leverage targets. I know that you had some time to think about investing both in the field turbo and some of the other initiatives, and you mentioned the restructuring on the debt towards the back half. Could you give us a sense of time line to the increased leverage target? William P. Donnelly: I -- like most things, we'll do it kind of step-by-step. But I think at this stage you could assume absent us surprising ourselves with a bigger than expected acquisition, which I think would be highly unlikely. Maybe add in an extra $100 million or so a year to the base of free cash flow that we already do. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg of Macquarie. Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research : I think it was mentioned -- sorry, I don't remember if it was Bill or Olivier, but you said you see some improvement in China but don't really see it returning to growth days of the past. Was that just a comment for this year? And I guess I'm trying to think historically, Bill, I think you -- when you kind of laid out kind of the growth scenario for a company like Mettler, it's kind of emerging markets growing at certain rates, then some of the developed markets at slower rates to get your overall growth target. And I'm just wondering is that -- has that model changed at all in your mind? And if so, what other types of things that you're looking at in terms of accelerating the revenue growth? Olivier A. Filliol: John, I think we definitely see that China will get back to very good growth dynamics, and we talked about the macro trends that are very favorable for us. And we feel that we can outgrow the GDP growth of China. But we all want to be cautious. We have seen many quarters of 20% plus growth for Mettler-Toledo in China in the times where there were huge investments in infrastructure and there was the stimulus money from the Chinese government. And these times will not come back and we don't rely on these kind of times. It's not that we need big stimulus money and big infrastructure projects to have really good growth for us in China. In that sense, we would feel that we're going to see in China a good healthy growth but also a more sustainable growth maybe that we have seen in the last 5 years. When I say sustainable growth, nevertheless, I would recognize that China will remain more volatile than a mature Western market. In terms of timing, we did talk that the second part of the year will gradually get better. Next year should also already get significantly better than this year. And then it will take probably some time that we will see this high-single, low double-digit growth that we expect. But then I really think the growth prospects are very attractive. And being in China this week, and actually I was already here last week, just reconfirmed that there's a lot of things happening here that we don't read in the Western press. And it's been always impressive when you are here and see all the things that the government are driving, new economic zones, then also new industries that they want to develop. And it was great to see how our Chinese team very much aware of that and of shifting all the resourcing to really tap into these opportunities. Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research : Okay, that's helpful. And I don't think you had any acquisitions contributing to your organic growth. Is that correct? And if so, kind of where do you stand? You made a similar comment Bill about, well, if you did a big acquisition. But would you hope to do some acquisitions this year, even if smaller? Kind of where do you stand on the M&A front? Olivier A. Filliol: Our M&A strategy is quite a consistent one. I'm very interested in pursuing acquisition opportunities. We have a thorough process where we constantly, actually, monitor tentative targets. We try to really nurture these targets. And we're actually constantly also talking to companies. And you have seen us doing a couple of acquisitions last few years and expect us to continue to do that. And there are a couple of opportunities that we are reviewing also at this stage. So our commitment is definitely here. What Bill was referring to is these big acquisitions adding another lag to the company also. The acquisitions that we do at this stage are typically ones that are in the range of $20 million to $50 million of revenue. And we can definitely finance these kind of acquisitions with our free cash flow. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of from JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I just wanted to follow-up on Derik's original question about some of the reinvestment you're going to be making. I was wondering if you can talk by geography or segment where you see the incremental headcount additions. Olivier A. Filliol: It's going to really be across the globe. We -- for example, next week, I am in Southeast Asia. We're going to review, in particular, investments in the Philippines but also in Indonesia, but I have also projects that are under review that relates to Service in Europe. We are looking at telesales opportunities out of Poland. I think that just gives you a flavor how broad-based it is. And it's really across the different business lines and geographies. I think that's the approach of the field turbo. We do them -- they are relatively small projects. So when I talk about Philippines, I talk about 2 handfuls of people. When I talk about telesales in Russia, I talk about a handful of people. So -- and these are many smaller projects, but the beauty of it is I always have a strong business leaders that can focus on it and really drive it. And it's not a single big bet on one opportunity. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And then I guess, as we think about the U.S. market, core industrial, you had a tough comp there, so that was down slightly. But can you talk about some of the gives and takes for the U.S. market in the back half of the year, whether it's an industrial improvement, or maybe the academic market's getting a little bit better? William P. Donnelly: So we're not as exposed to the academic market maybe as some of the other guys, but our pipette business, which is the one with the biggest exposure, has been doing quite well relative to past periods. It's also got some exposure to government money. And that business has done much better the last couple of quarters than it had in '13 or in '12 and we would expect that to continue. At the high-end instrument side, we're expecting a very good second half, both in our AutoChem product lines as well as some of our analytical instruments. In the Product Inspection area, we'll have an excellent Q3. I think that Q4 maybe has a really tough comp. If I recall correctly, 2013 Q4 had a blowout in the Americas in the food safety area. But that business is rolling very well. On the Industrial side, I think we feel pretty good. It was a little bit hidden in our Industrial numbers in this quarter that it didn't get much project business, for example, like in the T&L area, where you were having big projects with the UPSes, FedExes of the world. That business was actually down quite a bit in North America, but what I would describe as our core standard Industrial products, actually, I think grew mid- or high-single digits in the quarter. So in terms of the second half, maybe absent a tough time here or there, our Americas business looks pretty good. I see no reason it shouldn't grow mid-single digits, maybe a little better. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay and then lastly, Bill, you called out pricing on your gross margin comments. Just anything incrementally -- incremental there to add about your ability to push through pricing increases? William P. Donnelly: Yes, we -- I'm thinking on of year-to-date basis, we're about a 170 bps or so. No, sorry, I was mixing up material cost. So we're 210 bps. We're actually 240 bps in the quarter. And I would be surprised if that number wasn't a little better in the second half. There are a couple of areas we've been looking at around Service pricing, lab balance pricing. In Europe, in general, we feel like we have good pricing positioning right now, so I think you won't see that or you never know if there's a funny mix or something or a big -- a couple of big projects. But overall, I think you'll see pricing continue to move in a positive direction in the second half. We feel very good about the competitive position of the technology portfolio right now vis-\u00e0-vis competition. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Capital Markets. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : Could you talk to the Food Retail business? It was down in the June quarter, it appears, versus Q1. And then could you talk to Europe? Was Europe a little lighter than you had even expected? Olivier A. Filliol: Okay, on Food Retail, I wouldn't read too much in the numbers. It's are very project-driven business. It's a rather lumpy business. But -- and so we're always going to see ups and downs, but I also to remind ourselves that retail for us -- our focus is not on the top line growth. It's actually really focused on operating profit. It's a business that is below the group average when it comes to profitability and so we have really the strategies and the team focused on margin expansion rather than just the top line. And that means also we remain very disciplined in the project business. As you can imagine, this project business [indiscernible] tenders and pricing is always a key, key topic. While we have in all other businesses excellent positions where we can really enforce some price increases, Food Retail is the one where this is the most difficult and, accordingly, we can't be focused really on the top line growth without looking also at this margin topic. So that will be the reason why we are not alerted at all. And we are okay with that performance. To Europe, actually, I'm very pleased about the European numbers. Q2 was actually good. What you need to realize is that Europe was also impacted by, for example, Russia. Russia was down and, in that sense, had an impact on Europe. But it certainly met my expectations. I would say, even modestly up if I took a look at core Europe. William P. Donnelly: And maybe to add to Olivier's comments, maybe to give you a sense, Paul. The retail business on a 2-year business actually grew. So we had a very easy comp in Q1, had decent growth against it. We had a tougher comp in Q2 and -- but on a 2-year basis, we actually grew little bit faster. And maybe a couple of comments in more detail on the European position. I think the one business that didn't grow as much as we expected in Europe was our Product Inspection business, and that had a lot to do with just more -- we finished the year with more of a quarter with more backlog than we expected. Actually, order growth was just fine in Product Inspection but, reiterating Olivier's point, that the comps do get tougher. I think we grew our lab business about 10% in Q3 last year. So we'll face a tougher comp as we go into the second half. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Evans from Wells Fargo. Timothy C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : I was wondering if you could comment on the competitive dynamics in China, particularly with the local competitors over there. Olivier A. Filliol: So while most of the countries in the world we are facing only a few competitors, we have in China an interesting situation that when it comes to the Industrial division, we face hundreds, if not thousands, of local competitors. These are very small regional players. There are just a few ones that are bigger but then they are typically only competing in very focused business lines. We have been living with that competitive landscape for decades now. And I haven't seen any major changes that alert me. However, we constantly monitor that situation. And we also monitor kind of in which area they experienced growth and at what kind of profitability levels. What we would typically see is that competitors can grow in certain segments like we have seen also in the last 12 months when we walked away from certain deals because of terms and conditions and payments, particular payment terms. These businesses were picked up by competitors but we were then picking it up because, honestly, the projects were just not attractive. And in that sense, we live with it. But strategically, I don't see that any competitor here are making moves that are jeopardizing our position. These were a few comments on Industrial side. If I go to Lab, the situation is actually different. We have mainly global players that compete with us. The local players are competing in a totally different league in terms of quality, but also price. But customers would clearly differentiate that and in my update last week that I got from the local lab team, I was actually too pleased to see that the local Chinese competitors for different product categories, I would say, rather got weaker than stronger in the last 2, 3 years. So we feel actually comfortable with that competitive landscape. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman of Robert W. Baird. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Just a couple things. Bill, you had identified price capture in the quarter. And I'm a bit curious, is that pertain -- is it skewed at all on the hardware versus the Service and Consumables side? I mean, is 1 of 5 and the other of 0? Or are you capturing any price in the hardware? William P. Donnelly: Definitely capturing price in the hardware. I would be surprised if the differences were more than 50 bps. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay, okay. And then, also, Olivier, could you provide maybe -- again, just to double-back to China again. But with lab plus double digits in China, I'm curious, are there any of the product lines that are definitely kind of leading? I mean, is Balances or AutoChem? I mean, what's the -- what's your product position within China in the lab market? Olivier A. Filliol: So when we talked about double-digit, we meant core lab. The core lab is really basic Balances, Analytical Instruments. We actually -- Pipette did also well. So it's these product categories -- actually, if I recall well, Automated Chemistry did also well. So actually, really, our whole core lab portfolio did well. I think that reflects that we are serving here a different customer base than the Industrial division. It reflects also this macro trend that we are benefiting from like the number of scientists joining the workforce. This trends to with more quality control. And then, also the move in more value-added industries. And I would also say that Lab in general is earlier in the cycle than the Industrial products. So for me, seeing this core lab growing double-digit is an early indicator that things should get better. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Is there a -- an emerging Service market for you there or is that still in its infancy as well? Olivier A. Filliol: So the Service market and also our Service revenue is actually developing well. I'm very happy about the growth rates, but it's coming from a low base. Your statement that it's in an early phase is fair. This -- it's a little bit to be differentiated by different product -- business lines and service types. We have, for example, in China a situation where the government still provides calibration services themselves. And so it's a situation where that is kind of a delicate we don't want to compete and call it compete with the government for money calibration services. But that's a market that will open up in the future and, in essence, still offers great opportunities. There are other product lines and -- where we can offer our full service capability. If I -- for example, in the Automated Chemistry area or in the Product Inspection area as well, where calibration is not so important, then we can offer our full service offering, and that's certainly something we're focused on and will further leverage in the coming years. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : I'm a little bit curious again -- staying with China for a second, but I'm a little curious. Your Product Inspection business again was plus double digits and I know your business isn't lab-oriented. It's more production-line oriented, but again, we've heard so much during the first 6 months of the year about just regulatory schemes on the food service side and some compliance issues and kind of a reorder of food safety administration. But again, that all pertains more to the lab than it does to the production side. Is that a fair comment? Olivier A. Filliol: Regulations. to a far degree, yes. But the awareness is really huge about all food safety topics. And I heard so many examples of retailers in China, Walmart, but also local Chinese companies that are increasing the pressure on their suppliers that they really enforced good food safety practices. And we often also invited to seminars and trainings that these retailers provide to their suppliers, and we can raise the awareness for physical contamination that can be prevented through our metal detectors, X-ray systems. And we certainly also see that the big brands, food-producing brands, are taking actions to protect themselves through better product inspection solutions. So demand is good. The awareness is good for our solutions, but I would also state that while Product Inspection on a global scale is about 16% of our revenue, in China, it's still significantly lower. It's more like the 5%-ish. And so there is a way to go for us to reach the same penetration levels as we have in the West. And that's why I always refer to the fact that China offers not just growth in line with the GDP but, actually, offers additional growth because there are product categories that are still underpenetrated. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : I see. Okay. Very good. And then just one last question, Bill, given where you are in the buyback year-to-date through June, anything changed in terms of the targeted dollar amount that you'd like to put to work by the end of the year? William P. Donnelly: No, same as we talked about last quarter, which... Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Of that towards $400 million? William P. Donnelly: Yes, about $400 million. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Citigroup. Daniel Anthony Arias - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Bill or Olivier, on the Service side, you guys mentioned trying to bring of the installed base under contract. So just curious where that percentage stands at this point. I think it was 20% or so the last time we talked about it. So has that inched up at all at this point? William P. Donnelly: So I think, first, it would probably have to be maybe more narrowly defined like, for example, maybe our laboratory instruments might be closer to that level. But if you look at our business in total, we wouldn't yet be at that rate. The fact that our Service business grew 7% or so, if I recall, is -- and our product business of course, if you do the math, grew less than that, is a reflection that that's increasing. But of course our installed base might average high-single-digits numbers of years. If you take everything, it's a small move in terms of percentage terms. But I think both of us feel that there's -- continues to be good mid- to high-single-digit growth opportunities in service for many years to come. Olivier A. Filliol: I think the interesting part here is that the attachment rate of service differs highly country-by-country. We just talked about China before, where the penetration and attachment rates is significantly lower than in the West. But also within the West, within Europe, we see big differences. And one of the key measures that we are following is really looking at these penetration rates country-by-country, understanding why we have differences and developing plans with the local country management, how we can increase these penetrations. When we were referring to field turbos before, that's, for example, an area where we're also leveraging this field turbo, for example, doing more telesales of service products to attach the attachment rates to the installed base of recent years. Daniel Anthony Arias - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : And then just quickly, Bill, not sure if I missed it, but did you give the order number for China? William P. Donnelly: Orders were in line with sales. I think backlog's almost perfectly flat with last year in China. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research Company. Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company : A couple of things for you. First, raw materials. How much were they benefit in the quarter, Bill? William P. Donnelly: So raw material costs were down about 2%. Of course that's not all a cost of sales. Just to give you a feeling, it's -- on an annualized basis, that's 2% down and maybe $450 million or so. Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company : Okay, and then, just backlog in general, did you build backlog across the business in total at all? William P. Donnelly: I think, we're modestly up. Mixed buys have changed with -- I made a reference to, I think, specific to Europe, but in general, Product Inspection grew backlog quite a bit. Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company : And then just, my final thing is given the past 4 quarters, you've put up pretty good growth in Europe. When you look out going forward, is mid-single-digit growth in Europe still possible? Or is it may be more in like the low single-digit to mid-single-digit range do you think? William P. Donnelly: I think if we look -- let's talk like a 5-year window, we would say, hey, if Europe grows 3% to 4%, that would be well in line with our overall group targets. If it mid- -- if it grew 5%, we'd be doing better than we would expect. Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company : And then if I could squeeze one more in for Olivier. Olivier, you made a comment regarding some things you've seen in China that we may not have seen in the Western press so far that you thought were interesting or exciting. Just wonder if you could elaborate on that at all. Olivier A. Filliol: It starts that when you are here in Shanghai, as well as Jiangsu, you feel that the economy is actually still quite healthy. You see activity. You see new things happening, investments happening. The second thing that I felt really good about is -- from the Chinese team is, you see that there is still also greenfield activities. Maybe less than in the recent past and certainly not yet back to normal, but there is still investments in new production sites. There is also new developments of regions and cities where the government is actually really proactively investing in the future. There are new infrastructure being funded by the government because they want to develop and promote new industrial zones, and some of them are actually really big and promising. These are things that at least I don't hear too much in the European press about. And it gives you a different perspective when you were here and you have the Chinese team showing the different opportunities that are around. William P. Donnelly: Maybe one other anecdotal one. Sometimes we hear in the press about these empty cities, and I'm sure there are still some there, but in the train ride from Shanghai to Jiangsu now, what was once some empty cities there are now full. And that's over the last couple of years. So it's always better to be here. It's a naturally optimistic place, but I agree with Olivier there. There are maybe more positive signs when you're here on the ground than sometimes what you hear in the news, and I think we saw some good, was it, MPI [ph] numbers or something about this morning. So I feel it was a good sign. Olivier A. Filliol: Or to give you a fun one, we inaugurated our new plant in Jiangsu 7 years ago. And at the inauguration, we planted trees. And the trees are growing in the side, but on the opposite side of the trees, there was a farmland. And in the meantime, they are starting to build new residential buildings, huge buildings. and I was here, it was more or less last year, and within a year, you see the building coming up. And it's so much faster than the trees are growing. It's actually unbelievable how fast things are still happening here. And of course when you see them being built, they look totally empty. But I picked up actually from my management team that different of our employees have actually bought one of the other things there. And so it seems to be real and, yes, it feels good when you see that. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Sung Ji Nam with Cantor. Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : So, Olivier, I was wondering, your lab products and AutoChem and Product Inspection businesses are still kind of growing at a high rate and for -- in the developed countries in North America and in Europe, are there opportunities for further market expansion? Or is the growth largely coming from taking share from your competitors? Olivier A. Filliol: No, actually, I would really say both. I differentiate here maybe by product categories. If I talk about Automated Chemistry, it's definitely not just market share gains. This is about developing also new opportunities and new markets. The lab of the future that referred in my prepared remarks is a classic one. This is not winning against competition. This is actually working together with our customers for new solutions to their problems. So that's really developing the markets. In Product Inspection, we have, in particular, one product category and that's X-ray where the market is still developing. This is not yet a matured market and one that we are just replacing installed base. Not at all actually. It's very much about convincing customers that this is the right technology to deduct more physical contamination that they can do with metal injection. When you think about core labs, if I take, for example, a balance, the balance in the West is more a replacement business. And when it's a replacement business, when we are growing faster than the market, of course, it is about gaining market share. Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : And then more specifically for your Pipette business, you talked about a lot of innovations there and I believe this is an area where you're still #2 in the marketplace. I was wondering if you are gaining any traction in terms of taking share from your #1 competitor there. Olivier A. Filliol: So in the Pipette business, our market position differs very much by geography. Actually in U.S., we have an excellent market position. And when we look towards Europe and Asia, we are clearly not the #1, and there are even regions where we are a #3, #4 player. So our emphasis in terms of gaining market share is, of course, in these underpenetrated markets. Now for Pipettes, this is something that doesn't happen overnight. Even if we have superior product, it's a lot of fieldwork convincing customers and converting whole accounts. The Service business plays also an important role in providing a total solution to the customer. So a lot of room for market share gain but, again, this is significant work and the product alone will unfortunately not just make the difference. Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : Got it. And then, Bill, just quickly, when you talk about making incremental investments in anticipation of accelerated growth next year, is this a second half event or will this continue into next year as well? William P. Donnelly: I think Olivier made the point that it's we have an overall plan of investments that we can make. We're not making them all beginning in the fourth quarter. I think we want to make some beginning here in the third quarter, but a good number in the fourth quarter and then we're going to see how the market plays out a bit. But there are -- I think we -- I think there's maybe 2 comments to it. One is -- or 2 takeaways. One is that we do think '15 can be a better growth year than '14, that we see specific growth opportunities that we think are worth investing in and the ideas go beyond just the short term in terms of what we could absorb investment-wise. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn our presentation over to your hostess, Ms. Mary Finnegan. Mary T. Finnegan: Thanks, Pete, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As always, we're available for questions. Of course, we are here in China. And just given the time difference and to make sure that we can be responsive to your questions, it might work best if you e-mail me any questions, and then we're happy to shoot an e-mail back or give you guys -- or we'll call you back. I think you know my e-mail, but in case you don't, mary.finnegan@mt.com. Take care everyone. Thanks. Bye-bye. William P. Donnelly: Good day. Thank you very much. Olivier A. Filliol: Bye-bye.

My name is Kyle, and I'll be your audio coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the presentation over to our hostess for today's call, Ms. Mary Finnegan. Please proceed, ma'am. Mary T. Finnegan: Thanks, Kyle, and good evening, everyone. I'm Mary Finnegan. I'm the Treasurer and responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo. I'm happy to have you joining us tonight. I am joined here by Olivier Filliol, our CEO; and Bill Donnelly, our Executive Vice President. I need to disclose a couple of administrative matters before we get started. This call is being webcast and is available on our website. A copy of the press release and the presentation that we will refer to today is also on our website. The safe harbor language is outlined on Page 1 of the presentation. Let me just cover it briefly.

More detailed information with respect to the use of and differences between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided in our Form 8-K. Let me now turn the call over to Olivier. Olivier A. Filliol: Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter, and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter are on Page 2 of the presentation. Local currency sales increased 6% in the quarter, with better-than-expected growth in Europe, despite strong results in this region in the year earlier period. Americas continues to perform quite well, and Asia/Rest of World had good growth against easier comparison. Solid top line organic sales growth combined with our margin improvement and cost control initiatives led to good growth in earnings per share in the quarter. While there is greater economic uncertainty today, we feel good about our outlook for the remainder of this year and for 2015. I will have some further comments on our outlook later on the call, but now I will turn it to Bill to cover the numbers. William P. Donnelly: Thanks, Olivier, and hello, everybody. Sales were $629.1 million in the quarter, that's an increase of 6% in local currency. On the U.S. dollar basis, sales also increased by 6% as currency had no impact on sales in the quarter. Turning to Page 3 of the presentation. We outlined sales by geography. In the quarter, local currency sales increased by 7% in the Americas, by 4% in Europe, and by 7% in Asia/Rest of World, all as compared to the prior year. For China specifically, local currency sales increased by 4%, which was modestly better than expected and included the delivery of 2 large projects. The next slide provides year-to-date sales, which increased by 5% in local currency. By region for the 9 months, sales have increased by 5% in both the Americas and Europe and by 4% in Asia/Rest of World. Sales growth by product line for the quarter is highlighted on Slide #5. Laboratory sales increased by 6% in local currency, while industrial sales increased by 7% driven by strong growth in Product Inspection. Food retailing was flat in the quarter. For the 9-month period, which you see on the next slide, laboratory sales increased by 6% in local currency, while industrial sales increased by 4% and food retailing was up 2%. Now turning to Slide #7. Let me walk you through the other key items in the P&L. Our gross margins were at 54.6%, an 80-basis-point increase over the prior year margin of 53.8%. We benefited from pricing and lower material costs, which were offset somewhat by unfavorable currency and mix. R&D amounted to $30.4 million, an increase of 3% in local currency. SG&A amounted to $168.5 million, which is an increase of 7% in local currency. Higher variable compensation expense and increased investment in our field sales organization were offset in part by cost savings and lower employee benefit cost. Our adjusted operating income was $126.7 million in the quarter, and that's a 9% increase over the prior year amount of $116.1 million. Our operating margins were 20.1%, which is a 50-basis-point increase over the prior year. We estimate currencies reduced operating profit by about $1 million. Without the impact of currency, operating profit would've increased 10%, and operating margins would've increased by 80 basis points in the quarter. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $7.2 million. Interest expense was $6 million, while our effective tax rate continued to be 24%. Fully diluted shares for the quarter were $29.4 million, which is a 3.8% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted earnings per share was $2.95 per share, a 13% increase over the prior year amount of $2.60 per share. Currency reduced adjusted earnings per share by approximately 1%. On a reported basis, earnings per share was $2.89 as compared to $2.43 in the prior year period. Reported EPS includes pretax restructuring charges of $1.1 million or $0.03 per share, which are primarily employee-related costs. Reported EPS also included $0.03 of purchased intangible amortization. The next slide provides details on our year-to-date results. Specifically for the 9 months, local currency sales increased by 5%, operating profit was up 7% and adjusted earnings per share have increased by 11%. For the 9-month period, currency reduced earnings per share by about 2.5%. Now turning to cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter amounted to $106 million, relatively consistent with the prior year amount. We continue to benefit from good working capital management, which offset to a degree by the timing of the tax payments and higher CapEx. Working capital statistics were solid in the quarter with ITO at 5.1x and our DSO at 42 days. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow of $235.7 million as compared to $195.4 million in the prior year. This represents a 25% increase on a per share basis. Now let me turn to guidance. Forecasting is particularly challenging as we have a few different factors impacting our guidance. First, we're coming off a strong third quarter with results better than expected. Second, we feel very good about our market position and our execution. Third, we're continuing to invest in front-end resources, what we refer to as our field turbo programs. Offsetting these positive influences is the high degree of uncertainty in the global economy and the increasing volatility in financial markets, which could ultimately create greater uncertainty in the global economy and in our customers' investment outlook. These are some general comments, and Olivier will provide some additional comments shortly. Taken all together, we expect local currency sales growth in the fourth quarter to be in the 4% to 5% range in local currency. This should result in adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.12 per share to $4.17 per share or a growth rate of 8% to 9%. With this guidance, we expect full year 2014 sales growth to be in the 4% to 5% range and adjusted EPS to be between $11.60 and $11.65, a growth rate of approximately 10%. This compares to our previous guidance of $11.45 to $11.60. The increase reflects our outperformance in Q3. Furthermore, we are absorbing about $0.06 of greater currency headwinds in the fourth quarter as compared to the last time we provided guidance. Through our margin enhancement programs and cost control initiatives, we're able to offset this negative currency headwind and not lower guidance for the full year. For 2015, our initial guidance is that local currency sales growth should be in the range of 4% to 5%, and our adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of $12.80 per share to $13.05, reflecting a growth rate of approximately 10% to 12%. Let me provide you some additional details for your models. First, currency. We would expect currency to reduce sales growth in the fourth quarter by approximately 4%. For the full year 2014, currency will have no impact on sales. For 2015, we expect currency to reduce sales by approximately 2%. In terms of the impact of currency on earnings, we would expect currency to reduce EPS growth by 2% in this coming fourth quarter. As just mentioned, this is more negative as compared to the last time we spoke to you, principally driven by a weaker yen, a weaker Canadian dollar and a weaker Aussie dollar. For full year 2014, currency is expected to reduce earnings growth by 2%. For 2015, we expect currency to reduce earnings per share growth by approximately 1%. Okay, one final comment as you update your models. Our full year 2015 guidance is in line with current consensus. However, quarterly numbers are different. We will provide specific quarterly guidance throughout the year in 2015 as we typically do, but I did want to point out that the current consensus for the fourth -- for the first quarter reflects a 22% earnings per share growth, and second quarter consensus is at 16% growth rate. Both of these quarterly growth rates would be above our expectations. At this stage, we anticipate that the quarterly growth rates for 2015 will be in line with our full year EPS guidance that we just provided. Okay, that's it for my side. And I'd like to turn it back over to Olivier. Olivier A. Filliol: Thanks, Bill. And let me start with summary comments on business condition. Lab increased 6% in the third quarter with good growth in pipettes, Analytical Instruments, Automated Chemistry and Process Analytics. Balances have also grown in the quarter despite strong growth in the year-earlier period. We are executing quite well in our laboratory business. Combination of strong product pipeline in Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives. I expect results in the fourth quarter and into 2015 to continue to be solid in lab. Industrial increased 7% in the quarter. As expected, Product Inspection had very good growth, up 12% in the third quarter. The outlook for this market is favorable, given focus on brand protection in general and food safety in particular. We are well positioned in this business with strong relative market share, the most extensive product portfolio and the largest service network in the industry. We will face tougher comparisons as we get into 2015, but expect Product Inspection to have good growth in the coming years. Core industrial was up 4% in the third quarter. I'm pleased to see growth in all regions of the world. We would expect low single-digit growth for our core industrial business in the fourth quarter and into 2015. Finally, retail was flat in the quarter, but I expect some better growth for the remainder of this year and into next year as we have a couple of European orders that will benefit us. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. As mentioned earlier, European sales growth was a little better than expected and amounted to 4% in the quarter. We have growth in most countries in Western Europe with exception of France, which was down slightly. Eastern Europe was down modestly with Russia particularly weak. We are cautious on this region, given the recent negative news. We will face more challenging comparisons in Europe overall, but I'm happy that we continue to execute very well and are capitalizing on our Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives and strong product pipeline in this region. Americas had another very good quarter with sales growth of 7%. We had good growth in lab, Product Inspection and core industrial. Retail was down in the quarter against strong comparisons from the prior period. Our outlook for Americas is good. Asia/Rest of World increased 7% in the quarter. Market conditions in China continued to stabilize and their growth of 4% was slightly better than expectation. In China, we again had very good growth in our core laboratory products offering. Product Inspection, retail and core industrial also had growth in the third quarter. In general, China remains on track with our previously described expectations. We will remain cautious given the overcapacity in certain segments and the lack of investments in new plants and production life. While we expect conditions to continue to improve, the growth path remains sensitive. We expect China sales to be up modestly in the fourth quarter and expect better growth in 2015, principally due to easier comparisons. In terms of other emerging markets, India, Brazil and Southeast Asia also performed well in the third quarter, and we expect continued solid performance from these regions. One final comment on the quarter. Service had good growth in the quarter with revenue up 8% as compared to prior year. We had good growth in all geographic regions and in most product lines. Let me update you on our field turbo program. We mentioned last quarter that we were selectively adding sales service personnel to capture specific growth opportunities. We worked hard in recent months to identify penetration opportunities at detailed level by product category and geography and customer segment. By benchmarking across various units, analyzing territories' coverage, the size and mix of relevant end-user industry, we can identify gaps where we can invest in additional sales coverage to gain growth and share. We cannot pursue all these opportunities at once, so we prioritize based on expected return. Investments are not always front-line sales personnel. It can also be segment specialist, inside sales, telesales or telemarketing resources. The additions are very specific and directed. For example, we are adding service sales personnel in Thailand, a high-end volume sales person in Germany, service technicians and inside sales personnel in Turkey, telemarketing and telesales in Eastern Europe, to name just a few example. We expect to add more than 200 headcount over the next 12 to 18 months. We also see potential of additional resource additions in the future. These resources combined with our Spinnaker sales and marketing programs are the foundation for our strategy to continue to incrementally gain market share. One final topic I want to cover today is key account management. As we have discussed in the past, our business is very fragmented with no end customer accounting for more than 1% of sales. As a result, few of our sales are subject to corporate procurement program scrutiny. However, we increasingly see opportunity for growth to global key accounts as multiple -- national seeks to develop global standards for quality of automation in their operations and R&D. Relationships at these customers often involve corporate engineering, R&D, quality control and other functions. Let me explain this a little more. While a customer decision to purchase our instruments is almost always made at the local level, through targeted programs, we have been able to exploit our global capabilities to gain share in large global companies, especially in our Product Inspection and lab businesses. Much of these increased efforts are derived through an increased desire by customers to globally control the product quality. In most product categories, the quality of our solution, our global presence and service capability provide hard-to-match value proposition for customers as compared to our competitors. Customers appreciate having out one strong partner globally when they invest in programs to enforce global quality standards and service standards. We see a growing trend toward enforcement of these global quality standards with our multinational customers, and we believe we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of this trend. This is evidenced by some recent orders that we expect to gain more in the coming years. That concludes the topics for today. Let me summarize key messages as we look to 2015. We believe we are positioned well for continued growth. We are cautious on China and emerging markets in general, but we believe we see improved growth in these regions. We expect Americas to continue to perform well. Europe is a bit mixed, good results in the third quarter, but more recent market data is mixed. We also faced tougher comparisons in this region. Taken altogether, we believe we can continue to gain market share by capitalizing on our sales and marketing programs, including our field turbo investment and strong product pipeline. Our continued focus on margin enhancement initiative combined with our strong cash flow generation and share repurchases should continue to drive earnings growth next year and beyond. I want to ask the operator now to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Olivier, just qualitatively, can you give us a sense of the trends that you saw in, particularly in Europe and China in the period, and whether you're, I guess, qualitatively feeling directionally better about your progress, and I guess, the broader macro environment in those 2 regions? Olivier A. Filliol: As stated, I was certainly pleased to see Europe coming in better than expected and our outlook in that sense stays favorable. In particular, when I listen to my team, we were, for example, on a big tour back in September where we visited the units and that was with recent contact also with the General Manager. What I hear from them is actually positive and makes me -- actually encourages me really for the future. What is more difficult is the news that I pick up in the newspapers, and that's certainly a more challenging environment when you read that. But we don't see that challenge in our own numbers at this stage. When it comes to China, I would say that our numbers have also slightly been above what we expected. But the environment stays challenging. I would say, of course, what we hear to the news, but also what I hear from our own managers, there are certain businesses that do really well. For example, the core lab business, where we continue to have very good growth numbers. Similar to Q1 and Q2, we have in Q3, actually, a double-digit growth in core lab. Process Analytics is still challenged, but that's mainly because last year we had a favorable environment Q2 regulation changes. Then when I come to Product Inspection, they had good numbers in China. And I expect them to continue to do well. But in China, we have a smaller piece of Product Inspection than the global average. So I mean it has a little bit less impact. And when it comes to Core Industrial, which is actually a big part of our Chinese business, we had some growth, and I expect actually that business to do okay going forward. But it is a business that is exposed to infrastructure investments, government spending and certainly, I do expect that this will continue to be challenging, because there is still overcapacity in China, and there are industry segments that are still suffering because of that. So all in all, I would say Q3 clearly showed that things gradually get better, but we remain cautious when it comes to China and Europe. S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Bill, in terms of the guidance next year, what are you factoring for share repurchases? Should we expect it to be north of 100% of free cash flow next year? And then what are you baking in for local currency incremental margins? Will the field headcount expansions sort of push you to the lower end of what you would otherwise normally expect? William P. Donnelly: Okay. So on the share repurchases, we're probably going to do something in the range of $75 million to $100 million more than our free cash flow. I go back to what we talked about, I think it's now 2 quarters ago, where we want to pick up on the share repurchase program given our balance sheet position. We just think we could do it a little bit more leveraged in our capital structure. With regard to incremental margins, they should, on a currency adjusted basis, remain in the low to mid-30s. And maybe one thing, I think, one of the things we feel good about with regard to the field turbo program is that it was very much a story of resource allocations. We have a number of cost savings initiatives, productivity initiatives inside the organization that just allowed us to be able to save in other areas of the business and be able to field these additional resources and what I would describe as a normal operating expense budget as compared to our 4% to 5% top line target that we described to you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Yes. Just -- could you, Olivier, maybe just expand a little bit on Europe? I mean, that was maybe the upside to plan in the quarter. And which of the product lines in particular surprised? Olivier A. Filliol: It was pretty much across all the product lines that we did well and that we exceeded expectations. I really feel it's the teams that execute very well on the Spinnaker approaches that we talked about. We had also the benefit, for example, lease [ph] growth program that continued to yield very well. At the end of the day, I do feel like we are winning nicely share in Europe in this environment, and this is pretty much true across all the business lines. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And in China, Bill, you referenced 2 large projects in the comp period, Q3 of '13. Is that -- was that in industrial? William P. Donnelly: No. Just to clarify, we had 2 large industrial projects. The 4% included us having delivered on 2 larger industrial projects within Q3 of this year. One was large -- they're both kind of infrastructure-related. One was a grain project, grain depot project. And the other was a -- some kind of a highway project, I think. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : I understand. Okay. And so would it have been a point or 2 of the growth? William P. Donnelly: It would've been, I think, between 2% and 3% of the growth in China, maybe 2%. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay, okay. And, Olivier, did the field turbo program, is it targeted at -- you said basically, there's a lot of opportunities there. And so basically, you're allocating to the highest return. But are -- is that focused on lab or industrial or Product Inspection? Is there a piece of the business that we could zero in on and look for maybe a point of contribution to the growth rate next year to just see the results? Olivier A. Filliol: And so the lab business gets most of all the businesses, but we do actuals of field turbo for industrial and within industrial, for example, for Core Industrial as well as for Product Inspection. It is so that we give most to businesses with the highest profitability. But, of course, there are also some geographies where we are underrepresented or are building up. I would, for example, namely Turkey. In Turkey, we are building up our presence in industrial business. As for the lab business, we have already done that in the past or we are building up also resources in Indonesia and Philippines. And so when we do such dedicated efforts for a full country, typically, we do it across business lines. But when it's in more mature markets, then it really goes to the business lines with the highest profitability. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay, I see. And just maybe just as an offshoot to that, and then I'll jump off here. But when you think about new product spend, new product introductions and you're looking out into '15, could you take a guess at perhaps what the 4% to 5% might include from new products? And I guess possibly, it's less about volume growth and more about price pickup from the new products? Olivier A. Filliol: Yes. The new products are really important to us because they are driving the replacement cycle. We need to make sure that we have new value proposition so that our customers are -- have good reasons to upgrade the product, replace the products. And of course, it's also important to differentiate ourselves versus competition. That's a key reason why we continue to launch and upgrade our product lines. And we have an excellent pipeline for next year. But I don't want to overstate and suggest that these new product launches will accelerate our growth. It's really more like, I guess described as, the pricing power that we have is not particularly coming from new product launches. The pricing power that we have is the total solution. It is our application specialist that we have. It is the product that is also the service capabilities. And when you look at our price increases that we do, it is pretty much across all the business lines. Of course, we differentiate. There are business lines where we have more pricing powers than others, but it's not so much related to new product. Now of course, when we launch new products, we want to make sure that we have better differentiated value proposition. And often, we want also to make sure that we have lower cost. And so new products help us to expand margins. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : And is there a price component in that 4% to 5%? I mean, does it trend that maybe the current 2% or... William P. Donnelly: Say it again. I don't know... Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Is there a price component in the 4% to 5% growth for '15? I mean, is it trend line out, let's say 2%? Or... William P. Donnelly: Yes, yes. I think -- we think it could be 150 basis points, hopefully more, approaching 2%, somewhere in that range. Olivier A. Filliol: Yes, which is about what we have this year. So next year, not a big change. Maybe one additional comment. When you asked before, if there is a particular product line that's more impacted than others from these product launches. If I -- there are 2 business lines that got a lot of new products launched recently or will happen in the next 2 quarter. One is our lab balance business, where we have the high-end as well as the entry line that will have a new product and very, very good product. And the other one is Product Inspection. In Product Inspection, we have, across all the business units, actually new product. This is true for checkweighing. This is true for metal detection. And late last year, we launched also a new platform for x-ray. So we're going to have a very up-to-date product line in this business. For all -- for example, Core Industrial, it's more coming in the next few quarters, where we have promising products, and in essence, differentiation in the market. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I know you give some commentary on China in the prepared remarks and thus far in Q&A. But I was hoping to maybe get a little more granularity on why exactly the region did better this quarter than your expectations? And reason for asking is sort of if we look towards next year, I think your prior quarter commentary had suggested you're anticipating a better year in '15. And as a result, planning to invest there. So I just want to confirm that, that's all the case and maybe give us a sense of what you saw in the ground this quarter. William P. Donnelly: So maybe a couple of comments. So if we divide the business up into the different components, we continue to have a very good year in our peer laboratory instruments. So as you guys know, within the laboratory instrument category, we have our traditional benchtop stuff as well as our Process Analytics business. Our benchtop type instrumentations have grown by -- in double digits in this quarter. And on a year-to-date basis, we continue to think that, that should do well. We're very well positioned competitively there and made great strides in terms of distribution. And we don't run into maybe some of the same hurdles that some of the peer group companies have, because maybe in part I'm sure because our ASPs are a little bit below theirs. The Process Analytics business faces some tough comps the last few quarters because of some regulatory benefits that they had last year that have now expired, and we would expect that business to grow better next year. If we look at our Core Industrial that -- where Olivier made some mentions of infrastructure concerns in certain segments with regard to overcapacity. But if we look, the percentage of our business related to those markets does get smaller. And we see good growth in certain segments like food-related, for example, there. And we would expect to have marginally better business in that sector. And then our Product Inspection business does quite good in China. So I think this year, we're going to end up finishing the year kind of in an apples-to-apples basis with low single-digit growth in China. And we would be surprised if it wasn't somewhere in the mid-single-digits to high single-digit growth rates for next year. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Yes. That's very helpful. One follow-up would be on the service business. You obviously had a nice year there as well so far. And just trying to get a sense of how we should think about the service contribution to growth in '15 versus '14. William P. Donnelly: So you're right, we did have good growth. I think it was 8% in the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis, a little less than that. We have been investing a lot in our -- in globalizing our service business in recent years and in productizing it, that we can market it and sell it better at the point-of-sale and throughout the product's life cycle. And I think we're really in any ways just scratching the surface in terms of the benefits of those programs, but we think we have a lot of years to run in that regard, and we have a lot of, what I would describe, operational excellence, momentum within that business. And I don't mean it just from a margin enhancement point of view, but the way we sell in-market to products as well. So I would, again, expect that the service business will grow faster than the product business in '15. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Clark from Evercore ISI. James Clark - Evercore ISI, Research Division : This is James filling in for Ross Muken. Guys, I was just wondering if you could give a sense for pricing during the quarter. And then I think you talked about coming into the year about 150 basis points. And looks like you did 200 and 240 in the first and second quarter. Maybe you can give a sense if pricing is generally coming in better than you'd expected. And how that's impacting gross margin? William P. Donnelly: Yes. So just to clarify the reference to 150 to 200 basis points was with regard what our assumption is for 2015. With regard to Q3 this year, we realized about 240 basis points of price increases, and that puts us slightly north of 200 basis points on a year-to-date basis. There was a couple areas in the product groups where we tried to push a little bit more price, but not via list price increases, but rather via reduced discounting in the couple product categories midyear where we felt that things were going well. And so that's -- we continue to think the fourth quarter will also be a good quarter pricing-wise. James Clark - Evercore ISI, Research Division : Okay. And then one more on China. If you could just call out how orders were during the quarter. I know you talked about some orders converting to revs and how that contributed to the 4% growth. But maybe you could talk about sort of how orders track relative to revenue growth? William P. Donnelly: So back to the delivery of those 2 large products. The -- I'm embarrassed, I keep forgetting the second one. One is grain-related and whatever the second project is. Those 2 were order entry in earlier period and sales in this period. So order entry growth was slightly less than sales growth in Q3. And we would expect sales growth in Q4 to be in line with the order entry growth that we saw in Q3, both single digits. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JP Morgan. Patrick Donnelly - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : This is actually Patrick Donnelly filling in for Tycho. Just looking at guidance for 2015, can you talk through geographies a little bit, particularly Europe? I know you're strong this quarter but had some cautious commentary based on the date and headlines that are out there. So maybe just talk through your expectations there for 2015? William P. Donnelly: Okay. So we would expect Europe to grow a little bit less in '15 and in '14. At least that's our assumption at this stage. We're assuming low single-digit, 2% to 4%, growth coming out of Europe within that guidance. There is one or the other large jab that we have in the comps. And in general, we built a little bit of caution in given the economic environment. Patrick Donnelly - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And then just on gross margin, obviously, you called out prices impact this quarter. Can you also maybe just break out the raw materials? And then how much of a headwind was FX? And then do the same thing for 2015, you talked about 150 bps tailwind for pricing in '15. Maybe just talk about what kind of headwind FX would be and also the tailwind from raw materials? William P. Donnelly: Okay. So with regard to material costs. Material costs were down, let's call it 150 bps in the quarter and for the full year. We're happy with that number. I don't think we can do something like that again next year. But we should have raw material cost flat to down, let's call it, 1%, somewhere in that range for 2015. And so that would kind of give you the -- those components for '14 and '15. With regard to foreign exchange and the operating profit level, which is maybe the, I think, the easiest way to communicate about it. If you take the rates as of beginning of this week, so including that yen move at the end of the last week, we would have -- we would have had a headwind of $10 million on our P&L in 2014 for the full year. And we would expect a $4 million headwind in 2015, again, all based on current rates. So the main drivers there is the yen, the Aussie dollar and the Canadian. And I feel like I've hardly ever said this on our conference call, but I think we even get a modest benefit from the Swiss franc. So thank you, Switzerland. Thank you, Olivier. So yes, I think I answered your questions, Patrick. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Rafael Tejada - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : It's Rafael Tejada in for Derik. Actually just a couple more clarification questions on the guidance for the 2015 outlook. I think you just mentioned that Europe, you're anticipating about a 2% to 4% growth. Apologies if I missed it, but what are you anticipating for Americas and Asia Pac? William P. Donnelly: Probably in Americas, we'll do a little bit better than that. I think mid-single digits. And then Asia Pac should be mid-single to high single digits. Rafael Tejada - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And the same goes for the product segments. Just trying to get a better sense of what you're anticipating for Q4 and '15? William P. Donnelly: Okay. So just to be clear, the comments I made on geographies were 2015 comments. And if I make the same comments in terms of the business categories, the lab business should grow mid-single digit, with the PI business growing better than that, high single digits and probably the Core Industrial business slightly under that -- let's call it at 3%, 4% range. And that should get the industrial business also up to the mid-single-digit level. And then food retailing, it's probably got a -- at this point, it's -- a large jab [ph] could make a big difference. But we're assuming low-single digit growth for that business next year. But as Olivier and myself have said on many occasions, we're not trying to trigger growth in that business. If it happens, it happens. The key is that they are -- continue to enhance their margins and minimize their invested capital. And they did an excellent job on that this past quarter, we're expecting continued progress again next year. Rafael Tejada - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And a few other on gross margin. Just wondering, so we talked about some of the headwinds and tailwinds. But just wondering what other levers the company has to offset the volatility in currencies? William P. Donnelly: Well, we have a lot of ongoing margin enhancement and cost savings initiatives. I make a couple of specific comments here. We should get more progress again on pricing and material cost, I commented on, we expect them to be flat to down next year. I think one of the most interesting areas of productivity is if you look at the operating expenses, we're assuming in the sales growth targets we've provided, it's really quite efficient if you take into account the 200 people being added via the field turbo program that Olivier has mentioned earlier. Both of us have been here a long time, and we've never added so many people in the front end, particularly in the Western part of the business. And to be able to do that within the confines of the sales budget we described, show you that there's a lot of cost productivity being gained in other parts of the business that allow us to fund that efficiently, fund that type of growth opportunity efficiently. And one other comment to reiterate that I maybe elaborate on something Olivier said during his prepared remarks is that in the first year as a salesman, that's probably their least productive year. And the people that we are adding as part of this program are going to help us down the road as well and get -- and naturally become more productive themselves. And it's -- so that's one of the reasons you may be sensed the excitement we have with what we started here. Rafael Tejada - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Got it. And just one final one on Western Europe. I mean, you cited good growth there with France being the exception. Can you just expand on what's going on there and whether you're anticipating a rebound? William P. Donnelly: Okay. So yes, in terms of France, they had a relatively weaker third quarter, but I would highlight, it was against a plus 7 in the prior year. So I wouldn't overdo it there. Our general view is that right now the economic condition is maybe uncertain. But if you look at it, it's -- as compared to maybe 2009 or 2012 where you had real buttoning down the hatches in Europe, we just need our customers in Europe to continue on their normal replacement cycles. And that's generally the read we have. And if they do that, we're going to get our own shares of the business. We're going to get some pricing, and we're likely get a little bit of our competitors share as well. And that should position us well in Europe. We feel like that's maybe one part of the world, probably the part of the world that we're best executing on our Spinnaker initiatives and feel really great about their ability to take what the market gives and probably a little more. Olivier A. Filliol: And on the -- specifically on France, if I look at year-to-date numbers, it's more reasonable. And in France, we have a situation where the retail business suffers because the retail that's in France overall are under quite some pressure, and we see it. But the core business for us actually does quite reasonably in France. And this is actually just proving again that the execution of the team on all of the Spinnaker programs is going actually really well. Rafael Tejada - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : And just one final one. If -- with the 4% to 5% outlook for 2015, I'm just trying to get a better sense of what you think the underlying markets are growing. Just getting a better sense of how much the components of market share gains are contributing to the company's growth? William P. Donnelly: That's always a tough number for us to kind of quantify. But within the 4% to 5%, we think that every year we're gaining some amount of basis points, whether it's 25 basis points up to 100 basis points of market share gain. And then the rest, I guess, would be in your words, the growth in the market. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Reggie Miller from Citi. Reginald Miller - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I was just -- one question for me. Maybe, Bill, could you kind of update us on where you see the plan to kind of optimize the capital structure? Where we are at with any, I guess, at this point? And maybe the kind of the steps that we can expect to see from you guys adding, I guess, going forward? William P. Donnelly: So I think maybe the first comment would be is that we've always felt that there was a lot of cash flow generation in the business, and that it was stable, stable cash flow, highly predictable cash flow. And we feel that underlying our model and kind of the -- our most promise to shareholders is that we can continue to share repurchase program and invest our full free cash flow back and return that back to them. Recently, we have updated that model to say that we have room to have some extra leverage in the business even if we -- even beyond what we would need to continue to do bolt-on acquisitions here and there. In the course of 2014, we're going to have extra repurchases in $50 million to $75 million range. I mentioned earlier on the call that we'll probably do $75 million to $100 million next year. And sitting here today, it's tough to predict. I think we have to -- it's one of these things we look at regularly. We review with our Board of Directors regularly. But I think we certainly would have room, absent a more sizable acquisition, to continue to do that for some period going forward. We would tend to think that we would be very comfortable with the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1x, and that compares to today -- or north of 1x, sorry. And today, it's about 0.7. Reginald Miller - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay, great. And maybe your thoughts on adding leverage in the near term? William P. Donnelly: I guess the leverage we would had would just be these incremental repurchases. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : Olivier, could you talk about the service business. You brought that up a little more, I think, than usual on this earnings call. Is service giving you a little more pricing leverage, customer retention and higher growth than perhaps where you were in past years? Olivier A. Filliol: So services is going up in our total mix. And today, we have service and consumables together which is about 30% of our total revenue. Service has above group average profitability. So it's certainly, from a financial standpoint, very attractive for us. And then there is this additional strategic benefit that you alluded to, which is we get excellent customer access. It's a great tool for us to understand when customers are thinking about new project or thinking about replacing and upgrading the instruments. So it's a driver also for our product sales. And in that sense, we very much like to expand our penetration for -- with service of our installed base and selectively actually also of competitive installed base. And however, to grow service really needs many different efforts. It's not just adding service technicians, it is really understanding the installed base, developing additional value proposition for our customers on service. And then going off within opportunities to different channels. So point of sales, we need to sell service contracts, but we need also to activate telesales to go back to the installed base that is not yet under contract. And we have also quite a few dedicated sales service specialists that go visit big accounts and to sell bigger service contracts. I feel really good about all these programs that we have around the world. And the results, over the last few years, actually confirmed that we're on the right track. In parallel, what we're also doing is harmonizing our service offering across the world. In the past, every country had their own service products, their own service pricing and their own value propositions. We are more and more harmonizing that also in the context of our promotion program, and the money or the benefit that could cause to do so. So it's kind of a pre-investment for the future that we are in the middle in. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : On [indiscernible] I will just conclude, on 2015 guidance, could you -- did you mention what growth rates would be? And added to that, service would be above that level, is that correct? Olivier A. Filliol: Yes, we expect service to grow above the group average. And that is above the product's growth rates, yes. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to management. Mary T. Finnegan: Thanks, Kyle. Thanks, everyone, for joining us tonight. As always, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to give us a call. Take care. Good night. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Dustin, and I will be your audio coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn our presentation over to your hostess for today's call, Ms. Mary Finnegan. Please proceed, ma'am. Mary T. Finnegan: Thanks, Dustin, and good evening, everyone. I am Mary Finnegan. I'm the Treasurer and responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo, happy you are joining us tonight for the call. I am joined here by Olivier Filliol, our CEO; and Bill Donnelly, our Executive Vice President. I need to cover just a couple of administrative matters. This call is being webcast and is available for replay on our website. A copy of the press release and the presentation that we will refer to is also available on the website. Let me summarize the safe harbor language, which is outlined on Page 1 of the presentation.

I will now turn the call over to Olivier. Olivier A. Filliol: Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter are on Page 2 of the presentation. We are pleased to end the year with very solid broad-based sales growth in the fourth quarter. Local currency sales increased 6%, above the expectations we outlined with you the last time we spoke. Europe's growth was better than expected and it's particularly impressive given the very strong growth in the year earlier period. Americas continues to perform quite well and Asia/Rest of World also had solid growth. For China specifically, sales growth was on target with our expectations. Our margin enhancement and cost control initiatives continue to yield benefit, which contributed to our margin improvements and EPS growth in the quarter, this despite currency headwinds. While there is economic uncertainty in certain regions of the world and recent currency movements will create greater headwinds than we had expected, we feel good about our outlook for 2015. I will have some further comments on 2015 later on the call, but now will turn it to Bill to cover the numbers. William P. Donnelly: Okay. Thanks, Olivier, and hello, everybody. Sales were $697.4 million in the quarter, an increase of 6% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased by 2% as currency reduced sales by 4% in the quarter. Turning to Page 3 of the presentation. We outline sales by geography. In the quarter, local currency sales increased by 6% in both Europe and the Americas, and increased by 5% in Asia/Rest of World as compared to the prior year. For China specifically, local currency sales increased by 1% in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. The next slide provides full year sales, which increased 5% in local currency. By region for the year, sales increased by 5% in Europe, 6% in the Americas and 4% in Asia/Rest of World. Turning to Slide #5, we outlined sales growth by product line for the quarter. Both laboratory and industrial increased by 6% in local currency, while food retailing was up 4%. For the year, which is on the next slide, laboratory sales increased by 6% in local currency, industrial sales by 4% and food retailing by 2%. Turning now to Slide #7, let me walk you through the key items in the P&L. Gross margins were 56.5%, that's 160 basis point increase over the prior year margin of 54.9%. We're obviously very pleased with this increase, which was driven by the benefit of pricing and lower material costs. Specifically, net realized prices increased by about 230 basis points while our material costs declined by 270 basis points. R&D amounted to $31.3 million, a 7% increase in local currency, while SG&A was $186.8 million, an increase of 8% in local currency. Higher variable comp and increased investment in our field organization were offset in part by cost-saving initiatives and lower employee benefit costs. Adjusted operating income amounted to $176.3 million in the quarter. That represents a 7% increase over the prior year amount of $165 million. Our operating margins were 25.3%, an increase of 120 basis points over the prior year. We estimate that currency reduced operating profit growth by about 3% or $4.5 million in the quarter, while foreign exchange hurt operating profit by 3%. It actually helped our operating margins by 40 basis points. This is because the percentage impact of currency on the sales line was larger than the impact on operating profit. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $7.6 million in the quarter, while interest expense was $6.9 million. Our effective tax rate continued to be 24%. Fully diluted shares for the quarter were $29 million, which is a 4.4% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted earnings per share was $4.24 per share. That's an increase of 11% over the prior year amount of $3.82 per share. Currency proved to be a greater headwind than we expected, reducing adjusted EPS by approximately 3% in the quarter. Our guidance had assumed a 2% currency headwind on EPS growth. On a reported basis, EPS was $4.17 per share as compared to $3.63 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes pretax restructuring charges of $1.5 million or $0.04 per share, which is primarily employee-related costs. Reported EPS also includes $0.03 of purchased intangible amortization. The next slide provides details on full year 2014 results. Specifically, local currency sales increased by 5%, while operating profit was up 7% and adjusted EPS grew by 11%. We're particularly pleased with the operating margins, which exceeded 20% for the full year, and for the full year currency reduced EPS growth by about 3%. Now let's talk about cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter amounted to $107.8 million, a 26% increase on a per-share basis as compared to the previous year. We continue to benefit from good working capital management. In particular, DSO improved 3 days to 40 days as compared to the prior year. We're very pleased with the level of DSO. ITO ended the year at 5x. For the full year, free cash flow was excellent. It amounted to $343.5 million as compared to $284.6 million in the prior year. This is a 25% increase on a per-share basis. Importantly, it represents a 100% net income conversion, a level we're very pleased with. Now let's talk about guidance. Forecasting is challenging as several factors need to be considered this quarter and for 2015. First, we're coming off a strong finish to 2014 with sales growth and margins better than expected. Second, we continue to feel very good about our market position and our execution. Third, we are well on track with our field turbo program, which will meaningfully increase our front-end resources in 2015. And offsetting these positive influences is increased uncertainty in the global economy and greater volatility in foreign exchange and financial markets. It's difficult to determine at this stage what impact this volatility and the uncertainty will have on customers' decisions around equipment replacement cycles and new investments. With this as a framework, let me cover the specifics. We expect local currency sales for the year to be in the range of 4% to 5% -- local currency sales growth to be in the range of 4% of 5%, in local currency. That's unchanged from the last time we spoke. As you are aware, we're facing greater currency headwinds, however, to earnings growth. We now expect currencies to reduce adjusted EPS by about 4% as compared to a 1% headwind that we outlined on our last earnings call. The 2015 currency headwinds includes the benefit of the foreign [ph] exchange contracts that we disclosed on our press release the day the National Swiss Bank removed the Swiss franc floor to the euro. The hedges were put in place to mitigate our forecasted Swiss franc versus euro exposure in 2015 and to a lesser degree, our forecasted exposure in 2016. While the Swiss franc versus the euro is our largest currency exposure, we have many other currencies which have moved against us since November. In addition to the 4% EPS currency headwind in 2015, as the hedges roll off over the next 2 years, we'll face an additional 1% EPS headwind in 2016, an additional 2% in 2017. Of course, all these estimates assume rates do not change from today's levels. That gives you some additional color on currency. With respect to our guidance, we now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $12.70 to $12.90, that's an increase of 8% to 10%. A couple points worth highlighting in this guidance. First, this reflects a growth, excluding currency, of 12% to 14%. Our previous guidance that we gave in November was a growth rate of 11% to 13%. This incremental earnings growth, the 12% to 14% as compared to the 11% to 13%, reflects the first steps we are taking to offset the medium-term headwinds from the Swiss franc. Now turning to the first quarter. We would expect local currency sales growth to be in the range of 4% to 5%; we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.13 to $2.18, that's a growth rate of 7% and 9%. Currency is more of a headwind in Q1 as we expect EPS to be reduced by 5% in the quarter as compared to 4% reduction for the full year. One additional comment on currency for your models. We expect currency to reduce sales growth for the full year by approximately 7%. For the first quarter, we would expect that amount to be about 8%. Okay, let me make some final comments on guidance before turning it back to Olivier. We've provided you with our best estimates for 2015, but acknowledge we face more unknowns today than we might have in the recent past. Currency rates, in particular, are very volatile and there are questions on economies in various regions throughout the world. I know there is a tendency for you guys to move to the top end of our guidance range. I think given the uncertainty and volatility we described, it's prudent to take our guidance as a range. That's it for my side. And now I want to turn it back to Olivier. Olivier A. Filliol: Thanks, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions and then I will make some additional comments on currency, and also provide an update on our key strategic initiatives for 2015. Lab increased 6% in the fourth quarter with most product lines showing good growth. For the full year, Lab sales were also up 6%. We continue to execute quite well in our laboratory business. The combination of strong product pipeline and Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives. I expect results in 2015 to continue to be solid in Lab. Industrial increased 6% in the quarter. Product inspection grew 4%, which was modestly lower than we had expected due to timing of certain orders, but represents good growth considering very strong sales in the year earlier period. For the full year, sales in product inspection were up 6% and the outlook for this market is favorable given the focus on brand protection in general, and food safety in particular. We are well positioned in this business with strong relative market share, the most extensive product portfolio and the largest service network in the industry. We expect product inspection to continue to have good growth in the coming years. Core industrial was better than expected with a growth of 7% in the fourth quarter with good growth in all regions. For the full year, core industrial increased 4% and we would expect low single-digit growth in this business for 2015. Finally, retail was up 4% in the quarter with very strong growth in Europe, offsetting a decrease in the Americas due to the timing of project-related activity. For the full year, local currency sales and retail increased 2%. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Local currency sales in Europe increased 6% in the quarter, better than we expected. We had solid growth in laboratory, product inspection and core industrial and very good growth in retail in the quarter due to the timing of project activity. For the full year, Europe increased 5%. We will face strong competitors in Europe this year and are cautioned -- cautious given recent news. However, we continue to execute very well and are capitalizing on our Spinnaker sales and marketing initiative and strong product pipeline in this region. Americas had another good quarter with sales growth of 6%. Lab, product inspection and core industrial did very well. For the full year, sales were also up 6% in the Americas. Our outlook for Americas remain solid. Asia/Rest of World increased 5% in the quarter. China came in as expected with a 1% sales growth. We had good growth in our core laboratory offering in China, while industrial was down slightly in the quarter. For the full year, sales were up 1% in China. In general, China remains on track with our expectations. We remain cautious given the overcapacity in certain segments but expect better growth in China this year, principally, due to easier comparisons. One final comment on the quarter. Service had excellent growth in the quarter with revenue up 11% as compared to the prior year. For the full year, local currency service revenue increased 8% with good growth in all the geographic regions and in most product lines. We are seeing the results of our investments and initiatives to globalize and harmonize our service offering. We are pleased with this strong finish to the year and expect continued good growth in service. Let me now cover the topic of currency. Specifically, the strengthening of the Swiss franc, principally against the euro. Historically, these currencies were tightly correlated, which provided a natural hedge for us. With the financial crisis in 2009, this correlation began to weaken and we began to take steps to reduce our core structure in Switzerland. The actions by the Swiss National Bank in establishing a floor provided us time to take actions, which included moving our logistics hub to the Netherlands, shifting certain IT resources to Poland and moving certain back office functions to Poland and India. Now with the January move by the Swiss National Bank to abandon the floor, we will need to take additional steps to reduce our cost structure. We will utilize sourcing changes and further control of discretionary expenses to help mitigate the impact in the short term. On a longer-term basis, we are reevaluating our cost structure to determine what additional actions we can undertake. The advantages of having the foreign currency hedges in place for this year and in 2016 is that it provides us time to determine the best course of action. That is probably all I want to cover on this topic at this point, but we will provide additional insights as our plans are formulated and communicated internally. Let me now update you on some of our key strategic focus areas for 2015. First, progress on our field turbo program is quite good. We covered the details on our last call, so I won't take too much time on this topic today. As a reminder, we expect to add about 200 front-end resources over the next 12 months also. Hiring and training are underway and we are optimistic that the growth opportunities can be realized. We also have plans to expand the program late in 2015 if the market environment continues to improve. Our Spinnaker sales and marketing programs continue to generate tangible paybacks. Our sales and service organizations have their detailed plans for marketing campaigns for 2015 and I'm happy with the level of lead generation. A current focus under our sales and marketing umbrella is the formation of a group leads nurturing factory. This is a small team that supports sales organizations in nurturing cold leads. Automated e-mail marketing campaigns are designed and then follow-up is done once the lead has moved from cold to warm status. We are leveraging sophisticated lead scoring and routing methods that allow us to have very personalized e-mail content and activities. The nurturing factory was created in the fourth quarter of last year and our pilot work in this area indicates that we can meaningfully improve cold leads that we convert to warm potential. This allows us to focus our sales force on higher value leads, thereby, raising their effectiveness. And now the focus area in 2015 is sales territory optimization. We are providing more central support to our local units in terms of analyzing sales target potential, classifying accounts in terms of ABC potential, developing non-visiting customer campaigns and optimizing service technician activities. This is a lot of blocking and tackling, but we feel that it must be constantly done to ensure sales force optimization. At the same time, we are also enriching our contact database. The Spinnaker sales and marketing focus in areas in 2015 will help to further improve our sales and marketing efficiency. Turning to our technology leadership. Our new product pipeline is more robust than ever. For example, by the end of this year, we will have replaced and/or upgraded approximately 75% of our lab balance product portfolio. This includes upgrades to our high-end balances, which we undertook last year and will include upgrades to our basic weighing offering later this year. We're also introducing a new entry level moisture analyzer, which is specifically targeted to emerging markets. Moisture analyzers are primarily used in food industry to control manufacturing processes and ensure optimum product quality. With this new offering, we provide basic functionality at cost effective price. As emerging markets continue to focus on food quality, we felt it was an opportune time to upgrade our offering in this product category. Product inspection is another product area with meaningful new product launches. Last year, we began to launch of our new generation checkweighers, the C3000 system. It provides highest throughput and performance and most accurate high-speed weighing available in the market today. It has a very robust solid frame, yet a flexible design that allows it to be adapted into almost any packaging line. Comprehensive diagnostic tools enhance uptime and strong return on investments. And we have incorporated best-in-class safety features that put customers well ahead of current requirements. Initial customer response is strong, and reinforces our reputation as a leader in this market. We are also launching our new generation of metal detectors, the Profile Advantage. This instrument incorporates a breakthrough technology that is up to 50% more sensitive than our previous offering and this is essentially effective in the more challenging food applications. This is critical, not only to support compliance with food safety standards, but also to further enhance brand protection. Importantly, because of reduced validation requirements, it increases manufacturing uptime, thereby, also offering strong return on investments for food manufacturers. These are just a few examples of many new products we will have in 2015. We recognize the importance of technology innovation to reinforce our market leadership position. Our margin initiatives also remain well on track. We had good pricing results in 2014 and expect continued momentum in 2015 with a target of 150 basis points of pricing. A lot of work goes on behind the scenes for our pricing success and I'm confident it will continue this year. Our supply chain continues to benefit from the additional integration and transparency gained from Blue Ocean. Material costs were down approximately 2% in 2014, and I would expect material costs to be down again in 2015. Finally, we are increasing our focus on reducing the complexity in our product development processes. We are still in the early phases of this initiative, but expect over time to gain efficiencies by driving more standardized processes for R&D and engineering. That concludes our comments for today. Let me summarize key messages for 2015. Our momentum remains pretty good, but we are cautious on the global economy as pockets of uncertainty exists. In particular, our performance in Europe ended the year on a strong note despite some weaker economic data. Emerging markets are showing improvements, but are still below their long-term growth potential. Overall, however, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to gain market share by capitalizing on our field turbo investments, our ongoing sales and marketing programs and a strong product pipeline. Our continued focus on margin enhancement initiatives, combined with our strong cash flow generation and share repurchases should continue to drive earnings growth in 2015 and beyond. I want, now, to ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tim Evans with Wells Fargo. Timothy C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Would you be willing to comment a little bit on your tax rate expectations and share repurchase expectation for 2015? And I guess, I'm just thinking here that with significant foreign exchange headwinds, just want to make sure that we're modeling the operating margin correctly, so kind of trying to back into that. William P. Donnelly: Sure. So in terms of the tax rate, you can expect it to be at around the same 24%, absent some changes in tax legislation. The reason for that has to do with our -- maybe that's -- I don't mean to make it too complicated, but our tax strategy moves a lot of money to the manufacturing side as a general statement and this should -- so the mix of income won't change that much in that sense, and we have income growth. So that would be the first comment. Then the second comment was with regard to the share repurchase program. Our free cash flow for the full year next year is in the, let's call it, $350 million range. I think you can assume we'll repurchase somewhere in the area of $450 million to $475 million. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Olivier, just in terms of your outlook for next year, I mean, you seemed to exit with a lot of momentum in the fourth quarter, yet it sounded like some of your commentary might suggest that you're perhaps incrementally more cautious. I mean, what are your leads in quoting activities telling you about Europe right now? And how would you characterize, I guess, the level of confidence in the outlook? Olivier A. Filliol: The team actually feels good. And early indicators that we have also continue to be good. I think the comments that we made about uncertainty is definitely coming from the economic environment in general and some recent events that took place in Europe, but also currency related things that could have an impact on the economy. But looking at what we see internally, actually I remain very positive. I commented before how well the team executed in Europe last year on all the sales and marketing initiatives, and I continue to be very bullish on that end for this year. And I certainly also expect that the field turbo will start to kick in and help us. So everything that we control, I feel very positive. The part that we don't control brings the cautiousness in my statements. S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : On the new product pipeline, I mean, should we think about that as being accretive to the top line? And if I think about just lab balances in general, I mean, are new product launches enough to drive a replacement cycle? Olivier A. Filliol: The way you need to look at all this new product, there are always enhancements to previous products that we have, so in that sense we are not creating new product categories. This new product allow us to further distance ourself from competition. It allows us to raise prices, it allows us to win market share. But this doesn't happen overnight and it's not that we launch a product and then we immediately see it in the top line happening, it's happening over time. And I'd say, it's part of the strategy to outgrow the market and to increase our margins. And the fact is, however, that I feel really very strong about our product portfolio overall. We have done a lot of investments over the last few years to upgrade and so we have a very modern and a very advanced product portfolio. I mentioned before, lab, for example PI is also very strong. This is an enable for us to work -- to win the market shares. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight, Janney Capital. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : I sense, Bill, when you said the range, you said is a real range this time. And I guess, Olivier, your comments on the outlook, is this 80% related to the currency volatility in the world? Or are there signs within backlog that it's just not growing? Any fundamentals that most of us in New York don't see? William P. Donnelly: Maybe I'll start and let Olivier. So I think the first comment it is more kind of walking you through the kind of the EPS roll, let's call it. So you -- we beat the consensus and guidance in the fourth quarter by about $0.09, I believe. And we added that to the 2014 previous guidance. Then we subtracted off this incremental 3%, that headwind that we had from how currencies moved since November. And then we reduced that for the fact that we're already got to start doing some actions. And I think, which we maybe can't tell you today every single one of those actions that are going to add up to that leap we have. And so therefore, we think it's important in that sense that, hey, there are some margin in -- there's more than the normal Mettler 5, 10, 15 margin enhancement. We've got a little extra here because of the currency headwind in that sense. That maybe be the first comment. Second comment would be that from a backlog perspective, we do have more backlog entering 2015 than we did entering 2014. I -- maybe you would make the distinction that the one interesting piece that's maybe that's not true for is our Chinese business as we talked about little bit on the last quarter. They've been kind of closing out some of the larger jobs and so they have a little bit less. While their short-term business has been holding up well, we have less of the big project piece. But overall, I'd say, because the short cycle piece is the main one driving kind of current activity and the short-cycle piece all looks pretty good. And then the last thing is we always talk to you guys about our business as a replacement business. And we like when our customers have a stable financial markets, stable currency markets, stable business. And they're likely going to continue on their normal replacement cycle. So anytime we see increasing uncertainty and increasing volatility in these markets, we're always get little bit more cautious in terms of what's that got to mean for some of our customers in terms of how they think about their replacement cycle, how they think about their investment plans. To connect that to what Olivier said, if we look in our business today, backlog's good, leads look good, competitively, we feel very strong, product portfolio is going well, field turbo program's off to a great start. But there is the customer considerations and we'll have to see how this thing plays out over time. I -- we thought a lot about the guidance and we felt that, that added wording I gave you was appropriate. But I don't want to be overly dramatic about it either, Paul. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : With this 4% growth in the year, what's the growth rate within service, consumables and software? William P. Donnelly: The software piece is relatively a small number. So it's probably not worth adding that piece, but maybe I'll let Olivier comment on the... Olivier A. Filliol: Yes. And the way we look at software is really part of the solution that we sell with the hardware. We hardly have any software-only revenue. But coming back maybe to service, so service had an 8% growth in the quarter, really good. And actually, also for the full year was very strong. And consumables was actually also good overall. I am definitely very pleased as I made comments before, we have made pre-investments over the last years in service. We have invested heavily in harmonization, we have developed new service product, we have invested in additional service sales, campaigns, but also resources. And they paid off nicely and in that sense, I expect that service will continue to do better than product sales and in that sense I have also a good confidence for 2015. But the 8% growth in last quarter was really exceptionally strong. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : On China, I realize the easing comps are part of the tailwind that you expect for 2015. But I was curious if you could maybe identify any specific end markets where you're starting to feel a little better? Or at least have a line of sight on better orders? William P. Donnelly: So maybe a couple areas, we would -- hey, maybe right now to talk about orders, I wouldn't give you any, I think it would be misleading -- imply, I could name a couple of large orders. But I think they wouldn't be material in that sense to our overall results. But in terms of where we expect either continued good growth or in some cases, improved growth, I would highlight, in particular, we think Lab will have another good year. Lab grew double digit for us in China in 2014. We would be surprised if it didn't grow at least high single digits and probably will grow double digits again in 2015. Our process analytics business, I would highlight in particular, had -- we had talked about it with you guys in the past that they had a double digit decline in 2014 in part due to some environmental regulation benefiting earlier years. Our expectation is for good growth there in -- we think, high single digits, double digit kind of growth in the process analytics business for next year. Maybe the big piece of the business, the one that accounts for about half of our business in China is our industrial business. We do think that the easier comps are going help the industrial business. We think that if that business even grows low single digits next year -- sorry, this year, 2015, that should mean our overall business grows in China mid-single digits, hopefully, even better. But let's just call it mid-single digits for now. And we think that, that's a reasonable expectation given comps and other considerations. But we are alert to -- it's the more -- it's the most economically sensitive piece of our business down there, and there are some good signs some months, some bad signs other months, in terms of Chinese industrial. But we continue to think '15 will be a better year than '14 in terms of our China business and we think we can grow mid-single digits. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay, that's really helpful. And then just second item was on pricing, you had, obviously, very strong 2014, realizing some solid price. Was curious what was baked into your guidance this year, more or less versus 2014. And as part of that equation, was curious if you can talk a little bit about on the gross margin line. How should we think about the flow through of lower oil prices through your cost of goods and what are the combination of pricing and lower oil prices might help the gross margin story for this year as well. William P. Donnelly: Okay. So in terms of our gross margin, we'll have continued expansion on a constant currency basis. And in terms of on a -- and that will be, what's the word I'm looking for, even elevated a little bit because of the impact of foreign exchange. So we talked on the call earlier, Isaac, that there will be a 7% top line shrink due to foreign exchange. So part of the offset of that, because obviously, the impact on OP is not as much, is on the cost of sales line. So maybe it's best to speak in constant currency terms. So maybe if I start with pricing, we had built in about 150 bps into pricing. I think that we -- that's a little less than what we had in 2014, in part driven by an environment with less inflation to talk about, which makes it a tougher discussion with our customer base. We are going to certainly use pricing as one of the -- pricing will have to be one of the things we'll work hard on to help to offset some of the currency headwinds we see overall, but I think it would be difficult to quantify that at this stage. Maybe with regard to your comment on raw material costs, probably the biggest impact of lower oil prices to us will be just a little bit less gasoline cost for our service technicians. I'd maybe highlight that or just as a reminder, because we have actually more service technicians in Europe than we do in the United States, but maybe the gasoline price reductions that we see in the United States are not the same in Europe in euro terms. But we will get some benefit there, I think, Mary and I had estimated earlier, may be in the range of $0.5 million to $1 million. Now maybe if I think about, like, oil in terms of resin cost and things like that, it really won't be material. But as Olivier's -- that item won't be material -- but as Olivier said, material costs overall, we should be able to get them down, I think, in the range of maybe 1% at this stage, hopefully, 1.5%. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. James Clark - Evercore ISI, Research Division : This is James Clark on for Ross. Just a question on Europe, it sounds like you continue to see a bit of a mismatch between your business and some of the macro headlines we're seeing come out of the region. I guess, I'm wondering if you could give some details on maybe Lab balances and core industrial, some of the other businesses where you tend to see a bit of a lead with the macro changes? William P. Donnelly: So hey, in terms of our European business, as mentioned, we did quite well. I think 6% is an excellent number. I think in particular, if you think about the fact that within that number is Russia, which was down around 20%. I think excluding Russia, I think our European business was up in the range of 7%. Then in terms of maybe the breakdown, we had, in the fourth quarter, good growth in all the businesses, including even good growth in the retail business. We had a good year in retail actually, in Europe, with some projects in the first quarter of '14 and some projects still being delivered in the fourth quarter as well. But overall, a good year. So hey, I don't have -- I'm kind of literally looking at product line growth in Europe in total and we didn't have anybody worse than 3% and we had a couple of double-digit guys. So I think pretty solid numbers up and down the line in Europe. Olivier A. Filliol: It's actually worth to mention, we had this 6% growth against a strong previous year comparison. Actually, in Q4 2013, we had 8% growth in Europe. So it is just reinforcing the point that the team executed actually really well and executed well across all product lines and across also service. James Clark - Evercore ISI, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then, maybe a follow-up, I think, you guys spent some time talking about some of the levers you have to offset the impact of the FX headwinds. I'm just sort of wondering how you think about some of the investments you've laid out, whether it's new products or the field turbo programs or the growth of the service business, how do you think about those priorities relative to areas where you can potentially cut back and try to offset some of the headwinds through FX? Olivier A. Filliol: I look at these 2 things really separate. One is the offensive measures. The offensive measures like the investments in field turbo service sense [ph] one in really capturing the weight -- the growth weight. We have talked in about it at previous occasion. I feel that there is reasonable momentum in the market and I want to make sure that we capture that momentum and it's the opportunity for us to selectively invest in the front end for that. This is not impacted by this currency situation and we want to make this investment, we want to make the investment in the franchise. On the measures around FX, this is -- we have a couple of things that we need and want to do really short-term and this is related to purchasing supplier based and the pricing topics that Bill was talking and then selective discretionary spending that we have. But all of these should not have any impact on the growth-related initiatives that we have. And then, the more long-term things are more structural that should also not have an impact on the growth momentum. It should also not have an impact on our product pipeline. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : The -- just out of curiosity, is the weaker currency environment for some other countries causing some of your competitors to be more aggressive, particularly since you're raising prices in some areas? Olivier A. Filliol: I would say, out of Europe, I'm not so concerned. I think, in general, these are disciplined and reasonable competitors. In general, I would also say, most of our competitors don't have that high profit margins. So I don't think they will take advantage of the situation and be particularly aggressive. I haven't seen that in the last few years. The ones that we need to watch a little bit are the Japanese competitors that we have, we call maybe in Japan, for example, and it's the one in market where we have a local competitors for our Lab product. So there we have [indiscernible] separate situation where our pricing power is impacted by the local competitors. And then, for the product inspection business, we have some Japanese competitors that also operate globally and particularly in rest of Asia that we need to monitor. But here, I'm not worried that this will negatively impact our market shares across the globe. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Great. And I was writing and I sort of missed it, but could you revisit your comments about what happens in '16 and '17 when the hedges roll off? I believe you said a 1% EPS hit and 2% EPS hit? William P. Donnelly: So -- yes, next, we'll have, again, all things staying equal, the impact of the hedges rolling off, because we have a little less of '16 hedged than '15, is 1% headwind in '16 and then another 2% when all the hedges roll off by the end of '16, so into '17. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : And that's on the EPS line, not on the top line? William P. Donnelly: Correct. That's an EPS comment. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And so always impressed that you sort of you take advantage of situations and are proactive and do this and you clearly had plans in place to move some of your other manufacturing and some of your infrastructure around out there. So could you just refresh us in terms -- our memory in terms of what you're certainly manufacturing for [indiscernible]? How much you still have to move, just some comments on some of the actions you could potentially take on those and just how much more there is to go? William P. Donnelly: Hey maybe just to give you kind of some ballpark numbers, and I want to make sure I say these right way. So let's say, our net operating expenses in Swiss francs are in the area of CHF 280 million -- CHF 255 million. Yes, CHF 255 million. And I -- there's some things, I pick the examples like clearly, our supplier base in Switzerland will, if we have an alternative supplier in euro, he suddenly became 15% more cost effective. And there are other things we can do in areas like printing and stuff like that. In terms of maybe comments around manufacturing footprint and things like that, I think that, that's premature to talk about, anything there specifically. We -- if you -- and Derik, you have seen our operations in Switzerland, it's not like we're vertically integrated there, it's high-end assembly operations, mostly on businesses where it's important to have manufacturing close to R&D. So I mean, we're continuously looking at our businesses in Switzerland and globally to become more efficient. I don't necessarily think that we feel like we need to solve this problem all within the confines of Switzerland. It's a thing we'll work on as a team kind of globally and we're, as you pointed out, we're on top of it already. We spent the last few weeks talking about that. We have some answers, but not all the answers. But we're determined to continue to be a highly competitive company and so we're continuously looking at cost productivity measures. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Either Olivier or Bill, I'm wondering if you can give a little bit of color on just your growth expectations by segment for lab, industrial and food retail for this year. William P. Donnelly: Okay. Okay, so sorry, getting the right sheet in front of me. So in terms of the Lab business, we think that we had a great year in 2014 and think that it is very realistic to put up a mid-single-digit growth number on top of that. If I look at our product inspection business, we would have expectations higher than that. That should be a business that grows high single digits, whereas our core industrial business is probably going to be kind of on that borderline between low single digits and mid-single digits. But together, I think the overall industrial business should be in the mid-single-digit range. And then, as usual, we're not assuming much growth coming out of the retail business. I think we built in around 2% or something like that. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And then, I guess, as we think about the growth you highlighted in service, I mean, you've been talking for a while about the opportunity to increase the attach rate there. Is this a result of incremental investments you've made? Or how do we think about the potential going forward on that business? William P. Donnelly: We -- certainly, it's -- we're really happy with what we saw in 2014. We think we can continue to grow the service business faster than the product business, particularly in the core segments where we really want to be able to control proprietary service. And there's a lot of things we're doing from a sales and marketing perspective to make that happen in general and as part of the Blue Ocean program as well. So we hope that, that's a multi-year trend that you're going to see in the business over the medium-term that we're going to have good growth, sales growth and good profit growth within our service business. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And then on China, you've talked about the shift from infrastructure to pharma, food, biotech and chemicals. As we think about your level of investments there, are there incremental investments you need to incur throughout '15 to kind of capture the shifting growth dynamic? William P. Donnelly: I think, if you go back to some of our business exits that we did, I think that was early in '14, end of '13. Tycho, we exited some industrial businesses. We probably moved, in effect, changed out about 100 people net basis. And we really made a lot of those efforts in terms of making sure the sales force within China was well aligned to the markets you mentioned and as well, expanding our scope in the West. We think that the biggest piece to that was already done, but it will be something we'll continue to invest in going forward. And if we think about the field turbo program or our market penetration efforts that we've talked about earlier, I think you will -- that applies to China as well and we'll continue to move front-end resources in those directions and as well as product development efforts. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Olivier or Bill, was Europe above plan at that 6% local currency growth if you pull out food retail? In other words, industrial labs, do they come in kind of at plan with the upside out of food retail? William P. Donnelly: Hey, particularly, yes, -- the short answer is yes, and particularly, if you think about Russia. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay, so Russia was down 20%? William P. Donnelly: And Russia has no -- basically no retail. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. All right. And then, what portion of revenue is consumables at this point? And how did they fare in the quarter? They must have been up very high double digits. Olivier A. Filliol: So consumables in Q4 was about 6%. And in terms of growth, we are just looking it up. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. Because your reference earlier was -- service and consumables was plus 11%, service was plus 8%, so consumables had a big quarter. Is that a -- is there any trend there? Or new product driver? Or just a... Olivier A. Filliol: Hey, for example, our Pipette business did well in Q4. And of course, the Pipette business has a significant share of consumables. So I would certainly expect that this was a part of the explanation. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay, okay. William P. Donnelly: And I could confirm what Olivier said, and as well, our sensor business and a number of other areas. I think if I look at the full year, maybe a little bit less in the fourth quarter, but if I look at the full year numbers, for example, our Quantos consumables also had a good... Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay, okay. And then, In terms of the field turbo program, I think the target was to add 200 people, I think, by the end of calendar '15. And so maybe, can you just update us, I mean, how far along are we in terms of adds there, kind of front-end adds you speak? And then also, is that weighted to -- initially weighted to any geography or product line? Olivier A. Filliol: Let me take the second part first. So we -- this time, we do this actually really globally, it's not just emerging markets. We go off to under penetrated markets and where we feel we can win market share. So there are adds in Europe as well as in Americas. When I look at Europe, it's certainly particularly weighted with Eastern Europe, you have Turkey and some other countries, but it's not just emerging markets. We also did a couple of investments in mature markets. And then, we look at product categories, we focus on product categories with the highest profitability. So you would certainly see lab, product inspection and process analytics getting an overproportionate number of these resources. Service is also part of it that we certainly invest. Then there is a few additions that are cross business. For example, we invest more in key account management and there, we typically cover multiple divisions. In terms of progress, actually we have, on a regular base, we have these dashboards that show us the progress. We had the last one in December. And I was actually pleased to see that we have actually made progress already in recruiting on on-boarding people. And I do actually expect that we will be slightly ahead of the plan in terms of having these people on board. So when we said we will do it throughout 2015, I wouldn't be surprised if we have a very big majority on board by mid of the year. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then just lastly, Olivier, any opinion on -- competitive opinion on Sartorius. Finally they sold their industrial tech division to a Japanese company that quite frankly, I hadn't heard of before. But it wasn't -- it's not been too bad to compete in that space against Sartorius. Do you think -- any thought there? Olivier A. Filliol: I think actually, it will not really impact our strategy and our position. I think actually, it's not obvious that the strategy of that business will change to the new owner. And in that sense, I feel extra comfortable that we will continue to win market share here in that situation, too. So yes, I don't have strong feelings or worries about it. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Reggie Miller with Citi. Reginald Miller - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Just wondering, for the front-end investments that you're putting together, I was just wondering if you had a sense of when we can kind of see that materially impacting the top line? Olivier A. Filliol: So typically it takes 6 to 8 months before we have sales that covers cost. And if I said before, that it will take us until the mid of the year to really have the team on board. We would expect maybe late this year to start to have an impact. But to reach the full potential for salespeople, it can easily take 3 to 4 years. So I expect us to benefit from that, hopefully, in 2016 and 2017. So in that sense, it's one of the reason why we talk about investments in the midterm. Reginald Miller - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. And the kind of order timing issues that you discussed for the retail group in the Americas, when do you expect to realize that in '15? Olivier A. Filliol: I think it was more related to product inspection where we said there was a little bit of a timing thing. I wouldn't read too much into that. We talk here about lead times of a few weeks, so it might have moved a little bit, but this is not so material. Operator : And we seem to have no further questions at this time. Do you have any closing remarks? Mary T. Finnegan: Hey, thanks, Dawson [ph], and thanks, everyone, for joining us tonight. Of course, if you have any questions or any follow-up, please don't hesitate to give us a call. Have a good evening, everyone. William P. Donnelly: Bye-bye. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect.",

My name is Leanna and I will be your audio coordinator for today. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn our presentation over to your hostess for today's call, Ms. Mary Finnegan. Please proceed, ma'am. Mary Finnegan : Thanks Leanna and good evening, everyone. I am Mary Finnegan. I am the Treasurer and responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo. I am happy to have you join the call today. I am joined here by Olivier Filliol, our CEO and Bill Donnelly, our Executive Vice President. I need to cover just a couple of administrative matters. First, the call is being webcast and is available for replay on our website. A copy of the press release and the presentation that we will refer to is also available on the website. Let me summarize the Safe Harbor language, which is outlined on page one of the presentation. Statements in this presentation, which are not historical facts, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 and the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please see our recent Form 8-K. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed under the Factors Affecting Our Future Operating Results in the business and Management's Discussion and Analysis of financial condition and results of operation in our Form 10-K. Just one last item. On today's call, we may use non-GAAP financial measures. More detailed information with respect to the use of and differences between non-GAAP and the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided in the 8-K. I will now turn the call over to Olivier. Olivier Filliol : Thank you, Mary and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter are on page two of the presentation. We had local currency sales growth of 5% in the quarter with strong results in the Americas. We also performed well in Europe and are very pleased with the growth in this region, particularly given the strong comparisons from the previous year. Our industrial business in China has proven more challenging than expected, but our lab and retail business in China did quite well, as did most of the other regions in Asia and rest of world. With the continued benefit of our margin enhancement and cost control initiatives, we again generated good growth in EPS of 13% in the quarter and this despite currency headwinds. While economic uncertainty exists and currency will continue to be a headwind for us, we feel good about our growth prospects for 2015 and beyond. I will have some further comments later on the call, but now will turn it to Bill to cover the numbers. Bill Donnelly : Okay. Thanks, Olivier and hello, everybody. Sales were $535.7 million in the quarter, an increase of 5% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales decreased by 3% as currency reduced sales by about 8% in the quarter. Turning to page three of the presentation, we outline sales by geography. In the quarter, local currency sales increased by 7% in the Americas, 2% in Europe and 5% in Asia and rest of world as compared to the prior year. Two areas that underperformed in the quarter were our industrial business in China and our Russian business overall. In China, our laboratory business did very well in the quarter but our industrial business was weaker than expected with a decline of approximately 22%. As a result, local currency sales growth in China declined by 7% in the quarter. Russia was down by 40% in the quarter, which impacted our growth rate in Europe. looking at Europe, excluding Russia, we had a growth of about 4.5% in the quarter. Turning to slide number four, we outline sales growth by product area for the quarter. Laboratory was strong with an 8% increase in local currency sales, industrial increased by 1% and food retailing increased by 5% in the quarter. Turning now to slide number five, let me walk you through the key P&L items in the quarter. Gross margins were 55.8%, a 270 basis point increase over the prior year margin of 53.1%. We are very pleased with this increase. Currency contributed approximately 100 basis points of the increase including the benefit of the gain on the Swiss Franc, Euro hedges that we discussed earlier this year. Pricing, volume, material cost reduction and mix all contributed positively to the margin improvement. These improvements were offset by investments in our field service organization. R&D was $28.5 million and that was a 2% increase in local currency. SG&A amounted to $173 million, which is an increase of 8% in local currency. Increased investments in our field sales organization as well as higher variable compensation and employee benefit costs were the primary contributors to the increase. Adjusted operating income amounted to $97.3 million in the quarter and that's a 7% increase over the prior-year of $91 million. We estimate that currency reduced operating income by $3.5 million and that was a 4% headwind to our operating profit growth. Our operating margins were 18.2%, that's a 170 basis point increase over the prior year. Margins benefited by 70 basis points due to currency as a percentage impact of currency on the sales line was larger than the impact on operating profit. We are very pleased with the underlying margin improvement of more than 100 basis points on a apples-to-apples basis. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization was $7.5 million in the quarter while interest expense was $6.7 million. Other income was $817,000 and that includes currency gains. Our effective tax rate continues to be 24%. Fully diluted shares for the quarter were 28.8 million, which is a 4.4% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted earnings per share was $2.25 cents, an increase of 13% over the prior year amount of $2.00. Currency reduced earnings per share growth by approximately 4.5%, on track with what we outlined to you last quarter. On a reported basis, earnings per share was $2.19 per share, as compared to a $1.93 in the prior-year. Reported EPS includes restructuring charges of $0.02 per share and $0.04 of purchased intangible amortization. Now turning to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter amounted to $41.3 million, a 27% increase on a per share basis as compared to the prior year. We continue to benefit from good working capital management. In particular, DSO improved three days to 45 days as compared to the prior year. We are pleased with this level of DSO and our IPO also, which remained at 5.0. Let me now turn to guidance. Forecasting continues to be challenging as we have several factors to take under consideration. First, we are very pleased with our continued strong performance in both the Americas and Europe. We believe we are operating well in both of those regions and are continuing to gain share. Second, we are well on track with our field turbo program that we discussed with you last quarter. As a reminder, this is a program which will meaningfully increase our field resources during 2015. Offsetting these positives, however, is caution regarding certain emerging market countries, but especially our Chinese industrial business. Demand in our industrial business in China declined 22%, as I mentioned, this quarter. Weakness was seen in most end markets and product categories. We were disappointed in the results and now believe industrial sales in China will be lower in 2015 than we discussed with you last quarter. The factors facing this business, which we have been talking to you about, namely overcapacity in certain sectors, reduced level of government projects and foreign direct investment in a weak export market are taking longer to resolve than we had originally anticipated. It is clear that demand pulled back meaningfully to begin this year. We now believe China will be down for the full year with good growth in lab, offset by industrial decline. We would expect some improvement in the second half but it will not be enough to turn around our slow start to the year. Let me elaborate on two items in particular. One, this decline came relatively quickly and was broad-based. There was clearly a pullback in CapEx for our type of products in recent months. Q2 will not be better and we expect declines in our Chinese industrial business to continue into the second half of the year. The second point we want to make is that we see no evidence that the competitive dynamics have changed. We have studied international and Chinese competitors and see no signs of different performance. On the one hand, we take some comfort in this, but we are also disappointed in our Chinese results and are seeking to return to our above market growth. Olivier will have some additional comments on China in a second. With that backdrop, let me cover some of the specifics. Principally due to the weaker than expected results in our industrial business in China as well as our Russian operations, we now expect local currency sales growth for the full year will be at the lower end of our previously provided sales guidance of 4% to 5%. At the same time, we are raising the bottom end of our range by $0.05 and now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $12.75 to $12.90, which is a growth of between 9% and 10%. Adjusting for currency, it represents a growth of 13% to 14%. We are incorporating our Q1 beat into our updated guidance but this is offset to some degree by the reduction in the midpoint of our sales guidance. Now turning to the second quarter. We would expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 4%. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of between $2.75 and $2.80, a growth rate of 7% to 9%. Currency will reduce EPS growth by approximately 3.5% in this quarter. One additional comment on currency for your models. We expect currency to reduce sales growth for the full year by approximately 7% and for the second quarter, we would expect currency to reduce sales growth by approximately 9%. Okay, that's it from my side and I want to turn it back to Olivier. Olivier Filliol : Thanks, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab did very well in the quarter with local currency sales growth of 8%, which was on the top of good growth in the prior year. Analytical instruments, pipettes and process analytics did particular well, but we had growth in all product lines. In terms of regions, Americas and Asia and Rest of world did very well and we had growth in Europe too. We continue to benefit from our sales and marketing programs and strong product pipeline. Our industrial business was up 1% in the quarter with product inspection up mid-single digits and core industrial down low-single digits. We had particularly strong growth in industrial in the Americas. Retail came in a little better than expected with growth in the mid-single-digits Now let me make some additional comments on geography. Americas continues to perform very well. We had very strong growth in lab and industrial. Growth reflects the strong economy in the United States as well as good performance by our team. As mentioned earlier, we are very pleased with our growth in Europe, particularly given the strong comparisons from a year ago and headwinds due to the downturn in Russia. We had good growth in most regions in Western Europe. Eastern Europe was down driven by Russia. We expect Russia to continue to be a drag on sales growth in the near-term. With respect to China, I am very pleased with our lab business, which was up double digits. We are well positioned in this business and market demand appears robust. You heard from Bill, the weakness we are currently seeing in our industrial and the outlook for China for the remainder of this year. I think it's worth mentioning that we continue to feel very good about China overall and our Chinese industrial business specifically in the medium to long-term. We are competing well and maintain solid market position in this region. Furthermore the long-term dynamics remain very favorable. Specifically, the growth in GDP and GDP per capita will lead to more consumption of packaged foods, pharmaceutical and cosmetics as well as greater attention to consumer safety. Furthermore, the government's determination to transform the economy and focus on quality of growth is driving more commitment to science and continue to increase in the number of scientists graduating. Finally, we expect overall quality related regulation to continue to increase. All these factors are positive for our China business, particularly our lab business, but our industrial business as well. We expect China to be a source of above average growth in the future. We have talked a lot about China, but let me also comment on the rest of Asia. We have very strong performance in India, Southeast Asia, Korea and Australia and that strong performance will continue. Our Asian franchise and Asian teams are strong and we see the good long-term opportunities. One final comment on the quarter. We are pleased with growth in service and consumables which grew 6% for the quarter. I mentioned last quarter that our product pipeline is more robust than ever. I have a couple of additional examples to share with you this quarter. Last month, we launched our new generation of mid-range balance portfolio. These instruments are used daily in research labs, quality control and manufacturing for a wide variety of daily applications and tasks. The new generation of balances focuses on simplifying daily weighing tasks through built-in applications and a weighing guide to improve productivity. Our proprietary weighing cell and expanded warning features helps to ensure accurate results and is also fully traceable. The instrument is intuitive to operate and has a unique user-friendly touch screen which is almost twice the size of anything in the market today. We expect good traction in the market with this introduction. We also had an important launched recently on the industrial side, our new multifunctional terminal. This new generation of midrange terminals has a larger higher resolution display with enhanced user interface. It helps improve productivity through a more powerful workflow, improved connectivity and enhanced data management. Unique in the industry, it also has the capability for remote services port via a secured connection in compliance with ISO standards. Particularly in the manufacturing of high-value items such as active pharmaceutical ingredients, the avoidance of down time and proactive notification of potential weighing system inaccuracy is critical. Monitoring sensors and our remote capability allows managers to be notified when something in the weighing process needs attention or they can establish alert for certain events such as expired calibration or if the scale weight is overcapacity. All these actions help to reduce expensive downtime risks or inaccurate weighing performance. These are just two examples that I felt worthwhile highlighting as they represent core products for both lab and industrial but also demonstrates our ability to continue to innovate in these product areas. Let me make some concluding comments and then open it up for your questions. We are cautious on the global economy, particularly the timing of the recovery in our Chinese core industrial business. Despite some weakness here, we remain confident about our full-year sales growth target and we believe we are well-positioned to continue to gain market share by capitalizing on our field turbo investments, our ongoing sales and marketing programs and strong product pipeline. We also continue to focus on margin enhancement initiatives which should continue to drive good earnings growth. I will now ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley, Steve Beuchaw : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions and bringing the new guy on the call. First, I might actually start with, let's say, the brighter side of the China market, China lab. I wonder if you think about the balance of industrial and lab in China, so number one is, is the lab business actually accelerating? And number two, Bill, maybe you could reiterate your perspective on 2016? I know you have commented before that you are more optimistic about China industrial, but if China industrial is down this year, how do we think about China industrial's relative contribution in 2016 versus 2015, just thinking about the scale of those businesses? And then I have a follow-up? Olivier Filliol : So let me take maybe the first part of the question. The first thing I want to say, we, for many years, said our Chinese business is skewed toward industrial versus our global average and what we are seeing now for a while is that the lab business is doing better than industrial and accordingly the mix start also to shift to gradually to lab and we have seen now good lab momentum for quite a while. I wouldn't say that the lab, we see an acceleration in lab growth, I would say, hey, we are continuously happy with what we are seeing. I think last year we had similar results and I do expect that this goes on in that way. And I am happy when I see kind of high single-digit, low double-digit growth for lab. I think that's a very healthy number and if it continues that way, we are happy. Bill Donnelly : So maybe a couple of more granular comments on the China industrial and then I will speak to your comments, maybe about 2016. So when we look at the numbers in our Chinese industrial business, it was interesting for us that it was pretty consistent across pretty much every customer segment, pretty much all the industrial product categories and as well it was interesting it was smaller size orders as well as larger order. So one of the takeaways from us on that last point is that there appears to be a pullback not just in new projects but in, what you would call, typical replacement cycle stuff in China as well as to a certain extent what people are adding individual instruments maybe it's a new instrument but it's into an existing lab. And I think we have seen in the past in Europe and North America what happens when people are kind of delaying their replacement cycles. We do usually get that back up. So that, in theory, should make us feel pretty good about an improving environment next year, but that being said, I think we would acknowledge both Olivier and I were surprised with how this year started. I think we were all a little bit thinking, how to look at their business with the change in how the Chinese New Year fell but then it became pretty clear when we saw how March was going to play out, that things have changed in the industrial market. So we are feeling that competitively things are in good shape. We should continue to be able to gain share there and the market will improve in part because the replacement cycle will come back a little bit and we will have easier comps. But after having a the quarter like that, it's tough to make great statements about 2016 at this stage, Steve. Steve Beuchaw : That's incredibly helpful granularity. I appreciate that. Just one housekeeping follow-up for me on the buyback. Is the parameter for the year still $450 million, $475 million? Bill Donnelly : Yes. Steve Beuchaw : Great. I appreciate it. You guys have a great evening. Bill Donnelly : You too. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Can you quantify how much you are now expecting China to be down? I don't know if we heard that. I heard you say down. Are you thinking mid single digits or more? Bill Donnelly : So it looks like it will be down in Q2, similar to what it was down in Q1. If I look at the second half of the year, it's probably going to be a few points better, but still down, Tycho. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And any thoughts on whether you use this as a means to kind of pull forward some cost actions? Just trying to figure out how you are thinking about managing the operating margin? Bill Donnelly : As you saw in the current number, I think if we look globally at our cost management programs and margin enhancement programs, they are really going well. I mean, the EPS growth there was, if you pull out the impact of currencies, was north of 15%. I think 17.5% or something like that. And so we feel like we have a cost structure that makes sense. If we look at our Chinese business and our Asian business overall, we see no reason to really do pullbacks. What we did do in China, we will continue to do this resource reallocation that we have been talking to you guys about the last couple of years where we are moving into segments that we think or moving resources into segments that we think will grow for the long term. The lab business, the product inspection business, the process analytics business as well as I am thinking about customer segments and so maybe we will have a change in the mix of resources in China, but we are committed to China. We like China for the long term. So we don't expect any overall changes in that. Olivier Filliol : Hi, Tycho. I would add that we have taken cost measures last year in China and have certainly be proactive also in terms of the portfolio and in that sense, I feel that we have the right franchise. And the second point that I would add is the Chinese business remains highly profitable for us. And so it doesn't demand the same way of cost measures as we might have in other situations when we have such sharp declines. Tycho Peterson : And then, Bill, can you quantify the pricing, volume and cost reduction contributions on margins? And are you at the point now where Blue Ocean is really starting to give you better pricing traction here in the U.S.? Bill Donnelly : So pricing was up, I believe, 190 basis points and contributed about 90 bips to the gross profit margin increase. Our material costs were down about 140 bips and that contributed a little more than 30 bips to the cost of sales. In terms of the reasons for that, certainly Blue Ocean is an enabler, but I would say that it's, broadly speaking, the program that we put around it, like Blue Ocean, is a tool that gives us certain opportunities and then we have, within the organization, pricing specialists, the front-end people working towards that on the pricing side and similarly in our manufacturing operations we have global procurement teams working with the unit procurement guys and they have some new tools with Blue Ocean to do better in category management and other ways. So I do expect that we will continue to have good price realization and continue to take down material costs, I will broadly say, at similar kind of levels for the coming quarters. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then just one last one. Olivier, can you comment on the upper tranche service attachment where you are increasing the attachment rate for service? Olivier Filliol : This is something that has been ongoing for a while and it's a journey. So this will take us many years to really get to the level that we are fully satisfied. We are doing multiple things. So we have efforts to really make it much easier for the salespeople to automatically attach the service offering to any product quote that we are doing. We are helping them with new tools that we have. We help them with new service offerings. We have been upgrading all of the marketing material across all the different channels. So with that, I mean, also on our website, print materials and all these things. And then we are working on training for the sales people and we are working on the incentives around that and we are making progress across the world on the topic, but there are still very big differences by country in terms of, this is a journey that in terms of change management, but also kind of developing it in a country. Feel positive about the progress but there is still quite a way to go before we have fully utilized or capitalized on the opportunity. Tycho Peterson : Understood. Okay. Thank you very much. Bill Donnelly : Thank you, Tycho. Operator : You next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Derik de Bruin : Hi. Good afternoon. Bill Donnelly : Hi, Derik. Derik de Bruin : Bill, superb gross margin, improved strong in the quarter. I mean I realize some of that was currency based, but how should we think about progression for the rest of year? Bill Donnelly : It is going to continue to do well. Let me give you some, so for the full year it will be, let's call it, somewhere approaching 200 bips, okay. And we did a little bit more in this first quarter, but that has a little bit to do with the impact of the hedges are kind of static number, the impact of the hedges and as the sales numbers, this our lowest quarter in terms of sales. So the impact of the hedges isn't as large, but yes I think we feel good about what we are doing. We actually, Olivier and I, reviewed the presentation with some of our front-end leaders earlier this week on the whole topic of pricing looking at some of the new tools that we are developing from an analytical perspective, but as well as tools for the front-end and we continue to come up with good ideas and reasons to think that pricing will continue to be a sustainable advantage for us and a good value driver for the company. Derik de Bruin : And I guess as we think about the hedges, when they roll off, is there any impact in 2016? Bill Donnelly : There is a smaller impact on 2016. If I were look at from a EPS perspective, think about we have 1% headwind to EPS for the piece of the hedge that roll off in 2016 and then an additional 2% for the piece in 2017. Derik de Bruin : Great. How big is Russia for you? Bill Donnelly : A couple of percentage points, Mary? And maybe includes Ukraine and Belarus or something. Derik de Bruin : Great. And also staying with Europe and some of the other emerging markets there. I mean you had really good results there. Have you have seen anything to suggest that people are delaying purchases because they don't have enough purchasing power with this currency that's come in? Bill Donnelly : I apologize, Derik We heard most of the question, but the start of that question wasn't clear. Derik de Bruin : Yes. Basically, when you look at the currency changes that are going on, it's like have people not bought things or bought less because they don't have enough purchasing power? Basically have you seen anybody slowing purchases because of the currencies? Olivier Filliol : A: Derik de Bruin : Great. Very helpful. Thank you very much. Bill Donnelly : Yes. Maybe to add to Olivier, it's kind of probably to Brazil and Russia, we would both say the impact of energy prices has probably been as big on purchasing behavior as the impact of the currencies themselves. Derik de Bruin : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Brandon Couillard : To follow up on Tycho's question there, just to be clear. Have your plans changed around the field turbo program and your hiring expectations for the back half of the year at all? Olivier Filliol : At this stage, not. Actually we are working already on additional plans. But of course, we will see a little bit how things will play out in the coming weeks and months. But I am actually optimistic that we are going to implement as we were actually planning. And we have really great ideas. The teams have further expanded their analysis to identify new opportunities and I have multiple projects that were already submitted and I am excited. In that context, maybe also want to say that the ones that we initiated late last year are progressing very well. The big majority have been recruited and are onboarded and are now in training mode. I am actually optimistic that we are going to see good impact from it. And in that sense, if things don't change, we would go on another way. Brandon Couillard : Super. And then, Bill, in terms of the outlook for the year, could you tell us what you have baked in for just service per versus product growth? Bill Donnelly : China is disproportionate and Russia are both disproportionately low on service. So our service growth is basically the same assumption that we started the year with, which is kind of a mid-single-digit kind of number. And we would expect that no reason to change that number. Brandon Couillard : Super. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro : Hi. Good morning or good afternoon, guys. Thanks. I do have a question on China. Can you talk a little bit about what you thought maybe geographically within the country over the course of the quarter? Was there any real strength difference between coastal cities and more inland China? Bill Donnelly : Maybe I think you were just asking about geographic differentiation. Isaac Ro : Yes. Just within China. Bill Donnelly : Yes. We did see some improved growth, though there is better growth, maybe in the western part of the country, but still proportionately that's a smaller piece compared to the traditional manufacturing markets of China, Shanghai, for example. We opened up our Chengdu plant this quarter. That's certainly is a nice addition, but still proportionately the west is relatively small compared to those traditional areas but there was better growth, to your question. Isaac Ro : Great. And then maybe I haven't spent as much time on the call here, but Japan just curious how things are looking there for the balance of the year? Obviously the currency has been a issue, but just fairly where is the [indiscernible] environment there? Bill Donnelly : Okay. So our Japan business was up, let's call it low single digits, but I wanted to highlight that was against the plus mid-teens number a year ago because of a project. So I would expect that number to be modestly improving as the year progressed. Isaac Ro : Got it. Thanks very much. Sorry about the background noise. Bill Donnelly : It's okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with Janney Capital. Bill Donnelly : Hi, Paul. Paul Knight : Hi, Bill. Can you hear me? Bill Donnelly : Yes. We can hear you. Paul Knight : In the past you have had cycles like pipettes, the scale business in China. Is there a couple of product lines that bear mentioning and us digging into, to kind of see or engage incremental growth for the future? Bill Donnelly : And just to be clear, Paul, you are referring to China? Paul Knight : No, not China. Bill Donnelly : I am sorry. Paul Knight : Within the portfolio of products at Mettler-Toledo. You have always been able to produce some exciting products that really contribute to incremental growth. What would you want us to look at going forward? Olivier Filliol : I want to highlight maybe that we need to have continuous product innovation and come up with new product in all the different product categories. They are important to expand our lead versus competition and it's critical also to drive the replacement business. But typically, when we introduce a new product, it benefits that product category, but for the whole group it's not so important. It doesn't really move the needle that much. And I am excited about the two products that I just mentioned on the call. No question. But they are not going to make a huge difference. But they are important for the next couple of years. So I think every time on every quarter's call I highlight two or three product innovation that we have to show to you guys how broad our innovation is and we are going to continue. Actually for the full year, we have a very nice product pipeline and launch pipeline, pretty much across all the different businesses. And yes, I feel good, i.e. for example, just remember last year we talked about inspection product that we launched and we were just talking here about earlier this week how they had really an impact this product launches. So I would have a hard time to single out one product for you here. Paul Knight : And Olivier, has your philosophy on share buybacks changed? I know you are still an aggressive share repurchaser. But are you exercising opportunistic purchases or is it a regular repurchase program? Have you changed your tactics on share repurchase? Olivier Filliol : No. We are really very steady. We are in the market every day. We don't try to time the market at all. It's really -- Mary has a program where it actually basically buys everyday. And we have in that sense a very consistent policy. Paul Knight : And then lastly, what steps are left for you, do you think, regarding mitigating currency volatility going forward? Is there anything left that you want to do? Olivier Filliol : I think we have accepted that currency volatility is probably something that we are going to face also for the future. We had significant in the recent past, in particular around the Swiss Franc. But of course, the dollar appreciation is also very real and we expect that to go on. The key measures that we take against it is first on the pricing side. We always look also on what kind of opportunities this offers and how this relates to competition, but also can we adjust or not. So we sometimes do a very targeted mid-year price increases to mitigate a currency impact. And then currency changes can also have an impact on where we locate resources and we take measures around that one. And these are typically not a quick hit, but things that we do over time. We have had, for example in recent years, programs in Switzerland to address things. And we have, for example, built up local country service organization and these are certainly things that we will continue to do in the coming years. Paul Knight : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore. Bill Donnelly : Hi, Ross. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys. This is Luke, on for Ross today. Bill Donnelly : Hi. Unidentified Analyst : Just basically, I wanted to know if you had to break up the industrial weakness in to the following pockets, how would you do it? And if this would be qualitative or quantitative? So the first one would be delays due to the corruption measures, second one would be the dislocated demand in heavy industrial materials and the last one would be the general macro malaise? Bill Donnelly : I think Olivier and I will take this one maybe together. I think the first one we would probably on the industrial side say it's the smallest one. We do see that lead times on bigger projects that the government is behind directly or through state-owned companies, maybe take a little bit longer, but I don't think of that as the biggest one and probably the other two. Olivier Filliol : Actually we see some delays but this can also be related to the leadership. The new leadership team really putting in place and all the people around the different decision-making bodies and that probably slows down things. We certainly have concrete examples that's the case. But otherwise, I wouldn't connect it to your first point. Bill Donnelly : And the second too probably is, it's tough to judge. Maybe I would lean to the second one being a little bit more because of what I commented on, with regard to the replacement cycle, but it would be tough to quantify it. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Great. And then I guess for the second one, so we have heard from a couple of players that the U.S. industrial side might be moderating. Did you guys see anything in the quarter that would give credence to that? Olivier Filliol : If I take the early indicators like leads, these quote requests and so on, I don't see supporting point. In contrary, I would say, overall it continue to be healthy. Bill Donnelly : And our second quarter looks good, which is the place where we had the most visibility. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Great. Thanks. Olivier Filliol : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Arias of Citigroup. Dan Arias : Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. Bill or Olivier, on China. I am not try to put too fine of a point on it, but is the improvement that you think you might see in the back half strictly due to comps at this point? Or are you feeling like it's still reasonable to sort of think about some actual spending improvement? Bill Donnelly : Probably mostly the former. Dan Arias : Okay. And then maybe just within the quarter, do you feel like there was any China New Year effect at all? Or was that just not even a relevant factor, given the magnitude that we are talking about? Olivier Filliol : Initially we were seeing this January, February thing and we were kind of explaining it with that. But when we had the actual results of March and visibility also about Q2, we wouldn't connected it to that. I think no, that's not the explanation. Dan Arias : Okay. Maybe just finish with share gains. You guys have been talking about this for several quarters now. So I guess maybe in which product areas or geographies are you feeling like you are having the most success with the competitive win dynamic? Olivier Filliol : I think it's very broad based. I really feel that way. Of course, the European numbers are still strong, particularly if I look on a two-year base that I feel particularly confident about that one. But actually also the U.S. numbers and for emerging markets like Southeast Asia, India and so on, I have also very high confidence. And for some of the markets, it's maybe a little more difficult because there I have less data point from competitors to really compare. But honestly it's really broad based across the different business lines and across the geographies. Dan Arias : Got it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Steve Willoughby : Hi. Good evening. Two questions for you. First, I know you started to touch and discuss a bit about the field turbo program. I was just wondering if you could provide any more color on either the returns or the production you are seeing from those hires you have already made and where that compares to your expectations for those hires so far? And then I have a follow-up as well. Olivier Filliol : So out of the program that we initiated last year, we are talking about roughly 200 front-end resources that we added throughout the world. Most of these resources, as mentioned before, are hired and onboarded and now kind of in training. So you can imagine that they start now to have some impact but it takes time until they really have here an impact that is significant to us. Typically it takes six to nine months to cover that cost and then from then on, actually we start to have a good payback. It increases actually more on a linear base then exponentially and we would typically expect four to five years until such an additional salesperson plateaus in terms of sales growth. I think that if you, kind of an indication and so it's a pre-investments, but we just break even rapidly and then having actually a better contribution in particular in the second year. Bill Donnelly : I might add, Steve, that as a reminder, we had a smaller field turbo program, including in Europe in 2013 and clearly we think part of our success in Europe and in the Americas, but particularly, Europe is partly related to that. Steve Willoughby : Okay. Great. Thank you for all that color. And then just secondly and I realize this could be partly due to timing but in the quarter I see that your debt outstanding stepped up quarter-over-quarter but you are interest expense declined. So I don't know, Bill or Mary, if you could just talk about what's going on with the debt that you are taking on and the timing of it? Bill Donnelly : So yes, there is nothing special there, It's all a little [indiscernible] for you, but we are cash flow, I mean, you know our full-year number and you know that the first quarter is typically a period of time where we are more of a net borrower, we are anyway for the full-year a net borrower because of the extra repurchases and the first quarter is the weakest quarter, cash flow wise. So with regard to its relationship to interest expense, I can't think of anything that's changing or that has changed. You have seen what we have done debt issuance wise. Steve Willoughby : Okay. Thanks very much. Bill Donnelly : Sure. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg from UBS. Jon Groberg : Hi, guys. Congratulations on the quarter. So just two quick questions for me. First, I may have missed it, Bill, but what are you expecting for pricing for the year? Bill Donnelly : So we did 190 bips in first quarter and if we can say, somewhere in the 1.75% to 2% range, I think that that's a real realistic expectation. Jon Groberg : Okay. And this quarter you hit 18% margin. Olivier, do you kind of think about the next two years or so? Do you start thinking at all in terms of an additional, as your margins get higher, an additional 100 bips of margin expansion just doesn't have the same meaningful impact on your EPS growth as it would have at 12%, 13%, 14% and you start shifting at all how you think about maybe using your cash? And I am just curious if you start to think that M&A becomes a more useful, a more productive use of your cash in terms of what you are able to do with it maybe in two or three years? Olivier Filliol : Our view on M&A really remains unchanged, in the sense that M&A is part of our strategy. I like to do M&A cases but they need to be strategically really fit into the franchise. If there are close adjacencies, if they add from a technology standpoint, or gives us an opportunity to consolidate our market position in certain country, we are going to pursue it. And it's actually much less financially driven in the sense that I say foremost strategy needs to be right and then the financial needs to be right in terms of business case and we remain very disciplined on that one. I do not foresee a change in that one, even with what you alluded to about we seeing nicely improved profitability and so I think the nicely improved profitability gives us the opportunity to further invest in organic growth. The field turbo, for example, are good examples of that. So I don't expect a change in the strategy, but I want to reinforce even that we have only done very few M&A in the recent quarters that we are very committed to it. And we are actually constantly working on cases and we have a good pipeline on the radar screen kind of cases that we try to nurture, but it's also we are now in an environment where people are willing to pay premiums for acquisitions and here we stay disciplined and so we will see how it plays. Bill Donnelly : And Jon, Olivier and I, both continue to believe that in the medium term, we can't, let's call it mid-single-digit organic local currency growth, deliver mid-teens EPS growth in a constant currency environment and we have, while the absolute margins are getting higher, we have one of our biggest programs that we have invested in to drive margin enhancement with the Blue Ocean program being an enabler. We are only roughly halfway done with that. And so there is more to come in terms of that. And then, of course, we are saying that knowing that the amortization is kicking in and that intangible asset and that will mean even better free cash flow yield in terms of our EPS numbers as well. So we think the organic -- there will be nice acquisition opportunities, but we believe that the organic financial story has many years to run. Jon Groberg : Okay. And so just to be clear, on the field turbo initiative that you talked about, Olivier, in year two or year three would you be expecting to be growing 100, 200-basis points faster than you are today? Is that how you are going to measure the success of the program? Olivier Filliol : Your numbers are high and the way I want you to look at it is, the field turbo are part of us to achieve the mid-single-digit growth that we always talking to you guys. So we are not suggesting here with field turbo that we are going to accelerate our growth and you are going to certainly see higher growth rates. Jon Groberg : Okay. Thanks. Operator : And there are no further questions. Mary Finnegan : Thanks Leanna. Thanks everyone for joining us tonight. As always, if you have any questions or any follow-up, please don't hesitate to call us. Good night. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Let me now turn the call over to Olivier. Olivier Filliol : Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter are on page two of the presentation. We continue to execute very well in the West as our [Spinaco] [ph] sales marketing programs and are now our field turbo program are allowing us to leverage our strong product portfolio to gain share. These same factors also contributed to very good growth in certain emerging markets including Southeast Asia. Offsetting the positives were continued weak demand in China, Russia and Brazil. As a result, our overall local currency sales growth 3% in the quarter, however, our sales growth excluding these three countries was 7% in local currency. We had excellent margin expansion, despite worsening currencies we delivered 9% EPS growth, 14% before the estimated impact of currencies. This is a very good result, especially in light of the weak sales in the three countries. Now let me turn it to Bill to go over the numbers. Bill Donnelly : Thanks, Olivier, and hello, everybody. Sales were $582.1 million in the quarter, an increase of 3% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis sales decreased by 4% as currencies reduced sales by 7% in the quarter. Turning to page three of the presentation, we outline sales by geography. In the second quarter, local currency sales increased by 5% in the Americas, 4% in Europe and were flat in Asia / Rest of World as compared to the prior year. As Olivier mentioned, we had three countries that under performed in the quarter and they reduced our sales growth by 4%. Let me provide some context. China sales declined 11% in the quarter, a little worse than last quarter. We had good growth in our -- we had growth in our Lab business but it was not as robust as what we saw in the first quarter. Industrial continues to be very weak in China, with sales down 22%. The rest of Asia did quite, excluding China, Asia grew by 14% in the quarter. The second area is Russia, which was down 30% on the quarter and that impacted our sales growth in Europe. Excluding Russia, Europe had a growth of 6% in the quarter, also a very good result. And finally, Brazil was down by 27% in the quarter and absent this country our business in the Americas grew by 6%. Now I would like to turn to the next slide. We show sales for the first half of the year which was 4% growth in local currency. By region for the six months sales have increased by 6% in the Americas, 3% in Europe and 2% in Asia / Rest of World. Our growth excluding the three countries is 8% year-to-date. Now I would like to turn to slide #5. We outlined sales growth by product area there and for the second quarter, Laboratory had growth of 5% in local currency, while Industrial was flat and our Food Retailing business increased by 6% in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, which is shown in the next slide, our Laboratory business has increased by 7% in local currency, Industrial by 1% and Food Retailing grew by 6%. Let me turn to slide #7 now and walk you through the rest of the P&L. Gross margins were 55.5%, that\u2019s 160 basis point improvement over the prior year margin of 53.9%. We\u2019re very pleased with this increase. Currency contributed approximately 100 basis points to the increase and includes the benefit of the gain on the Swiss Franc-Euro hedges. In constant currency our margins were up by 60 basis points. Pricing and material cost reductions further contributed to the margin improvement. These improvements were offset in part by our investment in our field service organization. Now R&D amounted to $29.8 million, that\u2019s a 2% decrease in local currency. This decline was due principally to strong growth in R&D in the prior year due to the timing of new product activity, as well as our cost efforts to increase our low cost country content within R&D. SG&A amounted to $174.8 million, that\u2019s an increase of 3% in local currency. Increased investments in our field service organization and employee benefit costs were the primary contributor to the increase. Adjusted operating income was $118.3 million in the quarter, that\u2019s a 5% increase over the prior year amount of $112.9 million. Currency was a little worse than we expected the last time we spoke, excluding the $4 million currency headwind, operating profit increased by 9% in the quarter. Our operating margins were 20.3%, that\u2019s an increase of 170 basis points over the prior year amount. Margins benefited by -- our operating margin benefited by 70 basis points due to currency as the percentage impact of currency on the sales line was larger than the impact on the operating profit line. The core underlying margin improvement on a constant currency basis was a very strong 100 basis points. I also want to point out that our incremental OP margin approached 50% before currencies this quarter. This is particularly meaningful given the investments we\u2019re making in our field turbo program. A couple of final comments on the P&L, our amortization was $7.6 million in the quarter, our interest expense was $6.9 million in the quarter and our effective tax rate was 24.0%. Fully diluted shares for the quarter were $28.5 million, which is a 4.3% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted EPS was $2.80, a 9% increase over the prior year amount of $2.57, excluding the impact of currency adjusted EPS increased 14% in the quarter. Overall, currency was 1% greater headwind to EPS than we had expected last quarter. On a reported basis EPS was $2.73 per share, as compared to $2.49 per share in the prior year. Reported EPS included a restructuring charge of $0.04 and $0.03 of purchased intangibles. The next slide provides our year-to-date results. Local currency sales have increased 4%, while our gross margin increased by 210 basis points. As a reminder, currency has benefited gross margins by approximately 100 bps, operating profit increased by 6% and our adjusted EPS was 11% growth. Excluding currencies, operating profits year-to-date have increased by 10% and our adjusted EPS has increased by 15%. Now let\u2019s turn to cash flow, in the quarter free cash flow amounted to $89.9 million. This compares to $95.7 million in the prior year. We continue to improve our DSO as compared to -- which was 41 days as compared to 43 days in the prior year. Our ITO at 4.9, compared to 5.0 a year ago. Our year-to-date cash flow is $131.3 million and that\u2019s a 6% increase on a per share basis over the prior year. Now let\u2019s turn to guidance. Forecasting continues to be challenging, particularly given the uncertainty in certain emerging markets. As we look to the remainder of the year, we have some positive factors to incorporate into our guidance. This includes that we continue to execute well on various initiatives, which are driving share gain and margin expansion, these trends should continue in the second half. Offsetting these positives, however, are very challenging market conditions in China, Russia and Brazil. We do not expect an improvement in Q3 and we cannot yet judge Q4 for those countries. In addition, currencies have gotten worse and represent a significant headwind. In the second half of the year we have a currency headwind of approximately $0.33, which is $0.08 worse as compared to the last time we spoke to you. As a result, what would otherwise be mid-teens EPS growth will be reduced by about 4.5% in the second half. With this as a backdrop, let me cover the specifics, principally due to weak market conditions in China, Russia and Brazil, we now expect local currency sales growth for the full year to be in the 3% range. We expect to offset the impact of lower sales guidance, as well as higher currency headwinds with additional margin and cost initiatives. Consequently we are maintaining our current adjusted EPS guidance range. Specifically, we expected adjusted EPS to be in the range of $12.75 to $12.90 and that represents a growth of 9% to 10%. Adjusted for currencies, this represents a growth of 13.5% to 14.5%, which is about 50 basis points higher than previous guidance. With respect to the third quarter, we would expect local currency sales growth to be in the range of 2% to 3%, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.20 per share and that\u2019s a growth of 7% to 8% and we estimate currencies will reduce EPS growth by approximately 5% in the third quarter. In terms of the impact of currencies on sales, we expect currencies to reduce sales growth for the full year by 8% and for the third quarter the same, 8%. One final comment on the guidance, we\u2019re pleased that we could maintain our full year EPS guidance of -- for -- our EPS guidance for 2015. However, given the current sales environment, I don\u2019t see a lot of upside to the current range. That\u2019s it from my side and I now want to turn it over to Olivier. Olivier Filliol : Thank you, Bill. Let me start with comments on business conditions. Lab did well in the quarter with local currency sales growth of 5%. All product areas had growth with particularly strong growth in AutoChem. In terms of regions we had good growth in all regions. We continue to benefit from our sales and marketing programs, strong product pipeline and are now seeing initial benefit of our field turbo program. Turning to our Industrial business, as a reminder, our Industrial business represents about 44% of total sales and there are two components to this business, Product Inspection which represents about 40% of Industrial, and Core Industrial which represents about 60%. Later on the call I am going to provide an update on our Product Inspection business, so let me make a few comments on Core Industrial. This business consists of selling and servicing a wide variety of weighing instruments, terminals and related software. Core Industrial is pretty evenly split between the Americas, Europe and Asia, with the Asian numbers being very weighted to China. While Core Industrial is our most economically sensitive business, we have a wide variety of end markets including food, chemical and pharma. Historically in China our Core Industrial business has a higher concentration of heavy Industrial business related to infrastructure build-out. But this is changing with the downturn experienced over the last few years. In the Americas and Europe, our Core Industrial end markets lean toward food, pharma and chemical, and most of this business is replacement. So while we sometimes have customers delay their replacement cycle, history shows that the business will come. Now turning back to the second quarter, our Industrial business was flat in the quarter, with Product Inspection up high single digits and Core Industrial down mid-single digits. We had particularly strong growth in Product Inspection in Europe, while China Industrial was down significantly. I will have some additional comments on China shortly. Finishing up the product lines for Q2, retail had growth of 6% in the quarter. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Americas continues to perform well. We have good growth in Lab and Industrial while retail was very strong. The economy in the United States is solid and we are executing well. Europe also has good growth. We had good growth in most regions in Western Europe. Eastern Europe was down, driven by Russia, which overall reduced growth rates in Europe by approximately 2%. We expect Russia to continue to be a drag on sales growth in the near-term. Let me now turn to Asia and make some additional comments on China. We continue to face very weak demand in our industrial business in China. Lab is up 7% for the first half of the year. However, the general market pullback that we have encountered this year is impacting our lab instruments sold to non-life science customers. As a reminder, more than half of our laboratory business for the group and in China as well is sold to non-life science customers. We expect to have growth in lab in China for the remainder of the year, but it will be in the low single digit range. We do not expect to see an improvement in China this year. While I would have hoped to give you a picture on when we can expect growth to return to China, I cannot at this time. Our competitive position remains strong, so when demand turns, we will be ready but our timing is uncertain. Let me also comment on the rest of Asia which had good growth of 14% excluding China. We had very good performance in Japan and Southeast Asia. Our Asian franchise and Asian teams are strong and we see the good long-term opportunities. One final comment on the quarter. We are pleased with growth in service and consumables which grew 5% for the quarter. That is all my comments on current market conditions. And I now want to spend a few minutes covering in more depth our product inspection business, which had good growth of 9% in the second quarter. This business represents about 18% of total sales or about 40% of our industrial business. The business is more concentrated in the west and customers are principally food and beverage manufacturers such as Nestle, Kraft, Tyson and also pharma companies including Pfizer and Astrazeneca. Our instruments consisting of check ways, metal detectors, x-rays, vision and sterilization solutions helped to ensure the integrity and quality of packaged items. We have the broadest product offering in the market and are a clear leader in the global market outside of Japan. The Japanese market is dominated by domestic competitors who are not as strong outside of Japan. A meaningful competitive advantage for us is our extensive service network. Our service force is several times larger, more global, and better trained than our direct competitors. Manufacturing productivity and uptime is critical for all food and pharma companies and a key consideration for them in choosing their instrument supplier. Simply put, if the packaging line is down, manufacturing stops, which is very costly. For global customers, the size and reach of service capability is an important consideration and no competitor comes close to matching our global reach. We are generally recognized as the leader in innovation and are currently in the midst of meaningful product upgrade for our x-ray instruments, check weighers and metal detectors. For example, by the end of this year we anticipate that 80% of our orders for our core x-ray instruments will be for products completely upgraded within the last three years. Across our products, we offer the highest level of sensitivity for detection and combine it with an easy-to-use interface and a design that ensures all necessary hygienic requirements for cleaning, comprehensive diagnostic tools enhance manufacturing uptime yielding a strong return on investment for these instruments. Growth drivers for product inspections are very solid, driven by concerns of product safety, brand protection and manufacturing productivity. Retailer demands and increasing regulations are forcing manufacturers to have increased precision and assurance of inspection results which is driving sales of incremental verification hardware and software. We are also seeing the first examples of the food industry applying item level sterilization to provide comprehensive traceability to the point of sales, creating demand for the sophisticated solutions, which we already sell to major pharmaceutical companies. Another trend which plays to our technology strengths and global sales and service network is an increase in mandates by CEOs of major food companies to eliminate recalls given their associated costs and reputational damage. Our x-ray products in particular, with their advanced imaging software and multi-contaminant detection capability are becoming the solution of choice to fulfill these mandates. Recall avoidance and regulatory compliance is also the principal driver for our general vision inspection business. Label information is regulated in many markets and label mix-ups and label errors are one of the principle causes of U.S. FDA recalls to give one example. Our vision solutions protect manufacturers against these problems. As mentioned, product inspection is more heavily concentrated in the west where we are increasingly seeing customers seeking to standardize globally the product inspection instruments. Our global presence and service network provides us unique advantages with these standardization initiatives. Emerging markets offer excellent growth opportunities for product inspection over the medium to long-term. A rapidly growing middle class and the associated growth of modern retail formats is increasing consumer awareness of product safety and quality and increasing the consumption of packaged foods and personal care products. This dynamic, combined with the heightened concerns around food safety and the strengthening of regional food brands, are very positive for this business. We are uniquely positioned to capitalize on this growth opportunity given our leadership and product offering including designs specifically tailored for these markets. We expect product inspection to grow above the company average over the medium term. Let me make some concluding comments and then open it up for your questions. We are cautious on the global economy, particularly the timing of the recovery in our Chinese core industrial business and our business in Russia and Brazil. We expect market conditions in the Americas and Europe to remain solid, although these regions will face tougher comparisons. We believe our excellent product pipeline, the proven success of our sales and marketing programs and potential from our field tubal program position us well for above market growth in 2015 and beyond. We also continue to focus on margin enhancement initiatives which should continue to drive earnings growth. I want to now ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you [Operator instructions] And our first question will be from Steve with Morgan Stanley, Steve Beauchaw. Michael Clerico : Hey guys. It\u2019s actually Michael Clerico on for Steve today. Thanks for taking the questions. Olivier Filliol : Hi. Michael Clerico : Hi. If we look at the 4-year outlook, it implies stability on a comp adjusted basis. So I\u2019m wondering if that puts the onus more on lab growth to carry growth throughout the year, especially in light of weaker industrial trends. So I\u2019m just wondering, given your outlook for 3% organic, what\u2019s embedded in that outlook from a segment perspective? Bill Donnelly : So if you -- let\u2019s talk about, first of all, the lab business. We should continue to still do well. So on a full-year basis, we\u2019ll be in the mid-single digits in our lab business. The product inspection business within industrial will have a good second half, probably even a little bit better than the average of the first half. The core industrial business will stay in line about with where we were, maybe slightly better but basically in line with where we were this last quarter. The retail business is a little lumpy. So it\u2019s probably the one I have the least forecasting ability on. But I would expect retail to be down a little next quarter in Q3 and up a little in Q4. Michael Clerico : Okay. Thanks. That helps. Also so \u2026. Bill Donnelly : Maybe one other way to look at it as well is geographically. And we do expect some tougher comps in Europe. So probably the Europe growth rate will come down a little bit but U.S. growth rate will come up and that\u2019s largely driven by lab and product inspection. Michael Clerico : Okay. So as you think about the China business into \u201816, as China transitions past the current 12th 5-year plan, do you see anything ahead that could kind of cause the growth rate here to reverse from the softer trends you\u2019ve seen recently? And also headed towards the end of this year, are you expecting any budget flush from the close of the 5-year plan? Bill Donnelly : In terms of the -- maybe I\u2019ll get the last part first. I don\u2019t think Olivier and I, either of us see that that would be a material topic, the budget flush. Of course there will be orders, but given our business mix, we wouldn\u2019t see that as material. Second comment would be that, you know, sitting here today a couple of quarters in a row of really tough business conditions in China\u2019s industrial business. It\u2019s kind of tough to talk about when the recovery is going to be. All of you guys know us pretty well and the comps matter. So we eventually will annualize here but whether that annualize takes place early the impact or the benefit of an easy comp starts helping us at the beginning of next year or later into the year. It\u2019s kind of hard for us to judge now. I think Olivier and I are both going there in early September, and then I think I even have one more trip down there in November. And I think we\u2019ll know more when we get on the call with you guys next time. Michael Clerico : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Knight with Janney. Bill March : Hi. This is actually Bill March in for Paul. How are you guys doing? Bill Donnelly : Good, Bill. Thank you. Bill March : First question, in thinking about the FX guidance, how do you think about the macro environments in terms of we saw a big move in the second half of 2014 and kind of a stabilization in 2Q. What\u2019s driving the weaker guidance in the back half of the year? Bill Donnelly : Maybe, I will let Mary comment on the specific currencies. It\u2019s not a big change from where we were. The second half of the year we have headwind on the Swiss franc Euro. We had headwind on the Swiss franc versus the dollar but not as much. And then the big thing is the dollar versus a bunch of small currencies for us like the yen, the Singapore dollar, Thai Baht and all that. But in terms of what\u2019s changed recently, Mary, can you answer? Mary Finnegan : Yes, sure. Bill, if you look at it, it\u2019s like as Bill\u2019s saying, versus when we last reported in May, if you look at the yen, the Canadian dollar, the Aussie dollar, the Swedish Krona, those are all relatively small exposures for us but they have all moved against us and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving this $0.08 worse that we\u2019re predicting now versus when we talked to you guys in May. Bill March : Okay. Got it. And then a follow-up to that is just thinking about operating margin, and I know you called out 70 basis points from currency. But could you point out to which segment you\u2019re really seeing a, the currency headwind, and then b, where it\u2019s more leveraged? Just trying to think about R&D spend and its percentage of sales. Bill Donnelly : Sure. Well, maybe the way to answer that is if you\u2019re okay I could tell you like percentage of where we do most of our R&D. So our number one currency in terms of R&D expense would be the Swiss franc. And then of course the next two places would be China and the dollar and of course as you know the remnibi is well linked to the dollar. Bill March : I\u2019m thinking about it just more in the context of the sequential decline in R&D, how you\u2019re thinking about R&D spend in terms of organic growth and product development? Bill Donnelly : We kind of think of it as this quarter it\u2019s maybe down modestly in local currency. It\u2019s going to be up in some of the future quarters. But it\u2019s got to be flattish overall in terms of growth rate in the 5% or just above percentage of sales. And one of the things that you guys know is with the strengthening of the Swiss franc and other topics we have been looking at ways in which we can do certain pieces of our R&D in lower cost countries. We could give a long list of examples. I think you guys have heard it on earlier calls. And that\u2019s certainly providing us increased productivity in R&D as well. Bill March : Got it. Thank you. Olivier Filliol : To illustrate this, on the industrial side we do a lot of R&D in China. And so of course we benefit from the lower cost there. Software development we have a very big team in India that is increasingly taking responsibility for that. And we are increasingly leveraging Warsaw in Poland. That\u2019s helping us for the same amount of spending to get more output, basically. Bill March : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Dan Arias with Citi. Bryan Kipp : Hi guys. This is actually Bryan Kipp on behalf of Dan. Just digging a little bit on China, I know you guys have gone into some depth. I just want to get an understanding of what you guys are seeing on the ground in terms of Tier 1, versus Tier 2, Tier 3 cities, if you are seeing any modest discrepancies or significant discrepancies amongst those? And then in conjunction with that, how is the competitive dynamic evolving there with some of your localized peers? Are you seeing them kind of get flushed out of the market, or are those guys still hanging in there? Olivier Filliol : I think you bring in an interesting aspect about the geography. Geography plays a role. I would maybe not link it too much to the tiers of the city but more the geography in the whole country. For example, the west has for us better momentum than the coastal cities. And there are certain economic zones where their development is driven also by the government that offer pockets of growth. We are actually definitely monitoring them and taking advantage and to a certain degree also moving resources towards these opportunities. So, geography plays a role but again, I wouldn\u2019t link it too much to Tier 1 or 2 of these cities. When it comes to the competitive landscape, we need to differentiate between lab and industrial. In lab, we are mainly facing global competitors. These are the same competitors that we would have in the west. I do not expect that the current environment changes very much to that dynamic. I feel comfortable that we continue to win market share against them but it\u2019s not a fundamental change. We are all facing similar challenges in the Chinese market. When it comes to the industrial world, it gets more complex because the market is very fragmented. Many of our competitors in the industrial world are local competitors, very regional competitors. And in that sense, they certainly face challenges in terms of liquidity, in terms of profitability and so on. But then they have maybe also a willingness to accept certain payment terms that we are not willing to accept, or they are accepting to price levels that we are not. So, I do not expect that there is structural changes that have long-term impacts. I also don\u2019t feel that we are losing market share if I look at the whole country for industrial. But there are certain specific situations where we might lose against a competitor, again because we keep disciplines on the financial terms for ourselves. Bryan Kipp : I appreciate the color. Can I just sneak a quick one in here? I didn\u2019t hear any strength from the consumables and service but how is your pipettes business doing on the consumable size? Is that something you\u2019re still seeing some significant growth in or you are seeing some\u2026? Bill Donnelly : Is that a China specific question? Bryan Kipp : No, broader. Bill Donnelly : Yeah. We\u2019re doing well in pipettes including consumables especially. Olivier Filliol : Actually, pipette had a very good year so far and did particularly well in Q2. I was particularly also pleased because we had an important goal life, Blue Ocean goal life for you as you might have known and that went very smooth and they delivered actually good results across the world, including, or in particular U.S. as well as Asia. So happy about that performance. And this was pipettes as well as the consumable piece. Bryan Kipp : Thanks again. Operator : And our next question will come from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Juan Sanabria : Hi. Hello. Good evening. This is actually Juan on behalf of Derik. Thank you for the question. I actually had another question on China. In this case, I guess focusing more on the customer profiles where you\u2019re seeing a lot of strong demand, in particular in the China lab business. And for what types of products. I know that you just spoke about the consumable demand but then I would be interested also as to how the instrument and the equipment demand in the China lab business is doing. Bill Donnelly : So maybe I describe it by kind of breaking down the pieces of what we sometimes refer to as our classic lab line. So that would exclude our process analytics business. So what we see is, as you know, our pipette business there is relatively small but it\u2019s growing at a year-to-date basis in the 30% range. Our AutoChem business, which is kind of the other end of the spectrum with higher end products, that\u2019s actually growing well into double digits. And then the more basic products on a year-to-date basis, balances and analytical instruments are growing. Let\u2019s call it mid-single digits on a combined basis. And maybe Anne is doing a little bit better than balances but the balance guys also have inventory in the channel there. There\u2019s a lot of distributors and I know that their inventory levels are near record lows for the balance channel. So if that gives you a sense. In terms of the business mix on that, we do maybe a little bit differently than some of the other peer group companies. Those products are not only bought by government institutions but as well from our industrial customers. And we do see the industrial piece maybe as a little less strong than what we see in the more traditional government areas. Olivier Filliol : You would also note from the numbers that Bill shared, the two businesses that are more oriented towards life science in particular are pipettes and AutoChem actually had very nice double-digit growth as the business also exposed more to non-life science markets had more of the high single-digit growth performance. Juan Sanabria : Got it. Really helpful. Thank you. Bill Donnelly : Thank you, Juan. Operator : Our next question will be from Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan. Tejas Savant : Hey, guys. This is Tejas on for Tycho. First of all, just a quick numbers question. Can you quantify the pricing, volume and cost reduction contributions to your gross margins in the quarter? Bill Donnelly : Yes, we had 230 bps on pricing. That brings us to about 210 year-to-date. And on a material cost side, we are at 240 bps and that brings us to year-to-date to about 190 bps. We had some negative mix, as well as some investments we made in terms of service technicians that kind of brought that down to the 60 basis points net number after currencies that we referred to on the call. Tejas Savant : Got it. And then in terms of just the broader emerging market theme that we have been talking about on the call, have you seen any improvement at all in the replacement cycle trends in China? And then how big are Russia and Brazil in terms of your topline? And beyond sort of the energy price issue, was there anything else that\u2019s driving the weakness in these markets? Bill Donnelly : So maybe we start with the latter piece. I guess in addition to oil prices, sanctions are hurting Russia and I guess in addition to oil prices, the Petrobras controversy is hurting Brazil. With regard to China and replacement cycle, it\u2019s a good question. I would say that because we continue to see the order mix, the declines are both in large orders and smaller orders, which tend to be more the replacement cycle. So I would tend to say we haven\u2019t seen much of a change there. It continues to be weaker. Tejas Savant : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Bill Donnelly : Hey, Brandon. Brandon Couillard : Thanks. It\u2019s Brandon in for Brandon. Good afternoon. Bill Donnelly : Yes, this is Bill for Bill here. Brandon Couillard : Bill, sticking with the China theme, could you give us the order number for the quarter? And then did you give a revised revenue outlook for the year for China? And tell me if I\u2019m wrong, but did I interpret your comments to suggest that your outlook on the lab business is somewhat diminished in the back half here? Bill Donnelly : So, sorry, just to make sure that I got it, everything you asked, Brandon was China based? Brandon Couillard : Yes. Bill Donnelly : So in terms of order entry in China I think it was -- Mary is pulling out the numbers for me. So the orders were slightly better than sales but I wouldn\u2019t read, it was not a double digit number, it was down high-single digits. I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that. In terms of our view on the second half -- I think the second part of the question was what was our view on lab in the second half in China. I do think that we\u2019re going to see the industrial companies get a little bit weaker. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily see that the second half would be worse than what we saw in the second quarter, something in that kind of range. But the fourth quarter is a relatively big piece. So, we\u2019ll probably be smarter on the fourth quarter then. And I apologize, Brandon, your middle question I\u2019m not recalling. I think you had three, right? I think I got the first and the third. Brandon Couillard : Just the guidance and bets for China overall for the full year? Bill Donnelly : So down high single digits with the second half being a little bit better overall than the second quarter. Brandon Couillard : Super. And then I think, Bill, you alluded to taking some incremental cost actions to offset the currency in the weaker China, Brazil, Russia dynamic. Could you elaborate on where those are coming from? Bill Donnelly : Hey, I think like many things at Mettler, it\u2019s just okay. We need to push a little harder on some productivity topics. So maybe some -- with us there\u2019s always a series of things in the pipeline that we\u2019re thinking about cost wise, right. Planning for cost-wise. And we just need to move a few of those things up and that\u2019s how we approach it. And then it\u2019s time to almost fill the backlog again on some cost savings ideas. So nothing -- and we\u2019re talking about a few million dollars. So, I don\u2019t want to imply that there\u2019s a major restructuring just a series of little things that we can do to enhance our margins and a few things in the pricing area too by the way. Olivier Filliol : There are a few more specific activities going on related to the Swiss franc exposure that we have, that we talked also about in the last call. These are actually progressing as planned. And in that sense, I do expect that they will help us in 2017 here, when we have further head winds. Brandon Couillard : Super. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Ross Muken with Evercore. Ross? Ross Muken : Good afternoon, guys. It\u2019s been a really interesting economic cycle, right. We\u2019re multi-years post the recession. You\u2019ve always done your business historically, it\u2019s more late cycle and yet here we are later in the cycle and the organic growth rates are kind of not what we would expect. And I think in the \u201807, \u201808 timeframe, we were in the 7s and now we\u2019re in sort of the low singles. And so as we think about how this business should perform over a cycle, how does this experience and what\u2019s gone on in the emerging markets make you think about sort of the very long-term positioning of Mettler and whether you need to be deeper on the lab side or the bet that you have made on emerging markets, how that will sort of play out? I\u2019m just curious how much you\u2019ve thought about that cyclical element and how this business is sort of pace versus what we\u2019ve seen prior. Bill Donnelly : So, first of all in terms of our views on kind of what we think about our medium-term growth rates, we continue to think we\u2019re a mid-single digit organic growth kind of company over a cycle. I think if you -- Olivier and I were explaining to the Board over the last couple of days. For us it\u2019s kind of interesting, with the exception of periods of really snapback kind of purchasing. For us to grow outside of the BRC 7%, I\u2019m not sure if I could pick a quarter where we\u2019ve grown, much less a first half where we\u2019ve done so well in those countries. Yet, of course, we all know how, what a great contributor China has been and not just China but China, Russia and Brazil have all been good contributors to our growth over the recent past. And we particularly feel that China over the next 10 years is going to be a good market for us. I think we\u2019re uncertain for it in the medium-term. In terms of the business mix that we have, I think we\u2019ve been open with you guys that we have used certain businesses as being the ones we\u2019re investing in. The ones we\u2019re investing in, in terms of things like our field turbo program, how we allocate resources in R&D etcetera. And those have been for a long time our lab business, our process analytics business and our product inspection business. And our core industrial business as well as our retail business have not -- we\u2019ve not made the same kind of investments for growth there in the future. We benefited from it in our industrial business, the whole emerging market expansion, but we continue to think that that\u2019s a business that we make excellent returns on. We get really good returns on capital. Our operating profit margin and our industrial business is frankly excellent. And we think that there are still ways to grow it, probably at rates less than the lab business but with really good returns on capital. And yes, I think that\u2019s probably the how we would answer your question, Ross. Ross Muken : Okay. So I guess, just to be clear, so you guys think, because I was just looking at the growth rates. Since like \u201809 you\u2019re averaging about 3.6%, that\u2019s what I have it over the cycle. And the last few years it\u2019s probably been in the 3\u2019s as well. And so a lot of that is the function of emerging markets. Again I\u2019m not suggesting we\u2019re going to have China in sort of this lower rate, or Brazil, etcetera, forever. But I was just more curious about the strategic level. It seems like you\u2019re certainly investing in some of those areas, but is the view that we\u2019ll probably see mid-singles next cycle? Because I guess the point is, are you guys, as you\u2019re looking at things, do you feel like we are late cycle? Because that\u2019s the part that I think a lot of us kind of struggle with, because the industrials are kind of rolling over and that would sort of signal we\u2019re late, much later in the cycle. So I\u2019m just curious, if you\u2019re strategizing if you agree with that concept that we are late cycle now, and sort of haven\u2019t really -- and that 5% is really for the next cycle, or do you see what I\u2019m trying to get at? Bill Donnelly : Yes. I can\u2019t check your math fast on the 3.6, but I\u2019ll take you at that number. And with regard to us being late cycle, we would generally say we have a series of different businesses that fit in different parts of the cycle, but we would agree overall, we have generally been a late cycle business. Of course with a late cycle is often where things are cyclically on a global basis or a regionally global basis isn\u2019t always the same as we evidence right now. Ross Muken : Yes, I guess that\u2019s the point. Maybe in developed markets you\u2019re seeing the normal cycle, but EM is just kind of we had a super cycle and now maybe we\u2019re making up for it. All right. Thanks, guys. Bill Donnelly : Sure. Operator : Our next question will be from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Richard Eastman : Yes. Good afternoon. Bill Donnelly : Hi Rick. How are you? Richard Eastman : Good. Olivier, could you possibly just touch on the lab business? When I look at how it\u2019s performed in total, year-to-date, certainly the second quarter and maybe the outlook there that you presented, it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019ve chipped in your growth expectations for lab despite the fact that, as you flagged earlier, about half of that business does have industrial or process industry exposure. And I\u2019m curious what that dynamic looks like. I mean, is kind of the pharma lab, life sciences stuff, is it growing at a little faster pace to offset the industrial, or how do you view the industrial side of lab? Olivier Filliol : This is right what you just said at the end. I see that not just in the hard facts when we looked at our revenue by industry segment, I see it also by product lines. So the AutoChem business and the pipette business is doing extremely well across the globe. Again, these are the businesses that have mainly life science content. As the business for example balances, which has a higher mix of different industries that we serve was more on the lower end of the lab portfolio in terms of growth. So this is certainly true. But I would also say the lab is very nicely benefiting from all our growth initiatives that we have, all the Spinnaker and field tube initiatives, it plays well. And lab is certainly a business that gets also more of this resource allocation and investments in additional growth because we see the market share gain opportunities. And lab has a very nice profitability. So I would say these are the key factors that help us. And last but not least, I would also say that we still have in China a business that is cued towards the industrial business. And so lab has less exposure in these markets that currently suffer under weaker economic environments. Richard Eastman : Okay. And then the second thing, really I just wanted to think for a second or two about the services and consumables side and the hardware side. In the past, we have talked about the effort to grow services and expand services and the attachment rate. And we have talked about that being a mid-single digit growth business, if not high-single digits. If I weight these about right, it seems like the hardware business in this quarter, there was some modest growth in the hardware side of the business, but that\u2019s probably fully explained for in price. Do you get price on the services side? So Bill, when you threw out the 230 bps of price in the quarter, does that apply to the services as well as hardware? Olivier Filliol : Yes. So we definitely increased prices on both. For service, it\u2019s actually extremely important because of course we need also to offset wage inflation that we have on the labor piece of service. For consumables and spare parts, there is a little bit of a different dynamic, but also there of course we increase prices. So it\u2019s both. You are right, we target an above group average growth for service, but I wouldn\u2019t say that we can expect that in every single quarter. But overall, we are on track to achieve the targets and we see that happening actually across the geographies. I would mention here that also the growth on the service side in emerging markets, including China, is actually going well. Richard Eastman : Okay. And so if I\u2019m right, the forecast maybe for hardware for this year, you\u2019re kind of really thinking about flattish type of volumes, with your core growth at 3% in local currency? Bill Donnelly : Modestly better, but yes. And maybe in some details, there is some exits we\u2019re burying in there, but that\u2019s not going to move the needle. Richard Eastman : That\u2019s how it rolls together. And then do you ever speak to or have a sense of what the vitality index might be on the hardware side in your business? Bill Donnelly : So we\u2019re running a little higher right now, but we typically are running numbers in the mid 20s on products coming -- new product introductions over the last 24 months. Richard Eastman : As a percentage of total revenue, okay. Bill Donnelly : Product revenue. Richard Eastman : Correct. Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Bill Donnelly : I was just going to say we\u2019re a little north of that right now. Richard Eastman : Okay. All right. Thank you. Bill Donnelly : Sure. Operator : Our next question will be from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. I wanted to spend a minute talking about some of the comments you made on the cost side. You\u2019re obviously trying to manage, I think, through a difficult operating environment. And if I look back at sort of the \u201808-\u201909 timeframe you guys had of course managed to do something very similar where when the topline really got pressure you guys did a great job of preserving earnings. So I would be curious like if you kind of talk a little bit about where your priorities are and trying to rein in expenses and some of those might be permanent versus sort of deferrals on future growth initiatives? Olivier Filliol : I think the two situations are very different. What we experienced in \u201808-\u201909 was across the world a decline across all the businesses and we went after really severe measures really also across the world. The situation today is much more differentiated. You have few geographies that are challenged and others that are doing well. And also from business lines, we need to differentiate. And accordingly, our response is very differentiated. Yes, we are taking cost measures in countries like Brazil, Russia and China to respond to the new situation, but at the same time we are investing in other countries where we see good growth opportunities and potential. So it\u2019s definitely not across the board that we do cost-cutting programs, but we have that in our DNA that we continuously look for opportunities to optimize the cost structures. So, for example we have lean initiatives in all the production plants around the world to improve our productivity. And what we certainly also need to respond to is to currency changes. So we have the situation in Switzerland where we have very significant currency exposure at this stage, but then also down the road when some of the hedges that we have on the Swiss franc are running out. And there we have measures that we are implementing and that will kick in over the next few quarters and helping some offset that. So in a nutshell, a very differentiated approach. We are not pulling back any investments that we feel are strategic. In contrary, I would make the point that we are heavily investing in field tubal programs independent how we are doing on a quarterly base because we feel these are good long-term investments and we really believe also that this is really going to help us next year for example. Isaac Ro : That\u2019s a really helpful context between now and then. I appreciate that. One follow-up on the capital allocation front. You guys had raised your target leverage ratios. At the same time, the stocks obviously had a pretty good run here the last year or so since you did that. So can you talk a little bit about how you\u2019re thinking around capital allocation over the back half of this year factors into your guidance and kind of your general views on where best to put your dollars? Thank you. Bill Donnelly : Isaac, we are continuing to purchase a little bit more than our free cash flow. You\u2019re correct in your statement regarding our capital structure that we think a little bit more leverage would be appropriate. And we\u2019ve always been a buyer of the stock. We buy it on a consistent basis, so you will see the same pattern in the second half of the year that you saw in the first half of the year. Isaac Ro : Got it. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question is Tim Evans with Wells Fargo. Tim Evans : Thanks. Isaac took my question there. So I will step off. Thanks. Bill Donnelly : Thanks, Tim. Operator : Our next question will be from Steve Willoughby for Cleveland Research. Rob Cottrell : It\u2019s actually Rob Cottrell on for Steve tonight. I just want to make sure that I heard you clear, Olivier. With the field turbo hiring program going on, it sounded like on the last call that you guys were committing to ramping up that effort in the second half of the year. With the reduced guidance, are you changing your thinking at all on that or are you still kind of moving forward with the hiring in the second half? Olivier Filliol : No, we are still committed. And the main reason is that we see that there are still many countries where we have these opportunities for good growth and that these investments are having good pay backs. It is, however, very differentiated. So we are -- on the one hand, we are maintaining costs, reducing costs in settling these three countries that we are seeing today as very challenging. But then investing, for example, in the US markets that we feel has a further growth potential. So the commitment is here, and we have already the development of new opportunities. We are reviewing first projects now and it will certainly be a key topic when Bill and myself will be on the better tour later in September. Rob Cottrell : Great. Thank you. Bill Donnelly : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We do have a follow-up question from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Hey, thanks. Sorry, I hopped on a little bit late. But I don\u2019t know if you had commented on kind of your efforts to increase the attach rate for service. Can you talk a little bit about how that\u2019s going and how far through that process you are? Olivier Filliol : This is an ongoing topic. I often say it\u2019s a journey. So this is not completed within a few quarters. It\u2019s going to take many, many years, progressing well. We have actually really good initiative in all major countries going on. One of the key elements of it is also having good training, good marketing programs to support the salespeople that we sell service at a point of sales. So when we sell the instruments initially. But then we have also a lot of activities after sales that where we leverage the so-called [I-base] [ph]. This is a huge effort that we have ongoing to have better transparency on the installed base. And then understanding which products are under contracts, which ones are not, and running dedicated programs to bring the maximum possible on the contract. So all-in-all, good progress but I want to really make the point that this is a journey, this is not something that happens overnight. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then one follow-up. On the inspection business, obviously a nice recovery this quarter and I know you called it out in your prepared comments. Is there anything on the regulatory front that is driving that? I know in the past you have talked about things like organic carbon testing driving demand, but is there anything new on the regulatory front that maybe drove outsized demand? Olivier Filliol : No. I think we had in the past a significant change which makes recalls for companies actually really very expensive and very complicated. That\u2019s actually the key driver today that companies really want to avoid recalls. And we see that top management, CEOs of these companies recognize that physical contamination detection is actually a key factor also to recalls, and that\u2019s driving now the increased attention to metal detection and x-ray in particular. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And at this time, there are no more questions in the queue. Mary Finnegan : Thanks, Patsy. And thanks everyone for joining us. Of course if you guys have any questions, don\u2019t hesitate to call. We are doing the call from Europe so the easiest way to get a hold of us, send me an email. We are more than happy to follow up with you tonight or tomorrow. Take care, everybody. Thanks. Bye-bye. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a nice evening.",

I would now like to turn our presentation over to our hostess for today's call, Ms. Mary Finnegan. Please proceed, ma'am. Mary T. Finnegan - Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : Thanks, Ronny, and good evening, everyone. I'm Mary Finnegan. I'm the Treasurer and responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo, and happy that you're joining us this evening. I'm joined by Olivier Filliol, our CEO; and Bill Donnelly, our Executive Vice President. I need to cover just a couple administrative matters. First, this call is being webcast and is available on our website. A copy of the press release and the presentation we'll refer to is also available on the website. On page 1, we have our Safe Harbor language, let me just summarize it quickly.

Just one last item. On today's call, we may use non-GAAP financial measures. More detailed information with respect to the use of and differences between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided in the 8-K. I'll now turn the call over to Olivier. Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter, and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter are on page two of the presentation. We continue to execute very well. Spinnaker and field turbo programs are allowing us to leverage our strong product portfolio to gain share. The Americas have particular strong growth, and Europe came in as expected. We also had very good growth in certain emerging markets. However, these strong results are masked (2:55) by weak demand in BRC; that is Brazil, Russia and China. While our overall local currency sales growth was 3% in the quarter, excluding BRC, we achieved local currency sales growth of 7%, a level which reflect the above-market growth and one we are very pleased with. We also had excellent margin expansion in the quarter. Despite the challenging currency environment, we delivered 11% EPS growth, which equates to 16% before the estimated impact of currencies. We are pleased with these results, particularly given the headwinds from currency and BRC. Most importantly, our margin enhancement and productivity initiatives are allowing us to continue to make investments in field resources, which further position us for growth in 2016 and beyond. Now, let me turn it to Bill to cover the numbers. William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : Thanks, Olivier, and hello everybody. Sales were $604.2 million in the quarter, that's an increase of 3% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, our sales decreased by 4% as currencies reduced sales by approximately 7% in the quarter. Now, turning to page three of the presentation, we outlined sales by geography. In the third quarter, local currency sales increased by 10% in the Americas, 1% in Europe, and declined by 1% in Asia/Rest of World. All of these are compared to the prior year. Overall, the BRC countries continue to underperform in the quarter and reduced sales growth by about 4%. BRC was specifically down 12% in the quarter with China down 9%, which is slightly better than we expected. Now, turning to the next slide, our year-to-date sales increased by 4% in local currency. By region, for the nine-month period, local currency sales increased by 7% in the Americas, 3% in Europe and 1% in Asia/Rest of World. Our growth excluding BRC is 8% year-to-date. Now please turn to slide number five. There we outlined sales growth by product line. Laboratory had growth of 7% in local currency. Industrial declined by 1%, while Food Retailing increased by 7% in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, as shown on the next slide, Laboratory increased by 7% in local currency, Industrial was flat, and Food Retailing grew by 6%. Now turn to slide number 7 please. Let me walk you through the key items in the P&L. Gross margins were 56.2%, that's 160 basis point improvement over the prior year margin of 54.6%. We're very pleased that increase. Currencies contributed approximately 100 basis points to the increase and includes the benefit of the gain on the Swiss franc-euro hedges. In constant currency, our margins were up about 60 basis points. Pricing and material cost reductions further contributed to our margin improvement. These improvements were offset by our investments in our field service organization. Research and development expenses were $29.7 million, that's a 3% increase in local currency. SG&A was $175.5 million, that's a 1% increase in local currency and includes increased investment in our field service organization as well as some employee benefit costs offset by our cost savings program and lower variable compensation. Adjusted operating income was $134.3 million in the quarter, that's a 6% increase over the prior-year amount of $126.7 million. Currencies reduced operating profit by approximately $6 million. Excluding this headwind, our operating profit increased by 10% in the quarter. Our operating margins were 22.2%; that's an increase of 210 basis points over the prior year. Margins benefited by 70 basis points due to currency as the percentage impact on currency and the sales line was larger than the impact on operating profit. The core underlying margin improvement was a very strong 140 basis points. Our incremental OP margins reached 60% in the quarter on a constant currency basis, which is particularly impressive given the meaningful investments we're making via our field turbo program. Now, a couple of final comments on the P&L. Our amortization was $7.8 million, while our interest expense was $7 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate continued to be at 24%. Fully diluted shares for the quarter were $28.1 million (sic) [28.1 million] (7:53); that's a 4.4% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted EPS was $3.26 per share; that's an increase of 11% over the prior year amount of $2.95 per share. Excluding the impact of currency, adjusted EPS increased by 16% in the quarter. On a reported basis, EPS was $3.16 as compared to $2.89 per share in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.07 of restructuring charges and $0.03 of purchased intangible amortization. The next slide gives you our year-to-date results. Our local currency sales have increased by 4%, while gross margins are up by 190 bps. Currency benefits gross margin by approximately 100 basis points, resulting in a strong 90 basis point core improvement. Our operating profit increased by 6%, while adjusted EPS grew by 11%. Excluding currency, operating profit has increased by 10%, while our adjusted EPS has increased by 15%, both on a year-to-date basis. Now turning to cash flow. In the quarter, free cash flow was $107.1 million, or $3.81 per share. On a per-share basis, this is a 6% increase over the prior year amount. We had continued improvements in our DSO with 41 days, as compared to 42 days last year. Our ITO was 4.8. Year-to-date, our cash flow amounts to $238.4 million, and that's an increase of 6% on a per-share basis. Now let's turn to guidance. Forecasting continues to be very challenging particularly given the uncertainty in Brazil, Russia, and China. The timing of a recovery in these countries is uncertain. Another negative factor is currency, which continues to be a headwind to EPS growth for us in both Q4 as well as next year, but particularly the first half of next year. Offsetting these factors is our ability to execute. As you see in our year-to-date results, our various initiatives to drive share gain and expand margins are doing very well. We expect these trends to continue. With this as a backdrop, let me cover some specifics. We expect local currency sales growth in the fourth quarter to be approximately 2%. Based on this sales growth, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.58 per share to $4.63 per share. Currency will reduce EPS growth by approximately 5% in the fourth quarter. Absent currencies, adjusted EPS growth in the fourth quarter is expected to be in the 13% to 14% range. Incorporating fourth quarter guidance, we would expect full-year local currency sales growth to be about 3%. Adjusted EPS for 2015 is expected to be in the range of $12.85 per share to $12.90 per share. Currencies are expected to reduce our full-year earnings growth by 5%. Absent the currency headwind, we have EPS growth of 15% in 2015. As we look to 2016, we expect market conditions in Brazil, Russia, and China to remain challenging, particularly in the early part of the year. We're not yet forecasting a recovery in these markets, hopefully some stabilization. Outside of these three countries, we expect sales growth to be solid. Our product pipeline looks strong and we continue to see tangible results from our Spinnaker sales and marketing and field turbo programs. We will also make further investments in our front-end resources in 2016. Taking all these factors together, we expect local currency sales growth to be in the 3% to 4% range in 2016. This should result in adjusted EPS in the range of $14.10 per share to $14.30 per share, which is a growth of 9% to 11%. We expect currency to reduce earnings next year by approximately 1.5%. Adjusting for this currency headwind and using the midpoint of guidance, this represents a growth of 10.5% to 12.5%. A couple of items, I think, are worth highlighting with respect to our guidance. First, our productivity and lean initiative programs are well on track and yielding very good results. This will allow us to make additional investments in front-end resources in 2016, while maintaining our expense base at a reasonable level. We're very pleased with our ability to make these important investments, which are helping to drive share gains. Olivier will have some additional comments on our field turbo program shortly. The second comment is currencies. We expect sales growth \u2013 with respect to sales growth, we expect currencies to reduce sales in Q4 by 6%, which result in an 8% reduction for the full year of 2015. In 2016, we expect currencies to reduce sales growth by about 1% for the full year. One other item related to currency. I already mentioned that we expect currency to reduce earnings per share growth in 2016 by approximately 1.5%. I want to point out that that headwind will be greater in the first half of the year as compared to the second half. I realize some of you are updating your models, and thought this would be worthwhile to point out. The third topic about next year is cash flow. We expect cash flow generation to continue to be solid and expect free cash flow per share to increase by 6% in 2016. This will result in a free cash flow amounting to $353 million. We expect to continue to make progress in working capital improvements, but will have higher capital expenditures in 2016 due to some manufacturing expansions we'll have underway. In terms of share repurchase, you saw in the press release that the board has authorized an increase in our authorization, as it will be exhausted shortly. And we would expect to repurchase shares of approximately $500 million in 2016. One final item with respect to guidance. Looking at the current quarterly consensus estimates for 2016, they reflect an adjusted EPS growth in the first half of more than 15%. Given our expectations for continued challenging market conditions in the BRC in the early part of the year, combined with greater currency headwinds in the first part of the year, I would not expect such a level of earnings growth. Similar to what we've done in the past, we'll update you on a quarterly basis with regard to our 2016 estimates. But I thought it was worthwhile to mention as you're updating your models. Okay. That's it for my side. And then I want to turn it back to Olivier. Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab increased 7% in the quarter, with good growth in almost all product categories. We're executing quite well in our Laboratory business. The combination of strong product pipeline, Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives, and our field turbo investments. Our Lab business does very well, and I expect results in the fourth quarter and into 2016 to continue to be solid. Industrial declined 1% in the quarter. Product inspection had growth of 3% and our outlook for this business continues to be very favorable. As we discussed last quarter in some detail, we are well-positioned in this business with strong relative market share, the most extensive product portfolio and the largest service network in the industry. We expect product inspection to have strong growth in the fourth quarter. And while they will face tougher comparisons as we get into 2016, I expect solid growth in 2016. Core industrial declined 3% in the third quarter. We had good growth in the Americas and decline in China. Europe was flat. We expect conditions in core industrial to remain challenging in fourth quarter and into first half of 2016, principally due to China. We may see some growth in later part of next year as we will benefit from easier comparisons. Finally, retail was up 7% in the quarter with particular good growth in the Americas due to project activity. Retail will be down in the fourth quarter due to timing of activity and I would expect moderate growth in 2016. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. As mentioned earlier, Europe sales growth came in as expected. We had growth in Western Europe and most Eastern European countries outside of Russian-centric countries. We do not expect much growth in fourth quarter due to prior year's comparisons, but expect to continue to execute well and further capitalize on our Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives, field turbo investments, and strong product pipeline in this region. We expect moderate growth in 2016 in Europe. Americas had an excellent quarter with sales growth of 10%. We had good growth in all product lines. While I don't expect another 10% growth quarter, our outlook for Americas is good. Asia/Rest of the World decreased 1% in the quarter and increased 9% excluding China. As Bill mentioned, China declined 9% in the quarter. We had growth in our Laboratory business in China, while Industrial was down 18%. I would expect Industrial in China to be down at similar level in the fourth quarter. Looking to 2016, we expect sales will decline but not to the level we saw in this year. Outside China, in the third quarter, we had very good growth in Australia and Korea, and good growth in India and Southeast Asia. We expect market conditions in Asia outside of China to remain solid for the remainder of this year and into 2016. Service had good growth in the quarter with local currency revenue up 5% as compared to prior year. We had good growth in all geographic regions and in most product lines. Let me update you on our field turbo program. We are very pleased with our progress and results to-date. The growth opportunities we identified are yielding tangible results, and the additional field resources are allowing greater attention and focus to our high priority accounts. At the same time, we are executing very well on our productivity and cost initiatives throughout the organization. These initiatives focused on lean manufacturing and values (19:45) productivity enhancement programs, which allow us to continue our field resource investments in 2016. We have identified targeted growth opportunities and will make a portion of the investments early in the year with additional investing as the year progresses, assuming market conditions remain favorable. Despite the challenging market conditions, we are executing very well, which is allowing us to make these front-end investments, which position us well for future growth. That is about all I want to cover on this topic. One additional update I want to provide today is on the Process Analytics business which has a great track record for technology innovation and sophisticated marketing. It has a sizable percentage of its revenue from consumables and services, approximately 40%, and has achieved above-market growth for numerous years. It represents a little less than 10% of total sales and I wanted to update you on some recent developments. Process Analytics provides in-line and real-time measurement of key analytical parameters for industrial liquids which helps pharma, biotech, and chemical companies monitor and optimize their production processes. While the total market is large, we are leader for pH, TOC, conductivity and dissolved oxygen measurements in niche (21:14) applications including ultrapure water monitoring. Our solutions combine sensor technologies with transmitters to measure specific analytical parameters. The sensors must be calibrated, maintained, and replaced on a timely basis, which creates an attractive consumable stream. We are highly regarded as the technology leader due to our unique sensor design, and our Intelligent Sensor Management software. We have the most complete product offering and most extensive field force of our direct competitors. We're also cost effective in terms of manufacturing with the vast majority of transmitters produced in China. We have recently expanded our reach with an entry into gas analytics through a unique laser-based sensor technology. This technology combined with our deep knowledge of industrial processes offers cost-effective in situ installations and chemical process applications for existing customers. We're adding gas capabilities as well as unique installation solutions to complement our product range. Power generation is another expansion market for Process Analytics. We have extended our offering for this attractive market including multi-point transmitters, conductivity, TOC and optical dissolved oxygen sensors as well as panel mount analyzer solutions for monitoring of power plant water quality. Extensive targeted marketing campaigns to end-users and panel fabricators in power and chemical markets are driving good results. We are also having success with the expansion of our TOC, or total organic carbon, portfolio. TOC is an important to ensure the integrity of ultrapure water and is especially important to regulated industries such as pharma and biotech. We now have solutions in the valued mid-tier and high-end of the TOC market. We've added a portable version as quality engineers continue to gain acceptance of online analytical measurements in pharma. In the coming weeks, we will launch a VIS (23:37) verification system, which leverages our TOC and conductivity expertise to broaden our applications in pharma. Finally, we recently completed a small technology acquisition, which further enhances our expertise in ultrapure water analysis. We will now have a laser-based technology that can detect bacteria in real-time which makes us the only company to offer all three regulated ultrapure water measurements : conductivity, TOC, and bacteria. It is sold to the same pharma customers as our TOC offering, and the ability of customers to analyze bacterial contamination in real-time is a game-changer. We have seen a similar development in TOC where the alternative is to take samples offline and analyze in the lab, with meaningful time differentials. For bacteria measurements, this time differential is typically five days to seven days, which offer significant cost savings opportunities for our customers. I have covered a lot of the technology developments within Process Analytics but want to remind you that this business was the incubator for our Spinnaker methodology for sales and marketing initiatives. Process Analytics continues to make great progress in furthering their marketing and lead generation campaigns. This marketing focus combined with additional field turbo resources and excellent product portfolio is contributing to nice share gains for this business. Let me make some concluding comments and then open it up for questions. We remain cautious on China, Brazil, and Russia, as market conditions are challenging and the turnaround is not yet visible. We are working to protect margins in these countries and ensure resources are targeted to long-term growth opportunities. Our other (25:34) businesses, which encompass (25:35) more than 80% of total sales, are performing quite well. Market demand is solid, and we are leveraging our excellent product pipeline, strong sales and marketing programs, and investment in field resources to gain share. Our margin enhancement and productivity initiatives are well on track and allow us to make the additional investments in field resources, despite weakness in China, Brazil, and Russia and negative currency headwinds on operating profit and earnings. I want to now ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : And your first question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon. William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : Hey, Brandon. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Bill or Olivier, just curious, if you could elaborate on some of the productivity and lean initiatives that you plan to tackle next year. Just in more detail give us a few examples. And just how much runway do you see on that front to be able to still fund growth investments elsewhere in the business? Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, let me say that we have these programs in place now for quite a while and there's a continuation of what we have been doing already this year. And we have lean initiatives on factory floor, where we are optimizing layouts, where we are optimizing planning processes, and we are optimizing the logistics parts between suppliers and ourselves, but also at the logistics part between the different factories. These all helped us to expand the margins. And on top of that, we always have selective restructuring projects that are helping us. For example, last year we consolidated a plant in the U.S. and there is certainly also things that we continue to do in terms of leveraging low-cost countries. We have moved one product category actually to low-end part of that product category from Switzerland to China that will help us also next year. So these are continuous things that we do, sometimes project specific and sometimes just global initiatives. And then, of course, we continue also to do things on the supply chain management, optimizing our logistics (28:26), optimizing very much our purchasing, we have a very good material price index and I expect this to go on also next year. William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : Maybe I'd add to what Olivier said, Brandon, that one of the things we're leveraging more with Blue Ocean is that having most of our plants now on the Blue Ocean system allows us to have kind of common measures and KPIs around productivity, things that get measured and get done, so we are able to drive productivity improvements in kind of solving to the best-in-class standards within the group. And then I would add on top of that that \u2013 and these are now more back office costs, we see opportunities for shared service centers. We've certainly done some of our initial shared service centers coming out of Blue Ocean but we see continued opportunities there. In general, we gain productivity, let's say, 10% or 15% when we do a shared service center just within the Western world and more than that then if we can we go to a low-cost country. And those should be good runways. We actually had a review together with the rest of GMC colleagues this week as part of our GMC meetings and one of the comments I made to the guys kind of relates to a question investors often asked me, ask of me and that's how much more opportunity do we have. The whole review of this productivity and shared service center activities, I drew the conclusion preparing for that that we still have a long runway to go. We have a lot of good ideas to continue to enhance our margins in the coming years. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. That's helpful. And then one more for you, Bill. Two things. Could you \u2013 what have you baked in for net pricing next year and then, what does your EPS outlook contemplate for local currency incremental margin? William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : So, in the first question, we're building in, I think, about 150 basis points, based on what we see today. In terms of the incremental margins, they're going to be in the mid-40%s on a constant currency basis. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : Operator, do we have other questions? Operator : We do. Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes. Good afternoon. William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : Hey, Rick. Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Olivier, could you expand just a little bit on the strength in the Lab business? Really just kind of speaking maybe a little bit to the verticals \u2013 pharmaceutical, food, just maybe where the strength was, and are there any laggards in the verticals there? Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Actually, absent of the BRC, I would say, we experienced a good growth across all product lines and actually, also across this end user segment. I think there's really good momentum. And I attribute that certainly that demand is healthy, but then the programs that we have in place are actually relatively broad-based and yield good results. So I wouldn't single out here a particular segment. If I look at the U.S. market, it has been really broad-based. And typically, when we are \u2013 when we have good results across all the product lines, that's a signal that it's not a segment-specific topic. William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : Maybe the one area would be, some of the Lab side, in particular life sciences, look good. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, okay. And then, Bill, just on the gross margin, just kind of looking at the drivers on the incrementals quarter-to-quarter, and it was pretty substantial, 75% kind of gross margin incremental from Q2 to Q3. Is that \u2013 I'm just going to surmise that that might be a mix issue, with Lab as strong as it was. But is there a way that you could give us a feel for that? William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : Yeah. Hey. I think, Rick, this is probably like a classic. You're looking at it may be slightly different than how we look at it. Actually, the way we look at it, it's always Q3 on Q3, Q2 on Q2. And if I look in Q2, actually, our year-on-year margin expansion was a little bit less in Q3 than it was on a year-to-date basis. I think the absolute sales volume is partly explaining that. If I look at the growth comparisons, Q \u2013 the two-year growth rates are maybe relatively similar, maybe slightly more in Q3, which could contribute a little bit to what you're talking about. But I... Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : I, overall, would say, on a constant currency basis, the margins were very good. Good expansion in Q3, but probably a little less than what we had seen earlier in the year. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, okay. Fair enough. And then just one last question, I mean given the outlook in China, certainly for China industrial and maybe the trailing performance there, no quick fix there from an end market perspective when you're talking about the Industrial business, and potentially a pretty long cycle downturn here. But is any of your restructuring actions targeted at China? We've talked about moving assets around a little bit, but what are you doing with the asset base on the industrial side in China? Is that stable? Are you taking that down or...? Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We have been working on resource shifting in China for quite a while. And when I say resource shifting, there is parts of restructuring, head count adjustments, reflecting the pockets of future growth that we are anticipating. So, we are adjusting. We are assessing kind of the difficulty that we have in Industrial business, and you would have seen us, already in the last couple of months, still adding people, for example, for Laboratory business and for certain territories that we see a good future prospect. As for Industrial, we have been reducing head count. So, we are proactive on that. We have started last year, and this is still ongoing. William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : Rick, maybe one \u2013 because you used the word asset. And in terms of thinking about plants, maybe the one thing I'd remind you too is, we have our manufacturing for the Chinese domestic business, which clearly has been hurt on the Industrial side. But we continue to leverage those factories in terms of moving new products there and so things that were previously manufactured in the West. So the picture, inclusive of intercompany sales, would maybe show a better leveraging that you might expect just looking at the Industrial piece of the business. I would add to that that we see some facility consolidation opportunities in China, because we didn't own all of our office space. We have some office space and things we can take advantage of there \u2013 rental spaces. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, okay. Very good. And again, given your primary global competition on the Lab side, probably more than Industrial, do you have a sense of \u2013 I mean, is more of your product sold in China manufactured in China vis-\u00e0-vis, say, Sartorius on the Lab side? Do you have a sense of that? Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would say, in general, I think, of all of our competitors, we are very advanced in leveraging low-cost countries. And, in that sense, China as a production base is certainly significantly larger for us than for our key competitors. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I see. Okay. Very good. Thank you. Thank you much. Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Hi. Good evening. A couple of quick questions for you guys. First, you made a comment about some lower variable comp here. Was that for the third quarter? And if so, why did that happen? William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : Because a year ago we raised our bonus achievement expectations in Q3 a year ago. This year, we have about the same expectation as we did a quarter ago. Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Okay. That makes sense. And then, Bill, is there any way to sort of quantifying the impact from field turbo? As of yet, I know it's still rolling out and you guys are expanding, but is there any way to quantify the revenue contribution or anything like that? William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : We struggle to be precise there because, of course, we're often \u2013 the field turbos can often be splitting territories and things like that. I think, for us, the \u2013 what's that expression about the pudding \u2013 sorry, the proof in the pudding is the growth in non-BRC. I think given global economic, we just don't think our markets are growing that fast. It very much \u2013 the outsized growth very much ties to geographies and product categories where we've made field turbo investment. So, I think, our success is in those markets is very much explained by the investments we made in 2015, but as well the ones we started in 2014. Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Okay. And then just one follow up on that then. Even in the BRC markets, is there a way to gauge how you're comparing, your growth compares to what you would consider the market would be? Are you seeing \u2013 even though the business is declining, would you say you're seeing the similar type of kind of outperformance versus the market? William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : So, hey, let's maybe exclude Brazil and Russia that we're talking in those two cases, $30 million, $40 million of sales spread across 20 product categories. So it would be wrong for me to imply we have that level of visibility vis-\u00e0-vis competition because you're talking about really small slices. In the case in China, we certainly listen to what direct competitors that would have conference calls, i.e. \u2013 e.g. or i.e., Sartorius. And we feel good about what they do as well as our local market intelligence. We see on the industrial side, a couple of our industrial competitors have gone away in China. So we think we do reasonably well on a competitive basis there as well. And \u2013 yes. Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks for all the color, Bill. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : Hey, Ross. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : I was just hoping that you could go through your expectations for margins in 2016, if you can give us like your idea what the pacing is going to be like, what the core expansion and any FX impacts you guys are expecting? William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : So, first of all, maybe we are \u2013 if you pick the \u2013 we're saying 3% to 4% top line growth with about a 1% impact due to currency with that weighted towards the first part of the year. So a little more than 2% headwind in the first quarter and about 2% in the second and about 1% in Q3 and flat in Q4. Our margin expansion should be pretty well paced with maybe the fourth quarter being slightly more than the earlier quarters. But, overall for 2016, we're looking at 50 bps. And then in terms of our incremental operating margins, we're looking at a number in the mid-40%s for the full year. And if I kind of look at the pieces, the only one that \u2013 only quarter we don't see a number in that kind of range would be a little less than that in the second quarter. And that has to do with year-end (41:49) mix topics as well as some currency topics. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Thanks. That was really helpful. I'll just hop in the queue. William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik DeBruin with Bank of America ML. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Hello. Good afternoon. Thank you for the call. So, China came in a little bit better than expected at \u2013 declining only 9% versus the 22% declines that we saw in the last two quarters. I was wondering if you could just share with us some of the dynamics as that improved in China. William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : So \u2013 and maybe the first comment just to clarify some things. So our Industrial business was down in the low-20%s in China. Earlier in the year, it was down a little less than that in the high-teens. And, correspondingly, our overall business in China was down a little bit \u2013 2% less this quarter than it was last quarter. You can see that if we're down high-teens in Industrial, but only down 9% overall, that reflects growth in areas like our Laboratory business largely. So in terms of the areas of our Laboratory business, it's \u2013 I think, overall, we have pretty solid growth. Probably the only area we didn't have good growth in Lab was AutoChem and frankly that's driven by \u2013 we're up (43:33) 135% a year ago in Lab in AutoChem. So we feel that that business \u2013 the Lab side goes reasonably well. I think I largely answered your question. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, you did. Thank you. William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Thanks. Olivier, can you maybe just give a little bit more color on growth by segment expectations on 2016. If you're going to get to 4% local currency or better on the top line, best case, would that be driven more by Lab or where do you see the strong factors (44:15)? Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me have Bill comment, because of course we model that thing. William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : Yeah. So \u2013 hey, we \u2013 Tycho \u2013 first hello, Tycho. And we should be doing mid-singles in our Laboratory business. We have, relatively speaking, a somewhat tougher comp in Q1, but the rest of the quarters should be all kind of in that range. Our PI business, product inspection, will continue to do well. We should get high-single-digit growth out of that. Our Industrial business will probably be flattish. We would expect China to again be down in Industrial, but we'll have some growth in the other parts of the world. And I would guess that that will be a little bit better in the second half of the year than the first half of the year largely due to comps in China. And, hey, our retail business is lumpy due to large projects but we're not building in a lot of growth overall, maybe a low-single-digit growth for that business. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then the bacterial contamination business that you picked up, how large is the opportunity? I mean it seems like it could be a pretty large for pharma. Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, we bought mainly a technology here that we are now improving and then bringing to the market. As always when you launch a product with the new technology, it's going to take a while until customers will really adapt to it especially because you need to address your quality systems, you need to address standard operating procedures and so on. So, while in the long-term we see it as a very nice product category very similar to the TOC, we do expect that it's going to take a couple of years. But as mentioned also in the prepared remarks, it's very synergistic and we feel we have a really great customer access, we have the right team. And so from a competitive standpoint, we feel like we have a really unique position here to leverage. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then last one, capital deployment. It was good to see the buyback step-up, maybe just if you could comment on what you're seeing from an M&A perspective, given the market volatility, are you looking at more opportunities and any appetite to do something a little bit larger and some of the smaller bolt-ons? Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: M&A strategy really remains \u2013 I'm very confident on that. As a reminder, we feel that from a strategic standpoint, there is no need at all for us to do something big. But we are very committed and very interested in doing these bolt-on acquisitions because we feel we can have a franchise that we can really leverage, if we have synergistic technology or if there are opportunities to develop a certain market access. So very committed to that, constantly looking at opportunities. We have our own radar (47:27) with a lot of targets on it. But many of these cases are not available or don't materialize in the time lines we want (47:39). I think this recent technology acquisition that we did is a perfect example of how we are committed, and we are doing these cases. When you refer to bigger deals, hey, it's not \u2013 we don't say no to it. But there are not that many targets out there that would really fit the franchise. And in essence, I'm not expecting just around the corner something big. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery Scott. William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Hi, guys. This is actually Bill March on behalf of Paul. How are you guys doing tonight? William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : Good. How are you, sir? William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Doing well. I was just hoping you could speak to maybe the potential for growth in the Food Retail segment just in light of the potential Food Safety Modernization rules coming online. William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : So, maybe to clarify a little, the Food Safety Modernization Act has more impact for us in our product inspection business, and I would describe it as kind of an indirect impact. There is already \u2013 the principal driver of our product inspection business relates to brand protection and food safety topics. We certainly view the act as positive but for most of the guys, this is a little bit catch-up for maybe 20% of the market and probably 80% of that was largely covered already in people standard practices. The Food Retailing business itself won't really have any impact due to this. William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Great. Thank you. And then maybe just to follow up on China in terms of kind of Lab. What are you seeing maybe between the first half and the second half of the year in terms of \u2013 has there been a pickup in spending? And if so, if you think that continues into 2016? Thank you. William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : Yeah. I talk \u2013 maybe could I clarify your question? You were asking about Lab in China and... William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Correct. William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : Yeah. Okay. Sorry. So our Chinese business, PI (50:05), the first quarter was our strongest quarter of the year. We would have grown a little more the last couple of quarters, except for some tough comps on our AutoChem business. But we see no reason we can't grow high-single-digits in our Lab business, based on what I see out there. William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you. Bill, just wondering if you could maybe give us an update on pricing. I think it's obviously been a successful area for you year-to-date. But could you maybe give us a year-to-date view on what that's been, and maybe what's embedded in your guidance for next year? Thank you. William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : So, on a year-to-date basis, we're up approximately 200 basis points. Very much the Lab business leading the way there, with numbers actually north of that, and our Industrial business is somehow being somewhat laggards to that. And Retail, we struggle to have global price realization in the Retail business. In terms of next year, I think that we should be able to get something in the 150 basis point range. If you're wondering why a little bit less, we did make some extra moves this year, particularly driven in countries where we wanted to push through a little bit of extra pricing because of the strong dollar. So, for example, in places like Southeast Asia, we pushed through a little bit extra price increases there, to try to make up for some of the currency impacts. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. And then, maybe a second question would be just sort of, on the China point, you guys have put a lot of color on that, I appreciate. But wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit more about which end markets were, maybe not the weakest, but maybe the strongest. I'm just kind of curious, within that 9% number, how wide the range is between your various either end markets or product areas, because I have to imagine there are some bright spots, but curious about the dispersion on what you're seeing in China. Thank you. William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : Sure. So, hey, I would describe, first of all, a bright spot would be the Lab business overall and, of course, our Lab business maybe has a slightly different mix than some of the other guys. We have a little bit less healthcare, a little bit more industrial, within our product portfolio. But, overall, as mentioned, I think, kind of pulling out the impact of some large AutoChem orders last year, we think that that can be a high-single-digit business in the coming quarters. If I look at other parts of the portfolio, actually, Retail would be an area that's been growing there. And, of course, that's being driven by the increasing GDP per capita increasing consumer spending. Our Industrial businesses continue to be weak overall, but we do see pockets of growth there in some specific product categories where we're, I think, trying to push product categories. But, hey, probably they're small enough that it's not so helpful for us to mention at this point. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understood. Thanks for all the color. I appreciate it. William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : Hello, everyone. William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : Hi, Jason. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : Looking at your forecast for 2016, what is your assumption on material costs? William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : So, material costs should be down, let's say, somewhere in the 1% range to 1.5% range. And you can kind of multiply that number by 0.3 or 0.4 to get a sense for what kind of impact that would have on the gross profit margin. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : And then, looking at China overall, did you say it was going to be off around 9% in the fourth quarter, or is that just the Industrial side? William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : I think I'd like to give it a range. But I would certainly say high-single-digits. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : And then how about 2016? William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : 2016, it's got to do better than that. If you look at our Industrial business, we would expect the levels of decline are still large, that it's got to take a few more quarters to stabilize that business. So I think the beginning of the year, you'll continue to see declines in our Chinese business overall, whether we get to a flat business or a modest growth business in the second half of the year, I'm not quite sure yet. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : And then, looking at the percentage of your products manufactured in China, you expect that to change materially next year? William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : No, not \u2013 definitely not materially, because we have, to a certain extent, that \u2013 because such a high percentage of our Chinese business is Chinese manufactured products, clearly that piece will, again, at least, decline in the first half of the year. And we have, of course, always every year, a handful of products that we're transferring there ,or activities that we're transferring there. But I wouldn't expect the overall percentage to move materially. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : And then finally, what was the number of shares repurchased in the quarter? William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : Just give me a second here. So, we repurchased 390,548 shares. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : Thank you very much William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Michael Clerico - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good evening. It's actually Michael Clerico on for Steve. You drove some good acceleration in the Americas sequentially this quarter. So I'm just wondering what's behind that growth rate and, more specifically, are you seeing any drag from weaker industrial trends, specifically in the U.S.? William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : Yeah. So, in terms of our Industrial business overall, I think the Q3 is in line with our kind of year-to-date numbers. And we would expect to have maybe some slowing in some of core industrial areas but maybe some acceleration in terms of our food safety, product inspection related businesses. Our Lab businesses in the Americas did very well in the quarter and we expect continued good performance in the fourth quarter as well. Michael Clerico - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Second question, it seems like field turbo is going well, any updated thoughts on deploying a second wave of reps? And also could you give us an idea of how long it will take the current wave to be fully ramped up in terms of productivity? Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, this year, we added about 200 field resources. This typically I do \u2013 they take a few quarters to ramp-up in terms of the first quarter you have training, onboarding, that's one. And then it takes them a few quarters to build up the pipeline. I would say, after two years, they should actually be really profitable contributing to the overall situation. And we prioritized, of course, on product categories that have the highest profitability. And so, we have both (58:30) group average contribution. For next year, I expect if things continue to go as expected in terms of market demand, to add about the same amount as we did this year. Michael Clerico - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Groberg with UBS. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, guys. I'll just follow up with you offline. Thanks. William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : Hey, Jon. You're on the line. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Can you hear me? I said (59:17) I'll just follow up with you guys offline. Thanks. William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Is this bacterial contamination detection technology that you purchased, is there any application or cross application there with your product inspection business? Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. The application points (59:56) are very different. This is really pure water analytics \u2013 totally different. The synergy is, with our (60:07) business that you might know, particularly related to TOC and conductivity measurements. These are the three measurement points that you would find in ultrapure water. For example, an application is Water for Injection. And when you have Water for Injection in pharma, you need to be USP compliant and that's the parameters that are relevant here. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. I was hoping you'd say yes. And it seems to be a big opportunity in bacterial detection on the food side. But maybe that's still to come. And then, Olivier, I was always so curious, during the third quarter, we had noticed kind of a flurry of new product introductions from old house (61:04). And I'm curious maybe that not atypical, but is there any strategic rationale for that? Was there any window open on the U.S. dollar creating any opportunities or any soft spot in the competition that worked (61:22)? Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, you shouldn't read anything into it. This... Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, okay. Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It wasn't unusual for us at all. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We have a certain strategy to expand the product portfolio in terms of leveraging the access to the channel for life science applications and so on. But that's something we have been doing over a couple of years and what you have seen more recently was actually product launches for Retail, Industrial as well as for the Lab product (61:56). Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. And then \u2013 and there's no bump in your Lab growth? That wasn't big enough, any channel fills since that goes through distribution? Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. And certainly not related to old house. No, (62:11) I don't... Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, okay. Olivier A. Filliol - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Everything kind of as usual. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citigroup. William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : Hi. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. Bill, maybe just one for me and apologies if you've touched on it when I drop off the line there, but on the outlook for next year, what are you assuming in terms of the payout from some of the efforts that you have going on in service, increasing the attach rate on service contracts et cetera? Is that something that's sort of built into guidance or is that more of the \"upside case\" so to speak? William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : We built in some additional service growth over product growth and maybe that will be short answer, Dan. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. Okay. Thanks very much. William P. Donnelly - Head of Finance, Supply Chain and IT : Have a good one. Operator : And there are no more questions at this time. Mary T. Finnegan - Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : Thanks, Ronny, and, hey, thanks, everyone, for joining us tonight. Of course, as usual, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to give us a call or send us an e-mail. Take care. Thanks everybody. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I'm the Treasurer and I am responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo, and happy that you're joining us this evening. I'm joined by Olivier Filliol, our CEO; and Bill Donnelly, our Executive Vice President. I need to cover just a couple administrative matters. First, the call is being webcast and is available on our Web site. A copy of the press release and the presentation we refer to are also available on the Web site.

More detailed information with respect to the use of and differences between non-GAAP and the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our 8-K. Let me now turn the call over to Olivier. Olivier Filliol : Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter, and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter are on Page 2 of the presentation. We ended the year with a solid fourth quarter. Market conditions throughout the world developed as we expected and I\u2019m very pleased with our continued strong execution. Growth in the Americas was very strong and broad-based. Europe had good growth in laboratory instruments, which was somewhat hidden by a decline in retail due to strong prior year comparisons. Sales in China and Brazil declined meaningfully in the quarter, while Russia\u2019s decline was modest. Growth in emerging market outside these countries was solid. Overall, we continue to gain share through our field turbo program, Spinnaker marketing initiatives and our exciting product offering. With strong execution on our margin enhancement and productivity improvement program we again had good margin expansion in the quarter. Despite the challenging currency environment in the quarter and for the full year 2015, we delivered 10% EPS growth, which equates to 15% before the estimated impact of currencies. We are pleased with these results, particularly given the headwinds from currency and certain emerging markets. Equally important, we continue to make investments for growth, which position us well for 2016 and beyond. Now, let me turn it to Bill to cover the numbers. Bill Donnelly : Thanks, Olivier, and hello everybody. Sales were $673.5 million in the quarter, that\u2019s an increase of 3% in local currency and on a dollar basis sales decreased by 3% as currencies reduced sales by 6% in the quarter. If you turn now to Page 3 of the presentation, we outline sales by geography. In the quarter, local currency sales increased by 9% in the Americas, they were flat in Europe, and declined by 2% in Asia/Rest of World as compared to the prior year. China was down 8% in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Brazil was down 12%, while we saw some improvement in Russia as their sales decline was only 1%. Excluding these three countries, we had a growth of 5% in the quarter. Turning to the next slide, we have full year sales, which also increased 3% in local currency. By region in 2015, local currency sales increased by 8% in the Americas, 2% in Europe and were flat in Asia/Rest of World, Brazil, Russia and China were down 11% in 2015, excluding these countries, three countries we had a sales growth of 7% in local currency for the full year. Turning now to Slide Number 5, we outline sales growth by product line. Laboratory had a growth of 6% in local currency, while industrial was flat in the quarter and our Food Retailing business declined 8% in the fourth quarter. Full year sales growth is shown on the next slide, Laboratory increased by 7% in local currency, while Industrial was flat and our Food Retailing business grew by 2%. Turning to now to Slide Number 7, let me walk you through key items on the P&L for the quarter. Our gross margins reached 58%, 150 basis point increase over the prior year margin of 56.5%. We\u2019re of course very pleased with this increase, currencies contributed about 80% to the increase and includes the benefit of the gain we have on the Swiss franc-euro hedges. In constant currency, our gross margins were up by 70 basis points. Pricing and material cost reductions contributed to the margin improvement. These improvements were offset impart by our investments in the field service organization. R&D amounted to $31.1 million, that\u2019s a 3% increase in local currency. SG&A amounted to $177.4 million, which is constant with the prior year in local currency. Increased investments in our field service organization and employee benefit costs were offset by our cost saving program and lower variable compensation. Our adjusted operating income was $182.2 million in the quarter and that\u2019s a 3% increase over the prior year amount of $176.3 million. Currency reduced operating profit by approximately $7.8 million in the quarter. Excluding this headwind operating profit increased by 8% in the quarter. Our operating margins were 27.1%, that\u2019s an increase of 180 basis points over the prior year. Currencies benefited margins by 50 basis points as the percentage impact of currency and sales was larger than the impact on operating profit. The core underlying margin improvement was approximately 130 bps. Incremental OP margins reached 75% before currencies this quarter, which is particularly impressive given the meaningful investments we're making in our field turbo program. A couple of final comments on the P&L, our amortization amounted to $8.0 million in the quarter. Our interest expense was $6.8 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate continues to be 24% it was slightly less in the fourth quarter and that added about $0.02 to our earnings in the quarter. Fully diluted shares for the quarter were $27.8 million, that's a 4.4% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase programs. Adjusted EPS was $4.65 per share and that's an increase of 10% over the prior year amount of $4.24 per share. Excluding the impact of currency, adjusted EPS increased by 15% in the quarter. On a reported basis, earnings per share were $4.44 per share as compared to $4.17 per share and reported EPS includes restructuring charges of $0.17 per share and $0.04 per share of purchased intangible amortization. The next slide provides our full year results for 2015. Our local currency sales increased by 3%, while gross margins grew by 170 basis points. Currency benefited gross margins by about 90 basis points, resulting in a strong 80 basis point improvement on a constant currency basis. Operating profits increased by 5%, and margins on a constant currency basis increased by 120 bps. Incremental margins exceeded 50% for the full year. Our adjusted EPS grew by 10% which reflects a growth of approximately 15% excluding currency. Now let's turn to cash flow. In the quarter, our free cash flow was $126.4 million, or $4.60 per share. On a per-share basis, that's a 23% increase over the prior year amount. We achieved further improvement in DSO which was reduced to 39 days at the end of the year compared to 40 days in the prior year. Our ITO was 4.6. Full year free cash flow amounted to $364.8 million or $12.90 per share which is an increase of 11%. We converted 100% of our adjusted net income to cash flow in 2015 and we're of course pleased with that. Now let's turn to guidance. Forecasting continues to be very challenging given the uncertainty in certain emerging market. We expect market conditions to remain soft in our China industrial business and we don't expect to achieve growth in China for the full year. Russia appears to at bottomed while Brazil has ways to go. For the rest of world, we expect continued growth but less than what we've achieved in 2015 given economic forecasts and some tougher comps. We expect continued share gains globally driven by our Spinnaker sales and marketing program, our field turbo programs and a strong product pipeline. Taken all these factors together, we continue to expect local currency sales growth to be between 3% and 4% in 2016 and our adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $14.10 to $14.30. This is a growth of 9% to 11%. We expect currencies to reduce earnings growth by about a 0.5, which represents a growth of 10.5 to 12.5 excluding currencies. This guidance remains unchanged from what we reported on our last call. Now let me turn to the first quarter. In the first quarter, we expect local currency sales growth of approximately 4% while our adjusted earnings per share should be in the range of $2.40 to $2.45 per share. We expect currencies to reduce EPS growth in the quarter by about 2.5%. Excluding the impact of currency our guidance reflects an EPS growth of 9.5% to 11.5% in the quarter. A couple of additional comments on guidance, first our sales guidance for the first quarter is at the top end of the range principally due to comparisons in China, we expect China to have flattish local currency sales growth in Q1 while for the full-year we expect China sales growth to be down low single-digits. Let me cover currency, with respect to sales growth we expect currency to reduce sales growth in Q1 by about 4.5% and reduce it for the full year by about 3%. As already mentioned, we expect currencies to reduce EPS growth in 2016 by approximately 1.5% with a greater impact in the first half of year. Finally, let me comment on cash flow, we expect cash flow to be in the range of $355 million to $360 million for the full year and we would expect to repurchase shares of approximately $500 million in 2016. Okay that's it from my side and now I want to turn it back to Olivier. Olivier Filliol : Thank you, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab finished the year strong and had a year, sales growth for the quarter was 6% and for the full year was 7%. Most product lines showed good growth. As mentioned on multiple occasions, our product pipeline is Lab is very strong they were also a major beneficiary of the field turbo program. We expect continued solid growth in 2016. Industrial was flat in the quarter and for the full year. Product Inspection grew 6% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Market dynamics for Product Inspection continue to be very good. We have strong leadership position the most comprehensive offering in the market and very strong product pipeline which positions us well for 2016 and beyond. Core industrial declined 3% in the quarter and for the full year. In the quarter, we had good growth in Americas and Europe also had growth while China declined. You can see that many peers to our core industrial business are having struggles. In this leg, we performed well and gained share. I expect more of the same in 2016, a challenging environment with us performing relatively well and gaining some share. Finally, retail declined 8% in the quarter, Americas and Asia had good growth while Europe was down due to very strong quarter in the previous year. For the year, retail had growth of 2%, we would expect retail to be up modestly in 2016 due to timing of project activity. It is worth noting that retail had record levels of profit and profit margin in 2015 so we believe our strategy for retail is sound and well executed. Now, let me make some additional comments by geography. Europe sales were flat in the quarter, in line with our expectations given the good growth in final year. I am pleased with the solid growth in lab and core industrial in Europe during the quarter. For the full year, sales growth in Europe was up 2%, overall we continued to execute well in this region and I would feel two of our investments should help us continue to gain share. Americas had another excellent quarter with sales growth of 9%. We had good growth in most product lines especially where we make field turbo investments. Our outlook for Americas remained solid and although we will have tougher comparisons this year. We expect continued solid growth. Asia and rest of the world decreased 2% in the quarter, while increased 5% excluding China. As Bill mentioned, China declined 8% in the quarter. Lab was flat in the quarter in China while industry was down 17%. The order picture was better for China lab in the quarter and we expect China labs to grow in 2016. As Bill mentioned earlier, overall we expect China sales to be down this year but not to the level we saw in 2015. Outside China, in the fourth quarter we had very good growth in India and solid growth in Southeast Asia. We expect market conditions in Asia, outside of China to remain solid in 2016. Let me make some additional comments on 2016. Last year proved more challenging that we had anticipated and it also demonstrated our resiliency and ability as we deliver solid financial results despite sizeable sales decline in Brazil, Russia and China and significant currency headwinds. Our ability to navigate the wide economic environment around the globe is a result of our long standing core strategy and our discipline in executing them. These strategies which we have talked about with you for many years are well understood and embraced within the organization. We believe that our culture has been a key differentiator for us for many years and 2015 gave us ample of opportunities to show its benefits. In 2016, you will see more of the same, that is, we are more than happy to stick to our core strategy and focus on execution when we come in everyday. Let me provide some additional details to give you a better understanding of our key priorities in 2016. And first, the field turbo program had a good start in 2015 and we expect to add another 200 front end resources in 2016. Importantly, we are funding these investments due to productivity improvement and cost measures elsewhere in the business. The investments are aimed at underpenetrated market and are yielding tangible results as evidenced by our growth in 2015 outside of Brazil, Russia and China. Adding field resources is a high leverage investment for us and particularly important given our organic growth focus. Second, our Spinnaker sales and marketing program continues to drive share and productivity gains. We are now entering the fifth wave of Spinnaker and one of the key focus areas for us in 2016 is to use data analytics to identify sales opportunities which are actionable. One example is an initiative for replacement of old products. Our installed base consisting of millions of instruments is a highly valuable asset to our franchise. Our marketing teams work diligently to clean and enrich the information stored about these instruments in our comprehensive database, called iBase. Using data analytics we can identify customers in our iBase who will benefit from having their all the products upgraded to newest generation, which can provide significantly more functionality and translate into real value for our customers. To be successful, data transparency down to the model level needs to be extracted from the iBase and targeted marketing campaigns developed. We support this initiative through Telesales Resources, we have added to our field turbo program. Key account management is another key priority for our Spinnaker marketing programs in 2015. We\u2019re further developing our top 100 key account program with the focus on further penetrating key customer in food, pharmaceutical and chemical industry. As the market leader, we have a wide range of product and service solutions and a large direct salesforce presence has enabled us to be a true partner for our global customers with diverse needs in many locations. Third, you have a large number of new products introduced in 2015 and expect similar trends in 2016 as well. In particular, balances and analytical instruments, process analytics, automated chemistry and product infection have robust pipelines. We continue to lead the market in technology advantage that provide competitive edge to our customers and keep us at the forefront of innovation in our industry. Finally, it is a core aspect of our culture. You can even say it is part of our DNA to continue to look for ways to optimize our cost structure. This drive for continuous improvement is at the foundation of our franchise and gives us the resiliency and agility to remain successful even when market conditions are not as favorable as we might have expected. Many productivity programs and cost initiatives in various areas add-up to significant savings and efficiencies. These efforts include lean initiatives and manufacturing in back office, leveraging low cost countries for R&D, marketing support and manufacturing and utilizing shared service centers for operational activities. That covers my column on our strategy focus in 2016. Let me make some summary comments before opening it up for questions. We will remain cautious on China and some of the emerging markets. As market conditions are challenging and it will take some time for these markets to recover. Our priority in these countries is to protect margins and ensure resources are targeted to long-term growth opportunities. Our other businesses, which account for more than 80% of total sales, are performing well. Market demand is solid, and we are leveraging our excellent product pipeline, proven sales and marketing programs, and the investments in field resources to gain share. Our margin enhancement and productivity initiatives are well on track and allow us to make additional growth investments. We believe this positions us well for continued share gain in 2016 and beyond. I want to now ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tim Evans from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Tim Evans : Thank you. I would like to try to get a sense for some of the sensitivities in guidance. I mean we have obviously been in a challenging macro environment now for some time and you've done a great job managing through that. As you are thinking about your 2016 guidance, what are some of the downside risks that you think are the most things that are on the front of your mind at this point? Is it still kind of emerging markets, or is it more kind of global GDP that you are thinking about? Just kind of give us a sense for maybe some of the things that could go wrong in 2016? Bill Donnelly : So I would start with the global economy, right. We have certain assumptions about how the world should play out. We\u2019re using the same data that you guys are seeing the same information that you guys are. We continue to be a little worried about some of the emerging markets. We also see some weakness in some manufacturing data, which impacts our business. I mean, I would qualify that to say, if you dig a layer deeper into that, you would see that actually some areas like food and chemical or actually there is more, those are the more positive ones for example within those are actually growth areas within the U.S. PMI number as opposed to for example the oil and gas area or metals area are much more difficult at this time. Second area would be currency, I think we\u2019ve all experience together ourselves the peer companies the new guys. How currencies can move things around and we have an assumption based on where rates are basically today. And if those should continue, if the economy should continue, we would feel good about our guidance for 2016 and I would highlight Olivier and I both feel that the things we can control, the execution of our business plan are things that we feel very good about for 2016. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is open. Bill March : This is actually Bill March on for Paul. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe first, could you just speak to what you're seeing in China in terms of flat Lab maybe where you could see some upside into 2016 and what you're seeing on the industrial side as well? Olivier Filliol : Okay I expect 2016 a little bit what we have also seen in 2015 we had in 2015 actually good profits of growth in the Lab area and particularly in the area that is not exposed to the industrial world. I expect that to go on. I do on the industrial piece however also expect that the challenge goes on in 2016, the challenge that we have experienced last year is that there is overcapacity in many of our end-user industries that we serve. And the overcapacity remains and the high volatility that we just see in general in China is going on. It is today probably too early to really have a good outlook for China, we want to see kind of Chinese New Year and how the business starts after that and we will certainly have a higher confidence level in our outlook when we talk next time about China and so May time is certainly giving us then better visibility, we saw that also last year the impact of how business does before and after Chinese New Year is actually quite important. Bill March : Understood and then just as a follow-up maybe what is still playing out in the food retailing segment what is the decline this quarter and then as you look out in the next to see tougher comp even though Food and Chemical seems to be an area of somewhat strength in the applied markets? Thank you. Olivier Filliol : So Food Retail I think important this is really to this -- our solution going to the big food retails\u2019 key accounts around the world and we have seen a decline here in Q4, but that was expected actually we did talk about this happening because we had a strong previous year and particularly in Europe we had one or two big projects. And for 2016, we expect also some declines in Food Retail that's because we have talked about key accounts and they plan their rollout actually a couple of quarters in advance, so we have a certain visibility about the big project. And just the way it is coming together makes us believe that 2016 will be more difficult. But I want also to remind the way we're running this retail, my strategic standpoint is really a focus on some profitability and not just on the growth and we accept in that sense also the volatility that we have in that business, but I did highlight in my prepared remarks that I am really happy to have the profitability is developing of this business. So I feel we're on a good track and I am not irritated by the fact that we expect some sales decline for that business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg from UBS. Your line is open. Harris Iqbal : This is actually Harris on behalf of Jon I appreciate the question, so first one is in terms of pricing what are you expecting in 2016 compared to you prior guidance was 150 basis points, so curious seeing where FX and macro are today versus when you last reported what expectations are? Bill Donnelly : So still think the 150 basis point is a good assumption here and even that macro-environment inflation and so on wouldn't necessarily suggest that it's an environment for price increases and we feel definitely comfortable with that. And our customers ban you, they ban your ad that our products are brining, we have well differentiated solutions. And this allows us also to have some pricing increases and we do that in a differentiated way across the world. We do it differentiated across the product lines and the tools that we have in place, the processes that we have in place should really enable us to increase prices independent of the macroeconomic environment. You might also recall that we did breakout price increases even in economic crises I feel we can do also price increases in low inflation environment. Harris Iqbal : Got it and then one additional question, you've mentioned in the past various initiatives to and try to sale more serious contracts at the point of product sales, can you comment on the progress here and any initiatives you're pursuing on that front through 2016? Bill Donnelly : Yes, so our focus is still very much on this topic and what maybe phrased as a more broadly of course we want to sell more service contract at the point of sales. So, we have efforts here that first we always include service in our courts. And then we train and incentivize our sales people to really also convert on that. That\u2019s an ongoing effort and the big benefit comes when we cumulate all the contract business over many years. But in parallel we have actually very significant efforts to grow on the whole installed base and make sure that we can capture as much of the installed base on the service contract. So, I want to make sure that we emphasize really both things. We are making good progress but I would want also to strength up on that it is a journey the service business growing the service business and particular the contract business is every quarter of every year capturing a few hundreds of additional customers. It's not just a bold strategy that you can implement within one or two years. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joel Kaufman : Hi guys it's actually Joel in for Isaac. Just wondering if you guys have seen any improved demand from your customers you actually benefit from lower oil prices and if not when do you think we might actually see that? Olivier Filliol : It's an interesting question in the sense that I have been observing a little bit the chemical industry in particular who could be one of the beneficiary of the plastic industry as well. I don\u2019t see strong signals yet and in that sense I don\u2019t have much expectation that we are really going to benefit from this. And I would say that is probably a general comment, we don\u2019t see that many consumers or industry segments that are really benefiting from the lower oil prices. Joel Kaufman : Great and then maybe just one on M&A, is the focus still on bolt ons or are you guys thinking about anything larger in the context of some of the valuations we are seeing in the market today. And then maybe any update on how the Board is thinking about the optimal leverage for the company? Olivier Filliol : So, on M&A, we very much still pursue the same strategy, strategy of looking at opportunities, we have our radar, we nurture these opportunities and sometimes some more materializing and that the timing of it is difficult, the strategic target is to go for companies where we can add value and where it's strengthening our franchise and in essence there are not that very big companies that would really fall in that category and the few ones that are bigger might not just be available. So, I think what you are going to see from us is to do more of what we have done in recent years and this focus on really being able to strengthen the franchise has generated great results actually in the past and I want to continue to pursue that. On the balance sheet, Bill you might want to quickly comment on that one? Bill Donnelly : So, as you know we've bought a little bit more in the share repurchase program and our free cash flow this past year we are going to do that again in 2016. And I think beyond that period of time I think we'll comment 12 months from now or something. Operator : Your next question comes from the Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanly. Your line is open. Michael Clerico : Yes hi guys, it's Michael Clerico on for Steve. Could you elaborate a little bit more on what's driving larger FX headwinds, are there any currencies outside the majors that are having a larger and is that expected to impact, also if you could quantify the impact to hedges on the '16 outlook and also how those hedges will lead into '17? Thanks. Bill Donnelly : Sure. So, just to clarify there has not been any change in the OpEx environment since we last talked to guys in November, I mean there have been changes but they have basically netted out. In terms of the Swiss franc hedges, they will -- we have less of them this year. I think we were protecting maybe 85% of our exposure in 2015, that dropped to about 70% this year and then falls off completely in 2017 and the impact of it falling out completely is about $5 million or so. Michael Clerico : Okay, great thanks. And then secondly, I just want to ask about guidance again, with stronger expected growth this quarter and the 1Q guide in at the top of the range. The full year implies deceleration throughout the year as we go. We know from last quarter you baked in a level of conservatism into that guidance. So I\u2019m wondering, what the bigger deltas are in the end markets that you saw since we last got the update and what\u2019s giving your cause in change the outlook given the stronger than second quarter, this quarter and the top of the range outlook for Q1? Thanks. Bill Donnelly : I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that, we gave a guidance of 3% to 4%. We said 4% for the full year, we said 4% for Q1, I think in it very much reflects our more detailed look at how comps are going to go in particularly we see China has probably got to do a little better in Q1 then we expected it to do for the full year and I think that is largely explained by some specific comp considerations that they had. So I\u2019m careful I think the word you used to position, the question was deceleration. I think to say the, going from 4 to 3.5 deceleration is probably, I don\u2019t think the right analytical conclusion. I think is a little bit of comp topic in Q1 that benefits us and we largely think that what we see today is playing out very much in line with what the information that we had at the time we updated you guys in November. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin your line is open. Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tycho Peterson : Hi, thanks. Wondering if you can talk about linearity in the quarter and any commentary you can provide on trends in January both to the overall business and then in particular within emerging markets? Bill Donnelly : Tycho could you the word that you\u2019re asking, we both missed it we couldn\u2019t\u2026 Tycho Peterson : Yes. I\u2019m asking about linearity in the quarter, so just the sequential monthly trends throughout the quarter and then in January. If you can provide me commentary both for the overall business as well as emerging markets? Bill Donnelly : Okay. So I think the guys both years for Chinese New Year is February. So in both periods it was February. The month of January is solid. So it\u2019s not that we are expecting to race at the finish, we entered the year with more backlog decent order trend leads and stuff seem in line. I think it\u2019s a realistic expectation, we had from the quarter. Maybe in terms of budget flush CapEx at the end of the year, I think ourselves and many of the peer guys felt very good about 2015\u2019s budget flush and I think how we saw it play out in 2016 was solid, vis-\u00e0-vis a relatively stronger Q4 of last year. So the farmer guys seem to be spending some money on businesses that are most oriented towards pharma had a good finish to the year. Olivier Filliol : I think, I would also add, it\u2019s not easy to look at a trend on the monthly basis. A month can be impacted by bigger projects and number of working days and so on, so we don\u2019t necessarily look at monthly results to identify a trend, I think we prefer to take averages across at least three months, if not six months. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And I hate to harp on China, because I know you hit a disproportionate number of questions, but you did have flat orders there yet you\u2019re guiding for low single-digit decline in the year. So are you expecting orders to drop off over the next couple of quarters, I\u2019m just trying to understanding why you\u2019re projecting a decline not flat orders this quarter? Bill Donnelly : I think so maybe similar to where Olivier finished off the answer to the previous piece. We don\u2019t read too much into the shorter period, if we kind of look out on the China business, there is nothing that has happened let\u2019s say positive since we talked to you guys in November about the China economic outlook. And I think we always have a little bit of a late-cycle economically in our business. So we\u2019re impacted by investment decisions and I don\u2019t think anybody is rushing to make positive investment decisions in China based on what they heard recently. So we think it\u2019s prudent to be cautious and we\u2019re happy it\u2019s going to be off to a good start. We prefer that than trying to explain to you guys, why we\u2019re going to catch up later in the year. But we\u2019re not, we prefer, what we got for the first quarter versus the alternative, but we\u2019re not still excited yet about a turnaround. And we don\u2019t expect when the turnaround does come Tycho that it\u2019s going to be a jump back, it\u2019s going to be a bottoming for a while that overcapacity will take some time. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then just lastly wondering if you could talk a little bit more Olivier on the fifth wave of Spinnaker and particularly interested on the replacement opportunity you alluded to, is there anything you can kind of guide us to as to the age of installed base or which part of the business you will see maybe disproportionate benefits? Olivier Filliol : The fifth wave will not bring big revolutions. It's like the first four waves evolution. So we are strengthening all the different dimensions that we have been working on and bringing some additional sophistication. So topics around key account management, iBase management, the installed base topic all will remain in the center. I think where we get a little bit more sophisticated is in the area of big data analytics and leveraging it for sales and marketing initiatives. And the example that I used in the prepared remarks, we're going in that direction is that we're really applying more sophisticated analytics to the information that we have on the millions of installed instruments and the analytics allows us to better recognize the potential and based on the potential also use the right go to market approach. So meaning understanding, if this is an opportunity where we use telesales or are we using a field sales person and with what kind of value proposition we approach the customers. And there is certainly an area where we bring more sophistication with this fifth wave of Spinnaker. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your line is open. Brandon Couillard : Bill, just a couple for you, could you give us the ASP contribution in the fourth quarter and was there any acquisition revenue contribution from the deal you did in the third quarter? Bill Donnelly : The latter one I can answer quickly, the answer is no. We didn\u2019t catch what you're asking for the first one? Brandon Couillard : The pricing contribution to revenues in the fourth quarter? Bill Donnelly : Okay, pricing was up 220 bps in the fourth quarter. Brandon Couillard : And then I am just curious to how you're thinking about material cost for the year given what's happened in the commodity complex and how you see gross margins shaping out for the full year? Bill Donnelly : I think again we'll have a good year on material cost we are down on an apples-to-apples basis about 3% in \u201915. I think we should have good year. It's important now to remember on commodity prices. We're not buying that much that is -- if you look at for example a machine part or a fabrication labor time, machine time would be a bigger cost element than the steel or the fabricating material itself. So we didn\u2019t' get hurt by material in anyway, I don't mean to imply that, and certainly we like it going this way more than the other. But it's for example of the 3% that we saved this year I think less than 1% is directly attributable to lower material cost. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Luke Lemoine : Hi, it's Luke in for Ross, I guess you've talked a little bit more than the returns you're seeing from your, the field turbo program, I guess what kind of inning we are in and if you guys have any plans to make any additional investments past what early goals were? Olivier Filliol : So, as we discussed it on the November call, we have done a very successful wave of field turbo in 2015 and we want to repeat that into 2016, we're on track to implement about the same amount in terms of additional resources so roughly 200 field resources. We are very encouraged by the results that we had last year and we also want to approach it in a similar way this year in terms of funding it also through cost measures that we have in other areas of the company. And the projects or the field additions are very similar to last year in terms of the business priorities, but of course and the territories might be different, but the geographic focus remains on the markets that have reasonable growth momentum. And we're adding again quite a sizable number of resources in Americas and as well as selectively in Europe and yes. Luke Lemoine : Okay great and I guess turning to emerging markets we're seeing a lot of mixed singles over there and you guys are seeing some strengths and some weaknesses, I was hoping you\u2019d give more color into the various customer segments that you're seeing these trends in and kind of where you see any turnarounds and reversals in any of these trends? Olivier Filliol : So if we exclude China for a minute, in all the other emerging markets I wouldn't talk too much industry specific. I think actually it's more the geography than the industry. And when we talk about Brazil and Russia the challenges and the headwinds we had last year it's actually very difficult to attribute to that to a certain industry segment. We saw it actually pretty much grow across the business lines, and across industry segments. And what we are seeing is however that across the different emerging markets there are big differences, we have seen actually emerging markets that did very well for us. And we talked India, Mexico did well, Southeast Asia did actually well. And so we have multiple emerging markets that did well last year and I expect actually that this year it's also going to be mixed. We are going to have emerging markets that do well and they are going to be emerging markets that will be more challenging. Partially, I would attribute the good results that we had in certain emerging markets last year to an excellent performance by our local teams. With some highlights countries like Mexico and Southeast Asia that did really exceptionally well and that\u2019s certainly also attributable to programs that we have in place. Some of the emerging markets, and the economic environment might be a little bit more challenging but we consciously want to invest in these markets because we believe also in the long term I would name here for example Turkey but also Indonesia, and Vietnam and so on where you can see a certain cool down from an macroeconomic environment, nonetheless, we continue to invest there because we feel we can win market share and in the long term these economies will continue to develop well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Citi. Your line is open. Brian Kipp : Hi guys this is actually Brian Kipp on behalf of Dan. Well I just wanted to step back and go to 4Q last year when the Swiss National Bank removed the peg. You guys were talking about looking at your cost structure especially in light of hedging starting to roll off 2016. Now that we are seeing volatility in emerging markets currencies a little bit more than we are seeing in Europe. What are your thoughts there, have you guys gone through a plan, have you started to reallocate resources into Europe, maintained in Switzerland or move to emerging markets just want to get some color there? Olivier Filliol : Okay. I think we need to differentiate here between resources and cost base that we have that is associated with producing products and with serving local markets. When we talk about the cost base that we have in Switzerland and the currency exposure this wasn\u2019t the cost associated with serving Switzerland and the market but actually in terms of having a cost base because we do R&D product development and production in Switzerland. And this is true for Switzerland this true for our manufacturing base in China and so on, but we don\u2019t have this strengthening of a currency that is a headwind except in Switzerland until this was specific to Switzerland. And now, in the order markets of where we serve a country and there is currency exposure. We do a little bit cost measure specifically it's more on the pricing side that we would actually work. And with one big exception and that\u2019s China. In China, we have taken cost measures not because of currency but because of market dynamics. And there it is very much about resource shifting, and we have business lines that have growth prospects in orders. So, probably not surprising we have done restructuring in the industrial business in China as for the lab business we continue to invest into it as we are adding resources. Brian Kipp : I appreciate it, and piggy backing off of Tycho\u2019s question. I know the Spinnaker fifth wave is early stages but have you guys done any best testing at all yet and when do you expect to kind a fully ramp that and if you haven't done bets testing and start to convert some of those orders? Olivier Filliol : So, the bets testing wouldn\u2019t necessary apply to Spinnaker the way we develop things is we go out to -- on the different market organization and we study different best practices. And when we see that we have a best practice of certain sophistication in an approach and so when we qualify that as a tool box with qualified and training and then we roll it out. So, in that sense it's not beta testing, it's already reality. We have these pilots these crusaders of teams out there that have done good stuff that we are scaling up and rolling out. The scale up takes place over to about a year, and we go and normally with these more sophisticated levels to the countries that are more mature. And then we follow-up with the other countries and there a few things that we drive from the center rather than bottom up from the units, like the big data analytics things there are from the center. And there I would say yes, we start with prototypes and then we industrialize the things so there I am with you with the beta testing. I feel comfortable where we stand on that one and I know we\u2019re going to have the results out of it. Brian Kipp : Okay. I guess it was in context to the data analytics stuff, so you\u2019re in kind of like a bets testing type phase evaluating what methodologies you should use in the marketing realm versus actually out in reaching out to customers on a broad-base. That\u2019s correct? Olivier Filliol : Yes, that\u2019s correct. In this area it is also about we really try to innovate in this area. As we try to come up with new approaches, tools, and technology tools, databases and all that stuff that we are combining. And there is a very small team that is leading the thinking process on that one. And that\u2019s the prototype part and when we have cracked that analytics, scaling it up afterwards or industrializing is normally not the challenging part. Brian Kipp : I appreciate it. If I can sneak one more in Bill did you see any gross margin benefit were you able to clean out any gross margin benefit from oil and freight et cetera or is that something that\u2019s probably a little too deep? Bill Donnelly : Hi we had a good freight number savings year-on-year. But I doubt it would be big enough to move the needle good could it be 5 basis points maybe something like that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Steve Willoughby : Just two things, one just a follow-up to make sure I heard you correctly. Bill and Mary as it relates to FX. Just want to make sure I heard you correctly that you\u2019re now assuming that FX is going to negatively impact your revenue by, I believe you said 4.5% and earnings by 1.5%, is that correct? Bill Donnelly : It will impact earnings by 1.5% for the full year and it will impact sales by 3%. Mary Finnegan : For the full year. Bill Donnelly : For the full year, the 4.5, I think is Q1 and the 2.5 on EPS is Q1. Mary Finnegan : That\u2019s right. Steve Willoughby : Okay, great. Thanks for clarify that. And then just Bill, I know you guys have had a large number of different products in skews, but I was wondering if the creation or development of any new products that you guys have been adding over the past year or two worth into 2016 is anything worth discussing as it relates to the overall impact on the company? Olivier Filliol : No. In the sense that, we need to constantly come out with product innovations, upgrades to existing products and so on and that is just part of our business model and it\u2019s typically an individual product helps us to increase pricing and have better models and keep the growth growing. But it\u2019s not that it\u2019s going to really change our overall number. An individual product will not really change the needle. Steve Willoughby : Okay. I was thinking more in the kind of expanding in the new types of products that you guys haven\u2019t been offered in the past at all? Olivier Filliol : In the new product categories it typically takes multiple quarters that is adds up to millions of dollars. Yes it is actually Bill corrected me make it years. So we need to be realistic on that one. Even, yes what I have seen when we expanded new product categories after 5-10 years, it becomes really something effective, so yes that is it. Steve Willoughby : Sure. And then just one quick follow-up, I was just wondering that if we could have any thoughts on the difference in growth between the Americas and Europe. So I understand in the Americas, the pharma is driving a lot of the growth there. And is there any reason, there isn\u2019t thoughts on, why you\u2019re not seeing similar type of growth in Europe? Olivier Filliol : I mean first I would clearly say North America it is much more healthy in terms of economy that Europe, definitely. But I want also to say that I\u2019m very happy with the results than we had in Europe last year. Particularly if I look at the two year phase and then if you exclude Russia and that is something that has to do in Q4 kind of a, as exclude retail. It\u2019s actually a good performance. So nevertheless, Americas did even better and I expect 2016 to be the same Americas have more dynamic than Europe. In terms of team performance, in terms of share gain actually similar. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Richard Eastman : Yes, good evening. Bill could you just kind of speak real quickly. So in the fourth quarter, the service and consumables, how did that grow relative to hardware against the 3% local currency growth rate? Did we see any hardware growth? Bill Donnelly : Actually our service growth wasn't that high in Q4, I think it was 2% or so, its consumables might have 2 or 3 and the reason for that was we had about 11% growth in Q4 a year ago, so the product business modestly outgrew the service business, but I think that that's more of comp topic. Richard Eastman : And Olivier I just -- may be you could just do just a quick deeper dive on the product inspection business and I am a little bit curious the macro trends in food inspection has been prevailingly positive here for some time and so when you look at that market what's your sense of the markets growth? And then is there some new products you spoke to there, are there any technology trends that are boosting at those content within that marketplace and just I am kind of getting at what the growth product inspection growth should be for \u201916 and what your expectation is to perhaps outgrow the favorable macro there? Olivier Filliol : Okay. First on the macro, I would differentiate a little bit by geography. The long-term trends are very favorable across the world for this business segment and we're extremely well positioned. But there are temporary things happening for example China we clearly see that also the food industry is holding back. There is an overcapacity and the whole food industry is challenged right now in China also in terms of margins. So you see the big foreign companies but also local companies like MasterCom as well cutting back significant off their CapEx and that impacts our product inspection business. And while in U.S. for example we have very good data again we had very good growth for example last year. And so I would say globally and long-term very favorable, short-term we need differences by geographies. In terms of our market position, we have an excellent position because we are the leader in all the core technologies. We are a leader across the globe as typically we have competitors that are more regional and typically in one or the other technology. In terms of technology development, the check weighing and metal detection business is a relatively mature technology. The x-ray technology is still at an adoption rate that is growing meaning that not all the production lines are equipped today with x-ray technology even in western markets as part of a metal detection that is a more mature technology and has been widely applied and so we leave our supply from replacement business. And then the fourth technology is vision inspection, vision inspection has multiple applications and that's one that is more developing and it's more than early stage and also for us it's still a smaller and will hopefully develop well over the next 5-10 years. Richard Eastman : And you would be pleased in \u201916, if on a consolidated basis that product inspection grew kind of at that similar 6% rate that we saw in \u201915, is that, that would be, okay, okay\u2026 Olivier Filliol : No, no, I think that's a reasonable assumption. Richard Eastman : Yes, okay and then, I feel like I might have misheard the numbers or but in China the growth rates that you gave for Lab and the growth rate that you gave for the Industrial business kind of weighted out to 50/50 in terms of the size of those businesses, is that correct? Olivier Filliol : No. Bill Donnelly : You said significant you're talking about the fourth quarter standing alone? Richard Eastman : Yes, you talked about and you said in the fourth quarter that Industrial was down. Olivier Filliol : Yes so, sorry, Lab was 42% sales in the quarter in China while Industrial was 49 and Retail was 9. Richard Eastman : Okay, I got you, all right, that makes sense, and then just a -- how is the profit margin held up in China relative to the industrial declines that we've seen there, I got to believe certain pieces of the Industrial market are competitive but there is nothing visible in the margin line consolidated, so you've managed the whole margins there pretty flat despite the sales declines in China? Bill Donnelly : Yes, this is the customers that have the money are usually spending on more sophisticated applications that we make more money on. It's always the businesses that have the least amount of customer value proposition that gets hit the hardest. And it's partly a reflection of who the buyers are, partly a reflection of the nature of the application. And so you are right our margins have held up reasonably in China despite some of the sales declines and we are working hard to continue to do that going forward as well. Richard Eastman : Okay. And then a last question from me is the restructuring charge kind of kicked up a little bit and obviously we are using that to pay for the field turbo program. But can you just give us a sense of where the cost out is coming from either by end market or by region? Bill Donnelly : Sure, I think the two biggest pieces would be China and Europe and you can assume it's more weighted to for example the industrial business in both cases. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derek de Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is open. Derek de Bruin : So just one of the things I wanted to ask has already been asked but Bill what are your pricing assumptions 2016 in terms of being able to get pricing? Olivier Filliol : It is actually 150 basis points, so it's about the same that we guided over back in November. We feel comfortable with that even that the macroeconomic environment might have changed a little bit I feel comfortable that we can execute on that one. Derek de Bruin : And that is just you doing more Spinnaker and the focus on that. I mean I guess you are not seeing any of the local people sort of pickup speed like that or being pushed back on it I am just wondering if it's -- does your ability execute or does the competition just not play in? Olivier Filliol : No, it is actually it has much more to do with the customers. We have good differentiated products and as long as we do price increases every year actually we operate almost the load at radar and they accept that. And of course we differentiate significantly across the world by geography as well as the business lines. And we are going to execute it in a similar way as we did in the past. Of course every year it is getting a little bit more sophisticated but the approaches that we used to it is very similar. And it is a line that I haven\u2019t used many times but the biggest obstacle for price increases are often not the customers but our internal organization sales people and that is something we can work on and can control, so, I feel comparable from that end. Derek de Bruin : So, one of your strategies in terms of growth outlook has been that in your China business it is more heavily industrial weighted at the moment and overtime you expect China to look like the rest of the world business and have more of a Lab focus. Given the current economic situation in China and the slowing macro economy, are you worried that it may take longer to sort of get that conversion going on right now, I guess sort of how you are looking at what's going on in China right now into your longer terms plans so your strategy as to how tap into that market? Bill Donnelly : I think that there are things kind of going both ways right Derek, so I may be give you two example so -- because our industrial has been shrinking we are moving more towards the corporate side. Derek de Bruin : Good point yeah [Multiple Speakers]. Bill Donnelly : As far as the offer is that -- but then maybe to your point Olivier made this point on MasterCom cutting their CapEx levels the largest food company in China. And that certainly has slowed the move to more consumer safety in the food inspection area. So, probably both of us would say that if the economy was going better the move towards more consumer safety food inspection considerations would have had a more accelerated pace than China that it does now given the overall economic circumstances, so a little bit of both ways. Operator : Your next quarter comes from the line of David Stratton from Great Lakes Review. Your line is open. David Stratton : Thanks taking the call. I was wondering if you can give some color around CapEx expectations for 2016 and how that relates to the expansion projects that you mentioned in the last earnings call? Bill Donnelly : So, we are going to have CapEx of 120 million or so next year and that includes some significant building programs in the United States and Europe and I think a little bit in China as well. China is a little bit more a story about we will be consolidating with some other facilities there. David Stratton : All right, and then lastly kind of a housekeeping, would you breakout your service in consumables revenue as a percentage of sales for the fourth and the full year? Bill Donnelly : All right, you have to give me one second we have that number it is, -- so in Q4, service was 27% of sales and if I include service and consumables. I am sorry that was service and consumables and for the full year it was 30%. And so always a little less in the fourth quarter because that\u2019s a big quarter for product sales so it impacts the mix of it. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will turn it back over to Mary Finnegan for closing remarks. Mary Finnegan : Thanks Cameron and thanks everyone for joining us. Just had one last comment as your planning your schedules for this year. We wanted to let you know that we plan to hold an Investor Meeting at our Rainin facility and Oakland California on Friday, July 29th. We will have some more details for you in the coming weeks, but just wanted to mention it now as you are starting your planning. And that is all we have for tonight. Again thanks for joining us. Any questions of course don\u2019t hesitate to call. Take care. Olivier Filliol : Thank you. Bye, bye. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

And I would now like to turn the presentation over to your hostess for today's call, Ms. Mary Finnegan. Please proceed, ma'am. Mary T. Finnegan - Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : Thanks, Jennifer, and good evening, everyone. I am Mary Finnegan. I am the Treasurer and I'm also responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo. I'm happy you're joining us for this call. I am joined tonight by Olivier Filliol, our CEO, and Bill Donnelly, our Executive Vice President. I need to cover just a couple administrative matters. This call is being webcast and is available for replay on our website. A copy of the press release and the presentation is also available on the website. On page one, we have our Safe Harbor language. Let me just cover it quickly.

More detailed information with respect to non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided in our Form 8-K. I'll now turn the call over to Olivier. Olivier A. Filliol - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter are on page two of the presentation. We had a solid start to the year with our first quarter results. Local currency sales increased 4%. We had another quarter of good growth in America, while Europe came in a little weaker than expected. Emerging markets growth was solid, and we are pleased that we had sales growth in China in the quarter. With strong execution and the benefit of productivity initiatives, we achieved good growth in EPS, which increased 9% in the quarter. This equates to 11.5% growth excluding the impact of currency. We are pleased with these results and that the year is off to a good start. Now let met turn it to Bill to cover the numbers. William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President : Thanks, Olivier, and hello to everybody. Sales were $539.7 million in the quarter, that's an increase of 4% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased by 1%, as currencies reduced sales by 3% in the quarter. Turning to page three of the presentation, we'll outline sales by geography. In the quarter, local currency sales increased by 6% in the Americas and 4% in Asia/Rest of World and were flat in Europe. Regarding the Europe number, we may have underestimated a little the impact of Easter being in March this year versus April last year. Europe should do better in the second quarter. China had sales growth of 6% in the quarter, which is better than we expected. Turning to slide number four, we outline sales growth by product line. Laboratory had local currency growth of 5%, Industrial increased 2%, and Food Retailing was up 5%. All comparisons are versus the prior-year quarter. Turning to the next slide, let me walk you through the key items in the P&L for the quarter. Our gross margins were 55.6% as compared to 55.8% in the prior year. We're pleased with the continued good contributions from pricing and from our material cost reduction programs. Offsetting this were negative mix and some targeted investments in our service business. Currency was neutral to gross margins in the quarter. As a reminder, gross margins had a very tough comp. In Q1 last year, our gross margins were up 270 basis points, of which 170 basis points of the increase was on a constant currency basis. R&D amounted to $29 million. That's a 5% increase in local currency, while SG&A amounted to $168.9 million, and that's an increase of 1% in local currency over the prior year. Investments in our Field Turbo program and higher variable comp were offset in part by cost-saving initiatives. Adjusted operating income amounted to $102 million in the quarter. That's a 5% increase over the prior-year amount of $97.3 million. Currency reduced operating profit by $2 million. Absent currency headwinds, growth in operating income would have been 7%. Our operating margin was 18.9%, that's a 70 basis point increase over the prior year. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $8.4 million in the quarter. Interest expense was $6.6 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate continues to be 24%. Fully diluted shares for the quarter were 27.4 million, which is a 4.7% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.46 per share, a 9% increase over the prior year amount of $2.25 per share. Excluding the impact of currency, adjusted EPS increased by 11.5% in the quarter. On a reported basis, EPS was $2.40 as compared to $2.19 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.04 of purchase intangible amortization and $0.02 of restructuring charges. Now turning to cash flow. In the quarter, free cash flow amounted to $29.1 million as compared to $41.3 million in the prior year. We're pleased with our working capital management and further improvement in DSO, which was reduced by one day to 43 days as compared to the prior year. ITO was 4.6. The decline in cash flow versus the prior year is due primarily to the timing of working capital items, which was somewhat impacted by Easter falling in March this year as compared to April last year. We are on target for the full-year goal. Now let me turn to guidance. We're raising our full-year local currency sales guidance to 4% versus the 3% to 4% guidance we provided in February. This reflects a better view on China overall, somewhat offset by an expectation that Europe could be a little weaker than we expected. Overall, we feel very good about our product offering and our sales execution, in fact, better than we did three months ago. We also have raised our earnings per share guidance and now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.25 per share to $4.35 per share (sic) [$14.25 per share to $14.35 per share] (8:01-8:07), and that's a growth of 10% to 11%. This compares to previous guidance of 9% to 11% or $4.10 (sic) [$14.10 per share] (8:15) to $14.30 per share. Let me provide some additional background on our guidance for the remainder of the year. We now estimate that currency will have minimum impact on EPS for the full year. Previously, we had estimated that currency would be a headwind to EPS growth for the last three quarters of this year of approximately 1% or about $0.11 per share. Now we estimate a positive $0.04 impact over the last three quarters. We expect to have continued gross margin expansion for the full year, but at a lower rate than we originally assumed. For the coming three quarters, year-over-year gross profit margins should be up about 50 basis points on average. We also plan to expand our Field Turbo program further in the second half of this year as compared to our original assumption. We like the program's results so far and believe the environment is improving. This will offset some of the productivity gains we have and you saw in our Q1 results. One final item. Our share count will be a little higher than maybe your models had given our recent stock price performance year-to-date. This is a smaller adjustment to our forecast. It reduces EPS by approximately $0.06, but since you're updating your models, we thought it was worth mentioning. To incorporate these factors, we are raising the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.10. We now assume EPS will increase 10% to 11% as compared to the 9% to 11% previously. Now let's look at the second quarter. We expect local currency sales growth of approximately 4% and adjusted EPS in the range of $3.09 to $3.14. This reflects a growth rate of 10% to 12%. We do not expect currency to meaningfully impact EPS growth in the second quarter. In terms of currency impact on sales growth, we would expect currency to reduce sales growth by 1.5% in the second quarter and 1% for the full year. One final miscellaneous item. In the second quarter, we're going to take a non-cash pension accounting charge of approximately $8 million related to a lump sum offering to former employees of our U.S. plan. This plan is frozen, in fact it's been frozen for a long time, and the timing was advantageous to cash out the vested portion of these former employees. There is no cash flow impact to the company, as we use pension plan assets to fund the payments. Okay, that's it for my side and I now want to turn it back to Olivier. Olivier A. Filliol - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab had good growth, with 5% local currency sales growth, which is on top of strong growth in the prior year. Pipette and AutoChem had very strong growth, while Balances also had good growth. Good product pipeline, benefit of Field Turbo investments and continued strong sales and marketing programs are well contributing to strong Lab performance. Spending by our biopharma customers was strong. Industrial increased 2% in the quarter, driven by Product Inspection, which was up 7%. Product Inspection had good growth in most regions and we continued to benefit from solid market conditions and very strong competitive advantages in this market. Core Industrial was down slightly in the quarter. Finally, Retail was up 5% with strong performance in Americas and Asia offset by a decline in Europe. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales growth in the Americas increased 6%, with good growth in most product lines. Core Industrial was down modestly, however, it was against strong comparisons in the prior-year period of 8%. We continue to feel good about our growth in the Americas, but they will face tougher comparisons, particularly in the back half of the year. Europe sales growth was flat in the quarter, a little weaker than we expected. We had good growth in Lab and Product Inspection but declines in Core Industrial and strong decline in Retail. As mentioned earlier, there was some impact of Easter holiday timing. Asia and Rest of the World had growth of 4% in the quarter. As Bill mentioned, China had growth of 6%. While we are pleased with the good start, overall economic environment remains challenging in China. In particular, overcapacity remains in the industrial sector, which will take time to resolve. However, we are seeing good results in market segments, such as Life Sciences. We've had recent wins in our Process Analytics and Pipette businesses with research organizations such as the CDC and China National Biotec Corporate. Our technologies centered on Intelligent Sensors in Process Analytics and our LiteTouch systems in Pipettes helped us beat competition. Our Industrial team also had some successes. For example, we received an important order at a new pharmaceutical facility to provide a comprehensive solution to integrate formulation software with their bench and floor scales. These are only a couple of small examples, but I thought worth sharing as they demonstrate that the breadth of our product offering provides us good opportunities to target the growth segments of the Chinese market even when many segments struggle. I recently visited Southeast Asia and had business reviews with our teams from Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Philippines. I'm impressed with the good growth we are achieving in these regions, despite economic conditions which are challenging. We have strong management teams with proven success capitalizing on Field Turbo investments and our Spinnaker sales, service and marketing initiative. I am pleased how we continue to create and develop market organizations in new countries. Recent examples include Turkey, Indonesia, Philippines, New Zealand. All of these markets delivered strong results as we benefit from our direct presence. Our intentional customers really value our direct presence in these countries, particularly customers of our Product Inspection, Process Analytics, and Lab businesses. Those are all my comments on business strengths. I want to spend a few minutes today providing an update on our Automated Chemistry business. AutoChem provides enabling technology and software to develop and transfer bench scale chemistry into commercial processes. We are the clear market leaders in automated lab reactors and associated analytical tools that analyze chemical reactions in real-time. Our solutions provide customers increased R&D productivity, better product and process quality and ensure commercial processes deliver higher yields at lower costs. Driven by the reality that biopharma and chemical companies are under ever-increasing pressure to bring products to market faster, customers have increased their adoption of our AutoChem technology to increase R&D productivity. AutoChem had excellent sales growth in 2015, driven by increased adoption of our technology by our traditional customers combined with greater penetration in the biopharma large molecule segment. The prospects for Automated Chemistry remain strong, as we estimate the majority of potential users still use in-house engineered solutions which have fundamental limitations. We're increasingly seeing the general adoption of our EasyMax and OptiMax as the enabling platforms for automated lab reactors and are making great inroads in migrating chemists, engineers and biopharma scientists to adopt this technology to substantially improve productivity. Expanding our product offering is core to our market leadership in this segment. As our technology gains greater adoption, we see continued opportunity to provide a wider range of solutions. For example, we filled a gap in our offering with a plug-and-play control unit that provides automation for already installed manual high-volume, low-cost reaction systems. RX-10 has an easy-to-use interface that enhances data capture, increases automation and reinforces our automated lab reactors as the tool of choice in chemical development labs. This month, we will also introduce a new software package which reduces process complexity, including for data analysis, which allows a tool to be used by non-experts. Our market-leading technology combined with the largest service force in this market provides excellent competitive advantages for us. Our Spinnaker sales and marketing programs along with Field Turbo resources are positioning us well for further growth. For those of you that will be attending our Investor Meeting in July, you will have an opportunity to hear a little more about this business and see first hand some of our innovative technology for this market. That concludes our prepared remarks. Let me make some summary comments before opening it up for questions. We feel good about the start to 2016, but remain cautious on the global economy, given the uncertainties that exist. Our initiatives are well on track, and we expect to continue to benefit from our strong product pipeline, Field Turbo investments, Spinnaker sales and marketing program and our margin and productivity measures. Our focus is on execution and driving above-market growth. I want now to ask the operator to open the questions for us. Operator : And our first question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citigroup. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good afternoon, guys. William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President : Hi, Dan. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Bill, China during the quarter, to what extent do you feel like the results there relative to your guidance were driven by better market conditions, better demand versus maybe your expectations on sales force or sales manager activities, some internal things? William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President : So, certainly they did a little bit better than we expected. Just as a reminder, we talked to you a little bit last quarter about how we had done some things in terms of the sales teams to try to get them in the field a little bit more. Often in the early part of the year, we have sales meetings, training sessions, things. And so we did expect to do \u2013 frankly, in our original models, we thought Q1 would be the best quarter of the year. And at this stage, we feel like we're going to get full-year growth, and that's an improvement. Probably low-single digit growth, maybe a little upside to that, but low-single digit growth for the full year. That compares to a low-single digit decline that we would have guided you to before. If we look at the different pieces of business, of course our Lab business did particularly well during the quarter. It had solid growth. But even our Industrial business showed some signs of improving. If I were to look at order entry, maybe the Lab numbers were a little bit better than the order entry. And then the other piece of the surprise was our Retail business did well in China. That's always a little bit lumpy there as it is in other parts of the world as well. So we expect another positive number in China next quarter, maybe not quite as good as what we saw this quarter. And I think maybe in three months we can give guys a better sense of if it's the bottom or if we could see more lumpiness going forward. There's still a lot of fundamental issues in China around overcapacity and some fragility in some of the financial markets, but it's nice to get some good surprises there in China. We hadn't had them in a long time and we'll take that. And we feel like the team executed real well, particularly vis-\u00e0-vis competition. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, that's really helpful. And if I sort of stick with the geographic view here. I think the comps get a little easier in the back half of the year for Europe. So should we be thinking about sequential improvement through the quarters there? And then maybe in the emerging regions, I'm just curious what the outlook for Russia is in terms of a pick-up and maybe whether Brazil, you're feeling like you might have found a bottom on that? William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President : Okay, so let's start with Europe. I actually think Q2 will be a solid quarter. We see that already kind of in April. I think it's pretty clear to us that we had a little move in Europe between March and April due to the change in Easter. It impacts some of those European countries, although I look at Olivier, and it didn't have any impact in Switzerland because they were there, they were there throughout. So Europe, if I look at multi-year growth rates, I think your comment maybe applies on two-year growth rates, but I think a little bit less so if we were to look at three-year growth rates, Dan. So maybe at this point, Q2 might be one of the better quarters for Europe given what moved between March and April. In terms of Brazil, maybe I'll let Olivier give a couple comments about Brazil. Olivier A. Filliol - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hey. And maybe in general emerging markets outside of China had actually growth in Q1, but certainly Brazil and Russia are still challenging. Actually, Brazil was down mid-teens, so significantly down. But when I look forward, I would, for example, expect Russia to do better. We had good order entry growth and so I am a bit more optimistic for Russia, And Brazil will continue to be challenging. But it's good to see, and then as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I also expect Southeast Asia doing well. So for the remainder of the year, emerging markets should do actually okay, probably with the exception of Brazil. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Very good. Thanks a lot. Operator : And your next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Patrick B. Donnelly - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. It's actually Patrick Donnelly in for Tycho. Just on the Service front, Bill, I think you noted some increased investments there. What went into that decision and is that getting a little more competitive as other companies increase focus in that area where you've always been a strong entrenched player? Olivier A. Filliol - President and Chief Executive Officer : Services is one of the area where we really want to get stronger and we want to have a growth above a product because it strengthens the franchise, it's good in terms to have customer access and, of course, from a profitably standpoint it's very attractive. Services generates actually above group average profitability. Service is a strategic priority for us. We have given a lot of attention to Service in the recent years and will continue to do so. In recent years, we had to invest heavily in Service related to harmonizing our Service product offering across the world. We wanted also to streamline our processes, we wanted to prepare Service also to bring into our Blue Ocean platform. And more recently, we started to invest now in Service in the growth area and so also about adding telesales people to sell service contracts and also have better coverage. So the investment goes there. We see actually good results. We were happy to see that in Q1 Service and Consumables was actually up 6%. So as you can see, higher than what we had on products. And I am optimistic that we will continue to do well in Service. And so the investment and the attention that business gets is well deserved. Patrick B. Donnelly - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Then on Field Turbo, another place you talked about increasing investments. I think last quarter you talked about adding something around 200 front-end resources for 2016. How much has that number shifted higher now that you're focusing some more investments there? Olivier A. Filliol - President and Chief Executive Officer : So the 200 that we were talking about last time was across the whole year. What we are doing now is we're doing additional opportunities and funding it and it's also something that goes across my table. And that will be then going into the second half of the year and particularly also impacting next year. So there is always a lag between our commitment to it and until it goes really in effect. You can imagine the teams are developing these business cases and then we review. We commit to it, fund it, but then it takes a couple of months to recruit the people, train the people, onboard the people. So there is always a lag. So the additional commitment that we have goes to the second part of the year and is a pre-investment also for next year. Patrick B. Donnelly - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then maybe just one last quick one for Bill on gross margins. I know you said you faced a tough comp. Can you just talk about the contribution, pricing, FX, some of the other factors there? Thank you. William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President : Sure. So in terms of pricing, net realized prices were up about 180 basis points. That helped gross profit margin itself by about 80 basis points. Our material costs on an apples-to-apples basis were down about 120 basis points and that contributed about 20 basis points to gross profit margin. And then in terms of other \u2013 we had some negative mix and as I mentioned some investments on the Service side that they'll pick up productivity levels in the second half of the year. Patrick B. Donnelly - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Understood. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Evans with Wells Fargo Securities. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Bill, just wanted to kind of step back and ask a bigger picture philosophical question on share repurchases. The plan that you have this year to repurchase shares at a rate greater than your free cash flow, is that something you see continuing indefinitely, or is that more of a one-year thing? William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President : Well, I think it's something that we look at all the time. We do an intrinsic value calculation over various scenarios with the board and we monitor how that goes. We're of course looking at what might come up in terms of acquisitions or maybe more significant capital expenditures. We would say sitting here today I think we're going to repurchase about $0.5 billion this year. And we still have those building investments, that was kind of spread over 2016 and 2017. And I think a number, my best guess at this point would be another number in the $0.5 billion range next year. But that could change and we'll give specific guidance as we get closer. In terms of it being an indefinite thing, I wouldn't think of it as into infinity that we would buy more than the free cash flow. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Got it. And I just wanted to come back to Europe really quickly. I heard you that the Lab side of the business was better there, which was the same trend as you're seeing in North America. But I guess.... William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President : Hey, Tim, we struggle to hear the topic there. Could you repeat? Sorry. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Oh, Europe, I wanted to focus on Europe. I hear you that the Lab side of the business is doing better than the Industrial. Can you offer any more color there as to just how tough the industrial market is in Europe right now and how much visibility you have to the back of the year in the Industrial piece of the business specifically? Olivier A. Filliol - President and Chief Executive Officer : I wouldn't read too much into the first quarter. As we also mentioned before, there is a little bit of an Easter impact and so on. And when I look at the project pipeline, I don't think we are expecting a cool down for the Industrial business also. Of course, I do expect Lab to do better than Industrial, but that's not a particular timing aspect of it. It's more the whole environment that we have and the opportunities that we have. So I do actually expect that in the second part of the year, Industrial will actually look different than in the first quarter. William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. Wanted to spend a minute on China. Appreciate your comments in the script, but hoping you could put a little more color as to the reasons why you're maybe a little bit more optimistic for the balance of the year than you were maybe three months or four months ago when obviously the outlook was a little tougher? If you could maybe highlight a couple fundamental items that you're seeing in the marketplace that are giving you confidence, that would be great. William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President : Hey. I guess one obvious element, Isaac, is the fact that we have Q1 under our belt and a pretty decent forecast for Q2, so we have half of the year. We'll probably finish the first half of the year with mid-single digit growth and we had predicted for the full year previously a low-single digit decline. So some of it's just the math piece. The second is, I would comment on the fact that it wasn't that long ago that we were talking to you about we had last year in our China Core Industrial business, we had 20% decline for the full year last year and it varied between minus 17% and minus 23%. And while I'm not sure we're going to get growth in Core Industrial for the full year in China, it's pretty clear to me it won't be that kind of number. And just now that we're this far into the year, we feel a little bit better than that. In terms of what we see in terms of activity with customers, Olivier commented on some the progress we're making, particularly in the life science area. So we do see money getting awarded there. We see ourselves getting a good share without any kind of government preference things that might hurt people in certain industries. So, overall, mostly good news about China relative to where we were three months ago. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, that's really helpful color. Thank you. Follow-up, Bill, for you on pricing. I think there has been a bit of a run-up year-to-date in steel prices. So from the commodity standpoint, I'm curious how that factors into your plans to drive price. And maybe actually it's part of that, from a cost of goods standpoint, I know that the run-up has been relatively recent and relatively quick. Is that a factor that goes into gross margin for the year? William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President : So the area that you would see that impact us the most, Isaac, would be in our vehicle business because of the decks. And the way we do pricing in that market is we are quoting based on current market prices for steel. So we would push that price increase through with a little bit of margin. And so while it might look cosmetically like a little bit more price realization, on the gross margin there wouldn't be too big of an impact of that. In terms of the other pieces of our business, we do buy some fabrications and, of course, we buy a lot of machine parts. But those costs are mostly locked down in terms of annualized pricing, but certainly something we need to think about next year. And let's see how these commodity prices hold out and whether that might provide some opportunity because of what it does to Producer Price Indexes for us to try to do a little bit more pricing in the second half. But I think at this stage, it's probably \u2013 we have nothing definitive. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Fair enough. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Unknown Speaker : It's actually Mike Resk in (34:44) for Derek. I had a couple questions for you. First, you gave some commentary on the Consumables and Services in the quarter. Could you just follow-up with what you saw in terms of Instruments or how that was trending? William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President : Okay. So in terms of our \u2013 we grew 4%. The Service business grew a little faster than the Product business. And I think our Consumable, because I don't have it in front of me, but Rainin did well, so I just have to assume that our Consumable business, because that's the biggest piece, must have been done at least as well as the rest of the Service business. And then, of course, the Product Inspection business in particular had good Service growth, I would say, among the different divisions. Unknown Speaker : All right. Thank you for that. And what about operating leverage as your organic growth is improving? With all the restructuring and cost-cutting initiatives, what does it look like in terms of what operating leverage you get as your organic is expanding? William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President : So I think on a currency-neutral basis, we're looking at contribution margins in the mid-30%s. So for every incremental $1 of sales, we should be able to do something in the mid-30%s. And historically that's a pretty good number off this base of 4% growth for the full year. So not quite that mid-single digit because each extra $1 of sales growth usually has some more. And then I would comment that we're making pretty significant investments in the Field Turbo program that we're still delivering these type of incremental margins despite those investments. Unknown Speaker : All right. Thank you. And one last point real quick. You mentioned that you remain a little cautious on the global economy. There's some macro uncertainty. But at the same time you've talked a little bit about how China grew 6% in Q1, you saw a strong April so you expect mid-single digits at least through the first half. So what indicators are you looking for until you're able to revise your macro outlook? Are you looking for a longer duration, or is there something else that you're waiting to see an uptick in? William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President : I think it's really tough to point to one single factor. There's a lot of different data points we get from the market. What are we seeing in terms of our direct business, what are we seeing in terms of the economic data that you guys look at? And it would be really hard to pin it on one or two specific things. We're always looking at capacity utilization in China, we're looking at how they're doing from an export perspective. Maybe one of the new factors that's come out recently is the new Five-Year Plan probably since the last time we talked, and that certainly was more of the same at least as it related to our piece of the business. So I think just the passage of time and continued positive results there would be one of the factors we'd look to the most. Let's be honest, we have very much a short-cycle business, including in China, even if China's maybe slightly longer cycle than the rest of the world. But it's tough for us to be the \u2013 maybe the guy to make the first call. Unknown Speaker : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. Just a couple of quick clarifications. First, on selling days, there was a comment in the prepared remarks around Easter. I wonder if you've thought much about what the impact might have been in basis points, and was that isolated to Europe and were there any other selling day anomalies that you might spike out here? William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President : So if we look overall for the entire business, we felt reasonably good about that it was flattish for selling days. I think the comment related more to geographically the impact in Europe and that the Easter holidays tend to lead to our sales force as well as customers just being out of the office for that week. And it moving between March and April had a little bit of impact in terms of European sales and a little bit of impact in terms of cash flow collections. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then in the prepared remarks, Bill, I want to say that I caught a comment that suggested that in total there's not much change to the way you're thinking about overall margin expansion for the year, but you seem to think that the operating margin expansion might be a little bit more concentrated in terms of the rate of operating expense spend as opposed to gross margins. Am I interpreting that correctly? And can you give us a sense for what some of the underlying moving parts there? Thanks. William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President : Sure. And I'm looking at Mary, too, to make sure I quote some of the numbers right. But I think I understand your source. So the first comment is, hey, gross margin came in a little less than our model, probably a little bit less than some of your guys' models in Q1. If we look at now the remaining three quarters of the year, our best estimate at this point would be on a currency-neutral basis or actually I think there's maybe only 10 basis points anyway difference between actual and constant currency, but look at something like 50 basis points on average in the remaining three quarters of the year. It could be a little bit better than that, but something in that range. That, of course, is a good number and so we're happy with that number, but I think it compares a little bit. And if you look at what that means in terms of our full-year model, it means maybe a little bit less gross profit margin for the full year than most people were expecting. So that's maybe a slight negative. A slight positive is that we took the midpoint of our sales guidance up by 50 basis points. The next item is that you could see in our operating expenses that our various cost savings, cost reengineering initiatives, continue to go well. Our operating expenses, as we view it internally, were only up about 1% in the quarter despite having I think 250 more field personnel between sales and service than we had in Q1 a year ago. So we feel good about that. And partly because we're happy with how the Field Turbo program is going, Olivier mentioned that we're starting to approve already a few more Field Turbos that'll start to add a little bit of operating expense growth more than we had in the original model in the second half of the year. And then the final minor thing is that the share price has performed well recently. And that, for most of you guys, will probably have some impact on us spending $0.5 billion on share repurchases. We'll get a few less shares purchased because of that. That impact for us, at least in our model, was about $0.06. And, of course, one of the bigger impacts, Steve, is that if you look at where currencies are as of yesterday I guess as compared to what we told you in February and you looked at that over the last three quarters of the year \u2013 I say the last three quarters because, of course, the first quarter is already behind us, we estimated about $0.15 per share impact as the delta between those two. And of course, that's a positive delta. So taking all those things together, that's how we got to this $0.10 per share movement in terms of the midpoint of our guidance. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: As always, incredibly helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Groberg with UBS. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Bill, so just to clarify, in the first quarter \u2013 you just answered the question that gross margin was maybe a little less than you were expecting. And can you maybe just say what surprised you in the quarter? Was it mix or was it something else? Did you not get as much price as you maybe thought you were going to? And then, Olivier, in the U.S., everyone is kind of ignoring the U.S., how strong it's been growing, all these companies. What drove the strength for you? Was it mainly from an end market or a customer standpoint? Was it mainly pharma, or was it broad-based? Thanks. William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President : Do you want to go first, Olivier? Okay, so in terms of your question on gross profit margin, so maybe I'd give the overall picture. So the overall picture, 180 basis points price realization, that translates to about plus 80 bps on gross margin. Material costs were down 120 bps, that translates to 20 bps in terms of year-on-year movement in gross profit margin. Then the rest is kind of equally split between a mix topic, a series of little mix things kind of adding up. So maybe some of the highlights ones were a little less sales in terms of the overall composition, a little less European direct sales and a little less Southeast Asian sales. And those are two highly profitable markets. And if I look at within the Lab product categories, titration, for example, is one of our highest gross margin products that some of their sales moved a little bit into the latter part of the year due to some new product introductions. And then the Service was the other half of the negative. And in Service, Olivier talked about it earlier, we really see Service as an important part of our growth in terms of profit going forward. But also it's just one of the great competitive barriers and advantages that we want to build on and we invested a little bit more in Service technicians. It usually takes service technicians, depends on product category, but two quarters to four quarters to be breakeven. And we added a few more in a couple very targeted areas that are going to help us. And they very much fit in with how we made some of our Field Turbo investments and very much support those. Olivier A. Filliol - President and Chief Executive Officer : On Americas, so Q1 we had actually a good quarter. We were up 6%. Particularly actually was happy about the performance in Lab, Product Inspection, and Retail. Core Industrials was slightly down, but against a strong comparison in the prior year. So all-in-all, the growth was in line with our expectations and our outlook continues to be generally positive. But I would acknowledge that we start to have a strong comparison in the second part of the year. And biopharma. When I think about the particular strong end-user markets, it was certainly biopharma. I saw that, for example, very nicely in our results from our Pipette business and Automated Chemistry that are strongly exposed to that market and did extremely well. And I did mention that Product Inspection did well. That's certainly also because the whole food safety topic is an ongoing hot topic and we see our customer base having a high investment rate on that front. So, all-in-all, actually good and I definitely expect it growing \u2013 continuing to do well, but higher comparisons will also start to kick in. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes, good afternoon. William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President : Hi, Rick. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hello. Bill, could you just talk, in terms of Europe, I think you explained maybe why that came in flattish here in the first quarter. But you did kind of reference some puts and takes to the 4% core growth rate and you did mention maybe Europe comes in a little bit softer than you thought for the full year. Did I miss which piece of the business in Europe do you expect maybe for the full year to come in a little bit softer? Is that the Core Industrial or Retail? William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President : Core Industrial. Product Inspection \u2013 actually, Product Inspection in Europe is going to have a tough comp in Q2, but the business overall does well. On a normalized basis, it does well. We also have tough comps in Retail. And that's one we've been talking about since I think when we gave our original guidance in November that we're not going to have a particularly good year in Retail. We had some large orders I think in the Netherlands and Germany a year ago. But the Lab business looks solid in Europe. And overall our forecast would say we'll do better in Q2 than we did in Q1. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I see. Okay. And then in China, did the Core Industrial business, I mean, it has such weak comps throughout this year. Did the Core Industrial business grow, though, in China in the first quarter? William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President : It did. It had some bigger orders coming through and that's a little bit I'm unclear if \u2013 some of our hesitancy is we're going to keep getting those, or is that part of it? Rick, I think I remember talking I think even specifically to you a year ago when we were putting up the minus 17%s and minus 20%s in Core Industrial in China. There just was no big projects. And we got a couple of big projects in the backlog, some delivered in Q1, a few more coming in Q2. And we need to see a little bit more of that before it's easy for us to say, okay, now there's a more solid base there. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I see. Okay. Sorry if I missed it, but did you give the number of shares repurchased in Q1? William P. Donnelly - Executive Vice President : 390,337. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Excellent. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : And we have no further questions in queue at this time. And I would like to turn the conference back over to our presenters. Mary T. Finnegan - Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : Thanks, Jennifer. And thanks, everyone, for joining us this evening. As usual, if you have any questions or any follow-ups, please don't hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. Good night, everybody. Operator : Thank you for your participation.

I'll now turn the call over to Olivier. Olivier Filliol : Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter are on page three of the presentation. Local currency sales growth was 6% in the quarter and better than we expected. We continue to generate very solid growth in the America. Asia/Rest of the World including China had very good growth. Europe growth was solid. With the benefit of our margin and cost initiatives we had good growth in margins which contributed to excellent growth in earnings per share. Cash flow was also strong in the quarter. We are very happy with our performance as well our outlook for the remainder of the year. We will cover this shortly, but let me now turn it to Bill to cover the numbers. William Donnelly : Thanks, Olivier and hello everybody. Sales were $608.3 million in the quarter and that's an increase of 6% in local currency. On the U.S. dollar basis sales increased by 5% as currencies reduced sales by about 1% in the quarter. On slide number four we show local currency sales growth for the quarter. Sales grew by 6% in the Americas, 4% in Europe and 8% in Asia/Rest of World. On the next slide we show local currency sales growth of 5%. On a year-to-date basis that includes the Americas at 6%, Europe at 2% and Asia/Rest of World has increased 6% in the first half. Starting on page -- slide number six we will outline sales by product area. Laboratory had very good growth, with local currency sales of 10%. Industrial increased by 3% and Food Retailing declined by 2%. All these comparisons are forced to the prior year. And the next slide you'll see our year-to-date sales summary by product lines. Lab has grown 7% in the first half. Industrial 3% and Food Retailing increased by 1%. Now I'd like to turn to slide number eight and walk through the rest of the P&L. Our gross margins were 57.1%, that's a 160 basis points improvement over the prior year amount of 55.5%. We are very happy with the strong performance in the quarter. And on a year-to-date basis, our gross margins have increased in line with the expectations we had for expansion for the full year. Pricing material costs and mixed off contributed to the increase in the quarter and was partly offset by some additional targeted investments in our Service business. Currency had no impact on gross margins in the quarter. R&D amounted to $30.7 million in the quarter and that's a 5% increase in local currency. SG&A was $187.8 million, that's a 9% increase in local currency over the prior year. Investment in our Field Turbo program and higher variable comp were offset in part by cost-saving initiatives. Adjusted operating income was $129.1 million in the quarter, that's a 9% increase over the prior year amount of $118.3 million. Currency reduced operating profit by approximately $800,000 in the quarter. Adjusted operating profit margins were 21.2%, a 90 basis points increase over the prior year and, of course, a level of which we are pleased with. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization was $8.7 million in the quarter, while interest expense was $6.9 million. Our effective tax rate was 24%. You'll notice our reported tax rate was lower at 22.9% which is due to the tax impact of the one-time pension charge which I'll cover in a minute. Fully diluted shares for the quarter were 27.1 million, which is a 4.6% decline from the prior-year amount and reflects the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.22 per share; that's a 15% increase over the prior year amount of $2.80 per share. On a reported basis earnings per share were $2.93 per share as compared to $2.73 per share. As we mentioned on our last call, during the quarter we took a one-time non-cash pension settlement charge of $8 million before tax, or $0.19 per share after-tax. This relates to offering former employees of our U.S. plan a lump sum payout. The plan that we're talking about is frozen and the timing was advantageous to cash out the vested portion for these former employees. There is no cash flow impact to the company as we used pension plan assets to fund the payments. Reported EPS also includes $0.04 of purchased intangible amortization and $0.06 of restructuring charges. The next slide shows the P&L for the first half of the year. We had local currency sales growth of 5%, operating income increased by 7%, and adjusted earnings per share increased by 12%. Absent currencies, growth for the first half of the year would have been 14%. Now turning to cash flow. In the quarter, free cash flow was $108.9 million, which compares to $89.9 million in prior year. We're pleased with our working capital management and achieved further improvements in DSO, which was reduced by two days to 38 days as compared to the prior-year. ITO was 4.6 turns, cash flow for the six months was $138 million as compared to a $131.3 million in the prior year. In the third quarter we expect to complete the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of business called Troemner, which is focused in two areas : weights and weight calibration, as well as the manufacturing of basic lab equipment. We paid approximately 10 times EBITDA for the business and it should add about 1% to the sales on a full-year basis. It is a unique strategic fit with our business, and we're very happy to be able to close the business shortly. Olivier will provide some additional background on Troemner shortly. Now let's turn to guidance. We're raising our full-year local currency sales guidance to approximately 5% versus 4% previously. We estimate that Troemner will contribute about 50 basis points of sales growth for the half year, so for 2016. But to say it differently, we raised our organic growth expectations for the full year by 50 basis points to approximately 4.5%. We have also raised our EPS guidance and now expect adjusted EPS to be in a range of $14.40 per to $14.50 per share, which represents a growth rate of 11% to 12%. This compares to previous guidance of 10% to 11% EPS growth or $14.25 per share to $14.35 per share. We're raising the midpoint of our guidance by $0.15 to reflect our strong performance as well as the acquisition of Troemner. With respect to the third quarter, we expect local currency sales growth between 5% and 6%. This includes about 75 basis points of growth from Troemner. We assume adjusted EPS will be in the range of $3.65 per share to $3.70 per share, which is a growth rate of 12% to 13%. In terms of currency, let me first comment on sales growth. We would expect currencies to reduce sales growth by approximately 2% in the third quarter and 2% for the full year. In terms of the impact of currency and EPS, we do not expect it to have a meaningful impact on Q3 or for the full year. That's it from my side, and I now want to turn it back to Olivier. Olivier Filliol : Thanks, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lad had very good growth in the quarter with 10% increases. Pipettes, analytical instruments, and process analytics had an excellent growth with balances and auto chem also had good growth. Growth was strong across all regions and reflects our robust product pipeline, benefit of Field Turbo investment and continued strong sales and marketing program. Spending by our biopharma customers continues to be very favorable. Industrial increased 3% in the quarter driven by a 6% increase in Core Industrial. Growth in Core Industrial was particularly strong in the Americas which benefited from some projects activity in transportation and logistics. We also have growth in Core Industrial in Europe and Asia including China. Product Inspection was down slightly in the quarter. This business continues to perform well, but was impacted by timing of some activity and the strong comparison from the prior year. Product Inspection had strong order growth in the quarter and we expect good sales growth in Q3. Finally, sales declines 2% in the Retail. This was pretty much as expected. We have growth in Europe and Asia, but decline in the Americas against good growth in the prior year. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales growth in the Americas continues to be very solid with 6% growth. We have very good growth in Lab and Industrial, while sales declined in Retail. Demand continues to be solid in the Americas, but tougher comps will impact the second half. Europe grew 4% in quarter, an improvement over the first quarter which we think was in part due to timing of Easter holidays. Lab have excellent growth in Europe, while Core Industrial and Retail also grew. Product Inspection was down which was improved in the quarter. Asia/Rest of the World had growth of 8% in the quarter. China did very well and better than we expected as compared to the last time we spoke. Lab growth in China was double-digits with almost all product lines showing very good growth. We are pleased with performance which reflect some improving demand, also the benefit of our actions to reduce -- redirect resources to fast-growing market segments. While Industrial in China had modest growth, the fact is that overcapacity in industrial manufacturing sector remain. But we also pleased with our results in China we expect growth in the second half to be in the mid single-digit range. Let me make some comments on Service which grew 5% in the quarter. And on a year-to-date basis, Service represent about 23% of total sales and it is a key competitive advantage and an important source of revenue growth. This is the fifth year in a row which Service growth is outpacing Product growth. Although, this might not occur each and every quarter, over the medium term we expect Service growth to exceed Product growth. We have a service force of approximately 2,600 personnel which is by far larger than our direct competitive. Our Service team is specialized by-product area and we have made significant investments including training of tools which supports the daily activity. Core to our Service growth strategy is increasing the percentage of our installed base on the service contract and increasing the amount of service sold at a point of product sales. The long-term objective is to change the mix of our Service business to be largely contract business versus rate fix. Today contract represent approximately one-third of our Service sales. There are several reasons why this migration is a strategic imperative including the increasing quality of our products reducing the need to repair contract work -- sorry -- and all the other hand contract work is more easily planned and therefore our technicians can be more productive. And finally, our studies show that service contract leads to higher levels of customer satisfaction, and therefore [indiscernible]. The globalization and harmonization of our service offering which we have took several years ago led the groundwork to drive the contract business. Our marketing campaign under the Spinnaker initiative and our Field Turbo investment are helping to drive this change. Overall, we continue to make very good progress. We believe Service is one of our most important competitive advantage and could to continue to be an important source of sales and profit growth. Those are all my comments on business trends. I now want to provide some context to our acquisition of Troemner. Located in the Philadelphia area, Troemner is the U.S. market leader for weights and weight calibration and the great strategic fit to our leadership position in Europe. Together, we are now the global leader in this niche market. Weight and weight calibration services is an attractive market. It has strong barriers to entry as it requires very specialized know-how and expertise. We have 14 calibration labs worldwide, and the acquisition of Troemner firmly positioned as the U.S. market leader. Troemner is very strong brand in U.S. based on its world-class metrology competence and solid infrastructure. Service, which consists primarily of weight calibration, is almost 20% of Troemner\u2019s business and growing quite well. This is an attractive business, as customers must calibrate weight on a regular basis and one in very few players have the expertise to do it correctly. This is a good example of the kind of service business that fits well into our goal and of moving our service business to more contract value-added service. Troemner is also a provider of basic lab products such as [indiscernible] mixers and shakers, which will be a good strategic fit to Ohaus offering. As a reminder, Ohaus is our second brand used for indirect distributions for laboratory product and certain industrial weighing products. Troemner will help us strengthen the life science portfolio for Ohaus, which we have worked to expand over the last few years, in terms of channel presence and product portfolio. We also believe we can further extend this equipment offering internationally, particularly in emerging markets. We think this is a great opportunity to extend the offering of Ohaus. Troemner would add about 1% to sales goals, with similar margins to our own. We anticipate synergy potential from top line growth as well as potential in operational synergies. We expect to complete the acquisition shortly and have already begun integration plan. We believe this is a solid strategic acquisition and are excited about the potential development in this attractive market segment. That concludes our prepared remarks. We have kept our comments brief, as we will see many of you tomorrow at our investor meeting. Let me make some summary comments before opening it up for questions. We are very pleased with strong results in the second quarter. Our outlook for the remainder of the year is good, but we acknowledge the uncertainty in the global economy. Our focus remains on factors we can control, viz. successful execution of our initiatives. We feel very good about our new product launches, Field Turbo investment, Spinnaker marketing initiative and productivity measures. We believe with continued strong execution we can continue to gain share. I want now to ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Michael Ryskin : Hi. It\u2019s actually Michael Ryskin on the line for Derik. I want to say congrats on the strong quarter and the Troemner acquisition. A couple of quick questions. The strength in the lab was a little bit better than we expected, obviously. It is coming off a little bit of weaker comps per year, but is that something that was strongly affected by that, or is this something you\u2019re seeing operationally, and how do you feel about your ability to carry that double-digit growth, going forward? William Donnelly : So you\u2019re right. It was modestly easier comp so in Q1 of 2015, we grew by about 8% and in Q2 of 2015 we grew by about 5%, and then last quarter we grew 5% on the 8%, so about 13% two-year growth, and now the 10% would imply 15% two-year growth and a slight therefore acceleration in the two-year growth. If we look out to the next quarter, the comp will be 7%. So I think our view is that lab will grow well. The two-year growth rate will continue in a similar kind of range to what we have on a year-to-date basis, and specifically in terms of the end-market as Olivier mentioned biopharma spending is good. It should continue to be good, but you know comps [ph] matter of it. Michael Ryskin : Yeah, nothing a substantial difference, not to your run rate there. William Donnelly : That's substantial. And I think it could probably be explained by a larger order here or there. Michael Ryskin : Okay. That's helpful. And in terms of the gross margins sort of similar question, you mentioned that, you know, it was mostly flat in 1Q, but you had the strong 160 basis points improvement this quarter. Is this -- was it mostly just making up for some weakness you had in 1Q, you mentioned pricing material costs, the 50 basis improvement going forward. Is that still in play for future quarters? William Donnelly : Yeah, I think -- so we're at I think it\u2019s 80-plus on a year-to-date basis and that might be a little bit more than we would expect in Q3 and Q4 but still something probably north of the 50 basis points in Q3 and Q4. As we mentioned on the last call we really just had a very tough comp vis-\u00e0-vis Q1 of year ago on our gross profit margin. It was by far the biggest year-on-year increase that we had our year-end. And so I think kind of work themselves out on year-to-date basis in terms of the expense so we feel that the gross profit margin expansion that you guys have got used to should continue now. Michael Ryskin : All right. Thanks. I will get back in the queue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys. This is actually Phil on behalf of Paul. I just have one question. You were kind of highlighting Services and Products, if you maybe could just by either by segment or by geography kind of where are you seeing strengths for each of those. There's any anomalies in terms of growth of demand. Thanks. Olivier Filliol : So if I take it by geography actually I will talk with the performance across the geography. But what I would highlight as particular nice is that we in Asia Services going very nicely. China had actually good growth of multiple quarters despite the product range [indiscernible] and the Services are growing that had a good reflects that our initiative have actually real impact and then we capitalize that growth. A highlight of the perfect market of age, of course, our penetration attach the place of Service is higher in mature markets and seeing us and catch up in emerging market side. If we talk about business segment particularly with ionized product where Service is going very nicely over the last couple of quarters and in terms of profitability but also pretty benefit is this particularly for us is Services increasingly across all the business, Products in particular. So that's probably benefit of the flavor that it would get [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is [indiscernible] in for Ross, actually on his way out to see you guys. Congrats on a good quarter. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about your services investments that you've been making a lot of the you know and how that's impacting the sales line in terms of -- you know how do you think about the payback for those investments and how does that get address you know show you evidence that confidence in the revenue line trajectory? Thanks. Olivier Filliol : So we used the term Field Turbo and we have found on to weight this field additions have very project oriented in the sense that we really drilled out on the business story that the business line look and where we have these opportunities with good pay back. And what we do is we monitor actually the progress of these. So we monitor on one hand the implementation of it, are we successful in recruiting, onboarding, building up the pipeline and all the things. I'm very happy with how it\u2019s going. We do kind of [indiscernible] support for that. We need to [indiscernible]. But then when it comes to the financial results, of course, it\u2019s a little bit more difficult to isolate, but we have also dashboard behind us where we look at are we successfully outgrowing across the group average. Where we [indiscernible] and there is a very nice correlation between [indiscernible] where we are accelerating our growth. So I really feel good about it. Definitely [indiscernible] reflects in our results that this is paying off. We were talking about service before. Service is also an area where we did very positive addition [indiscernible] sales or services. We use like telesales and dedicated service and sales resources for service and [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Great. And then just one quick follow-up. Do you have any worries about any industrial softness or purchasing delays in Eastern Europe post Brexit? Thanks. Olivier Filliol : Not really. I think actually overall the industrial business is not too great [indiscernible]. I don't see anything get worse at all. On the contrary we could see very gradually things getting better and in Europe overall I expect that within the next few quarters we will be reasonably good. So the Brexit effect I am not saying it\u2019s positive, but it's also not particularly negative. [indiscernible] with one exception, U.K. itself. But we need to [indiscernible] U.K. is a [indiscernible] percent of our total revenue. U.K. had already some softness before Brexit. I would associated some of the softness with the uncertainty and certainly after the whole uncertainty [indiscernible] further up and we will expect some further softness in U.K. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. That was super-helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Isaac Ro : Hi, guys. Thank you. Just the first question on regional performance. On Europe you mentioned the 4% growth that was helped by [indiscernible]. If you back that out, just wondering if there was another effect there in terms of market share or something else that would have allowed you to grow faster than the actual market? William Donnelly : I think it's sometimes difficult to point specifically to market share gains. I think if we look in our lab in particular within one quarter, Isaac, but if we look at how we\u2019re performing in lab and product inspection, I would say those are two categories that we would view ourselves doing very well competitively and very well specifically in Europe. As a reminder, Europe is the place where we have the largest percentage of direct sales. And so many of our [indiscernible] initiatives are often most fruitful there. Isaac Ro : Got it. And then on the acquisition, I was just trying to put together some of the numbers you gave us. I think you mentioned 50 basis points contribution in the back half. Curious if you can give us a little sense of that number, what it assumes in terms of timing of deal closed in the third quarter, just so we get a sense of like the annualized impact? And then as part of that, just wondering, I don't think you mentioned how the revenues will be allocated between lab and industrial. I apologize if I missed that. William Donnelly : Okay. So a couple questions. So on an annualized basis, it's [indiscernible] about 1% of sales, and then we're assuming it's going to close in the next couple of weeks. And it's at 1% on an annualized basis [indiscernible] by a week or two I think. That won\u2019t make a material difference. And then the nature of the business would be that the vast majority of it will be inside the lab business. Isaac Ro : Got it. Thanks very much. Sorry to miss the event. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of an Dan Arias from Citigroup. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys. This is actually [indiscernible] behalf of Dan. I just wanted to take a step back just given the macro shift that we saw at least in terms of -- I'm surprised that over the last few weeks and kind of get an update on your view of how you guys think of the structure of your business. I remember last year when we use the tag Swiss franc conversations are being had as to whether or not you guys would shift from your cost to the euro dollars versus Swiss franc just kind of want to get an update on that in light of needs whether anything is fundamentally changed. Olivier Filliol : Yeah regarding Switzerland note currently it\u2019s actually didn't move particular it's worth make a difference and Swiss matters was something that we initiated with a multiyear plan and we are progressing very well on that plan and I am very happy with the progress that we're making. The currency moves that took place is impacting our producing organization in U.K. As we might know we have for the Product Inspection we have the metal detection at the x-rays production there this is an attempt a favorable for us, but it will not change something to our global manufacturing strategy or output. So I don't see that this will impact our strategy in any significant way. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. No fundamental change you're hedging strategies either. Olivier Filliol : In terms of hedging, no. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And I guess another one for me is the incremental margin in 2Q I have at right a little bit north 30% kind of in line what we have seen over the last few years and little bit higher Q-o-Q. Just surprised given the 6% organic I know you guys have prioritized some investments that would be net dilutive. Just kind of want to get a sense of how you guys looking at incremental margins going forward especially in the context of you know kind of a 3% to 4% growth and north and south of that where you think it can go on the incremental basis. William Donnelly : Yeah, so maybe a little bit of clarification in terms of the incremental margin I think at least the way we calculated it it's the 31% in were measured in actual dollars, but it's actually about 34%, 35% in constant currency, so probably closer to maybe what you would expect it. And then those included in there was a bid asset catch up and made investment to incentive payment in terms of our SG&A increase. And so we did trigger some reevaluation of where we expect to finish at the end of the [indiscernible] target. And maybe a last point would be along the lines when we were talking about for a while is that we do like the effectiveness to date in the Field Turbo program so either certain some brand investment with our -- to our internal program be in the quarter-end. And you'll see a little bit of that forward. In terms of our incremental margin I continue to think that, you know, numbers [indiscernible] are very realistic and frankly with the caps at the judgment that the comps in the current quarter won't impact full year number in any material way would have been there. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Can I seek one last one just on China Industrial I mean you guys were relatively tapping to start the year and improved in 1Q in the sense of your outlook. It seems like it it's modestly improved in the second quarters as well is that after it one and two, do you expect to be relatively steady here or you think there's a few one-offs that might provide some mental the close of the year. William Donnelly : So if I look at China in total I think the second quarter was marginally better than the first. If I -- that was largely driven by our bad business and in particular the process analytics in the Lab business. If we look at kind of where we are we would expect a positive second half of the year particularly be to where we - where expectation were once we started the year but probably a little less than what you saw in the most recent quarter I think we grew our Lab business in China by, you know, close to 20% in the second quarter, and I think we don't expect that kind of growth a little bit large order driven and particularly in the third quarter. We probably sitting here today would estimate that maybe the fourth quarter [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : I appreciate all the color, guys. Congrats on the quarter. William Donnelly : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tycho Peterson : Actually, Bill, just following up on the China question. Could you give the exact growth number for China? I may have missed it. Are you still expecting kind of low-single digit, mid-single digit for the full year? William Donnelly : Yes, I think at this stage, I think mid-single digit would probably be a pretty good guess. Specifically in the second quarter, we were at 9.5%, 10%, and about 20% on the lab. Tycho Peterson : And then product inspection, that's been a bit of a drag for a while. I think you previously mentioned you're expecting something around high-single digits for the year. Can you maybe just talk about some of the dynamics? What caused the decline this quarter and when do you think things turn there? William Donnelly : Yeah, maybe just to clarify, at least for us we\u2019re thinking this is the first decline from a sales reported number, the first weak number. I think it\u2019s been pretty consistent. It was 7% in the first quarter, 6% last year. It\u2019s totally in backlog build. Actually the order entry in the quarter was high-single digits, and we were looking for a return to high-single digit or better in the third quarter. In the details of the why, if you kind of look at what happened in our product mix, as you know, it's one of the longer lead time products that we have in the portfolio, and just the mix changed a bit in a quarter where there were a lot more within [indiscernible]. So we're very happy with how that business performed in terms of execution, and continue to think that the market dynamics are good in that business, Tycho. Tycho Peterson : Okay, then just lastly, what are you baking in, in the back half for core industrial out of Europe? Are you assuming things improve from here? William Donnelly : Yeah, let me double-check the details. So maybe in the second half of the year we think we'll have some growth. I\u2019ve to double check and see if there are any large P&L orders [indiscernible] something in the second half of last year, but I don\u2019t think so. So some modest growth, single-digit growth. Tycho Peterson : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Steve Willoughby : Hi, guys. Good evening. Just two things. Bill, the EPS guidance increased as you guys did. Are you guys expecting any accretion in the back-half of the year from the acquisition you've done here? And then I guess secondly, it's not every day that you guys do a lot of M&A stuff. But just wondering if there was any \u2013 do you think there are other future opportunities down the road for further consolidation of smaller lab manufacturers such as this? William Donnelly : I'll take the first part of the question, but let Olivier start with the second part of your question. Olivier Filliol : So this is a case that fits perfectly now with franchise. From a size perspective, it\u2019s really core. With these opportunities around, yes, we definitely go for them. We have a radar of possible targets and there are more such companies. But actually you can\u2019t really time when they\u2019ll become available [indiscernible]. So we really pursue them and whenever they materialize, we are more than happy to close them. We are looking at smaller ones too, but you shouldn\u2019t look that as a new path strategy that we are pursuing here. Yes, we did a couple of technology adjacencies and this time we had a great opportunity to acquire actually a service business, and if that pops up again we will do so. William Donnelly : Okay. And with regard to, it should add a couple pennies, maybe up to a nickel in a best case scenario. And that would include us making some investments in terms of different things on the growth side, for example, international distribution enterprise. Okay. Steve, any other questions? Steve Willoughby : No. That's good. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Richard Eastman : Just a couple of follow-ups on the Troemner acquisition. Olivier, did they compete with you or is just kind of fill you know a regional hole in your service capabilities, is that is that part of the fit here. Olivier Filliol : So we did compete but while in Europe we are market leader, in the U.S. Troemner was the market leader and we had a relatively small weights and weight calibration of business in U.S. and talk it perfectly fit our franchise. Richard Eastman : I see. Okay. Olivier Filliol : Troemner has a fantastic brand and confident in U.S. that they build up over decade that always made it difficult for Mettler to lead or to compete. As in Europe we have been the leader with patent it was difficult Troemner to establish a presence in Europe. Richard Eastman : I see. And did they route to market for their mixers and stirs and some of the basic lab equipment, did that go through Ore House [ph] or how did they get to market with those products? Olivier Filliol : Now so they use other indirect channels and Ore House was not a part of them and they have -- that they have multiple brands that they also leveraging at this current stage and we're going to maintain that, but in addition we definitely want to leverage the Ore House brand or the Ore House franchise to expand in particular also in international markets where Troemner was a particularly strong with their lab equipment business. Richard Eastman : I see. Okay. And then, Bill just a question, you know, we took up the 16 core growth guide from 4% previous leader now more like 5% and did you did you suggest earlier that, you know, 50 bps the basic points of that increase was due to Troemner? William Donnelly : Correct. Richard Eastman : Okay. So\u2026 William Donnelly : \u2026the pure organic number by 50 bps. Richard Eastman : Okay. Despite the strength that you are seeing out of Asia-Pac and even you know the reacceleration maybe in Europe, I mean that's -- is that a high confidence forecast that that's all that would contribute in the second half? I would think that geographically is that Asia-Pac seems to be driving more upside than that. William Donnelly : You know I understand the comment if you -- I think that the comment that we've been making now in the last couple of quarters, Rick, is that given over capacity as well as credit risk in the Chinese market that it's worth put a little bit of a discount on that piece of it that would kind of number one. And number two would be in the details now and I am not counting a lot of basis points but that we see some tougher comps in a couple of different areas. So if you look at our year-to-date number we are plus 5% and we're saying A, by the end of the year we should finish it 4.5% at the midpoint of the range and I guess closer to 5% at the high end of the range, so let's see how China and some of these comps play out. Biopharma has been a strong market for a while. I'd like to think that there is upside to the numbers but we'll see as the quarter and the second half plays out. Richard Eastman : Okay. This is great. And then just one last question maybe for Olivier the Lab strength in China is that, you know, somewhat traditional relative to the other geographies? In other words is that coming out of the biopharm vertical or, you know, are we seeing more uptake there in other labs, environmental or food and beverage or is it -- is a strength there by vertical kind of match up with U.S. or Europe. Olivier Filliol : I would say yes to both what you said. [indiscernible] generally the Lab is doing well, but I would also say, yes, that the life science and biopharma is particularly strong in China. Richard Eastman : It is, okay. Great. Thank you much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your line is open. Brandon Couillard : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Just, Bill, circling back on China, just give us an update kind of on what\u2019s the current or latest KPI readings, how they're faring in China in general, and if you could give us the order growth rate in the period. William Donnelly : Maybe on the economic stuff, I\u2019m not sure if we\u2019re a better source than kind of what you guys read. I think it's a bit of a lot of economic data globally. It\u2019s a bit of a mixed picture. Maybe one interesting insight we might give you is that I know there\u2019s been some articles that some of the GDP growth has come from leveraging up further some of this state-owned enterprises and regional governments, and it was interesting for us to see when we sorted through the details of our numbers that we saw really good growth, of course, in the government sector when it came to labs, but we also saw across the board a very good growth with multinationals. And that's an interesting comment in the sense that if you look over the last three years, the percentage of our total sales in China going to multinationals has shrunk, but now we see a nice rebound in the first half of the year across product categories, and I think that this famous comment that we talked about for a multinational company, they can defer the replacement cycle for a while on our products, but eventually it bounces back and I think we see that a little bit there. It\u2019s probably a little less on the project side but much more of this return to the normal replacement cycle. In terms of the order entry, the order entry was similarly positive to what we saw on the sales side. So it was a solid number. It\u2019s not that purely the order entry would make us cautious about the second half; it's just the realities of that it\u2019s still a market with some instability in it, and I think us remaining cautious makes sense, but I actually felt what we just shared with you about multinationals was one of the more positive readings that we had in our data coming out of China. Brandon Couillard : That\u2019s helpful and just two other quick steps. Could you give us the net ASP in the second quarter? How you\u2019re feeling about the second half? And then should we assume the tax rate still 24% in the second half? William Donnelly : Sure. So in terms of our price increases, our net realized price increases were 230 basis points up in the second quarter, and on a year-to-date basis they're now up at 2%. We did go and look \u2013 and just to put that in a little bit of context, some of that was us chasing some of the currency movements. That\u2019s going to happen in the course of the earlier part of the end of the first quarter, early part of the second quarter. And so we are trying to do something in terms of mid-year prices. I would not expect the second half of the year to be worse than 2% at this point in time. Brandon Couillard : Super, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. William Donnelly : Hey, Brandon. Tax rate we expect at 24%. I realized I forgot to answer that part of your question. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to Mary Finnigan. End of Q&A Mary Finnegan : Thanks, Nicole, and thanks, everyone, for joining us tonight. Hey, as always, if you guys have any questions or any follow-ups, please don't hesitate to contact us. Take care and have a nice night. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Olivier. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter are on page three of the presentation. Let me start by saying it was a very good quarter and it reflected strong strategy execution by our teams around the globe. Local currency sales growth was 9% in the quarter with broad-based growth in all regions and most product lines. Demand in the Americas and Europe was very good. Asia, rest of the world did particularly well with good growth in China and strong growth in most other countries in this region. We are very happy with these results, which reflects solid market conditions and as already mentioned, continued strong execution of our strategies. With the benefit of our margin and cost initiatives, we had good growth in margins which contributed to excellent growth in earnings per share. Cash flow was also quite good in the quarter. We are very happy with our performance as well our outlook for the remainder of the year and 2017. Before I turn it to Bill to cover the numbers, let me comment on the management changes that we announced today. Many of you have met Shawn Vadala most recently at our Investor Meeting in California in July. He has worked with Bill for almost 20 years and was promoted to CFO three years ago. Shawn is highly respected within our organization for his knowledge of our business and its processes as well as his business acumen. Shawn has been a key contributor to many of our margin enhancement programs. For example, pricing has been an important profit driver for us and Shawn has led our efforts in pricing since the beginning. Shawn has also played an important role in helping effectively shape the resource allocation within the organization toward our strategic priorities of the fast growing, more profitable businesses. Shawn has worked closely with me to initiate our big data analytics programs. For the next 12 months we expect Shawn to continue to focus on his existing responsibilities and you will gradually see him more on the Investor Relations front beginning in about a year from now. Some of you have also met Oliver Wittorf at our investor meeting. Oliver has been with us for 13 years and has one of the most diverse and key careers within our management team. Oliver has held a number of important roles including being Head of Operations for our Boston-based process analytics business. He was a project lead in China for our Blue Ocean program and for the last few years, he has held our Global Supply Chain Team Lead, which included our very successful procurement program and the establishment of our regional hubs. He will keep his supply chain responsibilities and take over daily responsibility for IT and Blue Ocean. He is ideally suited for this expanded role within the organization. I am confident that both Shawn and Oliver have the experience and track record to be strong contributors to our executive team and to further the development of the finance, supply chain, IT and Blue Ocean functions within our organization. I have worked with both of them over many years and look forward to many more years with them in their expanded roles. From an investor perspective, very little will change over the next 12 months and Bill and Mary will remain your principal contacts. Bill will gradually reduce his time commitments and beginning in 2018, Bill will begin to hand over the investor relations activities to Shawn and ensure a smooth transition. Mary will continue in her role in investor relations and treasury and continue to be your day-to-day contact. Finally, I want to express how pleased I am that we have orchestrated a smooth and well-planned succession for Bill and that we can continue to leverage Bill's unique contribution to the company for another two years. Bill demonstrated his great leadership in nurturing his successors and often working with me to make this a gradual transition, which I'm very grateful for. Let me hand it over now to Bill. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thanks, Olivier, and hello everybody. Let me reiterate or reinforce Olivier's last point. I'm pleased about the transition that we've put in place, and proud that we have developed these two strongly highly capable leaders in Shawn and Oliver. Further I'm happy to continue to serve this great company and help drive its development for the coming two years, and of course, I also look forward to working with all of you. Now, let me come back to the quarter and cover the financials. Sales were $650.6 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 9% in local currency. The Troemner acquisition contributed about 1% to that growth. On a dollar basis our sales grew by 8% as currencies reduced sales by about 1% in the quarter. On slide number four, you have local currency sales growth for the third quarter. Our sales grew 7% in the Americas, 8% in Europe, and 11% in Asia/rest of world. America's growth excluding Troemner was about 6%. In the next slide we provide year-to-date local currency sales growth which was 6%. By region, Americas had a growth of 7%. Europe is 4% and Asia/rest of world has increased 8% on a year-to-date basis. Now on to slide number six. We outline sales growth by product area for the quarter. Lab had good growth with local currency sales growth of 9%, of which approximately 2% was from Troemner. Industrial increased by 8% and food retailing increased by 13%. All these comparisons are versus the prior year. The next slide summarizes year-to-date sales by product line. Lab had a local currency sales growth of 8%, industrial, 5% and food retailing 6%. Now to slide number eight. Let me walk you through the key items in our P&L for the quarter. Our gross margins were 56.8%, that's a 60 basis point improvement over the prior year amount of 56.2%. Pricing and material costs decreased as pricing increases and material cost decreases contributed to the improved margin, which was offset in part by some targeted investments in our service business as well as an unfavorable mix. R&D amounted to $30.1 million, that's a 6% increase in local currency. SG&A amounted to $187.7 million, that's an increase of 8% in local currency over the prior year. Higher variable comp largely explained by assumed higher performance against our budget targets, as well as investments in our Field Turbo program, were offset by cost savings in other parts of the business. Adjusted operating income was $151.7 million in the quarter. That's a 13% increase over the prior year amount of $134.3 million. Currencies benefited operating profit by $1.5 million and, yes, that was not a typo. We had a currency benefit this quarter. The first one in some time. Adjusted operating margins were 23.3%, that's 110 basis point increase over the prior year. A couple of comments to the P&L. Our amortization was $9.1 million while our interest expense was $7.2 million. Our effective tax rate continued to be 24%. Our fully diluted shares for the quarter were 26.9 million, that's a 4.4% decline from the prior year reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.89 per share, a 19% increase over the prior year amount of $3.26 per share. On a reported basis, earnings per share was $3.77 as compared to $3.16 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.04 of restructuring, $0.05 of purchased intangible amortization, and $0.03 of acquisition transaction costs related to Troemner. The next slide shows the year-to-date P&L. We had local currency sales growth of 6%, operating income increased by 9% and adjusted earnings per share increased by 15%. Now taking a look at cash flow. In the quarter, free cash flow amounted to $125.6 million as compared to $107.1 million in the prior year. We remain pleased with working capital management and achieved further improvements in DSO. ITO was 4.6, which was flat with last quarter. Cash flow on a year-to-date basis amounted to $263.7 million. That's an increase of 16% on a per share basis. For the year, we expect free cash flow in the $380 million range. Now let's turn to guidance. We are raising our full-year 2016 local currency sales guidance to approximately 6% versus 5% previously. This reflects organic growth of approximately 5.5% and about 50 basis point of sales growth from the Troemner acquisition. We have also raised our earnings per share guidance and now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $14.61 per share to $14.66 per share. That's a growth of approximately 13%. This compares to our previous guidance of 11% to 12% growth or $4.40 per share to $4.50 per share. With respect to the fourth quarter, we expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 5%. This includes approximately 1% growth from Troemner. We assume adjusted EPS will be in the range of $5.08 to $5.13. This reflects a growth rate of 9% to 10%. Now let's turn to 2017. We are coming off a very strong third quarter and we have expectations for a solid Q4 as well. We believe we are executing well. We have a strong product pipeline. Our Spinnaker sales and marketing programs as well as our Field Turbo investments are yielding tangible results. These factors are within our control and we feel confident about them. Offsetting these positives are some lingering questions regarding the global economy. In particular, we see continued risk in China, some uncertainty in Europe, and we will face tougher comps for example in our lab business as well as the Americas. Taking into account these factors, we expect local currency sales growth to be about 5% in 2017. This will include 50 basis points from the Troemner acquisition. This should result in adjusted EPS in the range of $16.05 to $16.25 per share and that's a growth rate of 10% to 11%. We expect currency to reduce adjusted EPS growth by about 1% in 2017. In terms of quarterly guidance for 2017, as usual, we'll provide that on our upcoming calls. However I know you'll be updating your model and I just want to point out that we will have a tough comp in Q3 next year, given the very strong results that we are reporting today. In terms of currency impact on sales growth, we expect currency to reduce sales by about 1.5% in the fourth quarter. This will result in a 2% impact on sales growth for the full year 2016, and in 2017 currency should reduce sales by about 1.5%. Finally, in terms of cash flow next year, we expect free cash flow to be in the $390 million range. This reflects a 6% growth on a per share basis, which is below our normal target and that has to do with higher capital expenditures. As we explained last year, our CapEx levels in 2016 and 2017 are higher due to facility expansions related to our product inspection businesses as well as a facility consolidation we are doing in Switzerland. These expansions will amount to approximately $55 million in 2017. We've built into our assumptions $500 million of share repurchases next year, which is the same amount as we did this year. Okay. That's it from my side, and I now want to turn it back to Olivier. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thanks, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab had a very good growth in the quarter. All product lines performed well. Our strong product pipeline, benefit of Field Turbo investments and continued strong sales and marketing programs are all contributing to favorable results. Spending by our biopharma customers continues to be favorable. While government and academia was not strong in the West, it's not a big segment for us. Industrial was stronger-than-expected in the quarter, including core industrial which increased mid-single digits. Core industrial was particularly strong in Asia/rest of the world, but was up in China as well. In the Americas and Europe, we benefited from some projects in transportation and logistics, but the core industrial markets remain difficult. Product inspection was up strongly in the quarter, with particularly good growth in Americas and Europe. We continue to penetrate large multi-national food companies as the supply of choice as they seek to standardize the product inspection equipment. We have made some good inroads over the last 12 months to 24 months and we expect good results in the fourth quarter as well. Finally, retail increased 13% in the quarter, much better than we had expected as some projects moved forward for Q4. We had good growth in all regions. We would expect retail to be down in the fourth quarter. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales growth in the Americas continues to be very solid. Biopharma and food were our strongest segments. Lab had growth against strong comparisons in the prior year. Product inspection and retail did very well in the quarter with a number of large projects. Core industrial also had growth and benefited from some project activity in transportation and logistics, but as expected, many industrial segments remained weak. Europe's growth exceeded expectations. Similar to the U.S., Biopharma and food were good segments. Lab and product inspection benefited from these trends. Core industrial benefited from some transportation and logistics activity, but similar to the U.S., many industrial segments were weak. Finally, retail also had very good growth, and as already mentioned, was partially due to some projects moving from Q4 to Q3. Asia/rest of the world grew double-digits in the quarter. Lab growth in China was again in double-digits with almost all product lines showing very good growth. We continue to be very pleased with this performance, which reflects the good demand, particularly in life sciences as well as the benefit of our actions to redirect resources to fast growing market segments. Industrial in China had modest growth as we continue to be impacted by the overcapacity in the industrial manufacturing sector. We are seeing good growth in certain industrial markets such as chemical pharma and OEMs, but this is being overshadowed by weakness in markets such cement and metals. One final comment on the business. Service grew 6% in the quarter. Those are all my comments on current business trends. Now let me provide a broader update on our strategy and how it continues to evolve and positions us well for the next year and beyond. Let me start with our sales and marketing strategies. At our Investor Day in July we discussed one of our new initiatives in this area and that is our effort to generate leads and better focus our sales efforts by leveraging big data. Our data sources include our contact database, our installed base of instruments, hits on mt.com, and increasingly rich data streams from Blue Ocean as well as some third-party data. We are becoming more sophisticated in how we use this data to target incremental growth. We are in the early stages of developing the potential of big data, but we already see opportunities to refine our current strategies and identify new sources of growth and sales productivity. As shared at the Investor Day, we are using big data to help us identify better where customers are investing, account locations that need more focus on cross-selling, and the likely effect this means to succeed. We also recently launched Spinnaker 5, which is focused on increased sales productivity. The tools from Spinnaker 5 are being used to help units refine their channel strategy, more effectively balance the resources between field and inside sales, and achieve better results in account penetration and cross-selling. Finally, we have started our next wave of Field Turbo and expected to add 200 additional field resources in 2017. We believe the first waves of this Field Turbo program have been effective in helping us gain share. We talk to you a lot about sales and marketing, but our share gains would not be possible without an excellent product pipeline. It continues to be very strong, particularly on the lab and product inspection side. Let me give you one example from our Rainin pipette business. As a reminder, we have proprietary pipette with superior ergonomic design and which each have an embedded RFID chip for tracking. The team is now launching SmartStand, an easy-to-use pipette asset management system. This instrument can store up to four pipettes and read the embedded RFID chip to immediately determine if the pipette is within required calibration specification. For regulated labs in the pharma biotech industries, this is a major support tool that eliminates the manual and time-consuming process of tracking calibration dates to verify the pipette is proper to use. Our pipettes have long been known for the ability to provide reproducible data. SmartStand further helps our customers to ensure this data was generated on a verified pipette. We believe it will help drive our service business as well as lab conversions, as more researchers seek to benefit from our RFID-enabled pipettes. This is one new product launch that's representative of how we continue to drive value of our customers. As you can see, we have much underway in terms of targeting top-line growth. We also continue to make very good progress on our margin initiatives. Our pricing, productivity and supply chain initiatives continue to evolve and yield tangible results. There is a lot of work behind all of this, particularly in an organization as ours that has so many complexities. With continued diligence, we can move these initiatives to the next level. That concludes our prepared remarks. In summary, we believe we are executing well and market conditions are good enough for our customers to keep their replacement cycles. With the benefit of our growth initiatives, we believe we are continuing to gain share and continue to improve our margins. Assuming demand in our markets remain stable, we expect to continue to generate good sales and earnings growth. I want to now ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Tim Evans with Wells Fargo Securities. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you so much. On the strength in industrial, it sounded like the growth there was driven primarily \u2013 or the surprise I should say \u2013 was driven primarily by a couple transportation and logistics items. If you stripped those out, would the underlying growth have kind of been that low single-digit territory where it's been running? And secondarily, I was wondering if those two projects were pulled forward from Q4. Thanks. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: So maybe, so first, for our industrial business in total, the key good performer was actually product inspection. Product inspection grew by low double-digits in the quarter. We did do mid single-digit kind of growth in our, what we would refer to as our core industrial business. That business would have been maybe \u2013 trying to do the math here in my head \u2013 maybe 1.5 less without the T&L projects. The T&L projects maybe weren't as close on our radar screen, and frankly they are a little bit smaller. The retail projects did move from Q4 into Q3, and that's the one that was we more had in mind with that reference to coming a little earlier than we expected. The T&L project I think largely came in maybe in total a little better than we expected, but wasn't so much different than we expected from a timing point of view. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi. Just a couple quick things. Good afternoon, by the way. Could you just dig into pricing here a little bit? Not just on this quarter, but also Bill, what kind of price? Did we trendline price out into 2017 when we talk about guidance? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah. We did. We run a couple different scenarios. So I think the good news on pricing is that the tools we have, the strategies we have, the products we get to apply pricing to continue to get better. But it is a lower inflation environment globally. That represents some different challenges, so I think kind of at a baseline level, I could imagine we maybe only do 150 bps next year. But I also see some upside in terms of Shawn and the team are putting together some new things in the area, for example of services, where I think we have some opportunity and also reaching out to some other countries. So I hope that there is a little bit of upside to that number too. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then I also just had a question, Olivier, when we talk about the 5% growth for 2017, would you just kind of handicap the risk to that number, either geographically or by product segments? I'm curious, where might you see the biggest risk, and conversely, maybe the one area or two areas where you see the best possibility of upside? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Okay. In terms of risk, if I look to Asia, it's particularly China, and how will industry do in China? And that's rather difficult to predict and as we described before, for industry China, their segments that do well, chemical, food and so on and the others still difficult. But forecasting and anticipating how the Chinese economy do overall is difficult and the industrial business is particularly exposed to the cycles in China. And of course we have also comparison topics. We have, for example, a very strong performance in biopharma, I would here highlight, including also in Europe. And we going to feel that next year. How will this evolve is, in that sense a certain risk in it. Now, on the upside, I would say China industry could actually clearly come stronger in than we expect. As I mentioned before, there is a high volatility on that one, so that's one. If biopharma continues to be that strong, we would benefit across many businesses. That would be really nice. And then there is a certain pent-up demand that we had always seen when a overall economy strengthen, pent-up demand in CapEx where core industrial would benefit in particular. So that's another upside that I could see. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): One thing strengthened. Okay. And just maybe one last question, promise; just kind of open ended question here a little bit. I think \u2013 Olivier, I think you and Bill, if I'm not mistaken kind of do your annual budget \u2013 global tour of your regions in September/October period. And I'm just curious if there's any next level observations either politically or from a business perspective that \u2013 if I'm right on the timing of your tour \u2013 that you brought back with you from, in particular China? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Particular China. Actually... William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: China, I think the one thing the guys told us about was that at the beginning of next year the Chinese Politburo will do their changes. The two top guys will stay in place. If we look back at that historically, this has typically been a time where you maybe see a little bit is \u2013 like, people kind of wait-and-see. But the guys are a little bit more optimistic this year, because with the two top guys staying in place and a lot of people frankly worried about the Chinese economy that there will be more emphasis to kind of keep growing. And so, I don't think \u2013 the five-year plan's in place and I think it's just \u2013 they are optimistic that we won't see a slowdown there. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Actually, in that context the change takes place early in the year and everybody feels by Chinese New Year the uncertainty should be gone. This is different to past changes. And past changes where really the whole team, and this time it's a few people that will retire, age wise, and so there is continuity in the political leadership. One other highlight that we saw during this business review in China was our strengthening position in lab and in particular, Pipettes and pH. I was very pleased to hear that we are winning market positioning and becoming leaders in Pipettes and pH in China which is \u2013 typically takes a couple of years and is very attractive, because of course these are businesses with great profitability, great consumable streams. So this is our examples. We had certainly many more from other countries too. One that for example just to share with, in India we are so pleased to see how the growth goes there. We talked a lot about this Made in India that how this is helping. I mentioned that I love it, because for us we always depend also that the industrial manufacturing is important, drives quality, drives to export industry and that's for example something that I could feel very strongly when I met the Indian team. We see it in our good numbers. They one thing, next year they are moving to a VAT tax structure and that could in the short-term impact a little bit our numbers. But, so every country has something specific. And it was good to sense it. All in all, we came back from the tour in a very positive way. Extremely pleased by the plans, but also \u2013 and I think you referred to that a little bit, the macroeconomic and the government environment, we feel good about that. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC : I'm curious, on the biopharma side, whether by any of this sort of distinct customer sub-segments you saw notable changes in demand or whether there was any bias between higher-priced instrumentation, lower price instrumentation, because we've definitely seen some choppiness from, maybe not peers, but others who address the customer base. So we're just trying to discern if it was a price point question or really it's maybe more specific to certain sub-segments. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Was actually really broad based, and important to say, it's certainly not particular the big pharma. Actually we even saw a few ones in big pharma that slow down some of their purchasings due to internal things like new procurement initiatives and so on. Now, it was in essence broad based. We see good activities with CMOs. We see good activities with CTOs. And we have many businesses that serve this market. So from production to research, we benefited. And I didn't see any particular patterns between the more sophisticated or the more value instruments. It was broad based. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks, Olivier. And maybe, Bill, just quickly on the tax line for next year, I would have thought you guys \u2013 maybe you mentioned it and I missed it but \u2013 have gotten a little bit of a benefit from the stock comp tax shield. I'm just curious what the assumption is there. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: So, we assumed a 24% rate now. We are working through the models. As you guys know, we've been hitting this 24% tax rate for a while, but running a cash tax rate lower than that, in part explained by stock options. So we're \u2013 got to go through and see with the accountants where we come out, but I would assume that that could benefit us a couple percentage points when things get final. I think what \u2013 I'm not sure how much you've studied it yourself, Ross, but one of the things that I think is awkward about it is, it's got to mean people could have quite different tax rates by quarter. So, one of the things we would be dealing with is, we could maybe estimate what the full year impact was, but the nature of it would make our tax rate jump around quite a bit in the quarters, and I think it will take an increased level of investor communication to predict that. And in part, that's why I think we'll wait until maybe February to elaborate on what it will precisely mean for us. But you're right, it's positive. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. Just a couple of clarifications for me. (35:54) William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Hey, Steve. If you are still talking, I think we lost you. It's gotten very quiet. Operator : And Steve, your line is open. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hello? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Steve? Operator : And I believe we've lost Steve. And our next question is from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. I want to spend a minute on Europe. You had a big quarter there and I know you called out the pull forward effect in the retail business. Hoping you could maybe quantify how much that contributed to the local currency growth and wondering if maybe there was a \u2013 secondary effects where maybe your market share gains that you referenced were concentrated in the region and that also helped. Just trying to reconcile the fact that you grew so well there versus what we're seeing everywhere else. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Bill will talk about the quarter effect. Let me just say, overall, it was a great quarter for Europe. Lab and product inspection was particularly strong, really. And also for Q4, in general, good, but we will have declined in retail. But for example, product inspection, that did very well in Q3, will continue to do also Q4 well. So maybe, Bill, just on this effect between the two quarters? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: So our retail business in Europe was \u2013 sorry, lost my spot \u2013 was up about 14% and I think it will be down probably double-digits in the fourth quarter. So it's just kind of a timing topic. As you know, our retail business at the gross and operating margin line's a little less than the other businesses. So, not such a material impact in terms of operating margin and profitability flow through, but yes, timing wise that was the impact. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then just a clarification question on China. Appreciate your comments on the political backdrop. I just want to clarify that that's the reason why you guys kind of called out the potential for a little bit of risk next year in that region as opposed to any fundamental changes in key end markets. Just want to make sure I understood the sources of risk that you guys are keeping an eye on? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Hey, I would say on China, we have seen that predicting China is little bit more difficult and I think particularly for the industrial business. And it's difficult to say when certain industry will pick up again and start to really invest in capacity expansion and all these things. And it could also turn in the other direction. So we are cautious about particular the industrial business. On the lab business I feel much more comfortable that we will have a steady growth. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understood. Thanks so much, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good afternoon. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Hey, Derik. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just a few questions. So, Bill, can you quantify or just give us some guidance on what you are looking for in terms of gross margin expansion year-over-year 2016 to 2017? What's embedded in your guidance? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: 40 basis points, 45 basis points, something in that range up to 50 basis points depending kind of on how currency plays out, and also of course the comments on our pricing initiatives as well, whether we do a little bit better than the 150 bps. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. At your Analyst Day you mentioned, and you just mentioned on the call here your initiative to sort of target and discover where you installed base is and sort of targeting upgrades and replacements in that. I guess, how far into that initiative are you and I guess when we really start seeing some incremental benefits of that? And the question is like, how much of your installed base do you think is amenable to that sort of activity? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: So, we have two big data initiatives that we talked about at the Investor Day. One was these old product replacement initiatives where we have today a very good transparency on all our products installed around the world. And we data mine this to, and associate specific marketing programs to bring these products either under the service contract or upgrade/replace the product. This is ongoing and in that sense we have already benefit. But it's a long journey. This installed base is so huge, and of course our customers don't instantly replace it just because we send the marketing materials or we send over a salesperson with a dedicated value proposition. So I see that as one of many initiatives that we have in Spinnaker that help us drive further growth. We see already the benefit. It will continue to benefit us for many more years. And the same is true actually for the second initiative where we generate sales force targets based on big data analytics and this is something we started to pilot early in the year and we have been scaling it up in Q2. We start to see the benefits, but we have many more years to go until we see saturation in the upside of that. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And then just wanted a clarification. For 2017, what's embedded in terms of the interest income expense line? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: So on interest expense we've got $32.6 million built in. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Very helpful. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, thanks. Can you maybe talk on expectations by segment for 2017, what's embedded in guidance for each of the divisions? And then can you quantify what you are expecting for growth in China as well? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Sure. So let me start with the product areas. So I think something in the mid single-digits for the lab business makes sense, 5%, 6%. I kind of it use now the midpoint of our overall range. In terms of our industrial business, something in the 5% range as well, mid single-digits, but maybe the mix there would be our product inspection business growing faster than our core industrial business. And then a flat or maybe low single-digit growth in retail would kind of get you to the overall picture. And then if you look at it geographically, we're thinking Europe could be low to mid depending on best case/worst case. The Americas probably mid single-digits and then both Asia and China overall, we think mid single-digits probably anyway and could be into the high single-digits. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then can you comment on linearity in the quarter? I know you had the question before about kind of your global tour, but I'm actually just wondering how things progressed throughout the quarter and then any commentary on October trends in particular, if things were off trend relative to what you saw? Thank you. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: I mean, we finished with good order entry, which would be an early indicator for us in terms of September. I think the combination of October and November, which is the piece we have the most visibility on remains pretty solid. I think, as you know Tycho, many of us in the peer group have a certain amount of budget flush. I think we made a reasonable assumption in terms of it being a typical year with budget flush. But December is always the hardest one to predict. Things just come that you didn't have on your radar at all and you just hope you got at least as many as last year. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then just lastly on food retail. I know you talked about that being down in 4Q, but just a visibility on kind of orders there. Are there some bigger tenders coming through? Obviously you saw some pull forward in 3Q. Just wondering what the outlook for that business is. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Hey, if you're okay, Tycho, I think we might have a little bit. It tends to be that after Thanksgiving, and people tend to avoid in the holiday season delivering on many big projects. But there is a lot of work done by our customers in terms of thinking about the next year. So maybe when we see it or when we talk again in February, we'd have a bigger or a better way to answer that. At this point, there are a number of big jobs and that are in play, but the way those work out, what percentage of the big job you get, we won't know for a little while, much less the timing on them. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citigroup. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. Bill, you touched on service. Do you think service growth outstrips product growth again next year? And if so, how wide do you sort of envision that spread being? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Actually, this is our strategy. We feel like we can grow service. We want to grow service more than the product growth. And yes, this is part of our plan for next year. If we grow as we guide you, this should actually be possible. We have very good programs in place. And we have seen, actually, different regions with very strong growth year-to-date in service. I would highlight, for example, Asia. So, yeah, I have that expectation for next year. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then maybe just on the margin opportunity next year, if you look at indirect spend, which I think is something that you guys have been targeting, how much of what you see there in percentage terms is what you might call effectively managed or sort of where you want it, versus what's still open for improvement, and do you think that can be a meaningful source of savings next year as we look to 2017? Thanks. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Sure. So, our indirect spend number is actually the base of it, it's a number in excess of our material spend or direct material spend. I think it's the amount we have under control is in the $500 million range. We have \u2013 sorry, the amount of it's in the $500 million range and I think we have more than 50% now being under what we would refer to as category management. So I think that number will climb a little bit, but I think the way we look at it is we're always trying to come up with new programs that can drive further savings in there. I think we, this year, will save a number in the high single-digit million range and I think we should be able to deliver a number in that range again next year. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Groberg with UBS. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Congratulations for the quarter. Although, I have to say, Bill, it's a sad day to get the press release that we got today that you're leaving although. I've been talking with a few clients, we say only you guys could blow out a quarter and leave yourselves two years for the transition, so I appreciate that. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Sure. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : And I guess just a couple of follow-ups here. Around the quarter itself, it looks like maybe about $0.05 of the quarter you didn't pass on to the full-year. Is that just conservatism, is that some of the pull forward, maybe talk a little bit about that? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah, a little bit \u2013 yeah, the movement on the retail is probably the retail projects is probably the biggest piece. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: I think Mary maybe told me currency got worse by a $0.01 or $0.02 I think as well. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then, Olivier, on the Field Turbo update, I think you said you were going to add 200 people in 2017. Any particular geography or customer segmentation standout in terms of where those are going? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah. Hey. Lab gets quite some attention, and we will add a couple of people for example for our automated chemistry business that we presented to you also in July. We are adding a couple of people for our pH lab business that has a high profitability. And from a geographic standpoint, we have for example Southeast Asia, where we're adding again quite a significant number of people in the context of building up Philippines, Indonesia. But it's relatively broad-based. I had presented today to the board the annual plan where we're adding turbos and we had a geographic map on it. It was nice to see how well spread it is and that's actually the strength of the program that we are working on many projects in parallel and you have many managers that are also supervising and managing these. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Can you guys hear me this time? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: We can, Steve. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Well, thanks for giving me a second crack at it here. So I'm going to ask just one question, but it's a three part or so that's why I'm going to limit myself to just one. The basic topic is are there any items you might want to flag in terms of the progression over the next year or so from quarter-to-quarter? Specifically, I'm wondering and this is I guess a follow-up to Tim's question, is there any impact from timing items in the third quarter that might actually impact 2017 given you mentioned some of those were actually items that were further out? The second piece would be selling days. Any selling day abnormalities, either actually in the third quarter or looking forward? And then the third part of my three-parter is, anything next year aside from the tough comp that we should consider as you think about the progression of incremental margins? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Okay. Good questions. I have answers to at least some of them. Let me start with those and I will have Mary flipping me some lines as well as Shawn. So progression for quarter-to-quarter, I think we kind of mentioned in the conference call script that I think Q3 is got to be a tough comp a year from now. I think you can kind of play it out that way. Not all of it will. If you look at incremental margins it won't be as big an issue there because of the high retail content. You can also assume that we get about a percent or so of sales growth from Troemner in the first two quarters and that stops in Q3 and Q4. In terms of working days, I think the \u2013 it's flat in Q3 of this year and Q4, it's minus 2 working days. And for 2017, I think there is a day difference, that we have a day more in Q1 of 2017 and we catch it back up in Q2. And then it looks like there is one less day in Q3. But I don't think those should be so material. In terms of other things to think about, I can't think. Another one might be timing of some of our Blue Ocean Go-lives. I \u2013 those don't jump out to me right now in terms of being particularly large units, so I think that that shouldn't be so much of an issue. Yeah, I think all of us are kind of nodding that those would be the key items. I think the one other item would be in response to like a follow-up to make sure it resonated with people. Ross asked earlier about this new accounting regulations surrounding accounting for the income tax benefits of stock options in excess of actual value and I think that we are working on trying to estimate that impact now for the full-year. But I do think the way the accounting rules are written, it will lead to quite a bit of volatility by quarter, and that's something that I think we're going to almost have to guide you quarter by quarter at this stage. And so, I would maybe suggest people just leave it typical Mettler flat 24% for now, and that's what we've given you in terms of guidance. But it will probably be an improved number when we talk to you in February, but we're still estimating what that will be. Did I get all the parts to your questions, Steve? Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Sorry. Any impact of timing items in the third quarter on revenues in the first half? It sounded like some of the timing items in the third quarter impacted the events that you actually thought would go further out? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: I think it's mostly a retail topic and it's mostly \u2013 will work itself out Q3 to Q4. So, at this stage I don't see anything \u2013 but we'll let you know. I don't see anything happening in the fourth quarter that would push things out to Q1 in particular. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks so much. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Hi, Brandon. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Bill, you may have just answered my question in the context of the number of days in the fourth-quarter. But even if we strip out the pull-forward of the food retail surge in the third quarter, on the two, three, four year stacked comp basis, you still accelerated on each of those metrics pretty materially in the third quarter, which your guidance seems to suggest a step backward in the fourth, is that simply the days' effect? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah. It's \u2013 hey, I think the \u2013 if you look kind of the impact of the retail moving between the two quarters is 2%. So if you start by reconciling we grew 9%, 8% organically. You kind of get 2 points off to compare the two quarters and then there is 1 point or 1.5 point left. And some of that could be working days. Some of it's the \u2013 just the forecast of how we see things. Some of it might be we're just underestimating a budget flush. I think it \u2013 I would acknowledge that it's the quarter for us that we find most difficult to forecast, Brendon. But we had done the same stack analysis you did along with a series of other internal forecasting measures to kind of come up with this number and we think it's realistic, but I guess we'll see when the numbers come through. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then two more. Do you actually give the China growth rate in the third quarter? And then secondly, you've pointed to I think a 1% headwind on EPS next year from currency. Does that include the heads roll-off affect? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yes. That includes the heads roll-off affect and our growth in China in the quarter was 8% and it's 8% for the full \u2013 year-to-date. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Super. Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Good afternoon, guys. Two quick things for you. Wondering if you could comment at all about what you're seeing in the U.K. over the last few months post-Brexit? And then secondly just on Field Turbo, now that you're in the third wave of adding people if you could provide any color on how quickly these head count additions are ramping up and how quickly they basically start paying for themselves? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Good to hear on the first one. So just to put in perspective, the U.K. is about 3% of our revenue. And, yes, our business has slowed down and it certainly also associated with the Brexit discussions that we have. Of course, our customer base is faced with uncertainty and we see it in our business. What we also did, we had significant price increases that we implemented in the U.K. to offset, of course, the weakening of the pound. Now, just talking about the pound I wanted you to be aware that we have a net short position towards the pound because we have two major manufacturing plants of our product inspection. So, that's at least on the positive side for us. And we will see how it further develops. Typically, when these things happen in a country you have in the short-term an effect and then things rebalance. The second question about the Field Turbo, so we have different ways. There are so many different projects as I described before, so not all of them have the same payback time, I would for example, Asia-Pac, the investments that we do in Southeast Asia that will have a faster paybacks than for to the investments that I referred to in automated chemistry. But all in all, we say, we want to have them reach a breakeven after a year and kind of after two years they should cover their initial investments, and that's also the beauty when we do these in ways. But on a regular basis, the older ways also helped fund the new ways. Okay? Operator : And we have no other questions in queue at this time. And I would like to turn the call back over to our presenters. Mary T. Finnegan - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thanks, Jennifer. And, hey, thanks everyone for joining the call tonight. Of course, if you have any questions, as always, don't hesitate to send us an email or give us a call. Take care. Thanks. Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you for your participation and this does conclude today's conference call. And you may now disconnect.",

I'm going to turn the call over to Olivier. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter are on page three of the presentation. We had a strong end to the year, reflecting solid market conditions and good execution. Local currency sales growth was 8% in the quarter, better than expected with very good results in Europe and Asia / Rest of the World. Americas came in pretty much as expected. We are very pleased with these results and the performance of our teams around the world. Continued strong margin expansion led to very good growth in EPS in the fourth quarter. As a result of the strong finish, we achieved a 7% local currency sales growth and a 15% EPS growth for the full year. We are very happy with this performance as well our outlook for 2017. Let me now hand over to Bill to cover the financials. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thanks, Olivier, and hello, everyone. Sales were $709.7 million in the quarter, and that's an increase of 8% in local currency. The Troemner acquisition contributed approximately 1% to local currency sales growth in the quarter, and on a dollar basis, our sales increased by 5% as currencies reduced sales by 3% in the quarter. One slide number four, we show local currency sales growth for the quarter. You can see here that sales grew by 7% in Europe, 15% in Asia / Rest of World and 3% in the Americas. The Americas growth, excluding Troemner, was flat with the prior year. As Olivier mentioned, this is pretty much on track with what we expected and was impacted by strong results last year. You guys often ask us about budget flush. I would say that for us, it was a little less than last year, largely related to what we saw with U.S. biopharma. On the next slide, we provide local currency sales growth for the full year 2016, which was 7%. By region, Europe and the Americas each grew by 5%, while Asia / Rest of World increased 10% for the full year. On slide number six we outline sales growth by product line for the quarter. Laboratory had good growth with local currency sales growth of 8%, of which approximately 2% was from Troemner. Our Industrial business increased by 7% and Food Retailing also increased by 7%. All these comparisons are versus the prior year. The next slide summarizes full year results. Our Lab business had local currency sales growth of 8%. Industrial increased by 5%, while Food Retailing increased by 6%. Now I'd like to turn to slide number eight, and let me walk you through the key P&L items for the quarter. Our gross margins were a record 59%, 100 basis points improvement over the prior year amount of 58%. Pricing, material costs decreases and currencies contributed to the increase, which was offset in part by additional targeted investments, particularly in our Service business. R&D amounted to $30.2 million, which represents a 1% decline in local currency, driven by the timing of new product launches. Our SG&A was $188.2 million. That's an increase of 8% in local currency. Variable comp and investments in our Field Turbo contributed to the increase. Adjusted operating income was $200.2 million in the quarter, and that's an increase of 10% over the prior-year amount of $182.2 million. Currency reduced operating profit by $1.2 million in the quarter. We had expected currencies to be neutral the last time we spoke. Adjusted operating margins were 28.2%, a 110 basis point increase over the prior year. A couple of final comments on the P&L our amortization amounted to $9.9 million in the quarter, while our interest expense was $7.4 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 24%. Fully diluted shares for the quarter were 26.6 million, and that's a 4% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted earnings per share was $5.28 per share. That's a 14% increase over the prior year amount of $4.65 per share. Currencies reduced EPS growth by approximately 1%. On a reported basis, our earnings per share was $5.17 per share. That compares to $4.44 per share in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.05 of restructuring expenses and $0.06 of purchased intangible amortization. The next slide shows the year-to-date P&L. We had local currency sales growth of 7%, while our operating income increased by 10% and our adjusted earnings per share by 15%. As Olivier mentioned, we're very pleased with these results, and they reflect solid market conditions and strong execution. Now turning to cash flow, in the quarter free cash flow was $82.9 million, and that compares to $126.4 million in the prior year. Cash flow in the quarter was impacted by our $37 million purchase of our previously leased pipette manufacturing facility in California. Absent this purchase, our full year cash flow amounted to $384 million. And that's on target with what we discussed with you last quarter. We remain pleased with our working capital management and achieved further improvements in DSO, which was reduced by one day to 37 days as compared to the prior year, while our ITO was 4.6, which was consistent with last quarter. As a reminder, we have some facility expansions underway, which increased our CapEx in 2016 and will also impact 2017. Excluding the pipette facility acquisition and these facility expansions that I just referred to, our free cash flow per share grew by 15% over the prior year. Now let's turn to our guidance. We're coming off a very strong finish to the year, and our outlook for the first quarter is also strong. We believe we're executing very well, and the foundation is built on a robust product pipeline, our innovative Spinnaker sales and marketing programs, the investments we've made in Field Turbos, and they're all paying dividends. These factors are within our control, and we feel confident about capitalizing on them. However, we remain cautious on the global economy, as we see continued uncertainties, for example in the Chinese end markets, industrial end markets, some questions on Europe, and in general, we face tougher comps, particularly in the second half of the year. That provides you with some of the background on our assumptions. Now let me cover the specifics, as we see some moving pieces this quarter. First, taking into account the strong finish to the year, and with the assumption that market conditions remain stable, we're increasing our organic, local currency sales growth assumption for 2017 from 4.5% to 5%. We expect local currency sales growth to approximate 5.5%, as Troemner should contribute about 50 basis points to our growth in 2017. Second, we will implement the new accounting standard associated with the tax impact of stock option deductions. While we're still finalizing our calculation, our current estimate is that this will lower our effective tax rate for the full year from 24% to 22%, but there will also be an increase in fully diluted shares. The option exercises are steady and somewhat predictable on an annual basis, but there will be variability by quarter. When we report our quarterly numbers for 2017, we will reflect a 22% effective tax rate in reporting our quarterly adjusted earnings per share. We think this will be easier for you to understand. The actual tax rate on a quarterly basis will vary depending on actual exercise, but we expect to be at 22% by the end of the year. We believe this will make comparisons against the prior year and guidance easier for everyone. As always, we will include a reconciliation in our quarterly press release so it'll be transparent for you. Overall, we expect the impact of the new accounting standard will add approximately $0.31 to earnings per share. This reflects the reduction in the tax rate to 22%, which is offset somewhat by a higher share count as the tax benefit of option exercise is no longer reflected as a reduction to dilution. While the tax accounting is a nice benefit to earnings, it is somewhat offset by currency. The strengthening of the dollar since November has created a greater headwind than we provided in our initial guidance in November. Rates as of November would have reduced 2017 earnings versus 2016 by about 1% while current rates would be a headwind of approximately 2% versus 2016 actuals. Okay. Taking all these things together, we now expect adjusted EPS in 2017 to be in the range of $16.55 per share to $16.75 per share. That's a growth rate of 12% to 13%. As mentioned already, we expect currency to reduce earnings growth by 2% in 2017 with a greater impact in the second, third and fourth quarters. Now turning to quarterly guidance, we have a few factors impacting the first quarter. First, we're coming off a strong finish to the year. Second, we'll have our easiest comparison in the first quarter. And third, we expect a benefit in terms of the timing of the Easter holidays. If you'll remember, they were in Q1 last year, but they'll be in Q2 this year, and this impacts mostly our European business. Taking all these factors together, we expect local currency sales growth in Q1 to be approximately 8%, and this would include a 1% contribution from Troemner. This will result in adjusted earnings per share of $3.05 to $3.10 per share, something in that range, and that's approximately a growth rate of 24% to 26%. We expect currency to reduce EPS growth in the first quarter by about 1%. As we typically do, we'll provide updated quarterly guidance on future calls. As you update your models, please keep in mind the tougher comparisons in the second half of the year. We've reviewed current quarterly consensus estimates for Q2 through Q4, and we believe that low-double-digit EPS growth in Q2 and Q4 are realistic, while probably a high-single-digit EPS growth in Q3 is our best estimate at this point in time. We thought you would find that information helpful. One additional comment, the impact of currency on sales growth, we expect currencies to reduce sales by about 2.5% in Q1 of 2017 and also for the full year. Finally, in terms of cash flow this year, as we communicated last quarter, we expect free cash flow to be in the $390 million range this year. Our CapEx will be at a higher level in 2017 due to certain facility expansions related to our Product Inspection businesses, as well as the facility consolidation we're doing in Switzerland. These expansions will amount to approximately $55 million in 2017. Excluding these projects from both 2016 and 2017, this would give us a 15% growth in free cash flow per share. Okay. As a reminder, we will continue to assume we'll repurchase about $500 million worth of shares in 2017, and that's it from my side. And I'd like to turn it back to Olivier. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thank you, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. The Lab had very good growth in the quarter. All product lines performed well. We continue to benefit from our strong product pipeline, Field Turbo investments and innovative sales and marketing programs. Spending by our biopharma customers continues to be solid, but we acknowledge we will face tougher comparisons in 2017. Industrial had good growth in the quarter. As expected, Product Inspection had very good growth in quarter. The market dynamics for this business are favorable, and we have a unique competitive position that allows us to capitalize on the growth potential of this market. We expect to start the year with another good quarter in Product Inspection. Core Industrial did better than we expected, with growth in low single-digits, driven by strong growth in Asia, including China. Finally, Retail increased 7% in the quarter. This was better than expected and was driven by strong results in Europe and Asia. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales growth in Europe was strong, driven by Product Inspection and Retail. Lab also had growth, while Core Industrial was down. Sales growth in the Americas came in pretty much as expected. Lab had growth in most product lines, with the exception of AutoChem, which had very strong comparisons from prior year. Product inspection had modest growth against a very strong quarter in the prior year. Core Industrial and Retail were down in the quarter. Asia and Rest of the World grew double-digits in the quarter. All product lines had very good growth. China did better than expected with 15% growth in the quarter. Lab in China continued to do very well, and we were very pleased to see strong growth in Industrial in the quarter. One final comment on the business, Service grew 6% in the quarter. With the strong finish to 2016, we are well positioned to start the new year. We remain cautious on the global economy, and we'll continue to monitor it for risks that could impact customer spending plans. In the meantime, we are focused on those factors within our control and feel confident about them. Our investments in Field Turbos, Spinnaker sales and marketing programs and new products are yielding tangible results, and we believe we continue to drive share gains. Furthermore, our initiatives surrounding Big Data Analytics for sales growth are doing very well and contributing to share gains. We have made great progress in developing Big Data tools, such as sales project alerts and iBase analytics, and I see Big Data analytics developing into a unique competitive advantage. In addition to continued share gains, the other part of our strategy is our focus on productivity, which is a core part of our culture and is fundamental to our story. It is these gains in productivity and efficiency which provide resources to fund our growth initiatives. Let me give you a couple of examples. We are launching a new program to improve the productivity and efficiency in our producing organizations and supply chains. We refer to this program as Stern Drive, which is a form of marine propulsion, which combines inboard power with outboard drive. Stern Drive focuses on operations and the three pillars for its foundation, material cost reductions, shop floor productivity and back office productivity. Our initial priorities are to further challenge material costs as well as variable manufacturing and fixed labor costs. This program is just getting underway and will complement our Spinnaker and Blue Ocean programs. Similar to those programs, I think we will be talking to you about Stern Drive for many years to come. We have achieved great results over many years in increasing the efficiency of our supply chain and manufacturing operations, but with this program we intend to build on those successes and move to another, higher level of performance. We have a variety of productivity measures around the company, including a number which leverage our Blue Ocean platform. The platform has allowed us to develop global and regional shared service centers for a variety of activities, which help us better leverage scale and technology. Blue Ocean has also enabled us to enhance our e-commerce capabilities. We are improving transaction efficiency via integrated end-to-end processing across a variety of different channels and their specific needs. These are just some examples of various productivity and efficiency initiatives we have in place throughout the organization. This productivity focus is part of our DNA and reflects our culture of continuous improvement, which is at the core of all we do. That concludes our prepared remarks. In summary, we believe that if market conditions remain stable, we are well positioned for sales and earnings growth in 2017 and beyond. We will remain focused on execution of our core strategies, which remain central to our success. I want to now ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steven Reiman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. This is Steve Reiman on for Tycho. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to start off, regarding 2017 guidance, can you talk through what your current growth assumptions are by product area? And then are you expecting to see any meaningful pickup in core industrial, because you mentioned it came in a little bit better than expected? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Okay. So maybe I start with how we see things for the lab business. So our lab business should be able to, including with Troemner grow mid-single-digits, a little bit better. And we'll get a similar growth rate from industrial, but with the mix coming, PI actually growing faster than lab, our product inspection business and we expect a little less growth in our industrial business. And then we would expect low single-digit kind of growth coming from our food retailing business. Steven Reiman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. And then just in terms of pricing, is 150 bps still the right way to think about it for 2017? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: I think so. I think we'll know a little bit more in the quarter. We're taking a close look at some of these currency moves. They were a little stronger a while back. There are some parts of the world that maybe we need to go looking at that. I think that's probably an evaluation point for the next couple of months to see if we should push, but that would be largely aimed at maybe trying to offset any more foreign exchange that comes. Steven Reiman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. That's all for me. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Evans from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. One quick clarification first. The comment that you made early on about the biopharma budget flush, did you \u2013 were you saying that there was less budget flush this year than last year? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: I think with regard to our stuff, and the way we say it, so if you think about our \u2013 the comment was specific to U.S. You can see our European numbers were a little bit better. And if we look at our two businesses that have the biggest exposure, they were AutoChem, which had a tough comp, but still their sales were down in North America in the fourth quarter. And in our pipette business, it was the lowest growth rate of the year, still a healthy number, but it was the lowest growth rate of the year that we had. And we think actually both of those guys are going to do a little bit better growth rate in the first quarter, but for AutoChem, the fourth quarter is a more important quarter than the first one. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then if you think about the upside surprise relative to your core revenue growth, would you attribute that more to the macro picture? Or do you think that would be more attributable to company-specific things like share gains? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: I think actually we really executed very well. Our programs materialized well, but we also enjoyed good market environment. We were talking about retail surprised us in Europe. We did execute well, but there was also the markets, how projects came together that we benefited from. So it's a combination. But I certainly also feel that all these growth programs really have good momentum. And that's also why we remain optimistic also in Q1. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good afternoon. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Hi, Derik. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Hi. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, there's a lot of moving parts in terms of the global economy, and obviously, there's a lot of proposed tax changes in Washington going on. Bill, can you just sort of give us a thought on what you're looking at in terms of what's been currently proposed? And how Mettler fits in, given your global infrastructure and everything? Do you have any sort of initial thoughts on what this can mean for the business? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Okay. So we evaluate it a lot, and I would maybe start with we, for example, reviewed some of it with our board today. And one of the things that we highlighted to them was that from \u2013 there's a lot of uncertainty on what might happen and when. I think that the repatriation topic is certainly one that most people think could come because there could be broad consensus with that. That's not a big deal for us in terms of being a benefit. We maybe even would have some one-time taxes to pay there, but if I think about topics like a lower tax rate overall, that can't hurt us. But the U.S. isn't the biggest source of our tax earnings \u2013 or our pre-tax income. And if I go to topics like border adjustability, which I think generally most people think that would be hard to get through in the short-term, I think that our initial reaction would be, hey, we're a net importer overall. So we would have to do some adjustments in areas like pricing or supply chain strategies. I think that we're a company that understands that we would need to do some things, and we would be able to execute on it. But at this point, it seems so premature from our perspective, Derik, that we're not getting ourselves tied in a knot thinking about that. I would also highlight that, and you would recognize this from when we talked in the past about when biopharma, for example, or other companies move their facilities, our instruments don't move very good. And so if there was other \u2013 if there were companies bringing things back to the United States, that would create demand beyond our normal share of the replacement market. It would create new demand, and we would win disproportionately to what we would lose in the markets because of the nature of our product categories. So there could be a positive in that side on an indirect basis. But I think in that area, it's pretty premature at this time to say much more. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And as the growth starts to pick up on the industrial business, do you need to add any incremental sales costs to it, to basically drive the \u2013 any sales support or salesforce behind it? Any cost back to the business? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: I think, Derik, whether the growth comes from industrial or lab, I would say our incremental margins would not be materially different. Maybe they're slightly better on the lab side because of higher gross profit overall, but we do have slightly higher selling costs in the lab side of the business. So I think you could assume in a constant currency environment every extra 1% of sales growth has got to drop something north of $0.30 on a dollar to the bottom line, hopefully a little bit more. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Ross Muken, your line is open. Matthew John Nicolai - Evercore Group LLC : Hi. Yes. Hi. This is Matt Nicolai on for Ross. Thanks for taking the question. Just had a question about your assumptions for 2017 guidance. Just asking if you could provide a little color on the pacing of growth in the U.S. in early January after a mixed fourth quarter? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Hey, I \u2013 if we look at our outlook for Q1 in the Americas, it'll be solid. Better growth rate on a single-year basis than what we saw in the third quarter, to maybe be slightly more specific. Matthew John Nicolai - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then also was wondering if you could give some color on emerging market demand, excluding China, and whether FX settling down a bit is helping demand? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: So overall, very pleased about how all Asia did. Also, outside of China we had, for example, Southeast Asia that did very well. We had India that continues, actually to do well. I'm very happy about that performance. I expect that momentum will stay on, and at this stage I don't expect that currency has a significant impact. Of course, if currency would move even more so, it can, but at this stage we see good momentum in the market. And as I did talk in previous calls, we have made important investments also in certain parts of Asia like Philippines, Indonesia and so on, and we see the paybacks on that. So happy about how they are doing. Matthew John Nicolai - Evercore Group LLC : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Leonard from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Just trying to reconcile some of the moving parts in the guidance. So the $0.50 EPS guide uptick at the mid-point, you said $0.31 of that is the stock comp, offset by how much in foreign currency? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: $0.21, I think. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So something in the $0.20s, so most of the uptick is organic. And, Bill, can you remind me how much EBIT margin expansion you're assuming year-over-year in your 2017 guide? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: So let me answer that in a couple of different ways. So our \u2013 sorry, getting the right columns here in front of me. So on a full year basis, our margins will expand about 100 basis points, on a constant currency basis. Not too much different. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And it does seem, my final question; it does seem like you were trying to hold back a little bit in the guidance from I don't know if exuberance is the right word, but you had a good fourth quarter. If you were to be surprised on the upside in 2017, where do you think the big piece of variability is going to come from market-wise? Or product line-wise? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: I would start with we're always \u2013 Olivier has been pushing a lot of investments on sales and marketing topics and some of the investments in Field Turbos. And I think that there could be upside to that. I think that it's clearly providing some upside right now. And because of, as Olivier mentioned this call and on others, is the product categories such as lab and product inspection, process analytics benefit disproportionately from those investments, as well as certain geographies. And he just mentioned a little while ago Southeast Asia to name one. If I look in even places like Eastern Europe, which was a little bit of a struggle for us when Russia was having its struggles, bounced back for decent growth recently. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. Want to spend a minute on emerging markets, specifically if you could just kind of compare and contrast what you're seeing in South America versus China? I know you have a much bigger business in China, but we don't have a lot of visibility, I think in the last couple of weeks here, in terms of other companies in the space talking about how the year closed out between emerging markets versus \u2013 I mean in China versus South America. I'd appreciate any comparisons you could make. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Two very different situations in the sense that China, the microenvironment and the macro trends are very favorable for us. We have seen, for example, labs doing very well for us now many quarters. In Q4 we have seen that the industrial business started to pick up also for us in China. Still against easier comparisons, but we see some momentum coming back. So all in all, actually we feel good about it. When I look at South America, particular actually Brazil, it's still challenging. Brazil, I don't see that the market is really sustainably recovering and in essence, I feel we still are going to have challenges there and I don't see a strong rebound in Brazil coming. At China, it seems to be a more steady opportunity to build. And again, I want to specify that we had different product categories in China that continue to do very well across many quarters. We did not have that situation in Brazil, for example. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. And then I know it's small, but the retail business, if I look at the full year performance there, it was a pretty solid year, above trend if we go back several years. To what extent do you think that's market share and can you talk about the plan this year to try and repeat that performance? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Absolutely. We are very happy about how retail performed last year, particular Q4 performed better than expected. There were some effects that will not repeat themselves. We had, for example, a change in legislation in Germany that required different labels for customers and that drove some upgrade business that was beneficial and will not repeat. But overall, if I look at the full year, retail did well, and particular also profitability. You might recall in a couple of years ago, we said retail it's not about growth, it's about profitability. I have seen very steady progress over the last years and last year in particular was another big step. In the meantime, retail has reasonable profitability for us and I do expect that they will have a reasonable year this year. But I want also to specify, retail is a lumpy business, has big projects and so predicting it is more difficult and that's maybe also reflected in our Q4 numbers. We did expect things differently and then somewhat project did materialize. So, of course, that could turn out the other way around this year. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks so much, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Arias from Citibank. Your line is open. Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, guys. This is actually Bryan Kipp on behalf of Dan. Just wanted to get some color on the pipette transaction. You guys showed that facility middle of last year and talked about the robotics investments that you guys were doing. In light of the purchase of the facility, does that change anything? Are you guys able to pull forward some investments, expand faster? Just want to get some color there. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: It was \u2013 we \u2013 the property has a bit of a history. It was actually owned by Ken Rainin, the person we bought the business from and we kind of had a right of first refusal in perpetuity. And we felt that there was a unique bargain in the market, based on the company was selling a broader portfolio of assets and valuation-wise we felt like our right of first refusal gave us a good price. And so it was to give you a feeling, the only, at least of significance, I think the only manufacturing facility we had globally that was not owned, again because the history with Ken. And so we saw that it was a good value and we decided to buy it. Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Helpful. And then on China. I was just surprised by the strength in 4Q, yet your tepid view going into 2017. Can you talk through the backlog or give us some color on in core industrial in China, where you're continuing to potentially see weakness despite the strong 4Q? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: So in terms of our industrial business in China, I think that you very much see this just the impact of comps getting easier and some of the really difficult markets related to infrastructure have just shrunk as a percentage of total sales for us. And so if you were to, I'm kind of oversimplifying now, if you were to bifurcate our performance the last couple years in China, you would say we had some good markets that were growing mid to high-single-digits and we had some bad markets that in many cases were down more than double-digits. And so what's happened is the good markets have gotten to be, I don't know, probably I could almost say bigger than the bad markets in terms of our mix and that was different than 2012. And so we feel a little bit better positioned. I would highlight that it's also those are markets that even the good markets are sensitive to credit availability in that part of the world. We probably see more than any other market how when credit availability changes in China, it has a little faster impact on \u2013 it can be more volatile itself, availability, and it tends to have a pretty fast impact in the market. So when you hear us sometimes talk cautiously about the future in China, it's probably less about our competitive position or what we think can happen long term for China, but more about some of these shorter-term topics. Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Helpful. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi, good afternoon. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Rick. Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Bill, just on the back of that last response to the core China strength, you did touch on credit there and the sensitivity of the core industrial in China to credit. But what's conclusion there? We're hearing the credit is actually tightening at this point in time, but how do you see that as we roll into 2017? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: We in our business don't see credit tightening. And I would say that for example, like there's, help me out, Mary, the notes that are there, what do they call those? Mary T. Finnegan - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Bank notes. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: There's something called bank notes, and level of use \u2013 usually bank notes are one of the first steps when credit gets tight there, and it's very low. When, I think what you might be referring to a little bit, Rick, is the idea of getting cash out of China. And I think that's a fair statement. But at least to date, that's not tended to trigger changes in how our market activity goes. Even for ourselves, I think we see it that we aren't changing things because they're a little tighter than they were two years ago. In fact, I would describe the credit tightening that people are talking about now for us, we see this environment as similar to what it was three or four years ago before they did some easing. So it's not, it's really a tightening versus some loosening they did two years ago. It's not much different than what we've had in China for a long period of time. So we could get the cash out of there. Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I see. So but against the China industrial comps then as we roll into 2017, again, a high-single-digit growth, maybe even double-digit, with that credit background would be a decent assumption? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yes. I think we think a mid-single-digit number is realistic. And I would say that we do put a little bit of a discount factor. We probably internally our guys would think they can do better than that, but we think it's prudent to discount it for these things you hear me constantly bringing up, the risk around overcapacity and credit in China. Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Sure. And is the product inspection business in China \u2013 where does that stand as a percentage of your China sales? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: More than 5%, less than 10%. Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Oh, it is. Okay. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yes. Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Okay. Then just one other question on the core industrial business, I noticed again the weakness here in the U.S., we saw the same thing in the third quarter. And I'm curious, the second half of 2016 for core industrial in the U.S. was pretty soft. Is there a message there? I mean it's maybe a little bit surprising, but how do you feel about that business? And maybe what are the dynamics there that have caused that business to have a negative number in front of it? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Okay. So, Mary, just to make sure I'm looking at the right... Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Let me, first of all, we also have different comparisons in this business. And there were some bigger project activities that impacted the numbers too. So I wouldn't read too much just into two quarters. Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Okay. That's fine because I... William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Maybe I'd add too, Rick, and you know how we are sometimes. Even though it only looks like the comp was a plus 7%, the comp a plus 7% in Q4 2015, there was actually a plus 9% in Q4 2014. So on a kind of, a multi-year basis it was... Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Kind of doing the triple stack there. Yeah. Okay. And then just a last question. Around the product inspection business, just maybe a couple quick questions. Is that business \u2013 what is the end market exposure there? I know we talk all the time about packaged foods, but I know you have some pharmaceutical exposure there. Are there any other end markets that are driving the business? And then maybe the second question is around the service side of product inspection, is there still the growth opportunity in service? Or is that market fairly penetrated from a service, I guess, call it attachment rate? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Let me start with service. Actually, great momentum that we have there. There is definitely further opportunities. Our customer base is more and more appreciating the value of service up-time, but also making sure that their instrument is really performing up to expectations. It's also about selling spare-part kits, service contracts and so on. So we have a lot of opportunities, we are proactively going after it. The product inspection service business is one of the faster growing service businesses that we have, including in the very mature markets like in U.S. where we have a great installed base. We are growing it very nicely. To the first part of the questions, in terms of industry segments that we serve, you are right, we serve most of the pharma markets, we serve also the cosmetics market. We have some markets in the chemical, but food is the biggest piece and the food is the one that is particularly going well at this stage. It is really about protecting the brands, and we see many global accounts that are becoming very serious about rolling out standards across the globe, across multiple sites. So it's not just about going after individual sites; it becomes increasingly about upgrading or installing instruments across an account in a country, but sometimes even across whole regions. Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I see. Okay. Thank you. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon. Most of my questions have been answered, but a quick one, Bill. It looks like I think you said free cash flow guidance for the year is unchanged, about $390 million. For some particular reason, that's the case relative to the better, I guess, EPS outlook? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: So sorry, I just want to make sure I followed the question. So your question was, EPS guidance went up and but we didn't raise our... Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : The free cash flow was the same. Right. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: So one piece is that the tax one doesn't change taxes paid. There is some higher guidance number, but I think there's also a revision in our detailed CapEx assumption, slightly. So at this stage, too, Brandon, I acknowledge that the estimates on free cash flow and the timing there can be fluid. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Gotcha. Makes sense. And then could you give us the pricing contribution in the fourth quarter? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Prices were up for the full year 230 bps and it was up close to 3% in the fourth quarter. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Super. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jonathan Groberg with UBS. Your line is open. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Jonathan? Operator : Jonathan Groberg, your line is open. Your next question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Robert Sohngen Cottrell - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Hi. This is actually Rob Cottrell on for Steve. Just wondering if you can update us on the Troemner acquisition? We hear you that that it's added 100 bps to the quarter, but now that you've owned it for six months, just interested on how it's performing relative to your expectations and any additional synergies you see coming from the acquisition. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yes. Actually, integration continues to progress well from an employee standpoint, but as well as from a customer viewpoint, so happy about that. Our current focus is introducing our sales and marketing activities, initiatives and Spinnaker approaches. So we, for example, work on improving leads generation, bringing database marketing to them. So really good and in that sense, I remain enthusiastic and very positive about the potential from the whole combination. So yes, really happy about it. Robert Sohngen Cottrell - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Operator : There are no further questions. I will now turn the call back to Ms. Finnegan. Mary T. Finnegan - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thanks, Jesse, and hey, thanks, everyone, for joining us this evening. As usual, of course, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to give us a call or shoot us an e-mail. Take care and good night, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

I will start with a summary of the quarter, and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter are on page three of the presentation. We had a great start to the year with excellent sales growth. We had expected sales growth in Q1 to be strong, and local-currency sales growth reached 12% in the quarter, better than expected with very good broad based growth. We are quite pleased with these results, which reflect our ability to capitalize on favorable market conditions and very strong execution of our growth initiatives. Further progress on our modern initiatives are reflected in the strong margin expansion, which contributed to an excellent 36% growth in EPS for the quarter. All in all, very pleased with first quarter developments. Our outlook for Q2 and remainder of the year is also positive. Let me now hand over to Bill to cover the financials. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Okay. Hello, everybody. I hope you are all having a good day. Sales were $594.6 million in the quarter, an increase of 12% in local currency. The Troemner acquisition contributed approximately 1% to local-currency sales growth. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales were 10% \u2013 sales increased by 10% as currencies reduced sales by 2% in the quarter. On slide number four, we show local-currency sales growth by region. Sales grew 14% in the Americas, 13% in Europe and 9% in Asia/rest of world. China sales growth was 12%. Growth in the Americas benefited by 3% from the Troemner acquisition. As Olivier already mentioned, you can see that these percentage increases reflect a strong and broad-based sales growth. On the next slide, we outlined sales growth by product line, which is also broad-based. Laboratory sales increased by 13%, while Industrial sales increased by 12% and our Food Retailing business grew by 8%. Troemner benefited from \u2013 benefited our Lab growth by approximately 3%. All comparisons are in local currency and versus the prior year. Turning to slide number six, let me walk you through the key items on our P&L. Our gross margins were 57.7%, a 210-basis-point improvement over the prior year amount of 55.6%. While comparisons were relatively easy as gross margins were slightly down last year, we had a couple of factors that helped our margins this quarter. First, we had good productivity gains in our plants and in our Service business, giving us strong sales growth. Second, we continue to benefit from pricing, which was up by 190 basis points, which increased our gross profit margin by approximately 80 basis points. Material costs were neutral in the quarter, with savings in certain material categories offset by higher commodity prices in others. We are very pleased with the increase in gross margins and expect further improvement as the year progresses, although we won't have the same benefit of easier comparisons as we did here in the first quarter. R&D amounted to $31.4 million. That represents an 11% increase in local currency. Our growth in R&D in the quarter was driven by the timing of some new product launches. SG&A amounted to $184.2 million. That's an 11% increase in local currency over the prior year. Variable compensation, investments in our Field Turbo program, and employee benefit costs all contributed to the increase. Our adjusted operating income reached $127.3 million in the quarter, and that's a 25% increase over the prior-year amount of $102.0 million. Currency reduced operating profit by about $1.4 million in the quarter, a little worse than we expected last time we spoke. Our adjusted operating margins reached 21.4%, and that's a 250-basis point increase over the prior year. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Our amortization expense was $10.0 million in the quarter, while interest expense was $7.7 million in the quarter. Our other income was $5.7 million in the quarter, and that included a nonrecurring gain of $3.4 million from the sale of a manufacturing facility in Switzerland. This is part of our initiative to reduce our Swiss cost base by consolidating certain operations into an expanded facility. For comparison reasons, we've excluded this gain from adjusted EPS. And also included in other income is financial income of about $2.3 million. Now let's cover taxes. We have assumed an annual effective rate of 22% for 2017, which reflects a 2% reduction from last year due to the new accounting policy with respect to the excess tax benefits on stock option exercises. As a reminder, prior to 2017 this benefit was recorded in equity and was reflected in a reduction in diluted shares outstanding. Therefore, the P&L and the effective tax rate were not impacted. As we discussed on previous calls, we'll have variability in our quarterly tax rate due to the timing of stock option exercises and the accounting requirements around them. In order to make our guidance and comparisons easier, we are reflecting our estimated annual 22% effective rate in our quarterly adjusted EPS. You will see that our actual tax rate in the quarter was approximately 19%, and we've excluded the difference between the actual rate of 19% and our forecasted full-year rate of 22% in calculating adjusted EPS. We remain comfortable with our full-year tax rate of 22%, which is before nonrecurring discrete items. Moving to diluted shares, they amount to $26.6 million in the quarter, which is a 3% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, offset in part by higher shares outstanding due to the accounting change I just mentioned. Adjusted EPS was $3.34 per share, a 36% increase over the prior-year amount of $2.46 per share. On a reported basis, EPS was $3.48 per share as compared to $2.40 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.04 of restructuring and $0.06 of intangible amortization. In addition, as we already mentioned, reported EPS includes $0.14 due to the lower tax rate, and $0.10 for the gain on the sale of the Swiss property. Okay, that's it for the P&L. Now let me turn to cash flow. In the quarter, free cash flow amounted to $59.2 million, as compared to $23.3 million in the prior year. We remain pleased with our working capital management, and achieved further improvements in DSO, which we reduced by one day to 42 days as compared to the prior year. ITO was 4.6, and that's consistent with the prior year. Okay, now let's talk about guidance. We have a very strong start to the year, and our outlook for Q2 is also quite positive. We continue to execute well, and believe we're gaining traction from our excellent product pipeline, our innovative Spinnaker sales and marketing programs, and investments in our Field Turbo resources. Market conditions are favorable and we're capitalizing on the growth potential for our initiatives. At the same time, we acknowledge that uncertainty exists in the global economy, and that market conditions can change and they can change quickly. We will also face increasingly tough comparisons as the year progresses, specifically in the second half of the year. We expect market conditions to remain favorable, but recognize our growth rate later in the year will be impacted by these tougher comparisons. That provides you background on our market assumptions, now let me cover the specifics. Incorporating the strong start to the year, and with the assumption that market conditions remain stable, we're increasing our organic local currency sales growth assumption for 2017 from 5% to 6.5%. Of this increase, approximately 1% is due to better-than-expected Q1 results, and about 50 basis points is due to improved growth for the reminder of the year. For the year, we expect local currency sales growth of 7%, which includes 50 bps of growth due to the Troemner acquisition. Incorporating our Q1 beat and higher organic sales, we now expect adjusted EPS for the full year to be in the range of $6.95 (sic) [$16.95] per share to $17.15 per share, and that's a growth rate in the 15% to 16% range. We expect currencies to reduce earnings growth by 1.5% to 2% for the year. Now turning to Q2, we expect local currency sales growth for Q2 to be in the range of 8% to 9%, and that includes about 1% contribution from Troemner. This will give us adjusted EPS of $3.85 to $3.90 per share, and that's a growth rate of between 20% and 21%. We expect currency to reduce earnings per share growth in the second quarter by about 2.5%. One additional comment, the impact of currency on sales growth, we expect currencies to reduce sales by about 3% in the second quarter and 2% for the full year. Okay, that's it for my side, and I now want to turn it back to Olivier. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thanks, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab had very strong broad-based growth in the quarter as all product lines performed quite well. We continue to benefit from our strong product pipeline, Field Turbo investments, and innovative sales and marketing programs, which are helping us gain share. We expect continued good growth in Lab, but recognize that Q1 was our easiest comparison for the year. Industrial also had great growth in the quarter. Favorable market conditions and our strong competitive position continue to bode very well for our Product Inspection business. Multinational food manufacturers continue to standardize on our products and services on a global basis. We expect strong growth from Product Inspection in the second quarter. Core Industrial also did quite well in the quarter. What was particularly nice is that we saw good growth across all regions. We did benefit from easier comps and some project activity, but overall, very pleased with strength in this business. Finally, retail came in better than expected, driven by very strong results in Europe due to new labeling regulations which drove higher than expected sales. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales growth in Europe was strong, driven by very good growth in Lab, while core Industrial also had good growth, driven by some project activity. As already mentioned, Retail was up strongly. One additional comment, we had some benefit in Europe in the first quarter, given the timing of Easter, which this year was in Q2 but last year in Q1. In the Americas, Lab did well with growth in most product lines. Product inspection was very strong, and core Industrial did quite well, also driven by some project activity. Retail was down double-digits in the Americas in the quarter, against strong growth in the previous year. Asia/Rest of World grew high single digits, with good growth in Lab and Industrials offset by decline in Retail. Most product lines had very good growth. China did better than expected with 12% growth in the quarter. Lab in China continued to do very well, and we were very pleased to see strong growth in Industrial in the quarter. One final comment on the quarter results, Service had a strong quarter with 11% growth. The strong start to 2017 reflects favorable market conditions, but also our successful execution of our growth initiatives. We have several key initiatives aimed at gaining market share, one of which is our initiative surrounding global key accounts. Let me provide some additional background on what we are doing in this area. Our global key account efforts focus on customers in food, pharmaceuticals, and chemical industries. As a market leader we have a wide range of product and service solutions, and a large direct sales force presence that enables us to be a true partner for these global customers, which have diverse needs in many locations. We develop relationships at a high level with these organizations, which provides us the opportunity to sell based on the value of our solution. Increasingly, customers, particularly in segments such as Food Manufacturing, wish to standardize their equipment across their global location. We are ideally suited for this, and leverage our customer contacts to influence our roll-out of a solution across many sites, or ensure we are preferred vendor for order opportunities. In addition to furthering relationships at these customers, we are also utilizing our big data analytics initiative to improve the quantity and quality of our sales targets within these large and global diverse customers. For example, we use our sales projects alert initiative to identify when customers might be reaching decision-making points in their investment projects, or to help us identify size of large accounts, while Solutions might be able to fill penetration gaps. Capitalizing on our broad product offering and value selling are important to convert these opportunities to sales. Our sales teams have access to tools that help them demonstrate the competitive advantages of our offerings. For example, with increasing frequency we are highlighting the value of our software platform, which helps customers meet their high data integrity requirements. In 2016, sales growth at our targeted global key accounts grew well above the company average. We have further identified opportunities for 2017, and believe we can capitalize on them to drive further penetration with these customers. Another initiative in which strong execution is yielding good results is our Field Turbo program. We have added more than 500 field resources over the last two years. We have put together a structured process to evaluate market opportunities and establish specific multi-year targets for these additional hires. Similarly, we leverage best practices across the market organization in terms of recruiting, hiring, and training these front-end resources. We are working on another wave of additional hires in 2017. We are pleased with the market growth we are achieving in these target areas, and expect continued good results from the Field Turbo additions. That concludes our prepared remarks. As mentioned earlier, we are very pleased with the strong start to the year. At the same time, we recognize uncertainty exists in the global economy and we'll continue to monitor it closely. With continued good execution of our growth initiatives and stable end markets, we believe we can continue to generate good sales and earnings growth. I want now to ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : We'll pause for just a brief moment. Our first question is from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Steve, your line is open. Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Can you hear me now? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah, we can, Steve. Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Can you hear me? Okay. Thanks, guys. I had you on mute \u2013 had you on mute for a second. Bill, just wondering if you could comment about how you're thinking about the full year now, in two areas. Given the strong results here in the first quarter, what are you thinking in terms of overall revenue growth in both China, and then for your Industrial business overall for the full year? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Sure. So, let me start with the China piece of the business. I think we're very happy with the start to the year. And as you guys have seen with us over the years now, when there's tough periods of time in the Industrial business, we often kind of bounce back there. And I think we're seeing some of that return of the normal replacement cycle in our Chinese business, and just in general, the improving industrial environment there. So if we kind of look out to the second half of the year, what's built into our guidance is that some of what we have seen so far won't continue at that same rate, but it should still be better than maybe what we felt, let's go back six months ago. Okay? Then with regard to our Industrial business, we do \u2013 we are very happy with the start to the year. We think that, maybe even in parts of the world a little bit better than we expected as well. If I look at Europe for example, I think that our European Industrial business benefited a little bit in the first quarter due to the timing of Easter, as Olivier mentioned on the call. But maybe adjusted for that we would say, hey, in the western part of the world, maybe things can continue, adjusted for slightly maybe tougher comps in the second half and this Easter consideration. We do monitor the PMI numbers. The PMI numbers have been improving, but we're not \u2013 we're not yet ready to say that hey it's a time yet for big growth. So... Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Okay. Just one follow-up, then. I believe you made a reference to a $0.10 gain from a sale of a property in Switzerland. Just wanted to confirm whether that was in or out of your guidance? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yes. So it's out of adjusted EPS. If you kind of look in the press release, you'll see a larger than usual number on the other income line. But it's footnoted to say that we pulled that out then, and took that out of adjusted EPS. Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Perfect. Okay, thanks, Bill. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, good afternoon, guys. Thanks very much. Bill, a question for you on pricing. Just curious if you can give a little color on how that's played out year to date relative to plan, and the extent to which that dropped through to gross margin? It would be helpful if you could quantify that somehow? Thank you. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Sure. So, in the first quarter we had a net realized price increase of about 190 basis points. Little bit better than we expected, but I also think it's worth saying that some of that comes in areas like, let's pick vehicle, Isaac, so in the vehicle business if we look at the steel decks we have, we're having higher costs for the decks. And remember too, a big piece of our vehicle business is in China. So steel prices in renminbi terms have gone up even more than we talked about here in dollars, and so we've passed on some of that. So this 190 basis points has \u2013 how we're doing versus beginning of the year guidance is a little misleading, just to take those numbers one for one. But we're happy with the start to the year. And that 190-basis-point price increase contributed to about an 80 basis points of the gross margin expansion that we had in the quarter. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understood. And then maybe a little bit more hypothetical on capital use. Obviously you guys have done well with Troemner since the deal, but wondering if the funnel of deal activity has changed at all for the better or worse? Obviously equity prices are quite high, but you have also a lot of flexibility in the balance sheet, so I'm just wondering if you can probably-weight the likelihood of an acceleration in deal activity? Or at least characterize the nature of what you have on the radar? Thank you. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: I would say that the strategy remains very much the same. Acquisitions are part of the strategy, we pursue always many targets, we have an attractive radar. And we can't really time the opportunities to our own desire, it's often when a seller is willing. And many of our targets are privately-owned companies, can have succession topics and so on. The financial metrics the valuations play often a smaller role for the timing, but certainly we are very focused on the topic. And you have seen us doing stuff in the last two or three years, and yeah, I wouldn't mind if another opportunity like Troemner will materialize. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understood. Thank you, guys. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thank you, Isaac. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, Thanks. Olivier, can you elaborate a little more on the Lab strength? I think people are conditioned to think about the recovery in Industrial, but you guys put up great numbers in Lab. I know you had a slightly easier comp, but can you talk a little bit about the strength there, and the sustainability? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yes. Yes. Hey, very pleased to say that Lab was strong across the globe, across all the product lines. There were a few ones that had tougher comparisons and that played a role, like if you recall Automated Chemistry had a very strong previous year. They still had good growth this year, but maybe less than the average Lab. The same was also true for pipettes in the U.S., where we had a strong comparison but still I'm very happy with it. I would particularly also highlight Europe and China, where we continue to have really good growth. I think it's a reflection also that Lab serves many end-user markets, it's not just the life science. And many of these end-user markets start to be stronger and we see that also in our results. I would add also, I feel we had benefit from the strong pipeline, product pipeline that we built up. And we had many new products launched in recent years, and they all play well in the market, get good reception by customers. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then I guess on incremental investments, you flagged some of the R&D projects and continuing investments in Field Turbo. Can you talk a little bit just with the topline upside on how you're thinking about maybe expanding on some of these incremental investments? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yes. So the additional R&D investment often is a question of timing when we launch products and we have quite a couple of important launches, not just in Lab, across all the product portfolio in Q1, partially also in Q2. And probably more important is than the investment in Field Turbos. The Field Turbos, they typically we say the first year is really an investment. It's about recruiting, onboarding, training, building up the pipeline. And then we want to see that typically in the second year, the Turbo or the individual breaks even. And then in year two, three, we start to have a payback also on the initial investment. And I certainly see that this is happening. I would say the expectations \u2013 we exceed even our own expectations at right now, but that's more a reflection that the markets offer more growth than we originally planned. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Just last one on repos. You guys have been very consistent with your additional capital deployment, going back to share repurchase. Just any thoughts on, given where valuation is, whether the returns there would impact maybe the pace of buybacks going forward? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Sure. I'll take that one. So, the way we look at it, Tycho, is that we generate a lot of free cash flow. We look at the efficiency of different things. We certainly see that, our intrinsic value calculations for how we think we can build a business over time, it still makes complete sense to continue the share repurchase program. I think there could be periods of time in the future where we have one or the other acquisition that might be bigger than some of these, more like Troemner's or whatever, a little bit bigger than the small bolt-ons, where we might think about our balance sheet and choose one or the other. But sitting here today, our \u2013 we feel comfortable with the share repurchase program. We intend to continue with it as described earlier in the year. And we think that makes a lot of financial sense for shareholders, given where we see the intrinsic value. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Dan Arias with Citi. Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, guys. This is actually Bryan Kipp on behalf of Dan. Congrats on the quarter. Just wanted to take a step back, you highlighted some of the new products and how they're contributing to overall momentum that we're seeing here. Can you give a little bit more color around the incremental contributions, and whether or not the pipette launch that you guys had, the stand or UV/VIS, or some of the products last year, are really contributing now? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yes. Okay. So when we talk about new products, it's often new product generations. It is a product that has additional features, has additional benefits to the customer, but typically replaces an existing product. You mentioned UV/VIS. UV/VIS is kind of an exception, because that's a new product category. But these new product categories like UV/VIS wouldn't have such an impact on the top line. You build this business over many years, rather than launching it and have an immediate impact. But the whole upgrade of our product portfolio drives the replacement cycle. And that's why I say overall it helps our momentum, it helps us to increase prices because we have more differentiated value proposition and so on. But it's difficult to isolate the exact impact, because it's broad-based. It helps gaining market share, but then saying how many basis points, it's really difficult. It's a continued stream of improving the competitive advantage that we have. Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And just to help characterize back-half growth, just given the sequential stepdown that we're going to kind of see, I think two-thirds of your overall growth is implied in the first half. How do you guys think about the Field Turbo investments that you did last year in contributing to back half, as well as some of these new products? Is your expectation more that that's just GDP plus growth, and that's where it's going to flush through, to maybe that 4% to 5% local currency range? Or is there more kind of baked in there? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: I think it's tough to just put a \u2013 for us to give you a guidance in reference to a GDP number or something, but maybe we look at it and our analysis would say hey, the comps get a little bit tougher. Maybe I give a comparison here to the first quarter; I pick on maybe our Retail business had growth, in part due to some new regulations that came out at the end of the year. We weren't expecting that growth here in this first quarter. We certainly think that over the course of the year that we're going to be at a much lower number, and that'll work itself out. If I look at the China business, and you guys probably get tired of hearing us say it, but the \u2013 we're always careful with how we forecast that China business. It's \u2013 it can turn fast, it's \u2013 different economic situations or political situations could change demand quite quickly in China, or the credit situation there. And we do feel that we're currently benefiting from some pent-up demand, and it's unclear how that long \u2013 how long that will last. And while we feel good about \u2013 well, I would even say we feel great about our start to the year in China \u2013 we're cautious about how the second half will be. So yeah, we are looking at those tougher comps, and I think let's see how the second quarter plays out. Let's see how our order entry and backlog looks sitting here in July, and I think we can give you guys a better picture at that point in the year. But I think at this point we're careful to get carried away after this one really strong quarter of growth. Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): All right. Appreciate it. Thanks for the color. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Mm-hmm. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Ryskin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Hi, thanks. This is Mike Ryskin actually on the line for Derik. Congrats on the quarter, clearly. Appreciate your comments on what you discussed earlier in terms of targeting the global key accounts, and how those areas grew well above the company average. I was wondering if you could quantify how much that contributed to your topline growth, in any way? And whether the share gains you're seeing there, are they focused on any particular end-market or product segment? And then also what's the runway with sort of that initiative? Is this something that's still in the early stages, or will it be a contributor for some time? And then a follow-up also on the timing of Easter, is it \u2013 that you called out as a tailwind in 1Q. Is it fair to say that's probably approximately a 50-basis point contribution to topline growth? And so, we should expect sort of similar headwind built into the 2Q numbers? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Okay. Good. Let me take the first one on the global key account program that we have. Hey, what's maybe important to say, none of our end-customers is more than 1% of our revenue. So, while these are very important customers, they \u2013 the difference is when we have a large group of them, where we apply this improved sales and marketing techniques that I described. And in that sense, there are many years for us to benefit from these improved approaches, because we can apply them to many, many customers. And at this stage we are working on two handfuls of customers where we really apply the full program, but we're going to scale it up and I'm confident that we have a long-lasting impact. Quantifying the impact on the whole group, I want to be cautious to really give a number. I think what's for us more important that we see that the approach is really working, that's why I mentioned to you that they are growing above the group average, because that gives us the confidence that we have a good program in place. In terms of the Easter ... William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: The Easter, it's impossible to exactly quantify, but I think, could it be two to three points of European growth in the quarter? I think that's a realistic kind of number. Certainly less in the U.S., and not impacting Asia. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: The reason why it's more Europe, it's because many Europeans take a vacation around Easter. So it's not just about the one or two working days, it's maybe they go on vacation the whole week. And that's why we call out here Europe. Michael Ryskin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Got it. Thank you, that's really helpful. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Luke Sergott - Evercore Group LLC : Hey, guys. It's Luke in for Ross. Great quarter. Just kind of two high-level ones from me. If you could talk about the different margin expansion opportunities that you have within each business, and kind of how you balance between investing for growth and how you look at maybe it's time to take out some OpEx? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yep. Maybe on the latter one, I try to drive a resource allocation process in the company where we reallocate resources towards the businesses that have the best long-term profit margin upside for us, and certainly also the businesses that have the best strategic value for us. And so, for many years we have been for example favoring the Laboratory business over the Retail business. And this is certainly something we continue to do. In the last few years, when you think about China, we did some restructuring in the Industrial part of the business as we continue to invest in the Laboratory business. So, we do that resource allocation, we do prioritize in these terms. And when I think about Field Turbo investments, additional R&D money, this is all taking place. When it comes to going for investment and tentatively reduce cost at our other parts, that is probably more driven by geography at this stage, because it's very difficult to play offensive and defensive at the same time in a market organization. And at this stage, we feel actually pretty good in most of the countries around the world, if not all. And so at this stage we are mostly in an investment mode, and very selectively we do maybe cost measures in a country. It's a little bit different when we talk about the producing organizations. When you look for productivity there, it's more programs that we have in place. On the last call in February, we talked about Stern Drive. This is a program that is going on across the globe, and there we definitely also do cost measures whenever we have good opportunities to execute them Luke Sergott - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Great, thanks. Operator : We do have a question from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Zachary R. Wachter - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, hi. This is Zach Wachter on for Steve this afternoon. Thanks for the question. Just looking geographically at your local currency growth, it looks like, even if I take out Troemner from the Americas and Easter in Europe, you had a nice underlying acceleration on a two-year stack in those regions. What drove the upside in particular? I know you said that research was down double digits in the Americas. Was it really Industrial driving that upside? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: I'm hesitating on the double-digit comment. So if I'm looking at our Americas business, if I look at our Lab business excluding Troemner, we grew by let's call it 6.5% or something like that in the quarter, which is certainly a solid result. And it compares to a plus seven in the prior year, so the stack numbers are very solid. Our Product Inspection business, which can be quite lumpy, had 30% growth, and that drove a lot of our Industrial growth in that part of the world, and we are very much looking forward to that comp a year from now. But we have a lot of good things going on in Product Inspection. We're certainly taking some share, and that's a \u2013 one of the \u2013 somebody was asking about what kind of customer groups, but that's certainly one that Olivier's strategies around global key accounts has been helping us. And then our core Industrial business did very solidly as well, and let's see how that picks up in the coming quarters. What's worth noting is actually our Retail business was down mid-teens in the second quarter \u2013 or first quarter, I'm sorry. But that was, frankly, against mid-teens growth in the prior year. Zachary R. Wachter - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And on the same comp-adjusted measure it looks like China, you actually saw a nice acceleration here in the quarter, but meanwhile, Asia/Rest of the World was more stable. Were there any pockets of softness in other parts of Rest of World? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: No. If I kind of \u2013 I'm recalling a chart in my head, I think we had almost everybody was up mid-single digits, with, actually, Brazil and Russia not big markets but showing some very nice growth. I don't remember, even, anybody of material size having a decline, so.... Zachary R. Wachter - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks for the question. Operator : We do have a question from the line of Rob Mason with Baird. Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned that, Olivier, that Service, I think, grew 11%. Is that adjusted for Troemner? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: No, it's not. Without the Troemner effect, it would be about 9%. Which is of course a very good number; Service is a much more stable business, and when we exceed the long-term average by a couple of points we are extremely happy. I think it's a reflection actually of good execution, and what particularly made us happy was that it was across the globe, and particularly also in the Americas. So really good execution, and shows the potential of Service. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: And maybe Europe benefited from the Easter that we discussed earlier. Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. But still, that's a step up from where we trended, even exiting 2016. So... William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Definitely. Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): ...why would that necessarily \u2013 I understand the dynamics and maybe lack of visibility in some of the Product business in the second half of the year \u2013 but why would Service back off that number materially? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: I think, actually, the last point that Bill made about Easter impacting Europe, that's certainly one. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: And then the second one is, Service, in terms of the labor piece of our Service, Q1 is the smallest one. So, you know, if you \u2013 I'll make up a number, if you pick $1,000 worth of contracts, the impact of that in terms of the growth rate on the first quarter is just going to be a little bit larger. So, we were being open. We were surprised at it, and maybe we will do a little bit better in the quarter. It's certainly an area we've been investing for growth, so I'd like to see the growth continue. But if I look at our forecast for the second quarter, we're going to see some impact due to the Easter. But let's see how Q3 and Q4 come together. Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Okay. And also, Bill, the \u2013 with the first quarter, the operating margin expanded I think you said 250 basis points. If I do my math correctly, it looks like maybe there's 150 basis points baked into the second quarter. But as I look at the full year, or at least the second half, it's \u2013 there's not nearly as much in the second half. Is there anything that your \u2013 one, is my math correct? And I guess if so, is there anything that we should think about in the second half of the year, other than just the growth rate? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah. I think the biggest impact is due to the growth rate. I was just looking at one of Mary's schedules here to see if currency had really a different impact, and no, it's similar. So, yes, slight \u2013 Mary's saying a little bit worse, but it's mostly driven by the pure volume impacts. Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Just the last question, the share count that underpins the 2017 guidance, give us a feel for that? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yes. So, it's 26 million, 266 point.... And just as a reminder, that that includes the new accounting rules regarding the stock option stuff. And I guess maybe that number, I guess it's updated to the most recent stock price, or \u2013 let me tell you it this way, last week's stock price. Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Very good. Okay. Thank you. Nice quarter. Operator : And we have no other questions in the queue at this time. I'll turn the call back over to management for any remarks. Mary T. Finnegan - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thanks, Doris. And thanks everyone for joining us this evening. We appreciate it. Of course, as always, any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. Take care, and everyone have a nice evening.

We are conducting the call from Switzerland this evening and started a little earlier than we normally do given the time difference. I will start with a summary of the quarter, and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments before we open the lines for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter are on Page 3 of the presentation. We had another quarter of excellent results, sales growth was very strong with great growth in Asia/Rest of World including China as well as the America. Europe also had a solid quarter specially when adjusting for the Easter impact. We are pleased with our ability to capitalize on our growth initiatives, we continue to expand margin and EPS growth in the quarter was excellent. We are very pleased with the second quarter and first half results. Our outlook for the remainder of the year is also very positive, although we will face more challenging comparisons. We continue to be optimistic that we can further our share gains and delivered strong performance in 2017. Let me handle it over to Bill now to cover the financials. William Donnelly : Hi, everybody. Sales were $653.7 million in the quarter as an increase of 10% in local currency. Excluding the impact of the Troemner acquisition our organic global currency sales growth was approximately 8.5% on an U.S. dollar basis sales increased by 7% as currency has reduced sales by 3% in the quarter. On Slide 4, we show local currency sales growth by region, sales grew by 10% in Americas, 4% in Europe and 15% in Asia/Rest of World. China sales growth was 22% in the quarter. growth in the Americas benefited by approximately 3% from the Troemner acquisition. On the next slide we show year-to-date results, sales grew year-to-date by 12% in the Americas, 8% in Europe and 12% in Asia/Rest of World. China sales growth was 17% in the first six months, for the first six months growth in the Americas benefited by 3% due to Troemner. On Slide 6 we outlined sales growth by product line, laboratory sales grew by 9%, industrial sales increased by 12% and food retailing increased by 2%. Troemner benefited the lab growth by about 3%. All comparisons are in local currency and versus the prior year. The next slide shows year-to-date growth by product lines. Laboratory sales grew by 11% industrial sales increased by 12% while food retailing increased by 5%. Similar to what we had in the quarter sorry, Troemner benefited lab growth by 3% for the first half. All comparisons are in local currency and versus the prior year. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 8, and let me walk you through the key items on our P&L. gross margins were at 57.4% and that\u2019s a 30 basis points improvement over the prior year on 57.1%. we had a little tougher comparison last year as we had a 160 basis point increase in gross margins during the second quarter of 2016. We continue to benefit from pricing and also had productivity gains in the quarter, offsetting this was negative mix, material costs were down slightly as we obtained savings in certain material categories, but they are being largely offset by higher commodity prices. R&D amounted to $32.9 million that\u2019s a 10% increase in local currency, growth in R&D in the quarter was driven by increase investment in new product development. SG&A was a $193.5 million that\u2019s an increase of 5% in local currency. Variable comp investments in Field Turbo programs as well as employee advantage cost contributed to that increase. Our adjusted operating income reached $148.5 million in the quarter and that\u2019s 15% increase over the prior year amount of $129.1 million. Currency reduced operating profit by $2.6 million in the quarter or about a 2% impact to our growth rate. Adjusted operating margins were 22.7% and that\u2019s a 150 basis points increase over the prior year. A couple of final comments on the P&L, our amortization was $10.2 million in the quarter while our interest expense was $8.2 million in the quarter. In terms of taxes, for purposes of adjusted EPS, we are reflecting our estimated annual effective tax rate of 0.2%. For the quarter, our actual tax rate was 20%, as a reminder the difference is due to the timing of stock option exercises and the impact of the new accounting policy that went into effect this year with respect to the excess tax benefit of these exercises. We remain comfortable with our estimated full-year tax rate of 22%, which is before non-recurring discrete tax items. Moving now to diluted shares, fully diluted shares, they amounted to $26.4 million in the, which is 2.6% decline from the prior year reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program offset impart by higher shares outstanding due to the accounting change we just mentioned. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.92 per share and that\u2019s a 22% increase over the prior year amount of $2.22 per share. On a reported basis, EPS was $3.84 per share as compared to $2.93 per share in the prior year, reported EPS includes $0.12 of restructuring in $0.06 of purchase intangible amortization. In addition as already mentioned, reported EPS includes $0.10 due to the lower reported tax rate. On the next slide we show results for the first half of the year, which is excellent. We have a local currency sales growth of 11%, our operating income increased by 19% and our adjusted EPS increased by 28%. That\u2019s it for the P&L, and I would like to turn to cash flow. In the quarter, free cash flow was $130.2 million and that compares to $108.9 million in the prior year. We remain pleased with our working capital management, DSO was 38 days similar to the prior year. ITO was also consistent with the prior year at 4.6 times. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $172.4 million as compared to $138 million in the prior year. For the full-year, we now expect free cash flow to be in the $400 million range, on a per share basis excluding the large facility programs we previously discussed, this is a 15% increase over 2016. One additional comment, principally due to the timing of facility CapEx, we expect cash flow to be down in Q3 but will be up in Q4. Now, let\u2019s turn to guidance. We have had an excellent results over the last four quarters achieving approximately 9% local currency sales growth and 21% earnings per share growth. We have benefitted from a relatively stable global economy and we executed our strategies effectively. Going forward, we believe we will continue to execute well, but also acknowledge that market conditions can change and comparisons -. Looking to the second half of 2017, we see tougher comps than in the first half. In the back half of 2016, our local currency organic sales growth was approximately 7.5% as compared to 5% in the first half of 2016. Secondly, we expect our retail business to be down double-digits in the second quarter of 2017. As we have discussed with you in the past our retail sales can be volatile due to the timing of projects that provide you some background on our assumption on when we cover the specifics. Assuming that market conditions remained stable, we are increased in our local currency, sales growth assumption for 2017 from 7% to 8%. Based on the sales guidance range, we now expect adjusted EPS for the full-year to be in the range of $17.25 to $17.35 per share and that\u2019s a growth rate of 17%. This incorporates our Q2 B a higher sales growth assumptions as well as the impact of currency, which had improved. Offsetting these positives higher variable compensation for the back half of the year given our better than expected results for the full-year. Now turning to Q3, we expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 5%, if you exclude retail, we would expect our growth to be in the 7% in Q3. This will give us an adjusted EPS of $4.25 to $4.30 per share and that\u2019s a growth of 9% to 11%. One final comment in terms of the impact of currency on sales growth, we expect currency to be neutral to sales in Q3, and reduce sales by about 50 basis points for the full-year. Okay. That\u2019s it from my side. And I now want to turn it back to Olivier Olivier Filliol : Thanks, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab had good growth in the quarter particularly given very strong results in the prior year. We had a very good growth balances, analytical instruments and pipettes. New product launches, Field Turbo investments, and Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives are all contributing to growth inline. We expect to see continued good growth in line. Industrial also had a very good growth in the quarter, product inspection had another great quarter of growth. I will provide some additional comments on this business shortly. Core industrial also did very well in the quarter driven by an excellent results in China. Finally, retail was up modestly in the quarter. Now, let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales growth in Europe was good, especially [indiscernible] were impacting by timing of to Easter in Q2 and this year versus Q1 last year. Lab had grown against very strong results in the prior year, product inspection did very well, while core industrial was down slightly although up on a year-to-date basis. In the Americas, lab did very well in most product lines, product inspection had another quarter of excellent growth, core industrial was down against very strong results in the prior year period. Retail was also down in the quarter. Asia/Rest of the World grew double-digit in lab, industrial and retail as Bill already mentioned, China had excellent growth overall with lab, industrial and retail showing very good results. We benefited in China into the quarter from completion of some industrial project activities. As we look to the second half of the year, we expect to have very good growth in China in Q3, plus we will face tougher comparison in the fourth quarter. Before I call the products inspection, let me make some additional comments on services which have grown 7% in the first half. As a reminder, service represents almost 25% of total sales and is a unique competitive advantage for us as well as an important platform for revenue growth. We have service cost of approximately 2,700 personnel which is by far larger than any direct competitor and have invested significantly in training of tools to support the daily activity. Core to our service growth strategy is increasing percentage of our install based of the service contract. We have talked about this objective in the past, and today we can reported that over the last four years, we have seen our service contract business grow by approximately 40% through these efforts. We are emphasizing service contracts versus service in general, because we see the importance of moving our service business to be more contract base. We have much better plan on our technician when the work is contract base and we delete the value received by customers [indiscernible] when our work can be pre-planned and that drives healthy flight up time and prevented maintenance. One of our core beliefs is at the quality of our service has been at least as important as the quality of our product in impacting the customer experience. It helps us maintain very high rate of customer retention and therefore reduces our selling cost in the loss term. The intangible asset represented by our installed base of product is along with our CRM data the most valuable intangible that we have. We use as data collected on our installed base to promote the growth both our product and service business and to identify ways to bring value to customer. Our service business and our installed base are critical important to our future. We expect to continue to grow our service contract business at higher rate as the corporate average. And with the high profitability of our service business, this would provide a very rise mid impact to profit. Another strong performer has been our product inspection business, which had sales growth of 80% in the first six months. Let me provide a short update of this business, which represents slightly less than 20% of total sales or almost 45% of our industrial segment. Product inspection is more weighted to the west and customers are principally food as well as pharmaceutical and consumer goods company. Our offline consists of checkweighing, metal detectors, X-rays, vision and sterilization solution to help ensure the integrity and quality of packaged items. We have the broader product offering in the markets and are clear market leader in every major region except Japan. Our extensive service network is a very important competitive advantage for us. Manufacturing productivity and up time is critical to food and pharma companies. For global customers the tie and reach of service capabilities is a key consideration or no competitors comes close to matching our global reach. We are generally recognized as leader in innovation, which we reinforced earlier in this year with the launch of our C-Series checkweighing. the C series is an truly global product platform covering the entire markets of simple to high complex applications on the production line. All products are available worldwide and complying with global sound and regulations. Furthermore they are scalable with a flexible combination of mechanical and software option that can be tailored to individual customer requirement. The series set standard for weighing technology and it\u2019s what we refer to as future proof, that is it has a modular design making it easy computer upgrades. While offering significant value to our customers the C series benefits us in terms of manufacturing, spare parts and service knowhow in the form of reduced complexity. We have significantly reduced the number of product lines for more than 50 to 10 while at the same time filling products down to the markets and serving the full value per need with solution for both dry and wet environment. This series has the same software, man machine is a based and communication capabilities across all product lines allowing for easy intuitive operation for our customers and more efficient production and supply chain requirements for us. [indiscernible] equipment design among the product lines, greatly reduces the number of spare parts. Growth drivers for product inspection are attractive, principally driven by concerns product safety, plus brand protection and manufacturing productivity. We continue to see global food companies looking to standardize global leader product inspection instrument. Our global presence and service network provides us with a unique advantage here. Finally as product inspection is heavily weighted to food and food follows population overtime, we believe that in the future emerging markets will provide various active growth opportunity for product inspection. Product inspection should grow above the company average of over the medium term, we are currently expanding our manufacturing facility to product inspection in both in U.S. and in UK. to accommodate this growth potential. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are very pleased with our excellent results in the first half of the year. Our outlook for the remainder of the year is positive, although we will face more challenging comparison in the back half of the year. With continued good execution, we believe we can gain share and generate good sales and earnings growth. I want to now ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ross Muken : Good afternoon, guys. So, maybe as we think about the end markets for second and maybe geographies. Where are you seeing the biggest inflections where you are seeing growth kind of take off continue to sort of accelerate and even when you look at your order book or you are steering at third quarter. You sort of surprise that the trajectory or it\u2019s noticeably different than maybe a more smoother trend. And then is there anything where you have seen that happen and is leveled off or in general have you seen most of the markets kind of stay elevated that have sort of done that so far. Just trying to get a feel for maybe this slope some of these businesses that have been improving for you? William Donnelly : So, interesting question, I think one of the reasons that I wanted to call out in our guidance for Q3, Ross is the impact of retail is that when you kind of look at a three year growth rate including retail and two year growth rate including retail you kind of see Q1, Q2, Q3 all kind of at the same level. But when you start to pull out the impact of retail actually, you see that there is just a modest little pick up. And I\u2019m not sure this the impact of certain part of the global economy, I mean our general view is there is not too any [indiscernible] parts of the world right now. But I think it\u2019s the fact that we got a little bit more Field Turbo in there. And so we feel good about what we see globally, there is some markets like China that we would say hey, China is not going to say at that kind of rate and we will start to face much tougher comps later in the year. But, overall we don\u2019t see a slowdown, we see this 5% as more a little bit \u201cartificial impact\u201d due to retail which is kind of lumpy and just as a reminder for everybody tends to be a little less profitable particularly in the contribution line than some of the business, and also in the quarter. Ross Muken : And on the emerging market side, that\u2019s what I\u2019m more thinking about where you are seeing now this slope of recovery and obviously China as you mentioned was riding pretty hard. I mean is that consistent across sort of all the subgroups within there or some of the earlier cycle stuff looking at a different than mid or late cycle or some of the healthcare businesses. Just kind of steady stages. Give us a little bit of a picture in some of the emerging market pieces. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for maybe trajectories? Olivier Filliol : So, we felt good about also the other emerging markets beside China, we have parts of Southeast Asia that have a strong quarter and even the Russia and Brazil also did quite well. You might recall on the last call we did also talk about India, we have in India mid single-digit growth against very good growth last year. India is a little bit impacted by some new tax regulations, so maybe for the second part we\u2019re going to see a little bit of an impact. But overall, actually really good results across all the emerging markets and we stay confident that we are going continue to see good momentum there. Ross Muken : Thank you, guys. You next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tycho Peterson : Hey, thanks. Just wondering if you can provide little more granularity on growth expectations by segment for the back half of the year. I know you kind of touched a little bit on that to Ross\u2019 question. But in particular on the lab market, I\u2019m wondering what your expectations are given the funding environment getting a little bit better? William Donnelly : Yes, we had high single-digit growth in lab for the second half of the year. And the Product Inspection business should continue to do quite well although they had a very tough comps in the fourth quarter and our core industrial business should be in that mid single-digit. It\u2019s the retail business that\u2019s we are looking at probably a double-digit decline there in the second half. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then, Olivier On service, can you give us the sense as to how much of the services are under these broader Service contracts and how much of emphasis you are placing now is on emerging market service tax rates versus a more developed market? Oliveri Filliol : Okay so the contract based business is about half of our total service business or close to half. And has obviously been growing much faster like the rest of the service, the other parts of the service would be then spare parts and break fix and that piece has not being growing that well in the past. For New York region have seen declined and particularly reflection that the quality of our products becomes much better. And we have been successful to migrate customers to preventive maintenance that also helps to reduce the break fix aspect. So overall it\u2019s a very healthy change of mix, it\u2019s as I mentioned improved the customer satisfaction and it helps us to maintain a tight contact with the new customer base. Now in terms of attachment rates of service contract, we still have a significant differences country-by-country that\u2019s a question maturity of our whole service development and it reflects also maturity of the country, obviously in the West we have a much bigger installed base than in the East. We bring more and more good service programs also to the East in particular also to China where we have experience very nice growth rate and increasing it also in contract base and services. But in terms of - we are clearly huge towards the West when it comes to service contract business today. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then last one for Bill. Can you just give us that the margin component how much price and material cost, I know you said that moved around a little bit and what do you expect in the back half of the year for those two components? William Donnelly : Okay. So the price were up 230 basis points in the quarter and that\u2019s 2010 year-to-date and so that contributed about 1%, then we had productivity gains including material component and labor component that was about 30 bps for the quarter, 60 bps year-to-date. And then the mix and let\u2019s call it other would be then the reconciling items. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open. Steve Beuchaw : Well thanks for bringing the midnight early in Switzerland first of all. I really appreciate it if you could spend a minute on Field Turbo, I very much appreciate Bill\u2019s comments that there is an increasing and I mean it\u2019s in a good way disconnect between growth and the underlying markets, because the Field Turbo. Now that you have a few years experience, I mean how do you think about the sustainability that the growth rate of the sales force and how do you want to refine the Field Turbo program going forward. Olivier Filliol : The field turbo is really inspiring us as long-term initiatives like statistical [indiscernible] approaches, every year we get a little more sophisticated plus we don\u2019t see an end to the story, you are not going to necessarily see us to the same amount every year, we will certainly address that to the market conditions, but in general we see opportunities really around the world and we are prioritizing however the business is with the best profitability and certainly also the best opportunity for us to win market share. We the reason why I say the program has many more years to go is our average market shares are still giving us plenty room and for many, many years to grow here to additional resources and the additional resources help us to serve the customer better way and to have a better geographic coverage. So yes, if I look this year we are for example planning to add another 200 people roughly and we are certainly going to investigate for opportunities later this year and from today\u2019s perspective there is no reason why we wouldn\u2019t do something similar again next year. Steve Beuchaw : Really appreciate that. Just two quick modeling questions for me. One is now that you have seen 2Q you still thing Easter was two or three points swing factor between the first quarter second quarter in Europe and then a quick one for Mary or Bill any chance you can give us a view on want the tax looks like beyond this year given this year we had a bit of an accounting transition. William Donnelly : Let me answer the last part first. So the tax rates sitting here today we would say same point 22% rate next year. In terms of Europe I tend to look at the year-to-date numbers and say that our lab business is up 8.5% year-to-date and our industrial and [TI] (Ph) business is up about 5% year-to-date and kind a looking at the details I would say that 2% to 3% for the Easter impact on Europe is probably still realistic number particularly if I\u2019m looking at the multi year growth rates too and if I adjust for that I think that is a reasonable assumption Steve. Steve Beuchaw : Okay great. Thanks for the help. William Donnelly : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open. Isaac Ro : Good afternoon guys, thank you. question was on market share be interested maybe at a high level if you could talk a little bit about where you think you are getting share most effectively. And then maybe as a counter to that where you think the opportunities from here are going forward are most compelling for you to do better on the share front? Olivier Filliol : Because the data is not so easily available from our competitors. We can\u2019t exactly quantify the numbers on a quarterly base or business-by-business or country. But in general, I definitely feel very strong about our product inspection business how we do there, really very strong, the whole lot portfolio does also extremely well. And I also feel like we do well on the remaining businesses and when you think about geographies and feel strong across the world. And so I wouldn\u2019t highlight particular country or so and yeah. Isaac Ro : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe on the services side of the business. Can you talk a little bit about the types of investments you need to make at this point to drive continued growth there about corporate average. I mean just is that business grows as a percentage of total what that means through incremental margin profile of the total company. I\u2019m wondering if that will have a tangible effect. Thank you. Olivier Filliol : So, in terms of investments this has been something going on for years, we have heavily invested in having better data on our installed based. We make sure that we have an understanding where all our installed based is with respect to decision makers or users behind it and having an understanding how the equipment is used. And then running marketing programs behind it and that\u2019s actually very diligent work, detailed work for developing service contract business you need to do micro complains and that something that we have been really developing over the years. And we have invested accordingly in telesales resources, but also service development people. And then when you have the business of course we need to add more service technicians and heavily invest in training for this service technicians, we are proud of having a very well trained, but also very specialized service force around the world. And so these are multiple investments and of course we always talk about our [indiscernible] program, so in essence there is also IT tools that support our service organization across the world. Isaac Ro : Understood. Thanks so much guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Dan Leonard : Thank you. First off, I was hoping you could you could elaborate further on what drove the acceleration in China whether by end-market customer class or anything you could offer color on? William Donnelly : Okay. I think the thing that\u2019s really changed the last couple of quarters is the industrial business. So, we\u2019re doing well on industrial. I think there is multiple factors contributing it to that. One is we going back couple of years redirected our sale resources to go to more selected industrial markets. And I think it\u2019s fair to say that that process happen all at once. So, when you are approaching new segments, trying to gain share with customers et cetera it took a while to grow that up and I think that still improving. Second factor is, we clearly believe that there was pent up demand in recent years coming from China, it\u2019s hard to quantify, but we certainly have seen in another parts of the global economy, gets weak and there is let\u2019s say something of a financial limitation on credit availability that we tend to get eventually bounce backs in our replacement cycles. And then maybe the third thing that is another tough one to quantify and it\u2019s probably a little bit into the coming quarters, but there is probably something to be said with the end of the five year conference coming up that the government likes to talk about this program or that program that they have gotten finished for the benefit of the \u201cpeople\u201d and we are today much less a direct beneficiary of such programs than we were in the past but we are certainly an indirect beneficiary of the pushing you get some of those projects done. Dan Leonard : And just lastly, you can quantify growth rate between your industrial business in China and your lab business in China? William Donnelly : Okay, sure. So year-to-date basis our lab business is up and mid teens let\u2019s call it and industrial business is up around 20%. Dan Leonard : Great. Thank you, Bill. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Daniel Arias : Yes, good afternoon, guys. Bill, just following up on retail how much visibility you have into 2018 at this point, but do you expect the project works as you move to the beginning of next year and I guess along those lines, I think what is the normalized growth rate for that business in the out years? William Donnelly : So maybe I just start by trying to persuade with the idea that I want to answer your question, but I don\u2019t want us to get distracted on that question too. If you look at what is going to drive our EPS growth for the long-term it\u2019s how we are doing in those core product categories. Retail is by definition lumpy, it represents today Mary help me, probably by the end of this year somewhere around 8% sort of 8.5% and it\u2019s meaningfully less profitable than any other businesses. So certainly we need to help you guys with expectations for it, but if you think about your long-term model it\u2019s not going to be a key value driver. With that being said, sitting here today we don\u2019t know that much, as you guys remember our budget tour is coming up, but we will know a lot more on the next call and probably to give you some better insights. But you know sitting here today we will always say our next three to five year expectations for retail is also [indiscernible] and sitting here today we would see a different number for 2018 and that. William Donnelly : As you might recall that\u2019s in recent quarters we were surprised actually by better retail numbers than expected, some of that was driven also by the European regulation for label, so we had a little bit of a spike of business that we are facing now tougher comparison and that business doesn\u2019t repeat. So again, this is lumpiness of that business and we just should accept it, because I feel that it\u2019s kind of not the core that we want to focus on driving cost. Daniel Arias : Yes, certainly understand. Okay. Thanks. And then maybe just within lab, I\u2019m just curious about the pipettes business that was one that was up last year more than I kind of would have thought it would be. So I mean at the halfway point of this year, how do you think that looks in 2017 compared to the growth that you saw in 2016. William Donnelly : That\u2019s our growing last year it grew around 10% and this year 150 basis points less. Daniel Arias : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Evans with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, your line is open. Tim Evans : Thank you. Maybe I\u2019ll just turn to the balance sheet, over the past three years you have taken your leverage ratio up materially to return capital and I was just wondering if that\u2019s something we should expect to continue should we think about that leverage rate remaining stable or perhaps even going down maybe any comments on that. thanks. William Donnelly : Okay. So Tim I\u2019m going to try to be persuasive against. And I\u2019m having fun with your comment materially. I think you have got average for the last couple of years buying about a $100 million a year over our free cash flow and very much reflecting the fact that our balance sheet is pretty conservative and still is at the end of today. Sitting here today we are expecting that in 2018 we will get to buy just equal to our free cash flow which just as a reminder assuming things as they are today we will buy about a $0.5 billion this year, we bought about a $0.5 billion last year or we buy about a $0.5 billion again next year. And maybe not to get too much in the reach here just one other thing is, you guys will remember that our free cash flow in 2016, 2017 and probably a little bit early 2018 will be impacted by all these building projects that we undertook and this is reminder that the two main categories that fall into are one is the campus consolidation that we did as part of our efforts to reduce our Swiss Franc cost base eliminated a number of facilities and are consolidating that in to one this year and then finishing that up next year. And then second one is two plant pure expansions that we\u2019re doing one in the United States and one in the United Kingdom, because our product inspection business as you guys hear from the numbers has just been growing really well particularly in the X-ray side and we just needed more facility then. So with that kind of behind us, we lack of a better expression somewhat artificial deflating of our cash flow for couple years here we made up for that with some extra share repurchases and get back to a more normalized free cash flow level in 2018. [indiscernible] understand that I answered your question fully? Tim Evans : You did. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, your line is open. Derik de Bruin : Hi, good afternoon. Hey, so can you talk a little bit about the pharma and biotech markets and also pretty big bio production. In your [indiscernible] business you sell dissolved oxygen sensors and other tools that look at basically - they are using tool like bio production campaigns, bio manufacturing campaigns. Some of your competitors have commented about flowing in the bio production market. I\u2019m just wondering if you notice anything weird in terms of production scale and from your perspective in that market. Olivier Filliol : Okay, so life science in general is about 25% to 30% we will include [indiscernible] so have bio-pharma, we have pharma on skills and so on. this is a market that we serve in particular with the high tech business but also auto lab business and with the degree of which the process analytics business. You heard us just talking about high tech how well we have been doing so very happy with that. And if I look at the process analytics business, we had excellent growth last year, this year a little bit less so, but in terms of two year growth actually remains really strong and I think I feel like we saw a little a weaker now but that\u2019s because the comparison were really so difficult. But in terms of market momentum, I definitely feel good and we\u2019re reviewing that business early in the week and the outlook actually remains strong. So, I feel actually good about the end user prospect and particular also in the area bio production and bio stimulus and all the related markets. Derik de Bruin : Great. Thank you. And Bill, can you talk to us a little bit about the gross margin progression in the second half of 2017. Your second quarter numbers were a bit lower than what we have modeled? Thanks. William Donnelly : Yes. Sure. So, it\u2019s correct, we are up about 30 bps in the second quarter and that 1largely was explained because we\u2019re up a 160 bps in the prior year. In the second half of the year, I think you can assume our gross profit margins will be up about 50 bps. Derik de Bruin : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steve Willoughby : Hi. Good evening. Bill or Mary, I was wondering and I apologize in case I missed it. If you could just give us a quantify some of the like an EPS bridge between your old guidance and your new guidance. I know you called out a number of things [indiscernible] OpEx as well as some higher variable comps. So I just wonder if you can help us to put some numbers around how you are thinking between your EPS guidance and your new EPS guidance? William Donnelly : Hi. I struggle to be overly precise, because each one was independently bottoms up, if you know what I mean Steve. So, but that being said on the EPS side we certainly built in some additional upside due to higher sales expectations. We built in some impact due to higher bonuses to be paid. And you might know that has a little bit of weird impact that if I can explain it clearly in the second half of the year, because the first half of the year was so strong it\u2019s got mean, we finish very, very well on our bonus plans for the full-year. But with this kind of more mid single-digit growth in the second half of the year has a little bit of a disproportionate impact on the cost structure in the second half. And incremental margins would otherwise be even better in the second half. And then we updated ForEx, ForEx is still a slight headwind for the full-year, but certainly less than the headwind than it was last time and then we added in the impact of what we would be this quarter. So, that kind of gives you hopefully the flavor of how we are thinking about it. Steve Willoughby : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one quick follow-up and just on tax rate. [indiscernible] the simple math, I just want to make sure we\u2019re looking at the right, 22% for the year we\u2019re thinking something in somewhere in 24%, 25% range in the back half of the year? William Donnelly : Yes. I guess that it certainly got it over the only hesitation on the amount remember our pre-tax earnings are larger in the second half of the year than the first. So you might not be that much of an impact to get there but it\u2019s something north of 22, 24 probably. Steve Willoughby : Perfect. Thanks very much. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your final question comes from the line of David Stratton with Great Lakes Review. Please go ahead. Your line is open. David Stratton : Hi, thank you for taking the question. Really quick, would you go over what you are seeing in raw material cost and any benefit from this Stern Drive program at this point in procurement? William Donnelly : Yes, so maybe we kicked off some projects that will layer in over time, but I think we kicked off projects that have a total value savings about $9 million again it won\u2019t be all realized at once related to the Stern Drive program. We were relatively flat in terms of material cost and year-to-date basis and I believe that commodity prices were negative about a $1 million with offsets in other categories and then another one that was negative if I recall correctly was electronic components. So electronic components in commodity prices are up and other categories are down, I think we got 2 millions are negatives and 2 million of positives if I remember correctly. David Stratton : All right. And then really quick to the service revenue, how much is Troemner benefitting that category? William Donnelly : So yes it could be 1% or something like that, I think their pure service business is certainly less than $10 million. David Stratton : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions in queue. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mettler-Toledo management. Mary Finnegan : Thanks Devin and thanks everyone for joining then call tonight. As always if you have any questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact us. Given that we are in Switzerland probably the best way is through e-mail. Hope everyone have a good night and take care. Bye-bye. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Rodgers - Great Lakes Review Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our Third Quarter 2017 Mettler-Toledo International Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sera, and I will be your audio coordinator for today. I would now like to turn our presentation over to your hostess for today's call, Ms. Mary Finnegan. Ms. Finnegan, you may proceed. Mary T. Finnegan - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thank you, Sera, and good evening, everyone. I'm Mary Finnegan. I'm the Treasurer and I'm responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo, and happy that you're joining us this evening. I am here with Olivier Filliol, our CEO; and Bill Donnelly, our Executive Vice President. I need to cover just a couple administrative matters. The call is being webcast and is available for replay on our website. A copy of the press release and the presentations that we refer to is also on the website. Let me summarize the Safe Harbor language, which is outlined on page 2 of the presentation.

I will now turn the call over to Olivier. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Bill will provide details on our financial results. We will also provide an overview of our guidance for the fourth quarter and next year. I will have some additional comments and we will then open the lines for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter are on page 3 of the presentation. We are pleased with our sales growth in the quarter, particularly in light of the very strong sales in the prior year. In the third quarter of this year, sales growth in Asia/Rest of World was excellent, driven by growth in China. In the Americas and Europe, sales growth in Laboratory and Industrial was good but, as expected, we had a meaningful decline in Food Retailing sales. Overall, demand in our markets remains good and we are pleased with our strong execution. Our productivity and margin initiatives continue to yield results which drove strong growth in EPS in the quarter. Our outlook for the remainder of the year and for 2018 is quite positive. We are also pleased to have completed the acquisition of Biotix. I will cover that in some more details later in the call. For now, let me turn it over to Bill to cover the financials. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thanks, Olivier, and hello, everybody. Sales were $698.8 million in the quarter, an increase of 6% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, our sales increased by 7% as currencies helped sales growth by about 1% in the quarter. There are two considerations in evaluating our local currency sales growth for the quarter. First, we had a significant decline in our U.S. and European Retail businesses and, second, acquisitions benefited growth in our U.S. Lab business. Excluding Retail and the impact of M&A, the rest of our business grew organically by 8% in local currency during the third quarter. On slide 4, we show local currency sales growth by region. Sales grew 2% in the Americas and Europe. As I just mentioned, growth in both of these regions were impacted by the significant decline in Food Retailing sales, which was driven by a number of factors including strong prior year results. Excluding Food Retailing, local currency sales growth was approximately 5% in the Americas and 4% in Europe. Turning to Asia/Rest of World, we had 15% growth, driven by terrific results in China, which had local currency sales growth of 28% in the quarter. Retail did not impact Asia/Rest of World or our China growth rates. On the next slide, we show the results on a year-to-date basis. Sales grew by 9% in the first nine months of the year. In the Americas, sales grew by 8%. In Europe, sales were up 6%, while in Asia/Rest of World, sales increased by 13% year-to-date. On a year-to-date basis, sales growth benefited by approximately 1% from acquisitions, while growth in the Americas benefited by 2%. On slide number 6, we outlined sales growth by product line. In Laboratory sales, we grew 9%, 7% of which was organic, while our Industrial business increased by 8%, very much driven by our China growth, and our Food Retailing business declined by 18%. The next slide shows year-to-date growth by product line. Laboratory sales grew by 10%, Industrial increased 11% , while Food Retailing has declined 4%. Acquisitions benefited Lab growth by about 2% on a year-to-date basis. All the comparisons in this page are on local currency and versus the prior year. All right. Now I'd like to turn to slide number 8 and let me walk you through some key items in our P&L. Our gross margins reached 57.3%. That's a 50-basis-point improvement over the prior year amount of 56.8%. We continue to benefit from pricing and we also had productivity gains in the quarter. Offsetting this was mix and foreign exchange. R&D amounted to $32.5 million in the quarter, that's a 6% increase in local currency. Our growth in the quarter for R&D was very much a result of investments in various product development programs. SG&A was $204.9 million in the quarter, that's an increase of 8% in local currency versus the prior year. Variable comp and investments in our Field Turbo program as well as some new marketing programs contributed to the increase. Adjusted operating income was $162.9 million in the quarter, and that's a 7% increase over the prior year amount of $151.7 million. Adjusted operating margins reached 23.3%. A couple of final items on the P&L. Amortization was $10.7 million in the quarter, while our interest expense was $8.2 million. In terms of taxes, for purposes of adjusted EPS, we are reflecting our estimated annual effective tax rate of 22%. For the quarter, our actual tax rate was 25%. As a reminder, the difference is due to the timing of stock option exercises and the impact of the new policy that went into effect at the beginning of the year with respect to the excess tax benefit of these exercises. We remain comfortable with our full year estimated tax rate of 22% which is before non-recurring discrete tax items. Moving to fully diluted shares. This amounted to $26.3 million in the quarter, and that's a 2.2% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program offset in part by higher shares outstanding due to the accounting change I just mentioned. Adjusted EPS reached $4.36 per share, which was a 12% increase over the prior year amount of $3.89 per share. On a reported basis, EPS in the quarter was $3.99, and that compared to $3.77 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.10 of restructuring and $0.07 of purchased intangible amortization and also $0.05 of acquisition costs related to Biotix. In addition, and as already mentioned, reported EPS includes $0.15 of higher reported taxes due to the timing of stock option exercises. On the next slide, we show our year-to-date results which were very strong. We achieved local currency sales growth of 9%. Our operating income has increased by 15% and our adjusted earnings per share have increased by 21%. That's it for the P&L and I now want to talk about cash flow. In the quarter, as expected, free cash flow was down versus the prior year due to the timing of capital expenditures related to our previously discussed facilities expansion program. Free cash flow amounted to $111.9 million in Q3, and that compares to $125.6 million in the prior year. Our working capital statistics remain solid, our DSO is at 40 days while our ITO is at 4.5 times. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $284.3 million, and that compares to $263.7 million in the prior year. On a per share basis, this is an increase of 11%. For the full year, we now expect cash flow to be in the $410 million range. On a per share basis, excluding the large facilities expansion program, this represents a 15% increase over our 2016 level. Let me now make a few comments on the acquisition of Biotix, which we completed in the third quarter. Biotix manufactures and distributes plastic consumables associated with pipettes including tips, tubes and reagent reservoirs used in the life science market. Biotix's annual sales of approximately $35 million, we paid $105 million or approximately 10 times EBITDA for the business. Based on the results over the next two years, we could also have the potential earnout payment beyond base purchase price. Biotix is a unique strategic fit with our reigning pipettes business on several fronts, and we're very pleased to have acquired it. Olivier will provide additional background on Biotix shortly. With this acquisition, we have adjusted our share repurchases in 2007, and estimate that we would repurchase $400 million in total, which is in line with our estimate of free cash flow for this year. Now, let's turn to guidance. We continue to believe that our full year 2017 local currency sales growth will be approximately 8%. However, we're raising our EPS guidance and now expect to achieve EPS of approximately $17.50 per share for the full year 2017. This compares to $17.25 to $17.35 per share we previously disclosed. The improvement is principally due to our Q3 B (11:58), as well as a more favorable FX environment. With respect to the fourth quarter, we expect local currency sales growth of approximately 5.5%. This includes approximately 1% growth from Biotix. We assume adjusted EPS would be approximately $5.90, which reflects a growth rate of 12%. One final comment in 2017. The impact of more favorable currency environment on earnings in the second half of this year is largely offset by bonus expense due to the very strong results we had in the first two quarters. Now, let's turn to 2018. We're very pleased with our strong performance, particularly in the second half of 2016 and for the first three quarters of this year. The economic environment in the Americas and Europe is good. Market conditions have recovered in China, and we are currently benefiting from some pent-up demand, especially in our industrial business. Similar to how we have developed full-year guidance in the past, we are assuming market conditions remain largely consistent with the current environment. We're not assuming changes in the global economy nor are we assuming changes in the currency rates versus current levels. That being said, we want to acknowledge that we see very limited opportunity for improvements in the global economy or the foreign exchange environment. In terms of things we can't control, we feel very good. We are confident in our growth strategies, which are yielding good results based on strong execution. We should continue to gain share in our productivity, and margin enhancement initiatives should deliver further operating profit growth. One final comment, and as I've mentioned this to you in the past, comparisons matter. We'll have some challenging comparisons in 2018. I specifically refer here to our growth in China, as well as in our product inspection business, and this will especially be so in the early part of the year. Taking all of these factors into account, we expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 6% in 2018. This will include approximately 1% from Biotix. We expect this to result in adjusted EPS in the range of $19.65 per share to $19.85 per share, and that's a growth rate of between 12% and 13%. In terms of our quarterly guidance for 2018, as usual, we will provide that on our upcoming calls. However, I know you will be updating your models, and I want to point out that we'll have some very tough comparisons in the first half of next year, but particularly in the first quarter. As a reminder, we had 11% organic sales growth and 36% EPS growth in Q1 of this year. With these comparisons, we would estimate that sales growth in Q1 2018 would be in the 4% range and EPS growth will likely be in the mid to high single-digits. In terms of currency impacts on sales growth, we expect currency to increase sales by about 2% in the fourth quarter of 2017. This will result in basically a flat currency impact for the full year on sales. In 2018, we expect currencies to increase sales by approximately 75 basis points. Finally, in terms of cash flow next year, we would expect free cash flow to be approximately $450 million. We would expect our capital expenditures to again be higher than normal due to the completion of our facilities expansion program. As we've discussed in the past, we're currently expanding and consolidating our product inspection business in the U.S. into a new facility in Tampa. We're also expanding our production inspection manufacturing in the UK. And finally, to reduce our Swiss cost exposure, we're consolidating certain of our Swiss operations into an expanded facility at our headquarters in Greifensee. The timing of these expenditures has been delayed since we first spoke to you about them, and we've also modestly expanded the UK and Swiss projects, given the level of expected business at these locations. We estimate CapEx at $130 million dollars in 2018 and expect to complete the expansion projects late next year or the early part of 2019. Thereafter, we would expect our CapEx as a percentage of sales to be in the 3% range. Excluding these facility CapEx on a per share basis, we expect to increase NCO by approximately 11% in 2018, which is in line with our EPS growth. In terms of share repurchases, we'd expect them to be in the $500 million range in 2018. Okay. That's it from my side. And I'd now like to turn it over to Olivier. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thank you, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab had a very good growth in the quarter. Almost all product lines performed very well. Our strong product pipeline, Field Turbo investments, and continued strong Spinnaker sales and marketing program are all contributing to favorable results and position us well for 2018. We expect good growth in 2018 in Lab, but acknowledge spending by our biopharma customers won't be as favorable as we have seen these last few years. Industrial also had good growth in the quarter, with core-industrial up high single-digits. Core-industrial was particularly strong in China, but Europe had solid growth as did Americas if we adjust for some challenging comparisons in transportation and logistics in the prior year. We would expect solid growth in core-industrial as we finish 2017 and look to 2018. Product inspection was up 7% in the quarter and 14% year-to-date. We are well-positioned in this business, which we have discussed with you in the past. Given timing of project and prior year comparisons, we would expect this business to be down in Q4, but expect mid-single-digit growth in 2018. Finally, Retail was down 18% in the quarter. As Bill mentioned, this was expected given prior year strong growth and timing of project. We would expect Retail to be flat in the fourth quarter and low single-digit growth in 2018. We continue to manage this business for profit growth and return on invested capital. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales growth in the Americas was solid in laboratory and product inspection. Core Industrial also did well if we exclude the impact of some project business in transportation and logistics. Europe also had good growth across products \u2013 most product lines, except Food Retailing, which was down. Asia, Rest of the World grew double digits driven by excellent growth in China. We had very strong growth in both Lab and Industrial in China with almost all product lines showing excellent growth. The performance reflects good economic environment, which benefited in part with additional activity in advance of the start of their five-year Congress meeting. We are also benefiting from our initiative to shift resources to faster growing markets, in Industrial and Lab business. Our outlook for China is good, but they will face tougher comparisons beginning in the fourth quarter. We would expect sales growth to be in the mid-single-digit range for remainder of this year as we look to 2018. Finally, service grew 7% in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. That concludes my comments on the business. I now want to provide some context to our acquisition of Biotix, which we completed in September. Headquartered in San Diego with manufacturing in Mexico, Biotix manufactures and distributes plastic consumables associated with liquid handling, specifically pipette tips, tubes and reagent reservoirs primarily used in the life science market. As most of you know, we are a leader in liquid handling through our Rainin subsidiary, which manufactures and sells pipettes and tips. Rainin is the leader in U.S. in pipettes and is widely recognized for its innovation, particularly in terms of ergonomic and electronic pipettes. Many of you saw this firsthand at our Investor Meeting at Rainin last summer. Rainin is somewhat unique in the pipette market in that it sells direct through its own sales force, which we believe provides us a key competitive advantage, particularly around our ability to leverage our Spinnaker sales and marketing program. This acquisition is a great complement to Rainin as we will gain access to indirect distribution channels with strong secondary brands. Our strategy is to run a dual-channel, dual-brand strategy, with Rainin focused on direct sales and service and Biotix focused on indirect distribution channels and OEMs. We have successfully implemented this strategy with balances, where we used Mettler-Toledo brands on a direct basis and all-house (21:37) on an indirect basis. Biotix will also lead our efforts to support large OEM customers in this market, like the companies who offer robotic liquid handling solutions. Overall, they have been more successful than Rainin in this niche, and with access to Rainin's technology should be even more successful going forward. Biotix has a strong technology focus, and over time we expect to achieve synergies between Rainin and Biotix in the R&D and supply chain. We also expect to leverage our international presence to expand their footprint at presently almost 70% of sales are in the Americas. In the near term, Biotix will be run as a separate entity with management team intact. Biotix should add approximately 1% to our sales growth and is modestly accretive over the next year. We believe Biotix is a strong strategic fit and are excited about the potential and our further expansion in the attractive pipette consumable market. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are very pleased with strong results year-to-date. Our outlook for the remainder of the year and for 2018 is positive, and we believe we are well-positioned to continue to gain share and deliver strong results. I want now to ask the operator to open the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. Your first question comes from Dan Arias with Citi. Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, guys. This is Bryan Kipp on behalf of Dan. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess for me just to start with Biotix, just because we kind of ended on that, when we were out at the Rainin facility, you guys highlighted a lot of the automation manufacturing that you guys were doing for pipette tips and how gross margin expansion has accelerated from those efforts. How should we think about Biotix's manufacturing facilities and whether that's an incremental opportunity for them as well? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Okay. So first, as mentioned, they're in Mexico. So the labor costs are meaningfully lower, I think, in the area of 20% of what we have up in the Oakland area. But I do think there are opportunities for more automation than they have today. I don't think you'll see it looking exactly like the Rainin facility in that sense because of labor costs, but also because of a little bit of their business mix. It's smaller, so they probably have \u2013 let's call it shorter runs on the injection molding equipment than we might have at the Rainin facility. What I would say is that we're certainly hoping to work with Biotix to raise their growth profile. They should be able to grow faster than Rainin in the coming years. And there will be a lot of leverage in, and a big part of the synergies will be some of the leverage that will come in their manufacturing facilities from that additional growth. Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, helpful. Thank you. And a quick follow-up, Bill, I guess I was surprised by your comment that you said that you see little opportunity for improving the economy plus FX environment. Just given the macro data we've seen out of the Europe lately and continued strength in China, can you give any order commentary around that? Is there any anecdotal comments you can give as to why you think there's not a lot of further upside room from here? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: So you have to look at it first maybe on the currency side in the context of we've had a currency headwind as a company for 10 years, and this is our first year of having one. So I don't know, maybe we feel like we finally got a present instead of coal in our Christmas stocking. I can't imagine that this will happen two years in a row or further improve from here. And I think the other comment is and we've been saying it for a while is since the end of 2016, just a global economy for our kind of company has been going really well. On the one hand, we're not trying to say that we see clouds on the horizon, but if I look back at my 20 years, I'd struggle to name a point in time where you had so many parts of the globe acting at a good level. And so, that would tend to tell me this has \u2013 we'll have some hiccups over time. I hope there are hiccups in the smaller economies that impact us or smaller sectors of the economy. So I think that my comment should be read in that way. It's not that we see a big cloud on the horizon, it's more of the, hey, it's really good out there and it's hard to imagine it getting better. Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And order commentary here or order trends are in line with kind of what you've stated to date on expectations, right, for 4Q and... William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah. For 4Q, but I would just comment that we're a short-cycle business, so yes, October orders were good, but Mettler-Toledo in total has, I don't know, a month and a half of backlog, so I wouldn't read too much into orders. Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Awesome. All right, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Unknown Speaker : Hey, guys. This is actually Julie (27:07) on for Tycho. Thanks for taking my question. My first one is regarding Americas. So this quarter, I know you called out a slowdown in Food Retail, but even excluding that, Americas still grew 4%, which is a slowdown from last quarter of 10%. So, could you guys just give a little bit of color on what might be causing as a slowdown there? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Okay. So first, I just want to clarify a little bit on our numbers, so what we're saying is our organic growth in the Americas was about 5%. And I think as we had talked about a little bit on our last call, we do see tougher comps in a number of our U.S. businesses. So, for example, our product inspection business had a very strong second half last year and that would \u2013 to maybe just mention one, kind of pulling out my sheets now in front of me. In 2016, yeah, we had a good quarter, but particularly a good quarter in product inspection at 10% growth. So, yeah. And then if you \u2013 our T&L business had \u2013 grew by \u2013 I think the number was 62% in the third quarter and that made for a little bit of tougher comp on the Industrial side. Unknown Speaker : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then a follow-up on the Biotix acquisition. Just wondering if you could shed a little bit more color on the rationale given that the pipette business is tailored for the biopharma industry. And I think you mentioned that you expect a continued \u2013 a deceleration in the biopharma end market. So what's behind your rationale there? And then, specifically, if you could quantify the kind of growth that you're modeling for Biotix? And I think you mentioned it will be modestly margin accretive, but exactly how much, if you could quantify? Thank you. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: So, let me take the first part of the strategic rationale, and then Bill can fill you in on the model. First, I want to say the biopharma markets remain still very attractive for us. We are more talking about that we are coming out of a period with very high growth rates and growth rates become a little bit more moderate. But we like the biopharma market very much. It's one of our key focus, and especially if we look on that globe, that's going to be a core market for us going forward. And I'd like actually when the mix goes up for us with the whole life science market is attractive. Biotix is very synergistic. It strengthens the franchise. And there are synergies in the back-end that we talked about before. In terms of operations, there is a synergy in terms of R&D. And then, we feel we can play an interesting strategic card here by having two brands and two channels to the market. There is good growth potential for us here. And Biotix is clearly more focused to the U.S. market today, and we feel Mettler-Toledo can add value to also leverage the international presence that we have. So, in some way, I would say it fits very well into our core strategy about the markets that we want to serve. And the second point is, we clearly see synergies, and I think we are the perfect home to develop that business. In terms of the model, Bill? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah. So, maybe two comments on the model. So, their market share is relatively slow, but we think by teaming up there's a couple of specific opportunities that we can work with them on that we're pretty confident there'll be a double-digit growth business for the next three years; and that if we run that kind of through the model with some of the synergies that Olivier mentioned, we could move their operating profit or EBITDA kind of margins up well into the 20s from where they are today and that would mean even almost double the profit growth, pre-tax profit growth for the business that we have as compared to sales growth. So, I think the return on invested capital, if we hit our model, which I think is pretty realistic, would be quite good in terms of returns here. But there \u2013 but just to be clear, and I maybe misheard you, the margins today at Biotix are meaningfully less than what we achieved at Rainin. Unknown Speaker : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks. Maybe just one on China. You obviously saw a big 3Q with high 20% growth there. Can you just talk through what areas were outsized growth, and then also why it's been slow so dramatically? And I think you're calling for mid single-digits even this quarter. I mean, was there a timing element in 3Q, pull forward, or maybe just kind of talk through that? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah. Hey. So, China definitely exceeded our own expectations too, really, really happy. The market environment is very favorable. No question about that one, but our team also execute extremely well. All these growth programs that we have placed are paying dividends here. However, we need to realize we are benefiting also from pent-up demand, so this is very much true for the Industrial business. For Industrial, we have seen that a couple of quarters where we had a difficult performance, and now we see customers coming back. And so, there's definitely a timing topic in this and that's also the reason why we caution going forward about expectations, we're talking about high single-digit growth rates here for Q4 and certainly next year This is partially because of comparisons, but also because we don't expect to continue to benefit from this pent-up demand as we did. We did also mention on the call there was a timing question around the congress that they have, that could have modestly also benefited us. So, all in all, I think the situation that we have is \u2013 on the Lab, it continues to be very strong. Industrial, in particular, was an acceleration of growth, but not that specific one that will just stay that way. I think there we're going to see a more normalized growth going forward. Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Then maybe one for Bill. So, on the margins next year, could you talk through pricing, raw material pricing, just the impact with gross profit margins for next year? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah. So, in terms of our gross profit margin, we've assumed that within pricing we should be able to do 150 bps that \u2013 and that on the material cost side that we'll see some of this continued increasing commodities, but that we ought to be able to offset it. So, we kind of assumed a neutral material cost environment. And I would say though if it gets a little bit worse on the material cost side, we probably could push pricing a little bit more to compensate for that. So, I think that combination is a realistic one. And then, in terms of mix effects, I don't think that there's a big assumption one way or another. In terms of the overall gross profit margin, I think 50 bps is probably a good starting point based on today's currency. I think currency, just \u2013 because we have some top line benefit, the currency \u2013 I assume the currency might somewhat dilute the gross profit margin percentage even if it didn't hurt the dollars. Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. And maybe just one last one if I could sneak it in. How are you thinking about the geographic breakdown in terms of growth for next year? Thank you. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Okay. So, in terms of geographic breakdown, we see that Asia/Rest of World, we've built in something in that mid to high single-digit range assuming that China is a little bit of a tougher comp. For the Americas, we should grow mid single-digit organically and benefit \u2013 move up to high single-digits when you take in the impact of Biotix. And then, we're looking somewhere in that 2% to 4% range for Europe. Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Zachary R. Wachter - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi .This is actually Zach Wachter, on for Steve. On the Food Retail line, your 2018 guide for a low single-digit growth sounds very much in line with the long-term model. I'm wondering if that assumes any sort of impact from new food regulations in Europe? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Hey there. It's still a little bit benefit of this fiscalization, particularly actually France is adopting it; in Germany, it's pretty much implemented and the benefit over for us; but in France, we will still have some. But I wouldn't attribute too much upside from that. I think more it's a question of timing of projects. Typically, in retail we have bigger projects and we do see that things should be more normal next year. This year, we faced, first, comparisons topics, and then a few things that got postponed. Zachary R. Wachter - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And given the draft of the tax reform that was passed around today, I'm wondering if you had any initial thoughts on that and potential impact from that? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: So \u2013 hey. There was a few pages to digest there, so we didn't quite get the model fully fired up. We actually had our board meeting today, so all the senior guys were tied up as well. So, I think, in terms of impact on our effective rate, a few highlights would tend to make me think there's no big upside, but no big downside either. I think the one that we were worried about when we first started talking about this was the border adjustability topic. And I guess, for a while now, we've known that won't be part of it. We're not a big beneficiary of cash parked overseas and trying to repatriate that. As you guys know, our tax rate already reflects full repatriation. I think one of the things we found interesting was that the rules around CapEx expensing would be retroactive to the end of September, I guess, or sometime in September. And that's probably helpful in terms of we wouldn't want people deferring purchases into next year, that would make the fourth quarter more complicated. So we assume that's a good thing, but that's more a sales topic than in terms of our income tax rate. Zachary R. Wachter - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And just one last quick one for context on Biotix. Could you give us what was the historical growth rate for the business maybe for the last two or three years? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: I would say it was in the 10% to 12% range. I think, if you count year-to-date through, let's say, last 12 month, the LTM ended September 30, and 2016, you probably get numbers in that range. Zachary R. Wachter - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thanks for taking the call. It's actually Mike Ryskin on for Derik. Solid quarter, guys. Congrats again. A lot of the questions have been asked. So I just want to follow up with some more fine points. On the China front, you recalled that you're seeing some pent-up demand and that's benefiting you. I'm wondering if you could sort of talk a bit more about that, what's the pipeline there, expectations for how long it will take to work through that demand, just trying to parse apart what you see is the sort of underlying growth rate versus a little bit more of a temporary boost as people work through back orders essentially? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: And maybe just a few context so I think I'm answering your question, but if you want further clarification, let me know. You guys will remember back in 2015, our Industrial business was down by 20% in China, and then last year it had started to \u2013 it was pretty much flat for the first three quarters of the year and then started growing 12% in the fourth quarter. And then the first three quarters of this year, it's been coming up from that level. And I clearly \u2013 I think we all clearly think part of that growth rate in 2017 is the things that got deferred from 2015, this is what we referred to as pent-up demand. Now, we also had a pretty nice spike in our Lab business here in the third quarter and maybe some of that could be the result of the Communist Congress or People's Congress taking place. And in terms of what we \u2013 when we see this starting to get a little bit tougher as we already see now coming here in the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter was really a strong quarter for China. Last year, we grew by 15%, that was by far the strongest quarter we had in 2016 in China. Now we're saying that, hey, the comps will get tougher, we'll probably grow between 5% and 10% in the fourth quarter of this year. And I guess that's kind of the start of some of these tougher comps. Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. And then looking at sort of the 3Q performance vis-\u00e0-vis the 2018 guide, 6% local currency in both but without equivalent contribution from M&A, and yet in 3Q you had a pretty substantial headwind both in U.S. and Europe from Retail. So, for the 2018 guide, is it safe to say that the majority of the sort of conservatism in the guide related to the tough comps you're facing from 2017 or is there anything else in terms of you're seeing from the individual markets, whether it is a little bit of slowdown in the Lab or by geography? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah. So, I guess, the way we're looking at it is, you're right, the numbers for Q3, Q4 and 2018, if you look at the organic numbers, they're all kind of getting around to the same level. I think that if you pull out the Retail piece particularly, and I guess, if you look at our Q3 piece, we have quite a bit of growth coming out of China. We think that's got to go to a somewhat lower level. But we'll have \u2013 we see some pickups in other parts of the business. I think we're happy with our mix kind of globally as well as by product category. We're getting the growth in the right places and we're optimistic for 2018. Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. One last, and if I could squeeze it in, the last two years, some nice tuck-in M&A between Troemner and Biotix in areas where you really have a dominant position for both, can you talk a little bit about the deal pipeline going forward? Is this sort of we should expect about a 1% contribution from deals moving forward once these annualized? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah. The strategy that we pursue on M&A has been very consistent for many years. We always have a couple of opportunities that we are working on. We have quite a sophisticated approach to identify targets and we nurture them. And the availability for these targets is very difficult to predict. You have seen us, as you mentioned, doing the Biotix and Troemner, these were two acquisition in the Lab space. Before that, we did a few ones in the product inspection area, and process analytics would be the third business line where we are focused on opportunities. The fee (44:38) businesses offers additional acquisitions, they will certainly be all bolt-on. But it's not that I would feel like, oh, the track record of the last 12 months can be just extrapolated to the next 12 months. It's not \u2013 yeah, we'll see what comes, but again, I don't want to suggest that we will have every six months such a nice fate and such an attractive target as the last two that we could materialize here. But we will quite focus on opportunities, no question. Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : Yes. What was the impact from price on revenue and gross margin in the quarter? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: So, about 2.5 points of price gain in the quarter and about half that was the impact on gross profit margin. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : And as far as 2018 guidance, what are you modeling for share repurchase? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: About 475 million, I think we said on the call about 0.5 billion. So, I think precisely it's about 475 million, I think, today. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : And then, finally, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you're expecting from any kind of productivity improvements including Stern Drive (46:16) looking at 2018? Thanks. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Sure. So, we've built in an assumption around incremental operating margins with our typical something north of 30% on a currency-neutral basis. And if you look into what are the details that make that up, you would see that we've built in productivity assumptions in both our SG&A area as well as in our factory supply chain. Those numbers would approach probably high-single-digit millions, but we're also making investments in Field Turbos and other activities, so not all of that's falling to the bottom line. So, maybe that gives you some sense of what's in there. I think in terms of modeling purposes, you can assume this typical Mettler incremental operating margins in the mid-30s, high-30s depending on currency. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Do you have any closing remarks? Mary T. Finnegan - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thanks, Sera. And thanks, everyone, for joining us this evening. As always, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to give us a call or shoot us an e-mail. Take care and have a good night. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn our presentation over to your hostess for today's call, Ms. Mary Finnegan. Please proceed, ma'am. Mary Finnegan : Thank you, Erica, and good evening, everyone. I'm Mary Finnegan. I'm the Treasurer and I'm responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo, and happy that you're joining us this evening. I am joined by Olivier Filliol, our CEO and Bill Donnelly, our Executive Vice President. I need to cover just a couple administrative matters.

I will now turn the call over to Olivier. Olivier Filliol : Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with the summary of the quarter and then Bill will provide details on our financial results. We will also provide an update of our guidance for this year. I will have some additional comments and we will then open the lines for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter are on page three of the presentation. We are pleased with our fourth quarter results and the strong finish to the year. Local currency sales growth of 6% came in as expected. We are especially pleased with the strong broad based growth in our laboratory business. Overall, demand in our markets remains favorable and we are executing well. Our productivity initiatives continue to generate positive results, which drove another quarter of strong adjusted EPS growth. We are increasing our guidance for 2018 and believe we are well positioned for further market share gains in 2018 and beyond. Let me turn it to Bill to provide more details on the financial results. Bill Donnelly : Thanks, Olivier. Hello, everybody. Sales were $778 million in the quarter, that\u2019s an increase of 6% in local currency. Our acquisition of Biotix, which we completed in Q3, contributed about 1% to sales growth. On a dollar basis, sales increased by 10% as currencies increased sales growth by 4% in the quarter. On slide number four, we show local currency sales growth by region; sales grew 9% in the Americas, 1% in Europe and 7% in Asia Rest of the World;. Biotix contribute approximately 2% to the Americas growth; sales growth in China increased by 13% in the quarter. On the next slide, we show full year sales growth. Local currency sales grew by 8% in 2017, of which 1% was due to acquisitions. In the Americas, we grew by 8%, in Europe 5%, in the Asia Asia/Rest of World, grew by 11% in 2017. Americas growth benefited by about 2% from acquisitions. On slide six, we outline sales growth by product line. In the quarter, Lab grew 11%, of which 9% is organic. Industrial sales growth was 1%, as solid growth in core industrial was offset as expected by the decline in our product inspection business, which had a strong prior year quarter. Food Retailing declined 3% in the quarter. The next slide shows full year sales growth by product line. Laboratory grew by 10%, Industrial increased 8%, and Food Retailing declined by 4% for the full year. Acquisitions benefited Lab by about 2%. All comparisons again were in local currency and all were versus the prior year. Now let's turn to slide number eight, let me walk you through the key items on our P&L for the quarter. Gross margins were 58.5%, that's a 50-basis-point decline from the prior quarter. On a constant currency basis, however, our gross margin is actually increased by 20%, reflecting a 70 basis points headwind from currencies. We continue to benefit from good pricing, while mix was a headwind in the quarter. R&D amounted to $32.5 million, that's a 5% increase in local currency, while SG&A amounted to $204.9 million and that was an increase of 6% in local currency. Variable compensation investments in Field Resources and employee benefit cost contributed to the increase. Our adjusted operating income amounted to $217.8 million in the quarter, and that's 9% increase over the prior year amount of $200.2 million. Adjusted operating margins were 28%, a 20 basis points decline from the prior year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating margins were up by 20 basis points over the prior year amount. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization was $11.7 million in the quarter, interest expense was $8.6 million. Let me now cover taxes. First, for purposes of adjusted EPS in Q4, we\u2019re excluding the impact of the new tax legislation, which I'll cover shortly. Also, as we\u2019ve done in prior quarters, we reflect our annual effective tax rate of 22% in our adjusted EPS number. In Q4, our reported tax rate for the quarter was 23% with the difference due to the timing of stock option exercises. Moving to fully diluted shares, they were $26.2 million in the quarter, which is 1.5% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of the share repurchase program, offset in part by higher shares outstanding due to the accounting change related to the stock option exercises. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $5.97 per share, that\u2019s a 13% increase over the prior year amount of $5.28 per share. Now, let me make some comments on the new tax legislation that was finalized at the end of last year. A couple of factors are important for us. First, as expected, we do not foresee a meaningful change in our effective tax rate of 22% in the near term. While we benefit from the lower U.S. statutory rate, this is offset by limitations on certain deductions. Second, we view the legislation favorably as it will reduce the complexity of repatriating cash to the United States. It\u2019s along been our strategy to move cash to United States to fund our share repurchase program, and this legislation will make that process easier. Third, we are subject to a onetime tax in conjunction with this new legislation. We\u2019ve incurred a charge of $72 million in the fourth quarter, of which $59 million represents taxes on un-repatriated foreign earnings that will need to be paid over an eight year period and the remaining $13 million is a non-cash charge. On a reported basis, our EPS was $2.93 as compared to $5.17 in the prior year. Reported EPS included the $2.74 charge related to tax legislation we described above, $0.12 of restructuring and $0.09 of purchase intangibles and finally, $0.9 of higher reported tax due to timing of stock option exercises. On the next slide, we show our full year results. We\u2019re very happy with the year in which we achieved local currency sales growth of 8%, our operating income increase of 13% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 19%. Okay, that\u2019s it for the P&L and now we\u2019ll cover cash flow. In the quarter, free cash flow was $130.7 million. Our working capital statistics remain solid with DSO with 41 days and ITO at 0.5 times. Full year free cash flow was $415 million, this compares to $346.5 million in the prior period. We have some nonrecurring facility expansions going on in last year, including the purchase of our pipette manufacturing facility. Excluding these items, free cash flow per share increased by 14% over the prior year. Now let me turn to guidance, a few comments here. First, the economic environment continues to be favorable with good conditions in the Americas, in Europe and a positive environment in China as well. I would say we don\u2019t see a change in economic conditions as compared to last time we spoke. As in the past, our guidance assumes market conditions remain consistent to the present environment. Now second, we feel very good about our growth strategies and our ability to execute them. We\u2019re pleased with our performance in 2017 and we believe we have good initiatives in place to gain further share, as well as continued margin and productivity enhancement initiatives, which should help us to drive solid operating profit growth. Third and final point, comparisons matter, we\u2019ll have some tough comparisons this year in China and our product inspection business, particularly in the early part of the year. And with this backdrop, let me cover some specifics. We continue to believe that local currency sales growth in 2018 will be approximately 6%. Principally driven by a more favorable currency environment, we now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $19.95 per share to $20.15 per share, it\u2019s a growth rate in the 14% to 15% range. This compares to previous guidance of $19.65 to $19.85. As we look at the first quarter, we would expect local currency sales growth to be in the 5% range. As a reminder, in Q1 of last year, we had 11% organic growth so it was our most challenging comparison. Based on this sales growth, we would expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of 365 to 370, a growth rate of 9% to 11%. This is modestly higher than what we discussed last quarter, principally due to a more favorable currency environment. In terms of currency impacts on sales growth, we would expect currencies to increase sales by approximately 3.5% for the full year 2018. And in the first quarter, we would expect that benefit to be about 5.5%. In terms of cash flow, our free cash flow should be approximately $450 million and we will repurchase approximately $475 million of shares. Just two final comments on our 2018 financial results. There are two new accounting rules being implemented; the first is on revenue recognition, which we do not expect to impact our results; the second is related to pension accounting, which will move approximately $6.5 million of pension income from operating profit to other income. As we report our quarterly results, we will restate the prior-year, so it's apples-to-apples comparisons but want to mention it now. Okay, that\u2019s it from my side. And let me turn back to Olivier. Olivier Filliol : Thank you, Bill. Let me start with summary comments on business conditions. Lab had a great quarter and great year overall. Virtually all product lines performed well. Our investments in new product development Field Turbo resources and our Spinnaker sales marketing program are yielding tangible results. We expect current market conditions to remain but acknowledge that we will face tougher comparisons this year in Lab. Turning to industrial. Core industrial business was up a very solid mid-single-digit in the quarter and high single-digit for the full year. The fourth quarter growth in core industrial was broad-based across all major regions of the world. As expected, in the fourth quarter, product inspection was down modestly but ended the year with a high single-digit growth. We continue to be very well positioned in product inspection in terms of product offering, market presence and marketing strategies. We are coming off to strong use of growth so we\u2019ll face tougher comparisons in 2018. Finally, retail was down 3% in the quarter and 4% for the year. Although, they have sales decline, we are satisfied with this business as we continue to prioritize profit growth and return on invested capital rather than sales growth. Now, let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales growth in the Americas was very good with strong growth in Laboratory and solid growth in the Industrial. Retail was down slightly. Sales growth in Europe was impacted by declines in retail and product inspection. Both of which had challenging comparisons with the prior-year. Lab had good growth and core industrial solid growth. Asia/Rest of the World had solid growth driven by very strong growth in China. For the year, China sales grew 19%. We expect China to have a solid first quarter that they will then face more challenging comparisons in the second and third quarters. Finally, service increased 7% for the year. That concludes my comments on the business. Supported by favorable global economy but driven by diligent execution of our growth initiative, we had an excellent performance in 2017. We are also benefiting from our growth investments in the recent years. As we look to this year, we believe we're well-positioned for further growth and share gain. Let me remind you all the key drivers of our growth initiatives, starting with our long-running Spinnaker sales marketing platform and our big base of techniques. You have heard about Spinnaker for many years and it is a great reflection of our continuous improvement mentality within the organization. We are continually strengthening Spinnaker with new techniques and adjusting priorities based on potential. A current focus area is key account management, which allows us to capitalize on our broad product and service offering to further penetrate customers. We are using data and analytics to optimize our sales force activities by identifying and prioritizing sales opportunities and helping us to customize value messages that can best resonate with customers. Our Field Turbo additions to the sales force represent our largest investment for growth to-date. As a reminder, we are leader in the vast majority of our markets, yet our average market share is in 25% range. We believe additional front-end investments can accelerate share gains and plan to add another 150 resources in the current wave. Service is a growth contributor and key competitive advantage for us. We are focused on increasing the percentage of our installed base on the service contract and continue to make investments in training and tools for our 2,700 service technicians. We are also mining our installed base data to identify more service sales opportunities and increasing telesales resources to pursue these opportunities. Underpinning our sales and service growth initiative is our excellent product pipeline. We continue to distance ourselves from competition, which helps to accelerate the replacement cycles. We are also expanding our solutions by adding software, measurement parameters and automation to provide more benefit to customers. For example, in the Lab, we are further automating the Lab bench by connecting our high powered automated sampler to key analytical instruments, such as our typewriters and UEV. This is driving quicker analysis and increased throughput in the Lab. We are also increasing our offerings to support data integrity, which is important to customers in the regulated industry, such as pharma. We have also expanded our LabX software to encompass more analytical instruments and added predictive or smart analysis, such as our IC software suite for our AutoChem offering. The IC software fully controls critical chemical and biological process development workflows, while capturing critical analytical information. It is generally recognized as the standard in the industry. In addition to our initiatives to drive sales growth, we are also focused on margin and productivity measures to drive operating profit growth and also provide us with capacity for investments for future growth. We continue to use sophisticated data analytical tools to give us insights to further refine our pricing strategies and processes. We have identified many improvement projects with the launch of the Stern Drive program last year. Stern Drive encompasses continuous improvement efforts with our supply chain, manufacturing and back-office operations. We have also introduced a new e-shop portal to increase the efficiency of our automated sales transactions. The success of these various productivity programs are depended on strong execution, which I'm confident that the organization will continue to deliver. One final comment on 2018. We will soon open our new product inspection facility in Tampa, Florida. This facility provides for the growth in this business and allows us to consolidate all our U.S. tracking, metal detection and x-ray businesses in one location. You will have an opportunity to see these locations and learn more about our leadership and capabilities in product inspection at an investor meeting we are planning to hold in Tampa on Monday, November 12. I know this is ways off, but wanted to mention it now. Mark it in your calendars and we will be back with additional details in due time. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are very pleased with the excellent results generated in 2017. Assuming market conditions remain stable, our outlook for 2018 remains positive and we believe we're well-positioned to continue to gain share and deliver strong operating results. I want to now ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Muken : How would you tease out, as you would have expected, the order trend? I mean, there is a lot of moving parts there and you\u2019ve got some tough comps and thesis. But given all of the economic data is quite good. Are there some segments or some industries where you are seeing any differential or is it pretty uniform and is really just a product inspection question just in terms of like industrial overall? Bill Donnelly : So couple of thoughts there. So as you've correctly point out, Ross, comps matter so -- and the toughest comps we have coming in food. I think, we do see good order trends in industrial pretty globally and we do see good order trends with our industrial customers that buy lab instruments. The one area I think it's always tough to dissect come, which is tough comps. You also read that some of the food companies, packaged food companies, have some topics and it will be interesting to see what type of growth we can do. We've been conservative I think relative to past growth rates for that in 2018, but I think it will take a little bit of time to observe that. Absent maybe this food's comment about packaging where we might be a little cautious, I think we see great economic environment. We're talking it about today with our Board where it's part for Olivier and I remember a point in time where so many parts of the world were performing well. And we see that across our industrial customer base. Ross Muken : I guess just building off on that Bill. Just as you think about the growth cadence for the year, like what proportion of the business in terms of thinking we've got this unique synchronized global expansion. What proportion of the business do you feel like highly confident as we think about the second half of '18 versus where do you think we have maybe a little bit of wiggle room or macro just given how elevated we are and maybe some of the geographies that historically have and always been this sustainably strong, I guess? Bill Donnelly : Again I\u2019ll try to answer your question Ross, but maybe come back if you don't think I understood it completely. So we would tend to say historically that many parts of the business, particularly industrial piece, might be a little late cycle. So we tend to do okay in the later part of that cycle. I think where we feel too unusual things is in China, in 2017. We clearly benefited from some of the pent up demand for hold backs in that part of the world on capital investment in that '15-'16 timeframe. And then in the product inspection business, there is we're currently the Q4, 2017, we're going up against 15% comp, which led to what we had here in the fourth quarter. And I think we have another double digit comp in Q1. So we would tend to think that if the economy stays relatively at this level even with maybe some modest leveling off here and there, the second half would seem pretty solid relative to our current guidance. Operator : And your next question comes from Jack Jack Meehan from Barclays. Jack Meehan : I think versus our model, look like Lab was the greatest area of the strength in the quarter. Could you maybe just tease out what's performing better there? And sounded like it was pretty broad based, but just the outlook for 2018. Olivier Filliol : It was actually really broad based. Indeed, very happy how the Lab team performed. It's across the geographies. Certainly, China contributed very nicely. Just real estate in China, we have the seventh quarter here in a row where we have very good double digit growth in Lab. But we saw really good momentum also in Europe and U.S. I think it\u2019s a reflection of the economy, but also very much that we had very strong product pipelines. We did highlight that about a year ago where I shared with you that I said I never had so much confidence in our new products and the differentiation of the [indiscernible], that certainly translates in good results. And then all the sales and marketing initiatives certainly contribute nicely in Lab, where the Field Turbo contributing as well as all the additional innovations that we have to engage new customers. So it\u2019s a combination but definitely happy and I expect also '18 to continue to be good. Jack Meehan : Could you give us an update just in terms of pricing growth in the quarter? And it seems some big moves on the FX front. Are there any opportunities or risks you are looking at there? Bill Donnelly : So on the pricing, we were up about 280 bps in the fourth quarter, which was modestly above and we did push in one or two areas a little bit some of this inflationary pressure that you here described. So some of that -- and we did experienced some of that inflation by the way in material cost structure. So it\u2019s not that all 280 bps fell to the bottom line. But we had another good quarter and really a good year and feel pretty good about our pricing process entering '18 as well. Operator : And your next question comes from Paul Knight from Janney. Paul Knight : Can you talk a little geographic on the European market up 1% in4Q, what's going on there? Obviously, a great year in Asia, China specifically. Can you talk about your thoughts on China in 2018? Olivier Filliol : Let me start with Europe. Overall, pleased with the numbers and generally in line with our expectations. As expected, region was down double digit, but were very much impacted also by previous year comparisons. It\u2019s absent of retail, Europe grew 3% in the quarter. Again, solid growth already in the previous year. So that\u2019s why we said it came out as expected, but actually also in a good way. In terms of counties, we have France and the Nordic region that did, for example, particularly well and we had also good growth in Eastern Europe. Lab had also particularly good growth in Europe. So all-in-all actually a good picture. If we go to Asia and then particular China, China certainly had a very strong quarter, as well as the full 2017, and expected -- also clearly my expectation, we did not expect that China would develop so well, when we entered the year. And certainly -- also when we end this Q4, we didn\u2019t expect these results, very happy. The market environment is very strong, very good. And we benefit also from these pent-up demands that Bill mentioned that was certainly the case last year, Q4 maybe a little bit less so. This was particularly true for industry. Lab, we experienced multiple quarters as mentioned before seven quarters in a row with double-digit growth. I expect that to continue. As for several industries, we will now continue to experience the same growth rate. Here we're going to face tougher comparisons that will certainly play than in the second quarters of this year. Paul Knight : And Bill, could I ask last question, would be the net tax effect seems to be a little higher on your tax rate in '17. And what are all the moving parts mean for share repurchase? Any change in plan there? Bill Donnelly : So we might need to take it offline. So our tax rate of 22% came right in where we are, so our adjusted EPS is in line with what we expected for the full year. The tax rate or adjusted EPS, we did take a charge related to the new law. The charge was round figures about 80% cash related 20% non-cash. And we would expect that we can maintain this 22% rate going forward and probably longer term, we have actually a much easier repatriation process than we would have otherwise. In terms of the share repurchase plan, I would expect us to purchase 475 next year, which is our current -- this year, which is our current estimate for free cash flow plus option proceeds. Operator : And your next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Olivier, just curious, I know you've talked about China in fair amount. Can you maybe talk on what drove the upside in the quarter for you guys in China? I mean, last quarter guided for high-single digit growth for the year. Obviously, you're trending above that. So where you seeing upside from a demand side? Bill Donnelly : So I think the main thing was we were a little cautious about how much orders got pulled from Q4 into Q3 in connection with the party conference. So we finished -- we probably just did a little bit better in that regard or a little bit too conservative. And I would say the order trend was good, the start to the year was pretty good. I think that's one thing we're monitoring is the timing of the Chinese New Year was a little different. So while January was very strong, I think we'll have to see how that plays out by the time we get to the end of the first quarter. But I was down there last week, Olivier was down there in the fourth quarter and I think both of us feel very good about how the business is positioned there. And the Chinese team is pretty optimistic about their growth prospects and share gain prospects there. But it is realistically a tough comp, because the pent up demand topic we keep referring to. Tycho Peterson : And then back to the Lab's strength. Just curious are you willing to comment on and January trends just wondering to what degree there was a little bit of a budget plus dynamic in the fourth quarter. Bill Donnelly : I would say the best one to look at is you guys are usually asking that question in terms of biopharma. And we clearly had a very nice growth in pipettes, as well as in our AutoChem business in the fourth quarter. But they are going to have a decent first quarter as well. So I would have said that we had a nice budget flush, but not a huge surprise either. Tycho Peterson : And then lastly on Stern Drive. Can you quantify -- I know you\u2019ve talked in past about where you expect in terms of benefit from that. Can you just remind us what you're expecting for the year in Stern Drive? Olivier Filliol : The Stern Drive is really a program that allows us to continue to expand the margins similar to what we had in the past. It touches different topics. It touches productivity topics. It touches on material cost savings. And in essence, you shouldn't look at it as being an incremental program. It\u2019s more supporting the margin expansion that we have also pursued in the past. But it makes it more sophisticated now, it makes it more global and it\u2019s basically the next wave of excellence that we bring to operations. Operator : And your next question comes from Dan Arias from Citigroup. Dan Arias : Bill, just an outlook question. What are you looking for at this point for growth in Asia/Rest of World, if you exclude China? Bill Donnelly : High single digits in that 7%. Dan Arias : And then maybe just on the margin. Can you talk about the impact of mix on margins this year in the context of both your European business and then also what you do in the retail business? I know those are two things that can move the number around a little bit. Bill Donnelly : So the decline in retail certainly helped. What probably hurt a bit was the decline in our European business. You'll remember that Europe is the part of the world where we have the highest percentage of direct sales. So in terms of the gross profit margin that makes a difference. We also had, because of the strong growth coming out of china and the disproportionate amount of industrial business we have there versus lab as compared to the rest of world. While China is accretive at the OP line it tends to be a little bit dilutive at the gross profit margin line. So if I look out at our growth rates next year, we certainly have the retail business growing below the corporate average, but pretty solid growth in all product categories, maybe a slightly less in Europe than the rest of the world. But of course we\u2019ll get some benefit from Stern Drive. I think in terms of looking towards maybe recent trends and what we might expect to see in '18, I think the biggest difference is that currencies got to tend to inflate sales and inflate cost in a way that will reduce our gross margin as a percent, but actually benefited in terms of dollars of gross profit we\u2019ll be able to deliver. So currency will help us, help us more in '18 than it did in '17 and way more than it did in the previous 10 years. So in that sense, it\u2019s helpful but it will tend to dilute a little bit the percent. Operator : And your next question comes from Patrick Donnelly from Goldman Sachs. Patrick Donnelly : Bill, maybe one on industrial. How should we be thinking about core industrial and products inspection growth rates to trend in 2018 here? And then specifically on core industrial, any geography still lagging on that front that you expect to maybe show some turnaround in the near term? Bill Donnelly : So we should be able to put up a mid single-digit growth in our core industrial business. And we did a little bit better than that in '17, but that\u2019s largely due to the China industrial business it grew so much in 2017. And we see that one area now how good we are in measuring that pent up demand impact could be upside or downside to our guidance in this regard. But maybe connecting to our answer to our first question from Ross, I think we feel pretty good about the industrial environment in the western world. We feel actually good about it globally with maybe some comparison concerns when it comes to China. Was there -- I think I forgot this. I think you had a second part, Patrick, and I apologize I forgot. Patrick Donnelly : It was just about if any geographies are still lagging on the core industrial side, but it doesn't sound like. Bill Donnelly : I think it's just this question of how well are we estimating the impact of pent up demand on the China numbers. That's the hardest one to predict. Patrick Donnelly : And then maybe one on the Field Turbo side. Obviously, investments there have been at elevated levels for a couple of years here. Could you just talk through how long it may take to turn profitable and if there is any inflection point expected in 2018 from some of those early investments? Olivier Filliol : What's important to know is every Field Turbo is different and it's the payback period can make it change radically by geography and by type of business that we are focused on. So to illustrate it on a telesales person that telesales person might have reached breakeven point of the six months. But if we -- as a person for automated chemistry, it might take two years to build up the pipeline. So it varies. And the different ways that we are pursuing here have sometimes different entities, like two years ago we have strong entities on telesales. At this point, we have more emphasis on more sophisticated instrument sales people. And so we might have a little bit of longer payback period. But a good assumption is that of the one to two years, they reach to breakeven point. And so we definitely have a situation now where we are benefitting in terms of growth but also on profitability from the investments that we did one-two years ago. Operator : Your next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Derik De Bruin : Couple of questions. First one, what's the pacing in terms of the FX on the top line benefit over the next couple of quarters? Olivier Filliol : I'll let Mary give the answer on that one. Mary Finnegan : So Derik, we're assuming for the top line about 3.5% benefit for the full year, and you're going to see it start off about 5.5% in the first quarter and then about 4% and then down to 2% for the second half of the year. Derik De Bruin : And I'm just curious, are you seeing any -- your business was uniquely positioned within the life sciences market that we cover. And I'm just wondering if you\u2019ve seen any signs or any indication from any of your customers in the U.S. that they're going to reinvest any money from tax reform into their businesses and doing it through CapEx projects, i. e. any of food retailers planned using the windfall for investing in new equipment, or they all typically getting to Amazon? Olivier Filliol : I think I would start and say our instruments typically are not that expensive and not so CapEx relevant. And so I would be cautious to see a direct impact here from the tax changes in the U.S. I think what we might see more medium to long term that there might be more investments in new labs, for example, in U.S. and we might benefit from that. But on a short basis, I don't think so. And if you talk about retail, actually retail is probably more impacted about the overall nervousness on the profit pool, and that actually would rather impact or slowdown their commitment to new investments in store upgrades and so on. So in a nutshell, I don\u2019t see a big impact here. Derik De Bruin : And then just one final question. You did a couple of acquisitions last year or the last couple of years. Can you talk about how those were trending if there is anything else that is catching around the horizon? Olivier Filliol : So the two acquisitions that you referred to one is Troemner that we did about a year ago and Biotix that we did a few months ago, happy on both. Actually Troemner had its first full year and exceeded our expectations, really happy. And Biotix had the first -- last quarter here, a very good performance too. So from a financial standpoint, happy about how things are growing. And in terms of integration or accumulation, also very happy good retention of the teams, good commitments of the teams. And Biotix team, which is a little bit new to us, we are very pleased by talent pool that we have seeing there, and there how we are talking about shared strategies going forward how we can leverage the global franchise and so on, so a promising start. When you refer to about the pipeline for further deals, the strategy remains the same. Of course, I'm happy that we could close here two attractive deals in the last 12 months. We had a period where we were not closing any deals. This is unpredictable and going forward, we\u2019re going to pursue the same approaches both on acquisitions with good synergy potential. But the availability of deals is difficult to predict. But hopefully, one or the other deal will materialize. Derik De Bruin : And just one final one, just Bill on the op margin target for 2018. How much are you embedding your model for expansion? Bill Donnelly : So plus 50 bps, and currency adjusted a little bit more. Derik De Bruin : And the currency hit is basically on the gross margin line? Bill Donnelly : Yes, I guess if we look at our table, I'm struggling to give you -- I think through the logic of why that is. But yes, if we look at our model, which is bottoms-up, the short answer is yes. Operator : And your next question comes from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Brandon Couillard : Olivier, did you get the service growth rate for the fourth quarter? And then at a high level, do you have any difference in the growth between the core contract business versus the parts business? Olivier Filliol : Service co growth in the quarter was 5% and yes -- for the full year it was 7%. And the contract business is doing actually really well. I don't know the number for Q4 separate, but I would be surprised if it wouldn\u2019t be actually double-digit, because early in the year we looked at as we talked about it for you guys and we have really very good numbers, and the part that we also most focused on. The contract business is also outgrowing this past business because the quality of our products get better and better. And we shared with you that this is one of the things why we push the contract business the fixed business, including spares, we are not going to have the same growth dynamic and that\u2019s certainly region wise. In the overall numbers, it\u2019s difficult to see but the contract business would completely outgrow this 5% or 7% that we had for the year. Brandon Couillard : And Bill, are you still thinking about the APSs been up about 150 basis points for the year? Bill Donnelly : Realistically, it\u2019s probably got to be a little bit more than that. But realistically, our material costs are going to be a little bit higher as well than we originally forecasted. Operator : And we have reached the end of our Q&A. Ms. Mary Finnegan, your closing remarks please. Mary Finnegan : Thanks everyone for joining us tonight. Of course as always, if you have any questions just give us a call or shoot us an email. Take care and good night. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Bill will provide details on our financial results and an update to our guidance. I will then have some additional comments and we will then open the lines for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter are on page three of the presentation. Local currency sales growth of 5% came in pretty much as we expected and was impacted by the excellent growth in the prior year. As a reminder in the first quarter of 2017, we had local currency sales growth of 12%. China did very well in the quarter with a strong base sales growth. Our overall solid top line growth rose another quarter of strong adjusted EPS growth. Demand in our markets remains solid and we believe we are well positioned for further market share gains. Let me turn it over Bill to provide additional details on the financial and our updated guidance for the year. Bill? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thanks Olivier and hello everybody. Sales were $660.8 million in the quarter and that's a 5% increase in local currency. The Biotix acquisition contributed approximately 1.5% sales growth. On a U.S. dollar basis total sales increased 11% as currencies increased sales growth by 6% in the quarter. On slide number 4, we show local currency sales growth by region. Sales grew 5% in the Americas, 10% in Asia/Rest of World. Sales growth in China was specifically up 15% in the quarter, while sales declined by 1% in Europe. Sales in Europe were impacted by the timing of the Easter holiday and as a reminder, we had local currency sales growth of 13% in the same period last year. On slide number 5, we outlined local currency sales growth by product lines. In the quarter our lab business grew by 10%, industrial sales declined by 1% as growth in core industrial was offset by a decline in our product inspection business. Olivier will have some additional comments on product inspection later in the quarter. Our food retailing business was flat in the quarter. I know some of you have questions on the Q1 organic sales growth and the impact of Easter and other one-time topics. One way I gain confidence is by looking at our April year-to-date organic sales growth. Through April organic sales growth is a healthy mid-single-digit despite a very strong prior year comparison. Now turning to slide number 6, let me walk you through the key items in our P&L for the quarter. One comment to start, as we mentioned last quarter there's a new accounting rule that went into effect at the beginning of the year, which moves a portion of our pension income from operating profit to other expense. This is actually different for Mettler-Toledo than it is for other companies, who actually improved their operating profit due to the re-class that's because our pension plan in Switzerland is overfunded. Although it's not a huge impact to us, you'll note that we restated last year's results so that they're on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 56.7% in the quarter and that compares to 57.8% in the prior year. We have a couple of factors impacting gross margins this quarter. First, pricing continues to be a strong contributor. However, this was offset by the impact of currency, some negative mix and initial costs associated with the consolidation of the product inspection facilities currently underway in the United States. R&D amounted to $34.7 million and that's a 5% increase in local currency. SG&A amounted to $200.7 million. That's an increase of 2% in local currency. Investment in field resources were somewhat offset by a decline in variable comp. Adjusted operating income amounted to $139.5 million in the quarter, which represents a 10% increase over the prior year amount of $126.5 million. Adjusted operating margin was 21.1% and on constant currency our margins were up by 10 basis points (sic) [10%] (00:06:51). A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization was $11.7 million in the quarter, while interest expense was $8.4 million in the quarter. Other income amounted to $2.4 million and this includes the $1.6 million of pension income that re-class that I previously described. As you adjust your models for the year, you want to reflect this quarterly amount for the remainder of this year. Our tax rate was 22% in our adjusted EPS in the quarter. Our reported effective tax rate is 21% with the difference due to the timing of stock option exercises. Moving to fully diluted shares, they were 26.1 million in the quarter that's a 2% decline from the prior year reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $3.74 that's a 12% increase over the prior year amount of $3.34 per share. I think it's interesting to note on a two-year basis that's more than a 50% increase about as good as I've ever seen us do. And as a reminder, it's basically organic EPS growth. On a reported basis in the quarter EPS was $3.58 and that compares to $3.48 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.13 of restructuring and $0.10 of purchased intangible amortization. It also excludes $0.07 benefit of the low reported tax rate which is already mentioned, is due to the timing of stock option exercises. Okay. That's it for the P&L. And now I want to cover cash flow and the cash. In the quarter, cash flow was $56.5 million in line with the prior year. Our working capital statistics remains solid with DSO at 43.5 days and ITO at 4.5 times. Now let me make a couple of comments on the potential tariff situation as it relates to our business and manufacturing in China. One upfront comment, we do not have any greater insight than you with respect to what ultimately will play out. However, we're preparing diligently so we can be ready to react if necessary. We're looking at the tariffs in two ways. First, with respect to our business in China, we don't envision a significant impact as we import into China from the U.S. only a very small percentage of our product sales in China. We do import into China many higher end products from Switzerland, Germany and the UK, but we don't expect these countries to be involved at this stage. With respect to the possible slowdown in our Chinese business because of tariffs impacting our customers there, it's hard to determine at this point. Our exposure to raw materials and industries likely to be most impacted has declined over the last several years, but the remaining business may have some impact. We'll monitor the environment in China closely, but at this point see no change to demand. In terms of our exports out of China and the United States, we have limited steel and aluminum imports. But we already see some commodity price increases, due to the proposed Section 232 legislation. The impact before any corresponding actions from our side to mitigate is in the range of $2 million to $3 million. We also import some instruments and parts for instruments from China. Based on the current list of possible tariffs under Section 301 we estimate the potential impact to be something in the area of $8 million. For both of these items, we've prepared supply chain and pricing strategy initiatives which would largely impact the mitigate \u2013 sorry largely mitigate the impact should the tariffs be implemented. We fully acknowledge there's a lot of unknowns and uncertainty with respect to how this might work out. We're monitoring it closely and we'll react quickly, if necessary. Now let me turn to guidance, a few comments. First, the economic environment continues to be favorable with good conditions in the Americas and Europe and a very positive environment in China. However, we do acknowledge there is more uncertainty in global economy versus the last time we spoke. In particular, uncertainty surrounding for example, the impact of tariffs which I mentioned earlier. Our guidance assumes that market conditions remain largely consistent with the current environment. Second, we feel very good about our growth strategy and execution right now, and we think that can continue into second half of the year. Third, and I know, I've said this before but it's important to highlight, comparisons do matter. In particular, we face some challenging comparisons in China and in our product inspection business during the next two quarters. With this as a backdrop let me cover the specifics. We continue to believe that local currency sales growth in 2018 will be approximately 6%. With this sales assumption we now assume an adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.10 per share to $2.25 per share (sic) [$20.10 per share to $20.25 per share] (00:12:08) which reflects the growth rate of 14% to 15% and this compares to our previous guidance of $19.95 to $20.15. With respect to the second quarter we would expect local currency sales growth to be in the 6% range. Based on this sales growth we would expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.55 per share to $4.60 per share and that's a growth rate of 16% to 17%. In terms of currency and sales growth, we would expect currency to increase sales by approximately 2.5% for the quarter \u2013 sorry, for the full year. And for the second quarter, we expect it to benefit sales by approximately 3%. In terms of cash flow, we expect free cash flow to be approximately $450 million this year and our share repurchases estimate remains in the $475 million range. Okay. That's it from my side. And I now want to turn it back to Olivier. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thank you, Bill. I will cover the business in some more detail this quarter. Let me start with our lab business which continues to perform well despite strong growth in the prior year. Lab benefited from some acquisition revenue from Biotix. However, our organic growth in lab was up nicely over the prior year. All product categories continue to do well. Balances, auto-chem and process analytics have particular strong growth in the quarter. Analytical instruments and pipettes had good growth, but faced tougher comparisons due to excellent growth in the same period last year. For lab in general, we continue to lead the market with technology. We have many examples throughout the business. One recent example is our new unique handheld density meters. It can provide automatic digital measurements in an easy to use portable instrument and its proprietary software assists with data management. It has the look and the feel of our Rainin electronic pipettes, which reinforces our commitment to provide reliable, but simple to operate lab instruments. This is a small product line, but I thought it was a good example to share with you to highlight the focus on technology that we are making throughout our product portfolio. We combine this strong product pipeline with our proven Spinnaker sales and marketing strategies and investments in the field resources via our Field Turbo program. Lab receives a disproportionate share of both R&D, marketing and field investment resources. I'm optimistic about the lab business for the rest of the year and into the future. I'm convinced, we are well positioned and can continue to incrementally gain market share. One last comment on lab and this is looking at it from a geographic focus. Asia, in particular China did very well in lab. Europe's lab growth was more moderate principally due to the very strong growth in the same prior year and was impacted by Easter. Americas' organic growth in lab was solid. Now turning to industrial, as you heard from Bill, the overall industrial business declined 1% in the quarter. Our industrial includes two pieces : core industrial; and product inspection. We have factors impacting both businesses this quarter. I will start with product inspection which represents 42% of the total industrial business or a little less than 20% of total sales. Product inspection is focused principally on food manufacturers and also pharmaceutical and consumer goods companies. Our offering consists of checkweighers, metal detectors, x-ray, vision and sterilization solutions to help ensure the integrity and quality of packaged items. We have the broadest product offering in the market and are a clear market leader in every major region except for Japan. Our extensive service network is a very important competitive advantage for us as manufacturing productivity and uptime is critical for our customers. Growth drivers for product inspection are attractive, principally driven by concerns on product safety, brand protection and manufacturing productivity. We have seen a trend over the last few years of global food companies looking to standardize globally their product inspection instruments. Our global presence and service network provides us a unique advantage here. We achieved high-single-digit growth in both 2016 and 2017 in product inspection, in part due to these trends, I just mentioned. Given these comparisons our outlook for 2018 is for more moderate growth. In Q1, product inspection was down mid-single digit. There are a number of factors that impacted these results primary of which is tough comparisons as local currency sales were up 15% in the prior period. A couple other factors also impacted the results to a lesser degree. These included the move of our largest U.S. product inspection unit in Tampa, Florida at the end of the quarter. We will have some additional smaller ones in the coming months as we consolidate all the U.S. product inspection operations into this new state-of-the-art facility. As I mentioned last quarter, you will have a chance to see this facility later this year when we hold an Investor Meeting there on November 12. In addition to the move, the German product inspection operations were implementing the new ERP system in the first quarter. The investments coming from our facility consolidation and new ERP system will have a very good return in the coming years as they will further strengthen our franchise. Similar to Bill's comments on the group, through to April, our product inspection business is close to flat with double digit two-year growth rate. We will have a solid second quarter for product inspection. Longer term, this remains one of our strongest franchises with attractive growth prospects. The other piece of our industrial business is core industrial, which was up low-single digits in the quarter. We had strong growth in China in core industrial as we are benefiting from improved economic conditions. Growth in Europe and Americas in core industrial was solid on a two-year basis. The business was also impacted in Q1 by our transportation and logistics business, which is project-based and often lumpy. Last year, we had a couple larger T&L orders in the first quarter, which impacted comparisons for this year. Sales were also impacted by Easter, because of our large core industrial service business in the West. The final piece of our company is the retail business, which was basically flat in the quarter. This business is also project-based and relatively lumpy. This quarter we had a large increase in U.S., which was offset by a large decrease in Europe. Our focus for this business is profitability over growth. I would expect low-single-digit sales growth for the second quarter and [Technical Difficulty] (00:19:57) year. I think that gives you some more insights into our business both, the first quarter results, as well as the outlook. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are pleased with the solid results for the first quarter. Assuming market conditions remain stable, we are well positioned to deliver a year of strong sales and earnings growth. I want to now ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citigroup. Your line is open. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good afternoon guys. Thanks. Bill, on China when you talk about the uncertainty that exists there, does that at all refer to what you're seeing in the order book or the visibility that you have, or you kind of just calling out what you're seeing in terms of the headlines? Just trying to understand, the relative confidence that you have in that region, at this point, just given the quarter. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah. So I think the \u2013 for us, I think one of the uncertainties is the less the Chinese market and more of the impact of tariffs potentially leading towards downturn in the global economy. As we've mentioned, on several occasions the global economy is great, right? There's a lot of good stuff going around in the world and so we're more concerned, if there could be disruption to that and that's what I meant by uncertainty. I think this \u2013 the heightened uncertainty comes largely from the current tariff discussions going back and forth. With regard to our current Chinese business, it's performing great. Everything we've seen through April look great. But I would comment that it's a tough comp. They grew quite a bit in the second third quarter of last year; I'm just pulling up some numbers now, so China was up as a reminder 22% in Q2 of last year and 28% in Q3. So I \u2013 us putting growth numbers on top of that would be \u2013 is a sign that things are really going pretty well down there. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Do you have a full year outlook for China at this point that's updated? Is it any different than what we are looking at last quarter? I think it was 5% to 10%? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah. It's still in that range but probably creeped up closer to the top of that range than the bottom. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then if I could just ask one more. How are you feeling about Europe at this point? I mean it looks like some of the macro data points are sliding a bit, but they're still pretty good at relative levels. And it sounds like there was a bit of seasonality for you this quarter with Easter. So, what does the outlook for Europe look like? I think the comp next quarter gets much easier for you. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: So, it does get easier. Just as a reminder, Q1 last year we had a big benefit due to the legislation around that retail labeling topic as well as Easter timing benefited us in Q1 last year. So if I look just to give you a feeling the whole, just looking at year-to-date through April for Europe, the number is, looks already much better just adjusting for the Easter timing. I think we're more in kind of the range we would expect for the full year and that's despite having the tough comp anyways. So just adjusting for Easter and we're looking much better April year-to-date. So, we are well positioned there strategically. We've made some investments in Olivier's Field Turbo programs and other topics so our growth rate will be much better in Europe the coming three quarters. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Bill. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard, Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. I guess, first off, on the new Tampa facility is it possible to quantify the savings you expect to achieve by consolidating your product IT business \u2013 I'm sorry, your product ramification business down in Tampa? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: So it's a single-digit million would be the first comment, but maybe Dan, the bigger thing we needed to do there and that's just how much infrastructure we're taking out less building cost, things like that. But I think the biggest benefit we have there is we just outgrew our Tampa facility. So, I think I've mentioned it on calls in the past; our team would literally have to move inventory in and out of the plant in the morning just to make room for production to take place. We are one of the best stories inside the company in the last five years has been the growth of our x-ray and metal detection business in Tampa. So they will \u2013 it's a little bit more difficult to quantify, but you can imagine ,if you think about a lean supply chain layout in a new facility where we're not doing silly things like having to move inventory around just to do production is going to help. And we've never really been able to try to quantify but we knew it was the right answer to make that investment. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: And maybe on top of that beyond just the operations benefit we're bringing the teams here together, so we're going to have to check weighing business, with the x-ray with the metal detection business and the latest decision is also to add the vision inspection business all into the Tampa facility. This brings the teams together, cross-selling is supported, but you can imagine also for customers this is very attractive. The new facility offers great ways for us for demo programs, for tests, customer test programs. I think this is going to be extremely powerful going forward for us to further grow the business and totally underline that we have here a leadership position that we can further leverage. So, that's a powerful investment in the future, and it's certainly not just about cost savings opportunities. In contrary, I expect that this is \u2013 preliminarily an investment in the franchise. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And Olivier, I think you commented that you like the long-term trends in product inspection during your prepared remarks. Could you talk once you lap these difficult comparisons, how do you look at the growth rate of the product inspection business? Is it something that grows faster than the corporate average, at the corporate average? And what would be some of the macros that would drive that? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: So it's definitely one of the businesses that should grow above the group average. The market offers these opportunities and certainly the way how we are managing, allocating resources, again, all that stuff supports that approach. There are different factors. So first of all, I would stress the point that we have the most attractive portfolio of the different technologies and we have leadership positions in the different technologies. We \u2013 this plays very well also to the needs of our customers. Then we have an excellent service network that is very much appreciated by our customers. And then for certain technologies there is still an adoption rate opportunity. This is particularly true for x-ray and that's another driver for additional growth. This \u2013 what I just said applies across the world, but then you can imagine there is, on top of that the emerging markets opportunities. Packaged foods consumption is growing over proportionally in emerging markets and brand protection quality is a key driver. And so the combination of that offers additional growth opportunities. So yeah, all-in-all, I definitely expect to have above group average. But do also recognize that within product inspection we have a certain project-based aspect of certain lumpiness. If you have a global key account that is rolling out a big project across the world this can have an impact on a quarter-to-quarter comparisons. But, all-in-all, it should be very nice growth. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Appreciate all the color. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thanks, good afternoon. Bill, just if you can break down within China the lab versus industrial growth rate in the first quarter? And could you sort of talk about the sustainability of the lab business being double-digit there, I think that's eight straight quarters on a row it's growing over 10% give us some details on that. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yes. And so first comment on lab is that \u2013 it is eight straight quarters, it's probably the average is around kind of eyeballing it's probably 20% during that period. We were in the 20% range again this past quarter in lab. Our industrial business was up low-double digits and retail was actually flat. So, the business is performing well. We are doing quite well with this new focus that we implemented a couple of years ago on priority segments and we are very happy with the performance. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: I was actually visiting the team just three weeks ago, I had a chance to visit also the new facilities and I do have a very broad-based business review. And one thing that I really particularly liked is the resource shifting that we have done over the years to follow the market opportunities really play very well. And Bill just shared with you, the lab growth and this is not a coincidence. We really recognized early on the lab has promising end user markets. We continue to invest in these. As on the Industrial part, we did actually reduce resources to certain industry segments that we felt have no long-term or attractive long-term prospects. And seeing how that played out was really powerful. I could say similar thing also about the regional presence. So, we for example in the times where China wasn't growing so well we did \u2013 we visit our local office setup that we have. We had in the all-time many local offices across China and we recognize today that there is not the same necessity for that because you have just much better infrastructure. Mobility is better, phones are better, education of people are better. We have ERP system that is better and so on. So, the team really leveraged these opportunities and we allocated resources to drive more growth and that's what we see in our current numbers. And I certainly expect that this will continue to help us to outgrow this market. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : That's helpful. And then one more for you, Olivier, I think in your prepared comments with respect to the product inspection business, I think you mentioned an ERP roll-out in the first quarter that may have been disruptive. What exactly was that? And then at a higher level on Blue Ocean could you remind us where you are in terms of the status of the roll-out and implementation? And what the magnitude of the CapEx roll-off is which I think should fall in 2019, if I'm right Bill? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: I'll take the first part and then hand over to Bill. So the first part is the Blue Ocean ERP rollout was for our checkweighing business in Germany. That was quite an important, but also demanding roll-out because in the product inspection business we have a lot of engineered solutions and that requires some new functionality in our template. And in essence our checkweighing business was here to start for it. And as you can imagine such a roll-in takes always a lot of attention of the management. You have always in the first few weeks, sometimes also months, and some learning curve to go down and some fine-tuning and that's the impact that we saw in first quarter. I have already seen that we are \u2013 we called up most of it already in April and the remainder will happen in the next few months. So feel good about that. And in that sense not different to what we experienced in all the other roll-ins that we have. I think that's just a natural thing. We highlighted here on the call because it had a certain impact within one quarter. In terms of where we stand, we have rolled, or we have implemented Blue Ocean pretty much on all the significant producing organization. And there is one important one left that it is actually in Tampa. So the one that we just moved facility this is something that will follow, but otherwise we are very advanced. And when it comes to the market organization we are also very advanced. But there are more countries to come. And so we will continue on that journey certainly for a couple of more quarters. But if I look for the whole group, I think in the meantime we are far beyond 80% of the users that are already on the system. And I think that gives you the flavor that we are very, very advanced on the whole program. Bill maybe on the CapEx one? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah. I think you'll see CapEx maybe to not get it confused between maybe CapEx in total you'll see going down already some next year and in 2020 further. I think that you'll see our cash flow conversion which is already pretty good, get even better in the coming years. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions, everyone. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: You're welcome. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Bill, in your prepared remarks on gross margins you called out a few considerations there for the year-on-year trend. I think there was mix the PI issue that we've touched on here a little bit. Can you quantify any of those? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Sure. And maybe I cover the biggest topics and then kind of maybe in a quantitative way and give you some qualitative on the other item. So, I think the biggest single item was actually a benefit from our price increases. So, our price increases in the quarter were about 230 basis points and that translated to about 100-basis-point benefit to our gross margin. The biggest negative item was that we had currencies going against us by about 60 basis points, okay. And then there were a series of kind of smaller items that added up a little bit. I would say one is of course, there were some volume effect partly explained by the Easter movement between the years, so a little bit of volume. In the product inspection business, we had as Olivier mentioned this, on the one hand the startup of the Tampa facility. So they weren't running at full capacity I think for two to three week period there and when we ramped up the engineered-to-order part of the Garvens business in Germany that Olivier referred to there was that first month there, I think their output was roughly 60% of what a normal thing was. That's frankly a planned startup when we were doing that business. So, the other interesting item that didn't really have an impact, but I think it's good for you guys to focus on a bit is, material costs were basically flat in the quarter. And I do expect that that's going to get tougher as the rest of the year plays out. I think we'll be able to address that with better price increases, but I think if you look that material line, our current index kind of an inflation index that we measure our year-on-year buying is running almost exactly 100 right now. And I would expect that by the end of the year that'll probably be closer to 101. Did I answer your question? Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. It's a lot of moving parts Bill, but you did it. I really appreciate that. And then the follow-up that I wanted to... William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Hey, Steve, if I could interrupt you maybe \u2013 when you say a lot of moving parts, I realize I could easily be confusing. Maybe kind of get into the bottom line because I think one thing is to analyze the pieces of what happened this quarter, but maybe if I could give you some comments about the remainder of the year. So sitting here today, I continue to think that on a constant currency basis our gross margins will be up 40 basis points to 50 basis points for the full year which actually in this most recent quarter, the right sheet in front of me on a constant currency basis our gross profit was down by 42 basis points for some of these reasons we covered. And so you can imagine then it gets better going forward. And then because of currency you'll continue to see headwind down the line but that's a little bit cosmetic. I think the best way to look at it is in constant currency to measure from a performance point of view. But by the time we get through the full year, I think what you'll see is the constant currency improvement in our gross margin will be offset by currency. So year-on-year for the full year I think our gross profit margin will be pretty close to flat. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's perfect. Thank you very much. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Hopefully I think [Technical Difficulty] (00:39:32) more moving parts, Steve. So what was your second question? Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: The second was actually on China and in a scenario where the tariff issue does become real. I can appreciate that \u2013 for the team, be a pretty substantial operational challenge. But given that you guys have mitigation plans maybe it would just be helpful to understand those mitigation plans a little bit more deeply alternative sourcing import/export dynamics there. What I'm wondering is while I really appreciate the quantification of the potential impacts of a tariff scenario, what I'm wondering is given the implementation or offset programs that you have in mind is there a scenario where this does become real in terms of the financial impact or can we really work around it very effectively? Thanks. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: So let me take the first part. Operationally, it wouldn't be too disruptive to us in a sense that one of the key mitigation factor is pricing. And we have already started to do all this analysis. We know how to implement these things and that would certainly work well. And then on the supply chain itself, yeah, there is some parts that are supplier related, where you do a sampling and all that stuff, but it's not that major. And in that sense we feel this is absolutely manageable. I think the part that would be much bigger for us in terms of the impact is if it's -- if it influences the world economy. That's really the bigger part. But the other part as Bill described in the prepared remarks in terms of million dollars it's not so huge. And we have this mitigating factor that we feel actually our plans are already quite solid and we would know how to do it. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah, maybe one additional to Olivier's comments would be is that I think in the course of a full year, we probably could largely offset what would happen. But maybe in the first quarter or two quarters, Steve there might be a little bit of catch up work. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Exactly, what we needed. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Thanks. Bill, I appreciate all the color you gave on margins. Just as we think about the sequential progression here should we expect 2Q margins to be up or down I guess in light of the facility consolidation and ERP and some of these other transit issues? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Let me get my favorite cheat sheet in front of me so in Q2 we would say margin should be flattish which would be approaching 30 basis point or 40 basis point improvement in a constant currency basis. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Okay. And then on guidance you're raising by $0.10 you beat by $0.01. Can you maybe just obviously you touched on margins earlier, but is the rest of that from buybacks? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: I think the biggest thing what we're kind of looking at what would be appropriate guidance. I think for us is if we look at where we expect to be at the midpoint of the year, we're ahead of where we thought we would be three months ago. And so we adjusted our guidance accordingly. There's always a little bit of speculation Tycho for what the second half of the year can bring. But at this stage we see no reason to change our assumptions for the second half of the year. So it's kind of this combination of the beat which we described here in the current quarter. And then how we view the full first half of the year compared to maybe what we felt three months ago. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Okay. And then I guess lastly on lab. Obviously that's continued to perform well early days on NIH increase but are you starting to see any benefit from that yet here in the U.S.? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: I mean as part of our business that has the most impact from NIH budgets would be our pipette businesses. What I can tell you that given everything kind of going on in those two businesses right now we're very happy with their performance but it would be tough for us to specifically link it to NIH and I didn't really look at April year-to-date by segment. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah. I would say our whole bio life science business in U.S. did very well. Typically that's the Rainin and the auto-chem business that has particular exposure to that. Both businesses did very well on that one. But the NIH we are not so much exposed, the pipette business is really one of the most. So that's so why I answer yes bio life science in general. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Charles Steinman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey guys. This is Charlie on for Patrick. Just curious as we kind of trend through the year putting into our models kind of for the lab and industrial business looks like lab was probably the toughest comp of the year. So, are we in a position to think that that business might actually accelerate as we actually go throughout the rest of the year? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: So, understood the question. I think at this point we're largely seeing maybe next quarter not as much, but it could be in Q3 and Q4 we see some modest increases there, yes. Charles Steinman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it, makes sense. And then just on pricing I think when you were answering Steve's question you said that pricing in the quarter was up 230 bps. I think that was probably a little above where we were modeling, so just kind of any update on pricing expectations for the year? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Well some of that reflects Charlie that we started to see some inflation so we did see some moves there and started to implement some things in response to it. We do see higher wage growth for example in some other areas. What I would say is that Shawn Vadala and his team are working on some mid-year pricing topics. I think we haven't finalized what that's going to be in part because we want to see how the tariff situation plays out. But I feel reasonably confident that we can do something that brings net dollars hopefully to the second half of the year. Charles Steinman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks. Operator : You're next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Baird. Your line is open. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good afternoon. Olivier could you kind of speak maybe for a minute or two just to when we talk about China industrial I'm curious how developed and how much scale there is to the PI business versus the core industrial business? And maybe we could just start there, but I'm curious how each of those two pieces did relative to Bill's low-double-digit growth rate for the quarter. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah. So I will start to say that we \u2013 our mix that we have in China is different to the global mix that we have. If I look to the West and then in particular in the U.S., we have a very high share of product inspection, versus core industrial, and in China, it's still the reverse, core industrial is much bigger than product inspection. And that is historically driven. You will always see that more mature markets have more demand for product inspection equipment, because it's very much quality driven, it's very much about automated packaging and even the industry structure is different. We, in that sense, have benefited heavily in the past for this industrial business. Our product inspection business in China has been growing nicely in the last couple of years, but it is still underrepresented. And then in that sense, I do expect that product inspection is outgrowing our core industrial business, in particular also China. This has not always been the case every quarter, but in the long-term should be that way. To be specific on a group level, product inspection is roughly 17%. As in China, it is 5% of total sales. That alone gives you a clear indication how much upside we have when China starts to further mature and has an industry structure similar to what we have in the West. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I get you. And then, can I just back the question up and when I look at industrial for the full year in 2018, for calendar 2018, is both PI and core industrial, are both of those businesses expected to be kind of plus mid-singles? I mean, is that kind of order of magnitude should they both grow about, in parity? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Sorry. Just to make sure I got your question. We weren't sure if you were asking what China industrial or total industrial? Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I left China. Sorry. I left China. I backed up to the corporate level. Just curious, given the start here in the first quarter and I realized the comps and things, but I'm curious, do both pieces of industrial kind of grow at that, maybe Mettler average core growth rate? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: I think you'll see them both finish the year at about the same growth rate. But I think you'll see the product inspection business growing faster on average for the remainder of this year. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, okay. And then just, maybe the last question. It may not direct us back. Olivier, could you just kind of update us a little bit on the Field Turbo program? And maybe, are we on track through April here for full year investments there, and maybe where they're slanted, where they're weighted? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah. So the program is very much ongoing. We do these in waves. And I always said, I would continue with the programs as long as I feel the market offers growth opportunities and I definitely feel that way. And I see \u2013 continue to see very good results on it. I have seen that last year when I had detailed business reviews with the countries. I mentioned before I was in China, but I also spent quite some time in Southeast Asia was particularly excited about seeing the impact of Field Turbos in Indonesia, Vietnam and so on. So, my commitments to continue with the program is ongoing. In terms of waves, we certainly had an important wave, review wave end of the year where I committed to quite a lot of additional head count. And there's another one upcoming here or more in the summer. And from a regional perspective that might be \u2013 the last one that I expect \u2013 also the next one is certainly more weighted now to the emerging markets. As when I looked a few years ago, we were more focused also in Western markets. So that changes a little bit in terms of business mix. That's kind of unchanged still very much laboratory and product inspection business that benefits from it. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. Thank you much. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thank you Rick. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi good afternoon. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Hi Derik. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : It's the \u2013 a lot of my questions have been asked but just some cleanup. Can you \u2013 anything that we need to watch out on like the interest income line? Obviously rates are moving up and just sort of wondering what sort of -- how do you look at net interest expense for the full year? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Mary has got everything locked down. Derik would be the short answer. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: We're highly fixed right now, and have been for a few quarters. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I think we're modeling about $36 million for the year in net interest expense. Is that about right? Mary T. Finnegan - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah see that \u2013 hey Derik I think closer to about $33 million, $34 million for interest. And then of course we have other income is income of about $6.5 million. Does that make sense? Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Mary T. Finnegan - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Okay. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. And the $1.6 million for the pension continues on in the other income line? Mary T. Finnegan - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: That's correct. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Correct. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And for the full year for the Biotix acquisition, is that still tracking at about 1%? It looks it was a little bit \u2013 CAD below where we had modeled it for the quarter, is that still a good way to look at it somewhere in the 0.5% to 1% range? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: It'll be 1% for the full year, but without really any impact on fourth quarter. So that's somewhat above 1% for the first three quarters of the year. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it, okay. Thanks. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Hi, good afternoon guys. Just trying to put together the picture here in sort of interesting economic environment, right? You talked about inflation taking up and pricing being maybe a bit better or accelerating and the material cost accelerating and yet we've got industrial here, it's tough comps that were sort of flat to down. And growth in general seems good but then PMIs have ticked down. I guess just trying to think through like this environment versus environments you've seen in the past. I guess it seems like an odd picture a bit comparative to what we would sort of expect at this part of the cycle. And so as you just start planning and thinking, I mean, what are the sorts of things you're keyed in on or looking at? And do you sort of agree with the idea that the PMIs while they're slower are still kind of elevated and suggesting that growth will be quite good for a while? Is it really just a question then in your mind of duration given how long we're sort of into this cycle? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Hey, Ross. Actually yes. But I would also say that when I look at our early indicators lead generation and so on, we have no signals of slowdown at all. And we still feel that the world economy is very strong. We know that we are facing these comparisons topics and that's certainly true for China, but there are no clouds out there that worry us. But of course, we want to stay agile if something happens. But you hear me talking before about Field Turbo the same is true (00:56:20) investments in marketing, investments overall. We are very much in the growth mode and we will adjust our plans if need be, but at this stage we are all in growth models. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: I would kind of add to that. We've talked about it in the past Ross that, I mean, yes, we prefer higher GDP growth than lower, but we don't need a huge GDP growth. We need people to stick to their replacement cycles. When they do that we take our piece of that, we take a little bit of share and we can do well in that type of environment. So, yeah, that would be my addition. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Hi. Good evening. Couple of quick questions for you. Bill, I was just wondering first if you could comment on the product inspection business here in the quarter. I mean I apologize if you had already commented on this, as I'm jumping on late. But, how much of the software trends were related to the internal disruptions you referenced versus what you think is going on in the market? And then I have a follow-up. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Okay. So \u2013 hey, so we were down 5% in the quarter to put one number on it. And if you look at the prior year comp we were plus 15%. And so the biggest single reason is we had a tough comp. The second we had two then kind of what I would describe as operational issues where we had expected reductions in our capacity capability for lack of a better expression. One related to we were moving a very large facility in Tampa and are \u2013 it took a few weeks for our guys to get fully ramped up there. And then the second was we went live with the new ERP system in the middle of the quarter in our German checkweighing business. That business in April its output was back to normal, but in the month of February when they went live it was \u2013 they were producing at a lower than historical levels. So those two items were probably the \u2013 maybe had a little bit of an additional impact. And I guess to a certain extent there was probably some Easter impact for our European PI business but it would be tough to quantify the last three. The biggest item is the tough comp. And by the way we also have a tough comp in product inspection next quarter. But I think if I remember right Olivier commented about if you look already at April year-to-date, I believe our business was already caught up to flattish or something. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: I mean in essence the quarter came in as expected. You might recall that a lot of time on the call we did already anticipate that this will be a tough quarter because the comparisons and the operational topics we did anticipate that. This wasn't a surprise. Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you and then as a follow-up for Olivier, I saw in your press release you made a reference to new products, which I know historically new products have not been a major driver to overall reported growth, so I was just wonder if there's anything different with new products overall? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: No, no. It's the constant enhancement of new products, so not at all. In the prepared remarks I had one example but throughout the quarter we have multiple new products but none that would really move the needle. Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Okay, very good. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Hi. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I was hoping you could just update us on growth in aftermarket revenue, service consumables and where some of the initiatives you're working on there to drive growth? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Okay. Let me take \u2013 so first of all, we continue to experience here good progress, operational progress but also all the sales and marketing programs that we have around service. I'm very happy how that goes. This is true particularly also for the contract, service contract business (01:00:50) of service. When you look at our numbers, we always need to outgrow with service contracts because our break/fix business is more challenged. Our products last longer, they're better. And so we compensate that actually with having more labor content in our service offering, more pre-emptive maintenance programs and so on. So that's all going well. When Bill afterward shares with you the Q1 numbers, please keep in mind that for service actually Eastern has a much bigger impact, and in that sense we report to you the Q numbers really have a good picture of how the momentum is for the year. But, Bill, maybe quickly comment on the numbers? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: So we grew 3% in the quarter. Just as a reminder, last year for the full year we grew 7%, or just shy of 7%. And in the first quarter of last year, we grew by just short of 11%. So if you look at it on a two-year basis in Q1, we're just north of 7% and that's kind of in line with what we grew last year. So, we feel service business, as Olivier mentioned, key strategic focus and execution seems to go well there. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. That's great. And sorry if I missed it but did you quantify how much specifically you thought Easter impacted the overall results? And the European results specifically? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: I think it's tough to do specifically, but I think if you look for example at service, last year we grew 7%. In the first quarter we grew 11% of that 7%, and then if I look at the Q1 of this year we grew 3%. So our two-year growth rate is basically right in line with our \u2013 what we achieved last year. So somehow in the area of service because it's labor intensive, it's a bigger impact than it is on product but you see it also on our product business. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Very helpful. Thank you. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: And I guess Jack maybe one more thing. I made a point in the script to say that April year-to-date we were a healthy mid-single-digit which of course speaks to kind of where we are if you throw out Easter effects. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Make sense. Thanks, Bill. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Your line is open. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : Yes, pretty much everything's been asked. But I do want to ask about Stern Drive and some of the progress you're making with initiatives there? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah. Very happy about how that's going. To recall we launched that last year and one of the countries that actually is the pilot for here and most advanced is China. And when I was down there, I could visit our four facilities there and I was really very, very happy to see how this caused momentum. We see it on the floor. We see it in all the training communication and activities of our teams. And I start to clearly see it also in the numbers in the KPIs that we have. So, very pleased. The program proves that it's scalable. That's always the key success factor. And I definitely compare Stern Drive also to Spinnaker in the sense that we recognize that it's a journey. And we get more sophisticated every year, every way. And one of the key success factor is that we are doing that with our teams, with our employees. This is not just top down toolboxes or methodologies, no, this is very much with an inclusion of the teams and that helps us actually to get this continuous improvement. So bottom line, very happy. In terms of quantification, the way you need to look at it, this is feeding our margin expansion. You see Stern Drive impacting material costs but it definitely also impacts productivity and so the whole margin expansion program. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : All right. That sounds good. And Bill, do you happen to have the number of shares that were purchased in the quarter? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Mary's going to look that up for you. Mary T. Finnegan - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Sure. Jason, we repurchased 187,900 shares in the quarter. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : All right. Thanks very much. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Ms. Finnegan, I will turn the call back over to you. Mary T. Finnegan - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thanks, Scott. Thank you. And hey, thanks everyone for joining us this evening. As always if you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care and have a good night everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Let me now turn the call over to Olivier. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call which we are doing from Switzerland this evening, which is why we started earlier than usual. I will start with the summary of the quarter, Bill will provide details on our second quarter results and Shawn will provide an update to our guidance. I will then have some additional comments and we will then open the lines for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter are on page 3 of the presentation. Sales growth in the quarter was 7% in local currency, which is very good given the excellent 10% growth in the prior year period. China had particular strong growth in the quarter. This strong sales growth, combined with our continued focus on margin and cost savings measures, drove a 19% increase in adjusted EPS. This is particularly impressive given the 22% adjusted EPS growth we achieved in the second quarter of last year. All in all, we are quite pleased with the second quarter and our first half results this year. Demand in our markets continue to remain solid and assuming no change in the market conditions, we believe we are well positioned to continue to gain share and drive further earnings growth in the remainder of 2018 and beyond. Let me now turn it to Bill to provide additional details on the quarter. Bill? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thanks, Olivier, and hello, everybody. Sales were $722 million in the quarter, that's an increase of 7% in local currency. The Biotix acquisition contributed approximately 1.5% to sales growth. On a U.S. dollar basis, total sales growth increased 10% as currencies increased sales growth by 3% in the quarter. On slide number 4, we show our sales growth by region. Local currency sales grew 4% in the Americas, 7% in Europe, and 9% in Asia/Rest of World. Sales growth in China increased 15% in the quarter and our sales growth there was broad based. Slide number 5 shows sales growth for the first half of the year. Local currency sales growth has increased by 5% in the Americas, 3% in Europe, and 10% in Asia/Rest of World for the six month. Slide number 6, we outlined local currency sales growth by product line. In the quarter, laboratory sales grew 10%; industrial sales increased by 3%; and retail grew 6%. Within industrial, our core industrial business had good growth of 7%, offset in part by a 3% decline in product inspection. As a reminder, product inspection had an excellent growth of 20% in the year earlier period. Turning to the next slide, we have year-to-date sales growth by product line. Laboratory sales grew by 10%, industrial grew 1% and retail 3% for the six-month period. All these numbers again are in local currency. On side number 8, we've got a P&L for the quarter. Our gross margins were 57.2% that compared to 57.5% in the prior year. Pricing continued to be a strong contributor to gross margin. Pricing was offset by the impact of currency, some negative mix and lower margin on our product inspection business in part explained by the U.S. facility consolidation we described last quarter. On a constant currency basis and adjusted for acquisitions, margins were up about 30 basis points in the quarter. R&D amounted to $35.3 million and that's a 6% increase in local currency. SG&A was $208 million and that's a 3% increase in local currency versus the prior year. Increase principally related to additional investments in our field resources offset to a certain degree by cost saving initiatives. Our adjusted operating income was $169.3 million in the quarter, which represents a 15% increase over the prior year amount of $147.4 million. Adjusted operating margin was 23.4% and that's an 80 basis point improvement over the prior year. Currencies did not impact our operating margin in the quarter. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $12 million in the quarter, while interest expense was $8.3 million in the quarter. Our other income was $1.9 million and it includes $1.5 million of pension income. As a reminder and as we mentioned last quarter, the new accounting rules require us to show this below operating profit we restated last year to make it comparable. Our projected annual effective tax rate is 22%, which we reflect in our quarterly adjusted EPS. In the second quarter, our reported effective tax rate is 22.4% with the difference due to the timing of stock option exercises. Moving to fully diluted shares, they amount to $25.9 million (sic) [25.9 million] in the quarter, which is a 2% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $4.65 and that was 19% increase over the prior year amount of $3.92. On a two-year combined basis, adjusted EPS has increased by more than 40%. We are very pleased with this growth level, which I remind you is organic. On a reported basis in the quarter, EPS was $4.31 as compared to $3.84 in the prior year. Reported EPS included $0.22 of restructuring, principally related to the consolidation of our product inspection facilities in the United States. It also includes $0.10 of purchased intangibles and $0.02 related to the higher reported tax rate. The next slide provides results for the first half of the year. As Olivier mentioned, we're very pleased with these results. Local currency sales have increased by 6%, our operating profit by 13% and our EPS is up 16% in the six-month period. That's it for the P&L. And now a little about cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow was $120.8 million which compared to $113.2 million in the prior period. Our working capital statistics remain solid with DSO at 39 days and ITO at 4.5 times. For the first half, adjusted free cash flow was $177.3 million and we remain comfortable with our full year target of $450 million. Now, let me turn it over to Shawn to provide an update on our guidance. Shawn P. Vadala - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thanks, Bill, and hello, everyone. Let me start with a couple of upfront comments on our guidance before covering the specifics. First, the China tariff situation. On our last call, we estimated the potential negative impact to operating profit from the tariffs was approximately $10 million or $0.30 per share on a full year basis. We believe we can largely offset this impact with price increases and some supply chain adjustments. For the second half of this year, we will not be able to fully offset the estimated 2018 headwind of $0.15 to $0.20 per share. We estimate the net headwind during the second half of the year is in the range of $0.05 to $0.10 per share. In mid-July, another round of tariffs were announced. We estimate that if these additional tariffs are implemented, the negative impact on operating profit would be another $6 million. We have not built this into our guidance at this time as they are still under review and timing has not been finalized. Similar to the first round, we would seek to offset over time, but could face some headwind in the short-term if they are implemented. We will continue to monitor the situation closely. Second, foreign exchange has moved against us since the last time we provided guidance, principally from being driven by the weakening of the Chinese renminbi versus the dollar and the strengthening of the Swiss franc versus the euro. Specifically, currencies in the second half have deteriorated $0.25 to $0.30 per share since our last call. It is also worth pointing out that currency will also be a bit of a headwind during the first half of 2019, if rates stay where they are. On the positive side, we feel very good about our business. Underlying demand is solid and we believe we are executing extremely well. Our growth strategies continue to yield tangible results and we believe we can continue to gain share and drive earnings growth. With that as a backdrop, let me cover the details. We continue to believe that local currency sales growth in 2018 will be approximately 6%. As a reminder, this includes approximately 1% from the Biotix acquisition. We are leaving our adjusted EPS guidance range unchanged from $20.10 to $20.25, which represents a growth rate of 14% to 15%. We have the benefit of the Q2B, but some work to do to offset the nearly $0.50 per share headwind from tariffs and unfavorable currency just mentioned. With respect to the third quarter, we expect local currency sales growth to be in the 6% range, which includes approximately 1% from Biotix. Based on this sales growth, we would expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.97 to $5.02, a growth rate of 14% to 15%. Our EPS estimate includes the Q3 impact of the announced tariffs and currency headwind. In terms of currency on sales growth, we expect currency to decrease sales growth by approximately 1.5% in the third quarter. For the full year, we expect currency to benefit sales growth by just under 2%. That is it from my side. I now want to turn it to Olivier. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thanks, Shawn. Let me start by providing some additional comment on the second quarter. Our lab business continues to perform well. Lab benefited from some acquisition revenue from Biotix. However, our organic growth in lab had good growth over the prior year. Balances continue to do quite well and analytical instruments and pipettes also had good growth, particularly if you look at it on a two-year basis. Process analytics had excellent growth in the quarter and I will provide an update on this business shortly. The continued strong lab growth reflects our excellent product portfolio, investment in field resources and our Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives. Turning now to industrial, let me cover this in two parts starting with core industrial, which had sales growth of 7% in the quarter, very good growth, particularly given the very solid growth in the prior year period. Asia had a strong growth driven by excellent results in China. Europe also had strong growth in core industrial while Americas also had growth. The other part of industrial is product inspection, which was down modestly in the quarter. The results were principally driven by the very strong 20% sales growth achieved in the second quarter of last year, which Bill mentioned earlier. The final piece of our company is the retail business, which was up 6% in the quarter, a little better than we expected given some project activity in the United States. Now, let me make some additional comments by geography. Europe had good growth in the quarter with industrial particularly strong, but also good growth in lab. Retail was down in Europe. In the Americas, lab, core industrial had solid growth. As anticipated, product inspection was down against excellent growth in the year earlier period. Retail in the Americas was strong due to profit activity just mentioned. Finally, Asia/Rest of the World had strong growth with excellent growth in lab and good growth in industrial. Retail was up modestly in Asia/Rest of the World. China had very strong growth across most product lines. That concludes my comments on the business. Let me also provide an update to our service business, which had growth of 6% in the first half and 10% in the second quarter. As a reminder, service represents approximately 23% of total sales, and is a unique competitive advantage for us as well as an important platform for revenue growth. We have a service force of approximately 2,800 people, which is by far larger than any direct competitor. Central to our service growth strategy is increasing the percentage of our installed base and the service contract. With more service contract business, we can enhance the productivity of our technicians and create more customer value through supporting regulatory compliance and enhancing equipment uptime through preventive maintenance. Our current service growth initiatives are centered on our installed base of instruments. With more than 10 million installed instruments, our i-base provides ample opportunities to further penetrate existing accounts for service opportunities. We have prioritized biopharma and packaged food as our global service offering has the highest value to customers in regulated industries. Of utmost importance to them is ensuring they are in compliance with their standard operating procedures as well as ensuring uptime in their manufacturing operations. Big data analytics is giving us tools to identify service opportunities within our installed base. We can isolate potential opportunities by the age of the instrument, and by top instrument performance. This allows us to do specific targeted marketing, most appropriate for that part of the product lifecycle. Big data is also allowing us to further penetrate existing accounts by identifying cross-selling opportunities within large global key accounts where service decisions are made at the local level. We have invested in service telesales resources to follow up on leads and develop specific targeted sales messages based on customers' actual data. We are encouraged by the results and believe this will allow us to continue to grow the service contract revenue above the company average. In addition to growth initiatives in service, we also have initiatives to further improve operating margins. Although these margins are well above the company average, we see further opportunities to increase our field force efficiency and improve pricing realization. One additional update I want to provide today is on our process analytics business, which had a strong first half and has a great track record of technology innovation. It has a sizable percentage of its revenue from consumables and service, approximately 40%, and has achieved above market growth for numerous years. It represents about 10% of total sales, and generates above group average profitability. Process analytics provides in line and real time measurement of key analytical parameters for industrial liquids, which helps pharma, biotech and chemical companies to monitor and optimize their production processes. While the total market is large, we are a leader in industrial applications for pH, TOC, conductivity and dissolved oxygen measurement in production processes as well as auxiliary processes like ultrapure water monitoring. Our solutions combine sensor technologies for specific measurements, transmitters and services. The sensors must be calibrated, maintained and replaced on a timely basis, which creates an attractive consumable stream. Over the last several years, we have further solidified our leadership position by expanding our portfolio into gas analytics with lasers, power generation analyzers, and bacterial detection in ultrapure water analysis. We continue to enhance our technology leadership in this market. We recently launched a new portable dissolved oxygen meter that can automatically calibrate installed in-line oxygen sensors. We also launched a new turbidity sensor, which significantly expands performance levels. Both of these products are targeted to the growing beer production segment. With our expanded portfolio, we can now provide a comprehensive solution package, which provides great opportunities in the larger breweries. Another attractive aspect to the turbidity launch is that we moved the production of these sensors to China as a first step to build up sensor knowledge. Over time, we expect to move the entire turbidity parameter to China, which will help to achieve meaningful cost savings in this product category. Very soon we will launch our pH sensor called InPro X1, which is based on a breakthrough technology and represents a leapfrog over any other pH sensor in the markets today. Key benefit of the new sensor is the unbreakable design of the sensing element, thereby ensuring no release of contaminants or debris. It has cutting edge measurement performance and no calibration is needed at installation due to our Intelligent Sensor Management technology that allows pre-calibration of sensors. One additional example of our technology is the upcoming introduction of our new TOC sensor, featuring performance enhancement and Intelligent Sensor Management. It will have significant enhanced measurement performance as well as provide superior features to help customers comply with regulation. In particular, we offer new proprietary services based on full traceable tools that ensure compliance for customers. These are only a few of the many product launches taking place in Process Analytics. But I thought they were good examples of our technology know-how and leadership. In addition to technology, Process Analytics is a great example of our continuous improvement philosophy with respect of sales and marketing. This business was the original pilot of our Spinnaker approach, and for 15 years now, they have been working to continuously refine and enhance the sales and marketing programs. Process Analytics' excellent product portfolio, combined with the leading edge sales and marketing initiatives, should continue to yield share gains for this business. That concludes our prepared remarks. And I want to ask the operator to now open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. And your first question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, first off on the Q3 guidance, it looks like you had a good growth rate against a very difficult comparison and the outlook is strong. So, why wouldn't Q3 organic revenue guidance be a little bit better given that the comp is easier? Shawn P. Vadala - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, Dan. This is Shawn. Thanks for the question. I think when we look at it, we're actually looking at it more on a three-year comp basis, because I think it's important to look at that we started to have accelerated growth in the second half of 2016. So, if you look at it on a three-year basis, it actually makes a lot more sense to us. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That makes sense, Shawn. And then my follow-up on, you mentioned that currency at current rates will be a headwind in the first half of 2019. Would you be willing to offer up \u2013 will tariffs still be a headwind in the first half of 2019, as they stand today, or would you expect your remediation programs will have caught up to the tariff impact by then? Thank you. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: This is Bill. I think with regard to the first program, we should have caught up with our initiation. I think it depends a little if this additional $6 million or what other activities could come to make a judgment on the second round of tariffs and what might follow after that. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Good afternoon, guys. So maybe on China, obviously, it sounds like another fantastic quarter. Can you just maybe give us some color on like the cadence of how business is kind of ebbed and flowed there? The macro has been quite strong, but there's some worry just given all the trade noise that you start to see, maybe on the industrial side a little bit, the indecision on purchasing. Like, what are you seeing on different parts of the business in terms of cadence? And then, do you expect to see any different behavior between sort of lab versus industrial there, given maybe some of this question? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: In general, we don't see any early signs of things changing. We have very solid environment. The team is still very upbeat and the only thing that impact us is of course this previous year comparisons, and that's a little bit different quarter-by-quarter, but otherwise, we feel \u2013 and visibility that we have is good across all the product lines. You specifically asked about last, we have now many, many quarters of very solid growth, and I expect that to continue. But I would of course also say that we need to very carefully monitor things. For example, we have certainly seen that the stock market in China reacted to all these tariff announcements, and so we certainly wouldn't exclude that this will also impact the demand. But it's too early for us to see it. And the only reason why we are here a little bit more cautious with our outlook is again related to comparisons, and we certainly had also some pent-up demand benefits in the last couple of quarters that will not go up, and the pent-up demand is particularly relevant in the context of our industrial business; for last, this wasn't impacting us. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : That's helpful. And maybe, Bill, I know, you always get excited about inflation. It feels like pricing should probably be a tailwind to you guys or at least be more favorable that is typical just given the overall environment. How are you thinking about inflation in pricing right now for you, and how that trends into maybe next year? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: So first, we generally do like a little bit of inflation, Ross, and I think it helps us with pricing, messaging with our sales force, customers are more tolerant. What's maybe a little bit more nuanced about what we're seeing now is the inflation-related tariffs. So, if you look at where we're maybe getting some tariffs applied to us, it could be in product categories that maybe competition doesn't have the same challenge and tariffs are also something that's, let's call it, less easy to talk to customers than general material costs or what's going on with wages. So, if I think about the profitability impact of what we do in pricing, I think that we should have continued to execute well on pricing, probably do better than average overall on a net basis, but some of the higher price increases you'll see in the coming quarters will be offset by some of these inflationary impacts due to the tariffs. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thank you. Good afternoon, good night. I was hoping you could just talk a little bit more on the product inspection business. I think you started out the year looking at mid-single digit growth there, certainly kind of appreciate the comps in the first half, but can you just help us with a little bit of the conviction in the back half ramp to hit the target for the full year? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: If you look at our numbers, a part of the challenge has been self-created in the sense that we did talk on the last call that we have some facility consolidation. We moved our biggest facility in the U.S. to a new location. But at the same time, we also closed two facilities, one in Chicago and one in Ithaca and moved these product lines to this new bigger facility down in Florida. And that's certainly absorbed a lot of energy internally. We had certainly also some challenges in the supply chain. And then we had the other part, which is related to our checkweighing business where we went live with our Blue Ocean system. And so often when we go live, it takes a couple of months to be back in the smooth operations. So, that was one effect. The other effect that we certainly also see is a certain slowdown from our packaged food customers. We had in previous year excellent big orders with global roll outs and this year, we don't see them materializing in the same way and that makes it very difficult previous year comparisons on top of these things that I described before and that makes us a little bit cautious to the remainder of the year. The fundamentals remain very solid and mid-term, we are very excited about this business but again it might well take a while until we see solid growth coming back and certainly these comments of before we want to see that the packaged food companies reengage in global roll outs and increase their spending in protecting their brands and all the value propositions that we offer. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. And I appreciate all the color on the new product pipeline, just the breadth of the things that you're bringing to market now. Can you just help us put it in context of in terms of what you think the contribution from some of these new products could be relative to prior periods just as we start to think about what the trajectory could look like going into next year? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yes. As often, when we talk about new products, we share these with you to highlight how we continuously invest in our technology leadership that helps us to differentiate versus competition that allows us to increase prices and so on. But we have so many products in our portfolio that a new product really doesn't change the needle. It doesn't make that big of a difference. And to put it in perspective, process analytics we talk about, roughly 10% of our revenue and all these products that I mentioned will add to the growth, but you heard us also saying process analytics had very good growth already and we benefit from previous product launches. So, I don't want to suggest here that process analytics will further accelerate, but it gives us actually good confidence that process analytics will continue this kind of growth with this excellent profitability that we have. And it's, in that sense, representative of what we do for the whole group. We have many, many product launches across all the product businesses that we have. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks for all the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hello and good afternoon. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Hello, sir. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, just could you just give a little bit more of a breakout on what the headwinds that you're seeing from the tariffs? I mean, is it supply chain? Is it COGS? Is it end market demand? I'm just sort of curious in terms of like what you're feeling and what you're doing to sort of offset some of these? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: The comments of Shawn before were really focused on the direct impact that it will have. So, it impacts our material costs, basically the cost of goods. We try to offset that as far as possible through price increases and a few supply chain adjustment, and that's the piece that we have under control. There is a tentative significant indirect impact on our customer base that we talked before about the food industry, for example, the meat industry in the U.S. is certainly impacted and that can have ripple effect, but it's sometimes actually difficult to say if it's good or bad for us. So, we always need to anticipate. And then, there is the overall impact on the economy that of course, we have \u2013 it's difficult to anticipate and we don't really control. So, all our comments before was really focused on the direct impact and there we feel actually, we have good measures in place to mitigate the impact but Shawn highlighted that maybe from a timing perspective, it might not always be in the same quarter that the cost is coming and the benefits, for example, of pricing that offsets it. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thanks. And if the second round of \u2013 or the latest round of stuff that is in discussion goes through, I mean, with that in mind that you can't do things immediately, it's like, how long would it take you to sort of implement if you do get another hit? Shawn P. Vadala - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah, we would \u2013 given the \u2013 this is Shawn, Derik, given the timing of this one, we kind of leverage largely our annual price increase process. So, it really could be dragged into the first quarter a little bit, but I would say some point during the first quarter. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. All right, great. Thank you. Operator : Next, we have Mr. Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Bill, maybe just a little bigger picture when we look at Europe, can you just talk through the trends there, I mean, a little bit of mixed macro data points, PMI is still healthy, but not accelerating. Just wondering your outlook there, how things are going? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: So, I think overall, our European business is performing well. If I look our lab business, it's growing mid-single digits; our industrial business growing mid-single digits; and we're down in retail and the retail is just purely lumpiness. If we were to look out to the second half of the year, I would say that's the type of numbers that we would expect to put up. So, we don't at this point see any significant changes. There's probably some swings between individual countries but the overall picture for Europe I think would largely stay similar to what we saw in the first half. And we were happy with what we saw in the first half. Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then can you just talk through the transition of the Tampa facility, how the new facility is tracking and then also any other future moves this year we need to think about? I know you guys discussed moving the Chicago vision business in the second half. Just wondering anything we should look out from a disruption point of view? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah. So, the Chicago facility that's done that's including the Ithaca. So, the U.S. relocation is completed and it's more a question of fully digesting it. The other facility relocation that we have is in Switzerland. That impacts the laboratory balance business here in the coming few weeks. However that I expect this actually to be much smoother and, at this stage, really don't expect any impact on our supply chain. I just got the update yesterday that basically, I think, except one person, all the employees will actually join us at the new location, and that gives you an indication that it should be really much smoother. And it's also much more standardized product, makes it also simpler. And then the other relocations that will take place later in the year are office jobs. And so I don't expect any impact from that. Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, thanks. I'm going to stick with some of the themes here. But Bill, can you actually clarify your comment on pricing? I mean, basically, were you implying that if competitors source their products outside the U.S. and are not subject to tariffs inflation, it may be harder to pass through the price increases? I just want to get clarification on that. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah. So, Ross' question was, hey, you guys normally like a little bit of inflation and you can usually do better than inflation. Do we realize even better pricing with a little bit of inflation and with a low inflation environment? And the distinction \u2013 and I wanted to \u2013 I agree with that statement. I just wanted to make a distinction with regard to tariffs, that's not as straightforward, because we could be going against a competitor in that product category. We have a tariff and he doesn't because where he imports his product from versus where we do. I think that's a statement specific about pricing and inflation. I would think about in terms of what the impact is on our operating profit of tariffs, I then would defer to what Shawn said, and that is that we expect to largely offset them. We might have a little bit of a delay, but that we can largely offset them between what we do in pricing and what we do in supply chain. Now, in the details of that answer on pricing, Tycho, it might be that we're raising prices on some other products that are not tariff-impacted, but we view it as an effort to, in our mind, offset that $10 million of headwind that we have. And so, yeah, that's a little bit how we tackled it. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then, separately, you guys have a SternDrive program, I mean that's separate from the facility consolidation and the like, I mean anything notable there, is that something you can potentially expand? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: We just had a review with it in the recent days and the number of projects have increased this year versus last year that will increase again next year. So, we're very happy with how SternDrive is going. And as Olivier mentioned, some of the things we're doing to offset tariffs do relate to supply chain and is reflected as part of the SternDrive program. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then last one, just rounding out the geographic discussion, you touched on Europe and China. I guess here in the Americas lab and core industrial, you called that a solid. On the lab side, we've seen some good numbers from other life science companies. Are you starting to see some benefit of the NIH budget? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: NIH is not a huge piece for us, but if we look at how we performed in pipettes, for example, which would be the product category that has the best, the largest exposure, we certainly had a solid demand from that sector the last couple of quarters and have a good outlook for the second half. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citigroup. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. Olivier, just going back to your comment on pent-up spending in industrial, I'm curious whether you're able to give a sense of how much of the existing Mettler customer base you've seen just participate in the replacement cycle at this point versus those that sort of haven't come back to you yet. Is that a reasonable way of looking at things? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: So, the pent-up demand was specific to China. This is not a topic for the rest of the world. In China, we had a situation where it, for the industrial business, really had a very difficult environment about three years ago. And then, there were some factors that hardly recovered. And honestly, we also kind of shifted resources away from that sectors, and then focused much more efforts on the chemical industry, pharma industry, food industry that we feel is more sustainable and more core to us. And there, we have certainly a good customer base, where we had this pent-up demand because they have slowdown in the replacement cycle, but also they have not invested in additional capacity in the same way. And now, where the growth is coming back, we have the pent-up demand. Quantifying it is, however, difficult, but I certainly have three groups this exceptional growth that we have, apart to this. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then, Bill, maybe on food, obviously, that's a lumpy one. I think you're up against a pretty favorable comp there next quarter. So, are you expecting a rebound there in growth or is that sort of similar to PI in that the project timing is just going to have that business needing a little bit to get back up. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: I'll let Shawn take that one. Shawn P. Vadala - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah, you're right, Dan. So, we have an easier comparison going into the third quarter and we would expect high-single-digit growth in the third quarter. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good evening. Just a couple of housekeeping of questions... Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Hi. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : ...Bill or Shawn. Within China, could you breakout the lab versus the core industrial? And then what exactly is rewarding that ASPs in the second quarter, I guess? Shawn P. Vadala - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah. So, lab in China was up over 20% in the quarter and industrial was up by 10%. And then in terms of pricing, we had a quarter very similar to the first quarter, strong momentum in the program north of 2%. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Very good. And then what was the M&A impact to the lab business? Shawn P. Vadala - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah. I think, it was 3%, yeah. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Go ahead, Brandon. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Yeah, okay. Lastly if you could just... Shawn P. Vadala - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: It was 3%, sorry, Brandon, yeah. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then lastly, if you could just sort of remind me what the total annual transition tax payments you expect will be. Shawn P. Vadala - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah, just the payment I think we paid in the first quarter, which is I think $4 million \u2013 I mean, second quarter was $4 million. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Very good. Thank you. Shawn P. Vadala - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Well, first of all, I'd say thanks everybody for taking the time here very late at night in Switzerland, so thanks for doing that. Second, the couple of questions, I'll ask them both and then I'll jump back in queue. One, just a very big picture question. I'm not going to direct it to anybody in particular, but we talked about the macro, the operating environment, products, execution tariffs. With these all, sorry to oversimplify it, but it sounds like issue is that we very much have a handle on things, stable, steady, going well. But over the next 90 days or so, you guys are going to be going through your planning process for 2019. I wonder given that we seem to have such a good handle on those dynamics, what do you think are the really critical swing factors that you're thinking about that you recommend we think about as you think about the outlook for 2019? And then as a follow-up, just a couple of housekeeping things. I wonder if you could give us a sense for what you've estimated the impact of selling days for Easter might be on 1Q, 2Q and then any view on gross margins specifically, the cadence of gross margins in the back half of the year, really helpful and I'd say thanks again for sticking it out late here guys. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Sure. Hey, maybe I'll make a comment about packaging those tariffs and currencies et cetera and then let Olivier talk about some of the things he is expecting for budget tour. I do feel, Steve, that one of the key messages we have this quarter is that we have close to $0.50 of headwinds in the second half of the year that we didn't have the last time we (00:46:19) talked to you and we haven't adjusted our guidance for the full year. And I take that speaks to we're entering a budget cycle with some challenges but we feel like we have our arms very much around those, so lot of things going well for us. With regard to some other bigger picture or longer term items, I hand it to Olivier. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: We gave of course some pre-briefings to all our operating units around the world on what we want to focus on going forward, what kind of environment we expect. In essence, we are expecting the macroeconomic environment to be actually quite similar to what we had this year. We expect all the units to remain agile and in case that things would change and you have seen us in the past actually reacting to do these things quite in a fast way. But the working assumptions right now is that things remain the way they are right now. And I would also say we are in a continuous investment mode. So, you have seen us doing Field Turbo programs in the recent quarters and I'm still in that mode. I just approved the couple of more of these investment projects and I do expect actually good growth going forward coming also from all the different programs that we have in place around sales and marketing, around Field Turbos, new product launches and all. So that's very much the briefings that we gave to the units. And I have no indication from any team that they see particular concerns or changing economic environment. But of course, I don't want to say that macroeconomic things might not impact us, a dollar appreciation for example can impact also certain emerging countries and we would certainly also see that in the numbers but that doesn't necessarily mean that we would adjust our operating plans. So, with that, maybe Shawn, to specific questions. Shawn P. Vadala - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: On the gross margin, yeah, so in terms of the margin, Steve, we look at gross margin maybe the flattish in the third quarter and just as a reminder, we're going to have a little bit more of the tariff headwind in the third quarter, still working through maybe some of these internal topics that we talked about earlier as well too. And then in the fourth quarter, we would expect gross margins to be maybe up in the 50 basis point kind of range. So, on a full-year basis, it would be flattish on a currency neutral basis. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Really appreciate all the color you gave. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : And we will now take our last question from Mr. Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Hi. Good evening, and thanks for taking my question. Actually, I have a couple of one for you. I guess first, as you are trying to offset tariffs through price increases, do you typically see or have you already seen customers either try to hold off on purchases given the price increase or maybe try and pull forward spending ahead of price increases? And then I have a couple of follow ups. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah. Actually if anything we've seen, we saw a little bit of acceleration in June with certain customers that knew that we were going to be announcing the price increase. And then maybe to add a little bit more from a competitive situation, we've actually seen competitors come out with some pretty significant price increases as well, which we felt was encouraging. Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Okay. Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: And Steve, maybe one comment, that tends to be more in distribution channels and most of our sales are direct. So that's not a big impact and even in the examples that we're thinking about, that's mostly them placing the order before the end of the quarter. Yes. Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Got you, both. Okay. Okay. And then secondly, just regarding the changes \u2013 I guess, lack of changes in your EPS guidance, Shawn, I think you made a comment of maybe $0.05 to $0.10 of a headwind from tariffs and then $0.25 to $0.30 from FX. So you add those up, you're looking at maybe $0.30 to $0.40 of incremental headwinds and maintaining the guidance. I understand maybe $0.05 is from the 2QB then you're trying to do some pricing. But you're aware of \u2013 what are you doing to kind of pull the strings here to find some other offsets or is it something you're doing with compensation or is it something else where you're finding those extra dollars to offset these headwinds? Shawn P. Vadala - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: I think we feel our cost structure is in really good shape. I think that's one of the biggest things we looked at. We do a lot of homework, Steve, before we go on to the budget tour and that gave us some confidence and the cost structure is in good shape. I forgot I think it was Tycho or somebody asking about SternDrive. SternDrive programs are in good shape with the facility consolidation should add more of a benefit in the second half. So, it's just a number of things in terms of our cost structure being in good shape. Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Okay. And then I think just last thing, the facility consolidation down in Tampa, are the headwinds or disruptions and increased focus area, is that finished now or is that something that also continues in the third quarter? Olivier A. Filliol - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: It will take certainly a couple of additional weeks, months, but I certainly feel that the biggest challenges are behind us. Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Okay. Very good. Thanks so much for your time. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And we have one question that just came into queue from Mr. Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : Oh, thanks for squeezing me in at the end here. I just wanted to know if the plan is still to purchase around $475 million worth of shares in 2018. William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Correct. Shawn P. Vadala - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yes. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : And do you have the service growth, what that was for the quarter? Mary T. Finnegan - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Go ahead, Shawn. Shawn P. Vadala - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Yeah. Service was up 9.5% in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, 6%. Service, I should point out, had a little bit of benefit from the Easter timing in Q1. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : And then finally what should we expect as far as the product inspection business for the fourth quarter? William P. Donnelly - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: The fourth quarter, we're looking at high-single digit growth base, start to have an easier comparison in the fourth quarter Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review : All right. Thanks very much. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. Ms. Mary Finnegan, back to you for closing remarks. Mary T. Finnegan - Mettler-Toledo International, Inc.: Thank you, Emani, and thanks, everyone, for joining us tonight. Of course, as always, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us. Given that we're in Switzerland, it's probably best to send an e-mail, but we're happy to get back to you at that time. Take care. Good night, everyone. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Holly, and I'll be your audio coordinator for today [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn our presentation over to your hostess for today's call, Ms. Mary Finnegan. Please proceed, ma'am. Mary Finnegan : Thanks, Holly, and good evening, everyone. I'm Mary Finnegan. I am the Treasurer, and I'm responsible for Investor Relations, and glad that you're joining us today. I'm joined here today by -- with Olivier Filliol, our CEO; Bill Donnelly, our Executive Vice President and Shawn Vadala, our Chief Financial Officer. I want to cover just a couple of financial administrative matters. This call is being webcast and is available for replay on our website. A copy of the press release and the presentation we refer to is also on our website. Let me summarize the Safe Harbor language, which is outlined on Page 2 of the presentation. Statements in this presentation, which are not historical facts, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 and the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please see the discussion in our recent Form 10-K. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed under the captions, factors affecting our future operating results, and in the business and management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our Form 10-K. Just one other item. On today's call, we may use non-GAAP financial measures. More detailed information with respect to the use of, and the differences between, non-GAAP financial measures and most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our Form 8-K. I will now turn the call over to Olivier. Olivier Filliol : Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter, Bill will provide details on our third quarter results, and Shawn will be discuss our guidance for the rest of this year and for 2019. I will then have some additional comments, and we will open the lines for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter are on Page 3 of the presentation. We are pleased with our sales growth, which was 7% in local currency in the quarter. Our laboratory products had very good broad-based growth. In addition, China had strong growth despite excellent sales growth in the prior year. Our sales growth, combined with results from our margin and productivity measures, drove a 17% increase in adjusted EPS. Let me comment briefly on how we observe current market conditions and how we are deploying our strategies given the environment. First, demand in our markets remains good. Sales, orders, even leads look solid. But there are many reasons to be cautious about the global economy, including higher interest rates, a strong dollar and uncertainty and costs arising from tariff disputes. I would characterize it as a sunny weather but clouds on the horizon. These clouds provide a different outlook than it was 1 year ago when we gave guidance for 2018. So what do these clouds mean for us in terms of strategy deployment? We clearly remain focused on growth. We are investing for growth but somewhat more cautiously than we were at this time last year. We want to remain agile and react to, even to a certain extent and anticipate a slowdown. We are confident that we can continue to deliver share gains, irrelevant of underlying market growth. And with our strong focus on margin enhancement and cost management, this should translate to reasonable earnings growth under almost any circumstance. Shawn will cover this further in his comments on guidance. I now want to turn it over to Bill, but before I do, I want to acknowledge that this is Bill's last earnings call with us. Bill has made tremendous contribution to Mettler-Toledo over more than 20 years. I have worked closely with Bill and want to personally thank him for his support, dedication and leadership with the organization. Bill's personality, in particular his sense of humor and his down-to-earth approach to our challenges, will be missed. I think one of Bill's greatest contribution to Mettler-Toledo was his nurturing and development of his successors. He leaves the global supply chain and IT organizations in good hands with Oliver Wittorf, who many of you will hear from on Monday at our investor meeting. And, as I think many of you have seen over the last year or so, he leaves the finance organization in the skilled hands of Shawn, who has worked with Bill for many of this -- of his 20 years here. Bill, an official thank you for all of your contribution to Mettler-Toledo and you know I personally wish you all the best for the future. Bill Donnelly : Thanks, Olivier, for the warm remarks. I acknowledge we're on a transcript and a call, so I'm not going to take too long but the thanks go back in return. It's -- Mettler is a great company, I'm proud of what we've accomplished and it's been an honor to work here. And maybe to the shareholders on the call and to the investors on the call, I have great respect for the job you guys do. I hope you feel that respect from all of us in return. And maybe, one of the things I've loved about our shareholder base is they've been with us for a really long journey and maybe, a special thanks to them for all they've done for us. And maybe also to them, I want to acknowledge that -- what Olivier said, I think we left things in -- I feel like I'm leaving things in great hands with Shawn and Oliver but maybe to you in particular, Olivier, you and the rest of the team around the globe, I feel like the company is as strong as it has ever been, and thank you for the opportunity. All right. So enough of that stuff. I'll try to cover the numbers now. Sales were $735 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 7% in local currency. The Biotix acquisition contributed about 1% to local currency growth. On a dollar basis, our sales increased by 5% because currencies reduced sales by 2% in the quarter. On Slide number 4, you'll see our growth by region. So local currency sales grew by 5% in the Americas, 3% in Europe and 11% in Asia, Rest of World. Our sales growth in China increased by 12% in the quarter and that growth was broad based. In China, growth was particularly impressive when you consider that we had 28% sales growth in the prior year. Biotix benefited our growth by about 1% in the Americas. Now I'd like to turn to Slide number 5 and that's our 9-month numbers. So you see there, local currency sales have increased by 5% in the Americas, 3% in Europe and 10% in Asia/Rest of the World. Biotix benefited the Americas growth year-to-date by approximately 2%. Onto Slide number 6. We outlined in local currency sales growth by product line. In the quarter, lab grew by 11% while industrial increased 1% and retail grew 14%. Biotix helped out the lab group by about 2%. Within our industrial group, our core industrial business grew by 2.5%, offset against very strong growth in the prior year, offsetting this to a degree was approximately a 1.5% decline in product inspection and we'll elaborate on that later. Turning to the next slide. We have year-to-date sales growth by product line. So lab is up year-to-date 10%, while industrial is up 1% and retail is up 6%. And Biotix helped the lab sales by about 2% and of course, all those numbers were in local currency. All right, let's go to now Slide number 8, which gives you the P&L for the quarter. Our gross margins were 57.1%, that compares to 57.4% in the prior year. On a constant currency basis and adjusted for acquisitions, gross margins were down 10 bps in the quarter. Pricing continues to be a strong contributor to gross margins but we had headwinds from tariffs as well as poor mix in retail and some initial costs associated with our product inspection U.S. facility comp consolidation as well as a little bit on product launches. R&D in the quarter was $34.8 million and that's a 10% increase in local currency, and our SG&A of 202.5 million was a 1% decrease in local currency versus the prior year. That number included increased investments in our field force, which were offset by cost savings initiatives as well as lower variable compensation. That resulted in an adjusted operating income of $182 million in the quarter, and that's a 13% increase over the prior year amount of 161.7 million. We estimate that currencies reduced operating income by about $1 million, a little worse as compared to what we told you last time. Our adjusted operating margin was 24.8%, and we're pleased with that 170 basis points improvement over the prior year. A couple of comments on the P&L. Our amortization amounted to 11.9 million, while interest expense was 9 million even. Other income was 1.5 million, which primarily is pension income. Now let's cover taxes. We reduced our effective annual rate slightly from 22% to 21.5%. This reduction reflects the impacts of changes in our income sources and some benefits in China. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.7%, which reflects the cumulative catch up to get our year-to-date rate to 21.5%. We expect our Q4 effective rate to also be 21.5%. As Shawn will cover in a moment, we expect our rate to be further reduced to 21% in 2019. All right, now moving to fully diluted shares, which were 25.7 million in the quarter, and that's a 2% decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted earnings per share was $5.12, and that's a 17% increase over the prior year amount of $4.36 per share. On a reported basis, EPS was $4.93, that compares to $3.99 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.07 of restructuring, $0.10 of purchased intangibles and $0.02 related to a discrete tax item surrounding our stock option program. The next slide provides year-to-date results. Local currency sales increased by 6%, operating profit increased 13% and adjusted EPS was up 16%. Of course, we're very pleased with those results. Okay, that's it for the P&L, and now we'll cover cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow and now we'll cover cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow was $121.3 million, and that compared to $111.9 million in the prior year. Our working capital statistics remained solid, with DSO at 39 days while ITO is at 4.5x. And that's it from my side, and then I want to turn it over to Shawn to give some info on our guidance. Shawn Vadala : Okay, thanks, Bill, and hello, everyone. Let me start with a couple upfront comments on guidance before covering the specifics. First, our growth and productivity initiatives. These are well within our control, and we feel confident in their effectiveness and our ability to execute them. These initiatives are well ingrained within the company and have proven to be a success, and we feel very good about our ability for them to drive sales and earnings growth. Second, the economy. As Olivier mentioned earlier, demand in our markets is solid. This is evident with our third quarter results. Similar to how we have done this in the past, our guidance for Q4 in 2019 assumes market conditions remain largely unchanged. We do acknowledge, however, there is some more uncertainty in the global economy, in particular, what could be the potential longer term impact on the Chinese and global economy due to the trade/tariff situation, but we're not seeing any impact to date. Third, tariffs and currency. On our last call, we outlined the impact of tariffs from the first wave that went into effect in early July. As a reminder, we estimated this would reduce operating profit by approximately $10 million on a full year annualized basis. We had built the net impact of the tariffs and response initiatives into our previous 2018 guidance. The second wave went into effect at the end of September, and we estimate the full year annualized impact, once the full rate is implemented, will be approximately $15 million. For clarity, these incremental tariffs are initially at a 10% rate and step up to a 25% rate in January. The $15 million is the full 25% impact on the second wave. Therefore, the total impact of tariffs, both the first and second wave on an annualized basis, is $25 million reduction to our operating profit. Our guidance for Q4 and 2019 reflect the impact of this new wave of tariffs and our responses. In addition to tariffs, currencies also continued to move against us. In particular, the Chinese renminbi versus the dollar and the Swiss franc versus the euro. One final comment on taxes. As you heard Bill mention, we reduced our tax rate in Q3 to 21.5% for the full year 2018. Due to some additional impact of income sourcing, we expect a further reduction in our tax rate to 21.0% in 2019. I realize this is a lot of numbers and data but thought it was important as it will help put our guidance into perspective. With respect to the fourth quarter of 2018, we expect local currency sales growth of approximately 6%. This is organic, and we have owned Biotix for more than a year now. We expect this sales growth will generate adjusted EPS in the range of $6.72 to $6.77, a growth of 13%. We estimate currency and the impact of tariffs are a headwind to Q4 adjusted EPS growth of approximately 5%. For the full year, we expect local currency sales growth to also be 6%, with an adjusted EPS in the range of $20.20 to $20.25, a growth rate of 15%. For 2019, we expect local currency sales growth of approximately 5% and adjusted EPS growth in the range of $22.40 to $22.60, a growth rate of 11% to 12%. We estimate the headwind to earnings growth in 2019 due to adverse currency and tariffs will also be approximately 5%, similar to what we are facing in the fourth quarter. Let me also comment on cash flow for 2019. We expect cash flow of approximately $510 million. This represents a growth of 12% per share, adjusting for facilities CapEx. In terms of share repurchases, you saw in the press release that the board has increased the authorization as we would have exhausted our current authorization by the end of the year. We would expect share repurchases in 2019 to include our free cash flow estimate, plus option proceeds, totaling approximately $545 million. In terms of quarterly guidance for 2019, as usual, we will provide that on our upcoming call. However, I know you will update your models and want to point out that while our adjusted EPS growth is 11% to 12% for the full year, I would expect a lower growth in the first half, in particular, the first quarter, due to currency and timing of tariffs and implementation of our response actions. On a preliminary basis, we would expect adjusted EPS percentage growth in the first quarter of 2019 to be in the mid-single digit range. In terms of currency on sales, we expect currency to decrease sales growth by approximately 3% in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2018, we expect currency to benefit sales growth by approximately 1.5%. In 2019, we expect currency to reduce sales growth by approximately 3%, with more decline in the first half of the year as compared to the second half. That is it from my side, and I now want to turn it to Olivier. Olivier Filliol : Thanks, Shawn. Let me start by providing some additional comments on our operating results. Our lab business continues to perform very well, as shown by the 9% organic growth in the quarter. I point out -- this out, as this was in addition to solid growth in the prior year. Sales growth was broad based, with most product lines showing good growth. We are executing well in this business, as we benefit from a very strong product portfolio, our continued investment in field resources and our Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives. I would expect good growth in lab for the remainder of 2018 and into 2019. Turning now to industrial. Let me cover this in 2 parts; core industrial had approximately 2.5% growth, which was impacted by the very strong 9% growth in core industrial in the prior year. We would expect to see a better growth in core industrial in the fourth quarter and in 2019. As you heard from Bill, product inspection was down slightly in the quarter. We had expected it to be flat to a little weaker as compared to last time we spoke. I want to remind you, this business is impacted by prior year's comparisons, not one in 2017 but strong growth we saw in the second half of 2016. We expect to see growth in the fourth quarter and in 2019. For those of you joining us on Monday, you will hear more about this business and have a chance to see its new facility. The final piece of our company is the retail business, which was up 14% in the quarter, better than we expected, given some project activity in the United States. As you know, this business is lumpy, and we would expect a modest decline in the fourth quarter and minimal, if any growth, in 2019. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Europe came in pretty much how we expected. We had good growth in lab and retail, while industrial was down slightly. In the Americas, lab had very good growth and that is on an organic basis. Industrial was down, in both core industrial and product inspection. Retail in the Americas was strong due to project activity just mentioned. Finally, Asia/Rest of the World had strong growth, with excellent growth in lab and very good growth in Industrial. Retail was up nicely as well. China had very strong growth across most product lines. As we look to next year, we would expect Americas and Europe to have growth at, or little bit below, the mid-single-digit range and Asia/Rest of World, including China, to have growth a little more than mid-single digits. Longer term, we would guide for Asia and China, in particular, to have growth in the mid-to-high single digit range. But they will be impacted in 2019 by very strong growth over the last 2 years. That concludes my comments on the different pieces of the business. Let me now comment on our overall guidance for 2019 and what gives us confidence in our ability to generate the sales and earnings growth we have outlined today. I will start with our Spinnaker sales and marketing strategy, which we believe are a unique competitive advantage and important source of growth. We have core initiatives surrounding lead generation and investments in our field force through our Field Turbo program. These initiatives remain well on track, and we are also focused on sales force activities. Specifically, we have tools and programs to help ensure our front end sales reps maximize their productivity by targeting those customers with the greatest potential. How do we go about it? First, we identify what are the most attractive pockets of growth. This means specific market segments, where products provide the most value and the specific customer accounts where we have the best access and highest cross-selling potential. Second, we utilize sophisticated go-to-market strategies, which ensure we utilize the most cost-effective sales channel given the sales and profit potential of the different accounts. This increasingly means that sales reps are spending more of the time with high potential noncustomers and we use telesales resources for accounts with lower sales potential. It is worthwhile to highlight that over the last four years, we have more than doubled our telesales resources and currently have almost 300. We have developed a substantial amount of materials and tools to support our sales reps and telesales resources in demonstrating how our solutions help specific needs of the customers. Finally, we leverage our unique data analytics to formulate tailored marketing and sales campaigns. We process millions of internal and external data to guide our sales reps to the most promising opportunities. These sales force activities will increase the sales force time with the most strategic accounts and it will ensure we are redirecting resources to our most attractive businesses. This is core to maximizing our sales force productivity. We believe these sales force activities in combination with our other Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives will continue to allow us to gain share. New product launches are another important contributor to growth. As we have spoken to you about in the past, we are constantly coming to market with new products. No single launch will make a material impact to our results in any quarter but all of them combined are essential for our strategy to trigger replacement, gain share and support our pricing program. Let me give you a recent example from our laboratory offering and the launch of our new line of analytical balances. We have the most comprehensive portfolio of these balances and have reduced the minimum weight by 50%, thereby allowing customers to use smaller sample sizes and reduce waste. A patented cooling system and intelligent features that include ensuring the balance is level and free from static actively monitor weighing conditions to ensure outstanding accuracy and reproducible results. A large user interface and process and settings that can be saved for different tasks also help improve the efficiency of our lab customers. We are excited about this launch, which is receiving very favorable customer reactions. We also launched the newest generation of LabX, our lab data management system. From central control of instruments and tasks to eliminate manual errors, LabX helps ensure security, efficiency and data integrity of the lab. As mentioned, this is just one example of our many new product launches. With our Spinnaker sales and marketing programs and new products focused on growth and capturing share, our pricing and productivity initiatives are driving operating profit growth. I'm very pleased with our extensive pricing programs, trainings and tools we have developed over the last several years. On the productivity side, Stern Drive is continuously driving productivity and cost leadership of our operations and supply chain. Stern Drive is the platform for improvements in how we manage our procurement as well as how we improve our labor productivity in both the shop floor as well as back office operations. Using data analytics and benchmarking, we identify high-impact and fast-return projects in these areas. So far, we have completed more than 500 projects and have managed to establish a continuous pipeline of projects that allow us to deliver against our target of $20 million year-over-year savings. In summary, we feel very good about the factors we can control, namely the execution of our growth and margin and productivity initiatives. Demand remains solid, and we will monitor the global economy and be ready to react if conditions change. We face headwinds next year in terms of currency and tariffs but believe can still deliver strong earnings growth. That concludes our prepared remarks, and I want to ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Dan Arias, Citi. Dan Arias : Bill, I'm sure I won't be the only guy to say it's been a pleasure and good luck. You've been one of the best around for a long time, so thanks. Bill Donnelly : Thank you. Dan Arias : I just wanted to maybe start on pricing, if I could. That's been a really good tool for you guys. What are you baking in for 2019? How much of that do you expect is related to areas where maybe historically you've pushed hard versus those areas where maybe you've been a little bit less aggressive? Shawn Vadala : Dan, this is Shawn. Thanks for the question. For 2019, we normally would guide to about 150 basis points. But the way we're thinking about 2019 is something in the 2%, maybe a little bit better than that kind of a range. We put in place some additional pricing actions, as you know, during the second half of this year, and we're thinking similarly as we, kind of, enter next year, given the higher inflationary environment, and we would expect to do a little bit better than what I said on an annualized basis in the first half of the year, given the timing of some of these measures versus the second half of the year. Dan Arias : Okay. I believe it was Olivier that made the comment, but you talked about just how you entered the year versus the way that things are now. So I guess, the question is if you ignore comps, and you just think about the outlook for demand, can you, kind of, crystallize the way that you see things headed into 2019 and how that differs from the way that you were looking at spending and demand heading into the year this year. I'm just curious about the relative confidence that you have when we think about the customer segments and the macro environment? Olivier Filliol : Yes, the things that we really see in our numbers, in terms of leads generation and quote requests, but also all the feedback that I get from the organizations around the world, they all remain very positive. And in that sense, we have -- we don't see any negatives yet of the clouds that I was referring to in the prepared remarks. But of course, we are more alert, and we are a bit more cautious because there are things out there that could impact us. And that's just ask for us to, kind of, hedge our risks here. But when you think about investments and activities, we are very much still in this growth mode. Very comparable to what it was last year. I'm still funding Field Turbo programs, very committed to that, and we certainly also, when we interact with our market organizations around the world, we go for the growth mode really, in every single market. That includes also all the emerging markets, even that they might be impacted a little bit by the dollar topic or China that of course, is also impacted by the tariffs. But we don't see it and that, in our markets directly, until we feel we need to go for the top line. Dan Arias : And if I could sneak one more in on the tariffs, obviously that's a headwind on costs. But I'm just curious whether you're finding that -- are the tariffs and the trade war concerns diminishing or washing out any of the smaller local competitors over there, as the mom and pop type places try to make it all work? Olivier Filliol : No. I don't really think it changed much to the competitive landscape. So when we talk about our many Chinese competitors, I also referred to, we have hundreds, sometimes even thousands of weighing scale companies there, they serve the domestic market. Hardly any of them are engaged in significant export. The one thing that could happen -- from today's perspective, these tariffs mostly impact the discrete industry metal plastic, and I would say, this is a market segment that is maybe more served by the local competitors, as we have refocused our business already for now a couple of years, more to the value add businesses like Pharma, chemical industry and so on. And I would think that these businesses will be less impacted by tariffs. But again, our Chinese competitors that we have are not really directly involved in export business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Muken : So, Bill, I'll second the comment. Obviously, it's been a long time we've known each other. Great pleasure and best of luck. In terms of the business, so maybe on China, I'll, sort of, stick on that as a theme. There's a lot of cross currents, right? So the macro data in some parts has kind of deteriorated, at a country level, you've got a number of the consumer-oriented companies are, kind of, warning on demand. And yet, every company in the space, including yourselves had good results, not really seeing any shift in demand. It seems like your commentary and orders are still consistent. So help us, kind of, make sense of how these budgets are protected. How it's so broad in that, sort of, stability of demand and, kind of, what you're looking at in terms of the customer base in some of the more volatile or cyclical parts of your Chinese business that's kind of, giving you comfort that some of these other warning signs won't sort of, manifest themselves over the balance of '19. Olivier Filliol : First, I want to say, we don't see it today, and we don't know if there will not be future side effects from certain market segments that will decline and then spill over to others. But at this stage, what we see, the markets that we serve predominantly are less impacted because, as I described before, they are less export oriented. And the -- for the domestic consumption, there is still this desire for better quality, safety and productivity. And so, we see our Chinese customers to continuously invest and look to our instruments. I certainly also would expect that the Chinese government will continue to drive the growth in these value-added industries, for example, life science industry. And that's the piece that we are more and more focused on and probably, also not a coincidence I was talking about the strong results that we have from the lab business in China. We have the 10th quarter of mid-teens growth in this business. And I see that really, also the last quarter being very strong and that gives us confidence also going forward. But there might be spillover effect, from these other segments that are negatively impacted and it's just too early to really see it. And that's why we remain agile or also a little bit cautious. You certainly have seen us guiding for China next year a little bit more modest, and this is, on the one hand, because comparisons but secondly, also that we realize that the overall economy will not be that strong. Ross Muken : And maybe, it's really a tremendous job, the whole team did around mitigating some of these tariff and FX related headwinds. One, can you just give us kind of an example outside of obviously, price of maybe anecdotally, something you came up with or decided to do to, kind of, help with margin management for next year. And then, help us think through in, sort of, the various scenarios. You reacted so quickly this year to some of the headwinds that came up, like, how much flex do you have into next year, should the 25% tariff go into place or other counter -- other measures or we see even more volatility in the dollar, et cetera? How much juice is left to be reactive because you've already obviously, done a lot. Bill Donnelly : Maybe I give you an example, Ross, it's Bill. I think an easy one to understand is, if you take a look like at how we bring product into the United States from China, if we can bring down the transfer price, that of course, has $1.04 -- or $0.25 on a dollar kind of impact. And so that might require that we also adjust where some activities happen in the supply chain. So moving some value-add from some -- one place the other. Now if -- back to your point what we can do in the future, well, we certainly, as you know, we sell a lot of SKUs. So we don't try to do too many things to touch the supply chain because we don't have that many products we can get a lot of activity behind it. But if we were to think it might be more permanent, we could probably do more on the supply-chain side and have more on the transfer pricing side to, kind of, offset that. But I think one of the bigger points would be is those are only mitigations. We're not eliminating the tariff in those cases, and frankly speaking, we would prefer if things were reversed, that the tariffs went away, we'd frankly rather move those activities back to China. Let China enjoy a little bit larger transfer price and -- but our overall cost structure would be much more efficient if we didn't have that work around. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Dan Leonard, Deutsche Bank. Dan Leonard : So I wanted to talk about the result in industrial. Appreciate the issue around comps but how much of the performance do you think is a reflection of more challenging comps versus anything structural, like CapEx pressures and some of the big food companies? Olivier Filliol : So I think we need to talk -- when we talk about industrial, we should really differentiate between core industrial and product inspection. I think here, you refer more to product inspection. And in product inspection, we had three key effects : One is, this comparison topic and this is very much related also to some key account activities. Very strong key account orders that we had in previous years. And these key account activities are more lumpy. And partially, also related to what you said, the very big packaged food companies did manage their capital spending in a more forceful way this year than we have maybe seen in previous years. But I -- the early signals that we have is, this is something that will come back. And so, that's one of the reasons why I'm not worried. The second one -- impact that we had was that we made some important changes to our manufacturing blueprint, particularly here in the U.S. This was a major undertaking. This will make the franchise so much stronger and the ones of you that join us next Monday I'm sure, you will immediately recognize what this means. Consolidating three plants but also three technologies at one place. It's going to bring huge synergies going forward, not just in terms of production capability but very much, this brings benefits to customer interactions because we can demo and all the technologies at the same time. And that in sense, this was a pre-investment. A pre-investment that did cost some margins initially but also brought some distraction for us to serve the markets as we normally would do. And that's something that I see us recovering really fast and is a part of why I say Q4 will also look better. When I say Q4, I imply with that, also next year. I expect good growth from product inspection. Dan Leonard : And, Olivier, is it possible, can you give us just kind of a rough flavor of how much you expect the industrial segment to accelerate in Q4? What roughly would be in your plan? Bill Donnelly : We should grow high single-digit in the fourth quarter and maybe, one of the interesting things, Dan, is if you look at, like, multi-year growth rates, I think it will be our best three year growth rate of the year, which speaks to, I think, the foundation, as Olivier mentioned, of the franchise. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Patrick Donnelly, Goldman Sachs. Patrick Donnelly : Definitely want to echo the prior sentiments that you'll be missed, Bill. It was great working with over the years. And maybe since it's your last earnings call I'll throw one your away. Always appreciate your macro perspective. So I just want to expand on, I think it was Dan's earlier question. Relative to this time last year when you provided guidance for '18, sitting here today, looking ahead to 2019, can you just walk through the geographies and then talk through which you feel more cautious or constructive on. Bill Donnelly : So sure, I'm happy to do that. So, I mean, on a broad statement, I think emotionally, even as you look out a year ago, we had a very positive currency environment looking forward. The tariff situation wasn't where it is today. And so, it's just the combination of those two things. I think when Olivier refers to clouds, I think that's the type of the thing he has in mind. If I go through the world geographically as compared to a year ago, I think we knew we had -- I start with the Americas. We knew we had a tough comp coming in the Americas when it came to product inspection, and we probably underestimated a little bit some of the challenges with the plant consolidation. So those two should both be a little bit better. In terms of the core industrial business, I think we probably feel like we're getting later in the cycle now, so do we feel materially different? Not really. And then, the lab business, looks to be again on solid footings. If I go to Europe, I think we do see that maybe GDP forecasts are a little bit less for '19 than they were a year ago for '18. But if I look out, kind of, what we've done recently as well as what we do in the fourth quarter, it's pretty solid, and we haven't built in overly high expectations as part of our guidance for Europe. I think one of the bigger changes is China, and the change there just relates to -- we were coming off a year ago very strong comparisons in China, and now, we see that that's kind of behind us, but we still keep a pretty solid base. But I thought Olivier answered the question around, kind of, outlook and confidence for China very well. I think the 5-year plan calls for them to invest in life sciences. So the life science, we see no reason why even these tariff topics should have much of an impact there. The industrial business is probably a little bit more exposed but certainly, much less exposed than the industrial business we would have had 3 years ago for these moves that Olivier mentioned. So I think that would be my key comments. Patrick Donnelly : And just for '19 on the guidance side, could you guys just let us know what the growth rates you're guiding for, for lab, industrial and food are? Just to -- want to make sure we have that. Shawn Vadala : This is Shawn. So on the lab side, we would be doing, kind of, a mid-to-high single-digit. On industrial, kind of, more in line with the total group number. And then, on food retailing, we're currently looking at flattish, just given the pipeline of project activity looking towards next year. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Jack Meehan : Bill, it was a short time but I echo, good working with you. I was hoping you could elaborate a little, either you or Shawn, as we look into 2019 on the gross margin line with some of the moving parts, whether it's the different currencies or tariffs and pricing and just, underlying productivity. If you could, kind of, walk us through some of those factors and what the build for gross margin looks like. Shawn Vadala : Sure. Hey, I'll take that one. So in terms of 2019, we'd probably be looking at currency -- sorry, not currency -- gross margin benefit of probably like, say, 50 to 60 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. I'd start with the price increase. I mentioned earlier, we'd be looking at a price increase in the 2%-plus range. That would probably have about a 90 basis point improvement on the margin. Offsetting that would be the cost of the tariffs. The tariffs would be about 60 basis points. And then, on the differential, we've have some of the benefits of some of the productivity and other actions we've been taking place this year and maybe some of the upside of some of the benefits from our facility consolidations that Bill and Olivier talked about earlier in the call. Jack Meehan : And then, maybe just continuing on that. Excited to see all the work in Tampa next week. Could you -- sorry if I missed it, but what was the CapEx forecast for '19? And could you just give us an update on the what the right pacing looks like as you wrap up some of these projects? Shawn Vadala : Yes, so the total CapEx number would be about $120 million. And that still includes some facility CapEx because we have one more facility to go in the U.K. in our -- one of our product inspection facilities there, which requires additional capacity to keep up with the volume growth. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Tycho Peterson, JP Morgan. Julia Qin : This is Julia on for Tycho today. First off, congrats, Bill. And on behalf of Tycho, thank you for being so great to work with and best of luck. So maybe to follow up on China. I know you guys mentioned mid-teens growth in the quarter. Could you maybe break that out by end market? Shawn Vadala : I'm just going to -- I'll just run down the different business lines. So on the lab side, we did just under 20% in the quarter. And then, on the industrial business, we did a high single-digit. Julia Qin : And then, how much of your China exposure is from the Pharma industry and to what extent did you benefit from the generic quality regulation in the past year? Olivier Filliol : So we don't break out the details for a country. I would phrase it that way, the whole life science piece is one that has been steadily growing, and that's true actually for the laboratory business as well as pieces of the industrial business. And regarding your last point, it didn't have any particular impact for us. Remember, we are very strong in general labs, QC labs as well as R&D., and it's not particular in the bioresearch area or even medical area also. It's very, very broad based when we talk about life sciences industry. It would also include academics that is connected to life sciences. Julia Qin : And then finally, on the services, how much was services as a percentage of revenue in the quarter? And how high do you think you can increase the mix to? And to the extent possible, can you comment on just the current service penetration rates within the biopharma and food markets particularly? And the runway you had? Olivier Filliol : I've got to hand over afterwards to Shawn to give you the specific share for the quarter. When it comes to growth -- so the way we look at service is, we, over a midterm, we clearly see that service will outgrow product. I say the midterm because it doesn't necessarily happen in every quarter. If we have a very strong product quarter, that doesn't mean that service can top of it. But I expect that service is outgrowing product because we really have a great opportunities there. We have very strong value propositions and we, as we often refer to, we have strong programs like the iBase and marketing campaigns that is really addressing our installed base. We're also using Big Data analytics for that. And then, we try to do more and more service under contracts. In that context, we talk about the attachment rate. And this is something that you build up over a years -- over years, because it's really hard work but one that has great payoff. We have very different service attachment rates by different countries and businesses. And so, just using a year-on-year universal number, would not be that insightful. But you will see on next Monday, we have actually a separate session that talks about service, and we're going to drill down in more details and to illustrate to you that what the value proposition is and how we do these iBase campaigns and contract attachment rates for the product inspection business specifically. What's -- maybe one insight also that I already want to share with you today and I will talk to again also on Monday is that the service contract business is actually outgrowing the average service growth that we have also because the break/fix part of the businesses is not growing as fast. And that's a consequence that our quality of our products actually are continuously improving. And so, there is these extra efforts going in, in the service contract business. And in the meantime, I'm sure Shawn has the number. And so, I'll hand over to you. Shawn Vadala : Thanks, Olivier. So, Julia, the service as a percentage of our total revenue is 22%. And if we include consumables, that number would be 31%. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Derik De Bruin, Bank of America. Derik De Bruin : Bill, it's been an interesting 15 years. It's been a pleasure. I'll miss you and I look forward to seeing your one-man show on Broadway the next time you're in town, because I assume that's what you're going to do, I can already envision it, Hamilton. So on that note, let's talk about net interest expense and sort of what you're thinking about for interest rates next year and how should we think about the interest expense and then interest expense for 2019 and this sort of leads on to a conversation about, you just annualized the Biotix deal. How are you looking at capital deployment beyond share buybacks, M&A. Do you feel comfortable in this environment levering up a bit if you need to -- just find something interesting. Bill Donnelly : Hey, it's a timely question, I think, in terms of our capital structure. One of the things we've reviewed with the board in recent days is we think it's appropriate to start to gradually move our leverage up. We have tended to think that a medium-term number in 1.5 range, just for you guys that aren't tracking it, we're probably at about 1.1 right now, would be appropriate. I think we would look to be doing that over with a combination of M&A and share repurchases, if I just look back on past probabilities, for lack of a better expression. But I do think it would be appropriate to lever up a little bit more and I think we're going to that over maybe two years. Derik De Bruin : And thinking about the last time, a couple of years ago, when China was topical and started to hit. I'm just curious, any signs of credit problems like we saw in the past? And then just on a broader note, I mean the currencies have moved so much. Is there any sense of hesitation that people don't have enough purchasing power right now, to go out and buy things, any sort of hesitation that FX, rather than the tariff issues, are causing some slowdowns in spending, or potentially? Bill Donnelly : Just, maybe for the benefit of everybody, Derik, your memory is good. One of the things we've commented about in the past in China is there's not a free flow of credit like there is in the Western world. And so, a couple of comments in response. And then, because of that in times -- at times in the past, things have moved quickly or markets have deteriorated relatively quickly when the boys in Beijing dialed back credit a little. Now if I look at how we've moved our mix of business, kind of, again going back to this combination, to the point that Olivier made, that our industrial business today is a different industrial mix than it was three to five years ago. And secondly, the percentage of our sales going into lab and product inspection is a lot bigger than it was five years ago. The two of those facts would make us, let's say, less susceptible to such items. But I think everyone that does business in China would acknowledge that a tightening of credit would flow through the market but sitting here today, we don't see signs of that, and we certainly would say that, given all the other uncertainties and what's going on in their stock market and how their government has typically worked to keep the economy going, I would not anticipate that and frankly, would be quite surprised if that happened. And we see no details in our credit-type stuff that would indicate that, that's the case with our customers nor in how the government's dealt with us in terms of bringing cash out of the country and that type of thing. Derik De Bruin : And one final question. Just talking a little bit about supply chain moving around, east-west supply chain is like -- can you -- just a little bit broader plans on what you're doing to, sort of, mitigate some of the impact that you're seeing now? Bill Donnelly : So I gave one specific example so I want to avoid repeating that. So for us, it's largely focused on our U.S. the impact is really on our U.S. industrial business, our U.S. retail business and our U.S. Ohaus business. And it's an impact on products we manufacture in China and sell into the U.S. market as well as some components that we bring into the country. So we haven't been impacted, we see no signs on, we're not impacted by the Chinese tariffs that they've put on some U.S. products, I mean, it's de minimus, and we also haven't seen any, let's call it, prejudice against our products in China, which frankly speaking most of what we sell in China is coming from Switzerland and everybody loves Switzerland. And in terms of what we're doing now, we're doing as much as we can to mitigate as Shawn and Olivier talked about with regard to pricing, so where we think we can. But of course, Olivier would point out, pricing isn't without some volume consequences. And we're doing the little things that we can in supply chain like the example I gave in response to Ross's question, and we don't really want to do more permanent things because we hope that this would end but there would be additional steps we could take if this thing were to continue on for multiple years. But frankly, none of the mitigating steps would be as good as what we have now with our manufacturing capabilities in China. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Daniel Brennan, UBS. Daniel Brennan : Bill, obviously it's been tremendous working with you and certainly hope to see around. So first question would just be on, what was the price realization in this quarter? Shawn Vadala : Dan, this is Shawn. Price realization was about 2.7%. Daniel Brennan : And then, Olivier, not to belabor China, just had one follow-up on your comments that you've already made, just so I understand it. So to the extent your demand was to be negatively impacted, is what you were basically portraying earlier in the conversation that basically would be just from slower economic growth in China that just kind of seeped into your customers or I know you talked about a spillover effect, but I'm just trying to think through, you talked about the clouds and you're not seeing it today but effectively, is that essentially what it is? Just kind of general slowdown in China, that would, kind of, be felt across your businesses? Olivier Filliol : Yes, I think there are market segments that are today already impacted. Of course, there are exports related to discrete manufacturing segments that are impacted by the tariffs and when they export to the U.S. I think we will see more of that going forward. But these are typically markets that we don't sell to directly. However, if these market segments are slowing down, I would not exclude that they might also have an impact on other markets that partially supply the exporting segments. And so, I would not exclude that, for example, chemical segments will be impacted because the discrete manufacturing segments are buying less. That's one of the spillover effects that I was meaning. And overall, the economy in China might be impacted also just by the sentiments around these topics. But that's more a macroeconomic view than something that I see today already or the team tells me. Daniel Brennan : And then, maybe as just one follow-up, I know Bill has already talked about it earlier in the quarter. But in terms of the core industrial business, which I know you've deemphasized some of the more cyclical areas within that business in China specifically, to kind of temper, I guess, the impact. But you just remind us today like how big that business is in China and give us some perspective on what that business did this quarter? And I know Shawn already mentioned 8% total industrial growth but more with the breakdown of core industrial and as you look out towards 2019, kind of, what are you baking in for that core industrial business in China? Shawn Vadala : Yes, so the core industrial business in China is about 42% of the total business. That business was up high single-digit in the quarter. And as we, kind of, like, look to next year, hey, we'd probably be mid-single-digit and wouldn't be surprised if it's even a little bit lighter than that next year, just given the tough comparison that we have. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby, Cleveland Research. Josh Waldman : It's Josh on for Steve. Just a quick one on the earnings guide for '19. You guided for 11% to 12% earnings growth. If I understand you, that's including the 5% headwind from FX and tariffs. So effectively guiding to 16% to 17% earnings growth in your initial guide. Just looking back over the last decade, the strongest earnings growth you guided to right out of the gate was 13%, last year was 13%. So given you're already absorbing this 5% headwind from FX and tariffs, how much cushion are you factoring in, in your initial guide compared to maybe years past? Bill Donnelly : I think we do our -- as the guide guy for a long time, I think the guide process was similar to how it was in the past. I struggled a little bit to understand, I think if I -- I thought I heard you say that 13% has been our highest earnings per share number, and that -- I'm not sure where that number came from. Josh Waldman : That was -- the 13% year-over-year growth in your guide just out of the gate for the following year. Bill Donnelly : Our guide for -- yes. I think one thing certainly is that we have put some measures in place. I think that the comments with regard to foreign exchange are factual, the comments with regard to tariffs are factual now. If these tariffs were to go away because maybe, if I give you the example around that we talked about earlier on transfer pricing. If the tariffs went away tomorrow it's not that we would add 5% back on because it would probably be 3.5% maybe 4% back on because the tariff piece, the mitigating factors, it isn't 100% reversal. So I think that one of the reasons that the earnings power is so good next year is that you have full benefits coming from some facility consolidation we did in Switzerland. We have full benefits of facility consolidation that we did in Tampa. We have the Stern Drive program now is maturing significantly. Shawn mentioned quite a bit of pricing power and that combination of things meant that our incremental margins, particular incremental margins excluding the impact of tariffs and foreign exchange, are excellent. So I, process wise, I think we went about it the same way. But yes. Olivier Filliol : I'll add also that because of the tariffs, we have a little bit of higher inflationary environment particularly in the U.S, which allows us to do more on pricing. And that's, of course, we build in, and we did not have that in the recent years. Actually, the inflationary environment, we didn't have, and that's the reason why Shawn was sharing with you that we expect more than we normally would expect. And that alone has quite an impact on our EPS guidance. Shawn Vadala : And hey, maybe one final comment is that we do get a little bit of benefit from reducing tax rate by another 50 basis points next year. So that's maybe 70 bps on the growth rate, which would round to 1%. Operator : I'll now turn today's conference back to Mary Finnegan for closing comments. Mary Finnegan : Thanks, Holly, and thanks, everyone, for joining us tonight. For those of you that are attending our investor meeting on Monday, safe travels, and we look forward to seeing you. Take care everybody. Bye-bye. Operator : Once again, we'd like to thank you for participating on today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Olivier. Olivier Filliol : Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call which we are doing from Switzerland this quarter, which is why we started a little earlier than we normally do. I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Shawn will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments, and we will open the lines for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter are on page three of the presentation. We are very pleased with the strong finish to the year with our fourth quarter results. Local currency sales growth was better than expected as demand in our markets remained favorable and we continued to execute very well. Total local currency sales grew 8% in the quarter. We had strong broad-based growth in most of our laboratory and industrial product lines. China had another quarter of excellent growth. Our sales growth combined with results from our margin and productivity measures drove very strong improvements in operating margins. And despite a 5% headwind due to adverse currency and high tariff costs, we achieved a 15% increase in adjusted EPS in the quarter. All around, these are strong results. Our outlook for 2019 remains positive, but similar to our comments to you last quarter, we remain concerned about the global economy. We do not see evidence of a downturn in our markets today, but Marko [ph] data and rhetoric surrounding international trade disputes make us cautious. We remain focused on execution of our growth initiatives and believe we are well-positioned to continue to gain share regardless of market conditions. Assuming market conditions remained favorable we believe we can generate good earnings growth in 2019. Let me now turn it to Shawn to cover the financials and guidance and I will come back later with additional comments on our business. Shawn Vadala : Thanks, Olivier, and hello everybody. Sales were $817.9 million in the quarter, an increase of 8% in local currency. All growth is organic and we have owned Biotix for more than a year now. On a U.S. dollar basis total sales increased 5% as currencies reduced sales growth by approximately 3% in the quarter. On slide number four, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales grew 7% in the Americas, 6% in Europe and 10% in Asia/Rest of World. Sales growth in China increased 12% in the quarter and strong in both laboratory and industrial products. Slide number 5 shows sales growth for the full-year. Local currency sales increased 5% in the Americas, 4% in Europe, and 10% in Asia/Rest of the world. Biotix benefited Americas' growth by approximately 1% for the full-year. On slide number six, we outlined local currency sales growth by product line. In the quarter, Laboratory sales grew 7%, Industrial increased 10%, while Retail decreased 6%. Within Industrial, product inspection increased 7%, while core industrial grew 13%. Turning to the next slide, we show sales growth for the full-year by product line. Laboratory sales grew 9%, Industrial grew 3% and Retail grew 3% in 2018. Biotix benefited lab sales by approximately 2%. All sales growth is in local currency. Slide number 8 provides the P&L for the quarter. Gross margin in the quarter was 58.4% as compared to 58.6% in the prior year. Pricing continues to be a strong contributor to gross margins but we had headwinds from tariffs mix and some additional costs associated with our product inspection business and new product launches. R&D amounted to $36.2 million, which represents a 15% increase in local currency. SG&A amounted to $201.7 million, a decrease of 1% in local currency over the prior year. Increased investments in our field force were offset by cost savings and productivity initiatives as well as lower variable compensation. Adjusted operating income amounted to $239.7 million in the quarter, which represents an 11% increase over the prior year amount of $216.9 million. We estimate currency reduced operating profit by approximately $5 million. We also estimate tariffs where gross headwind to operating income by an estimated $5 million. Despite these meaningful headwinds, our operating margin was 29.3% which is a 140 basis point improvement over the prior year. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $12 million in the quarter. Interest expense was $8.8 million in the quarter. Other income, excluding the onetime items I will cover shortly amounted to $340,000 compared to income of $1.2 million last year. Our effective tax rate was approximately 21.5% in the quarter, moving to fully diluted shares which amounted to $25.5 million in the quarter and is 3% decline from the prior year reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $6.85, a 15% increase over the prior year amount of $5.97. On a reported basis in the quarter, EPS was $7.11 as compared to $2.93 in the prior year. Reported EPS included a $0.75 acquisition gain related to our earn-out accrual with Biotix. As background, when recording an acquisition with an earn-out provision, the initial amount accrued in goodwill is recorded is based upon a Monte Carlo simulation of all possible outcomes. The Biotix acquisition was structured with the large potential earn-out component, while we are very pleased with the Biotix acquisition and expect their operating profit to grow by more than 35% in the first two years they fall short of the earn-out level. As a result, we recorded a onetime non-cash gain to reverse a significant portion of the original amount. Other one-time items in EPS include $0.10 of purchased intangible amortization, $0.14 of restructuring, $0.14 of a true up of the transition tax associated with last year's new tax regulations related to the most current guidance that was published in December, $0.09 of litigation cost and a $0.02 difference between our quarterly and annual rate due to timing of stock option exercises. The next slide provides full-year results for 2018. Local currency sales increased 6%, operating profit increased 12%, operating margins improved 100 basis points and adjusted EPS was up 16%. We are very pleased with these results. That is it for the P&L. Now I will cover cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow was $157.2 million as compared with $130.7 million in the prior year period. Our working capital statistics remain solid with DSO at 39 days and ITO of 4.5 times. For the full-year, our free cash flow was $455.9 million which represents a 12% increase on a per share basis. We are very happy with this achievement. Let me now turn to guidance. First, we continue to feel very good about the things we can control namely our growth and productivity initiatives, we have spoken to you often about our spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives, our new product launches and our stern drive productivity programs. We're confident in the effectiveness of these initiatives and our ability to execute them. Our guidance for 2019 assumes market conditions remain unchanged while we ended the year on a strong note as Olivier mentioned we are cautious on the global economy, some economic data points have further moderated over the past few months but we have not seen an impact on our business today. We also continue to acknowledge risks associated with the potential impact on the Chinese in overall global economy due to trade and tariff disputes. We will continue to monitor the global economy closely and remain agile to adapt to conditions necessitate. Next tariffs, based on the situation today, we expect a gross negative impact of tariffs of approximately $25 million on an annual basis. This assumes the full 25% tariff rates which we assume will be fully implemented in March. We estimate tariffs will be a gross headwind to EPS of approximately 3% in 2019 and will have a greater impact in the first half of the year versus the second half. We expect to be able to negate much of the impact of tariffs through price increases and some internal supply chain adjustments, one question you may ask is what happens if the tariffs go away, we would estimate a positive impact to full-year EPS growth of approximately 1% if the tariffs were eliminated and this would be on a full-year basis. We would not recoup the entire 3% as some pricing in the internal supply chain process changes are tied directly to the tariffs and therefore would go away if the tariffs are eliminated. In addition to tariffs, currency also continues to be a headwind to earnings in 2019 particularly in the first half of the year, for the full-year we would have - we would expect adverse currency to reduce EPS growth by approximately 1.4%. However in the first half, it will reduce EPS growth by approximately 3%. Finally, our tax rate, when we provided guidance in November, we had assumed a tax rate of 21% for 2019. Based on our current expected mix of income, we now expect the effective tax rate for 2019 will be 20% to 25%. Let me now cover the specifics, we continue to expect local currency sales growth in 2019 to be approximately 5%. We are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to $22.50 to $22.70 which is a growth rate of 11% to 12%. This compares to previous adjusted EPS guidance of $22.40 to $22.60. With respect to the first quarter, we would expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 5.5% and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4 to $4.05, a growth rate of approximately 7% to 8%. We would expect the headwind from tariffs and currency to approximate 7% in the first quarter and the first half of the year. Let me also comment on cash flow for 2019, we expect cash flow of approximately $510 million in 2019, this represents a growth of 16% per share. In terms of share repurchases as we mentioned on our last call, we intend to modestly increase our leverage over the next two years through share repurchases and our acquisitions. We currently expect share repurchases to be approximately $745 million in 2019, some final comments on guidance as you update your models. Other income, which is below adjusted operating profit will be approximately $3.5 million, as compared to income of $6 million last year. This line includes pension income which we expect will be lower this year, we would expect shares outstanding to be approximately $24.9 million, interest expense is expected to be approximately $40 million, total amortization will be approximately $52 million which includes approximately $13 million of purchased intangible and amortization or $0.40 per share which we exclude from adjusted EPS. In terms of currency and sales, we expect currency to reduce sales growth by approximately 2.5% in 2019. For the first quarter, we expect currency to reduce sales growth by approximately 4.5%. We will provide Q2 guidance on our next call, but wanted to point out given the expected impact of tariffs and currency in the first half of the year as compared to the second half, we would expect EPS growth in the second quarter to be high single digits. That is it from my side. I'll now turn it back to Olivier. Olivier Filliol : Thanks, Shawn. Let me start by providing some additional comments on our operating results, Our lot business continues to perform very well with 7% sales growth in the quarter, which was again excellent growth in the prior year, almost all product lines have good growth with analytical instruments, pipettes, and process analytics particularly strong. We are executing well in this business as we've benefited from a robust product portfolio, continued investments in field resources and our spin on sales and marketing initiatives. Last we will have tougher comparisons in 2019, but we expect good growth nonetheless. I will have some additional comments on lab shortly but let me cover other business. With respect to industrial, we ended the year with strong sales growth in both core industrial and product inspection. Core industrial had an impressive growth of 13% with all three regions and most product lines showing very good growth. These results reflect solid market demand and good execution. Product inspection had good growth in the fourth quarter with 7% local currency growth. This business have been under some pressure for most of 2018 due to very tough comparisons and reduced spending by large package food companies. We expect growth in 2019 in the mid-single-digit range which is below our long-term outlook for this business as we think it will take some additional time for packaged food companies to return to full investment mode. The final piece of our company is the retail business which was down 6% in the quarter based up on the timing of customer activity. Although negative we are not overly concerned given that we manage this business profitability not sales growth. We also expect a sales decline in the first quarter but expect for the full-year that this business is relatively flat. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Europe ended the year with strong local currency sales despite the declining food retailing. Lab had solid growth while industrial both core industrial and product inspection were up strongly. In the Americas lab had excellent growth product inspection was flat while core industrial was up strongly. Retail was flat. Finally Asia and rest of the world had another quarter of excellent growth. Lab and industrial did very well while retail down. China had very strong growth in lab and industrial. One final comment on the business in the fourth quarter is service which was up 9% for the quarter. We had a growth in both lab and industrial reflecting traction on our growth initiatives surrounding service. That concludes my comments on different pieces of the business for the fourth quarter. We are very pleased with how we ended the year. Let me comment in some more detail on our lab business, which have had strong organic growth over the last three years. And now we present just over 50% of our business we are benefiting from a very robust product pipeline. Lab received a disproportionate amount of our R&D and our recent and upcoming launches are yielding very tangible results. Our Spinnaker sales and marketing approach has worked particular well for this business as we very much leverage cross and value selling and innovative marketing that drives leads growth. There are also some market dynamics of our base table to our offering to the market. One example in the area of data integrity and specifically how our instrument control software LabX is helping customers ensure compliance and data integrity. Data integrity is one of the most critical topics in the pharmaceutical industry today and has become a hot button issue with the FDA. In particular the focus is on bench-top instruments such as balances, Ph meters and typewriter that do not store data electronically. Such instruments typically use printout as data records which of course can be subject to manipulation y. This risk has gotten the attention of the FDA. Our answer to this challenge is LabX our instrument control and data management software to control bench-top instruments. LabX supports all of our lab instruments, which represents approximately 40% of the instrument on a typical chemist bench-top. LabX through well-designed workflows, standardization of validation methodologies and strong data management capabilities can help customers achieve the data integrity objectives. LabX can also be fully integrated in a lymph system. LabX as a fully compliant FDA 21 CFR Part 11 platform addresses the FDA concerns for providing controlled user access, for data traceability and secure data handling across all of these very commonly used product line in the analytical testing and QA/QC in the pharmaceutical industry. In addition customers enjoy significant productivity improvement as a training burden is reduced as LabX can be standardized across many of these critical bench-top instruments. Most of our balance and analytical instruments are used routinely in the QA/QC or testing lab. With LabX data analysis and management are seamlessly integrated into one compliant software solution. One additional market dynamic is productivity and efficiency in the lab and on our one-click approach that allows customers to simplify lab processes and ensure they are being done correctly all with a simple click. The one click technology incorporates short cuts methodologies and sophisticated analytics into an instrument so workflows can be executed easily and effectively by combining our one-click approach with our LabX software our regulated customers can ensure proper method operation and data integrity. Over the last three years, we have expanded our one-click concept to all of our analytical instruments. We are now taking the concept to our AutoChem instruments. By pairing one-click analytics with our IC software we are able to use artificial intelligence to provide high quality information from large amounts of data with limited user interaction. One benefit is a customer can analyze a reaction in approximately two minutes instead of the two hours it traditionally would have taken. LabX and One Click are just two examples of the value that our lab offering provides to customers. We believe our laboratory business is well positioned and we will continue to focus on five key customers values, safe result, solid compliance, simple operation, sustainable value and seamless integrated processes. We have been incorporating these values into our products for sometimes and while these are simple concepts we believe they resonate well with customers and provide a compass for our development teams to ensure they bring real value not just technology to customers. That concludes my comments on the lab business. In summary, we feel very good about how we finished 2018 and our outlook for this year. Assuming market conditions remain stable we believe are well-positioned to generate good sales growth, capital market share and deliver strong earnings growth. That concludes our prepared remarks, and I want to ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Muken : Hi. Good afternoon, guys. So, maybe just turning to sort of the industrial piece, obviously a fantastic quarter, China put that in sort of the context of what we've seen on the PMI side. I'm sure you're watching as well, as well as maybe some of peers in China, I guess how are you thinking about kind of that core industrial market, and it doesn't seem from the reports we've seen for many companies so far at least in this space this quarter did anyone see any change, but I guess as you look at sort of what's happening on the macro, particularly in Europe, maybe lesser in China, how are you sort of putting that full picture together to kind of get a feel for how that business will play out over the year? Olivier Filliol : If I look we did in Q4, we really saw very good growth across all the regions. It reflects still good market conditions, but very much also the strong execution of the team. We have invested quite some effort to go off to the attractive segments of the markets. We have done some resource shifting in certain counties, but if I also look at our marketing spending, our sales force guidance, we really support that our focus goes to the industrial segments that are most promising, and here I would name pharma, chemical, and food, and less so the more discrete by factoring kind of the material plastic electronics components markets, and that gives me also confidence that in 2019 we still will have good growth, even that maybe there is a certain slowdown in the global economy. Our business today is a different one than that we had in the downturn - in the last downturn, and that's particularly also true for industrial. Ross Muken : That's helpful. And maybe specifically on China, obviously some noise today out of the government, but feels like there's still just a lot of posturing, but we'll eventually sort of get the tariff issue behind us. I guess, as you look at your business there, any discernable change in sort of growth rates for any of the sub segments in the region? And how are you thinking about sort of the comps in that business over the balance of the year? Olivier Filliol : So far we don't see a slowdown in China. We delivered very strong results in Q4. We have great momentum in most of the industry segments. But what I said before for industrial worldwide applies also to China. There are industrial segments that do better than others. Again, pharma, for example, would do very well. But we would have the material - or the discrete manufacturing sectors that are certainly impacted in China, and that - at market that today is less relevant for us than it was 10 years ago. We talked a lot about our Chinese market business mix that changed. We have today a situation where the lab business is significantly bigger than it was a couple of years ago. And even within the industrial business we succeeded to grow the PI business to become more significant. So, I feel like we have a more healthy business mix. We have a team very focused on capturing the growth that comes from the industry segments that are growing in China, and that are benefiting from the five-year plans of the Chinese government. Looking forward, I don't expect the same growth rates out of China as we had, rather would see a mid to high single-digit growth in China. Here I would see lab to be particular strong. Kind of expect from lab in China high single-digit, as probably on the industry it's more the low single-digit range, and then reflecting basically also a slowdown of the Chinese economy, not the same in every segment. Ross Muken : Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Patrick Donnelly : Great, thanks guys. Maybe just on the service side, another nice quarter of high single-digit growth there, can you just help us think about the durability of the growth? I know it's been a big focus internally around things like driving higher attach rate. Can you just help us think where we are on that progression, how much room is left on that front? Olivier Filliol : Indeed, I was very pleased about the Q4 results here on service. It's a good reflection of what we did. I want to highlight maybe also for the full-year I was very happy with service because we did talk to you at the investor conference that our products become better and better, and therefore we sell less spare parts, we have less break/fix. And the decline in the break/fix we compensate with higher penetrations for contract business. And we have seen that happening throughout the year, definitely also in Q4. I see also that for some lab service business is doing particularly well, all these things. So, the trends in our service business are all point to the right direction, and it's a result of the many initiatives that we have. I would also highlight that the service in percentage of total business has been grown over all these years. As I include consumables to it, it's today almost a third of our total business, so a very attractive mix and I'm happy to see that our internal initiatives are actually delivering this. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. And then you mentioned the investor day, obviously you guys spent a lot of time there on the product inspection business, nice to see that bounce back to the kind of high single-digit growth. I guess on the go-forward mid single-digit growth in 2019 why couldn't there be upside there? I know you guys talked a lot about the competitive advantages you have, the opportunity in front of you at the investor day. So, is it just the market slowing on the food segment, could you just talk through the growth outlook, again a little lower than we've seen historically? Olivier Filliol : It's also related to timing of projects. The process inspection business has also deals that are bigger. And then it's a timing question of things how they come together. Then the second factor is the packaged foods industry overall and their investment commitments. We had seen in 2017, for example, very good large orders, global rollouts. '18 was then slower on that one, and we had certainly also a comparison challenge. And in '19, I just don't see it yet that the large packaged food companies are coming back in the same degree with the large global rollouts. And that's the reason why we are here a little bit more cautious for the year, but when I think about mid to long-term, I certainly the product inspection business to come back with very good growth numbers. Particularly we have a very good competitive position. We have the leading positions. And so I really see this as a very attractive business in the long-term. But then short-term, and again 2019 it will be a little bit more challenging. And yes, in that sense I'm happy how we delivered in Q4, but just because we had a good Q4 doesn't make the 2019 an easy year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Steve Beuchaw : Hi. Thanks for the time here. Just a few cleanup questions, I guess one, I wonder if you could just spike out or maybe tell us that you have no need to spike out anything in the quarter as it relates to timing items or projects, anything that affected the revenue progression 3Q, 4Q, 1Q? Shawn Vadala : No, I mean - Steve, this is Shawn. No, I mean the question first of all was - we're particularly happy to see broad based growth throughout most of the businesses, not only by products but by regions. Probably the two things that stood out on the positive side from the trend perspective is we had a strong finish to the year in product inspection that Olivier was just talking about. And then we also had a very strong year in core industrial, which was especially nice to see in each region of the world. I mean, each region really ended the year on a strong note there. And then on the other side of that, our retail business, as expected, was down in the quarter based upon the timing of project activity. Steve Beuchaw : Okay, got it. And then just a couple of housekeeping ones, one is, any change to the way you're thinking about the margin impact in '19 from the work that you guys have done on the facility consolidations in Switzerland and around Tampa. And then - and sorry, just I wonder if you could give me a sense for how to think about one other issue and it's, you mentioned in the prepared remarks, and thank you for the detail, in a scenario where the tariffs are resolved that the guidance would change, it would go higher. And again, thank you for the granularity. But I'm just a little confused about how to think about that when at the same time you mentioned that you assume that the end market conditions are very stable relative to what you've seen in 4Q. And exiting 2018, at least so far, we haven't seen an impact to the tariffs. So I wonder if you could just help me sort of parse that out. Is there potentially some impact from the tariffs that you found ways to offset, and so those kind of net out? Thanks a bunch. Shawn Vadala : Yes, maybe I'll start with the second part of your question, Steve. So, just to be clear, when we talk about the impact with the tariffs, we're not talking about the potential impact on the global economy. And so that's yes that's what we're referring to when we talked about in the prepared comments that the gross impact is about 3% of direct costs, but if that went away the net benefit of going away would be more like 1%. In the first part of your question in terms of product inspection were you referring to operating margins or gross margin I wasn't sure what you meant by that. Steve Beuchaw : I was actually more focused on operating margins, but both would be well? Thank you. Olivier Filliol : Yes, sure. So, on the operating margin side we're looking at a 100 basis point improvement for 2019. I think that's a strong guide from our perspective that certainly factors in some of the benefits we would see from some of the synergies and benefits we would have from the new facility in consolidating the plants. Similar story on 2019 gross margin we would see gross margin increasing in the range of about 50 basis points. Of course there's different puts and takes to that with favorable benefit from currency I mean I'm sorry from pricing which we would expect to be similar to what I guided last quarter in the 2%ish kind of arrange. Offset by the cost of the tariffs and kind of the rest is probably noise at that point. Steve Beuchaw : Thanks so much. Olivier Filliol : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Brandon Couillard : Thanks good afternoon or evening. Olivier just back on the core industrial business the 13% feels a lot more early cycle then base cycle, were there any specific discrete sort of projects that happened to fall in the fourth quarter that sort of contributed to that? Olivier Filliol : No, no, particular, and it was broad-based, it was across geographies and so nothing particular that I would highlight and that would explain it. Brandon Couillard : Fair enough and then just one on the R&D line the 15% spike in R&D spending in the fourth quarter so a bit of jump. Just curious how you think about the new product pipeline for 2019 and what segments do you feel like you got sort of the strongest lineup? Thank you. Olivier Filliol : Yes hey so yes we are investing heavily in the business. There's a lot of different great projects that we're excited about. How we see stuff in each area of the business but if we probably disproportionally in the laboratory side we have some really exciting things on the analytical instrument business as an example, but nothing I would highlight in particular. As we have a pretty diversified portfolio so no one new product introduction or upgrade moves the needle in isolation. It's just kind of our constant DNA of continuously having these things coming out. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Hey, thanks, a couple follow-ups on margin, I appreciate the commentary on some of the facility initiatives. As we think about some of other things you've talk about supply chain adjustment and then also Blue Ocean kind of being harvest mode. Can you maybe just talk about the impact from those two dynamics over the course of the year? Olivier Filliol : For 2019, you mean, Tycho? Tycho Peterson : Correct yes. Shawn Vadala : Yes. Hey, I mean it's not like we have a model that says this basis point is for one thing versus the other, but as we have a lot of really I'd say exciting initiatives to expand the margins. The pipeline of initiatives is strong as ever as Olivier mentioned before we feel really good about the execution in terms of our teams on the different programs. But I would say all areas whether its pricing had a particularly good fourth quarter and I feel good about the program entering the year. Stern Drive, as you heard at the Investor Day over 300 projects with lots of good things going on there. And then on the Blue Ocean program has a lot of really interesting things that we're working on at the moment that I think also positions us even better for the longer term. Tycho Peterson : All right, and then I guess going back to the industrial commentary I appreciate the fact you didn't have any meaningful projects in the fourth quarter Olivier are you able to talk it all about kind of order book actually in January or actually in the quarter and then January trends at all? Olivier Filliol : Not particular about January I think the guidance that we provided you before reflects different early indicators that we have and you heard Shawn talk about those are the business mix that we expect in Q1 and I think remains very healthy across all the businesses. So I think that supports the strong industrial number in Q4 wasn't just a spike. We in general feel good about that momentum. But of course we recognized that industrial overall is more exposed to an economic environment and that's also the reason that for the full-year I expect a better performance than from lab then I would say from industrial, but industrial will continue to do well. Shawn Vadala : Yes, and just to be clear, we start the year with a good backlog in industrial and expect a good first quarter there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Derik De Bruin : Hi, good evening everyone. Olivier Filliol : Hi, Derik. Derik De Bruin : So, I have to ask another Q4 question on this one just because some of the other industrial focus companies have mentioned it. Did you see any sort of pull forward in demand in Q4 just from customers in the industrial side you were potentially worried about tariffs and trade issues? Olivier Filliol : No, actually you have a transaction size for us is not that high that customers would change their behavior just because of tariffs or anticipated price increases. Also we did communicate special price increases early on now I don't see a connection between the two things and as Shawn highlighted did the backlog indications for Q1 remain solid so. Derik De Bruin : Great, and so, just one follow-up on this one, one of your life sciences tools peers when they gave 2019 guidance they basically said the same thing everything looks good. They flagged actually in their comments some concerns over potential Europe can you also talk about the European market and what's going on I mean obviously there is some political uncertainty and the point might now and just would love some of your feedback since your local there? Olivier Filliol : Yes. Yes, hey, yes of course Europe is certainly a region that we look at in more cautious way they are certain countries where the economic forecast were downgraded in the last couple of weeks. But that doesn't always mean that it's going to directly impact us and I strongly feel that for example the pharma-chem industry is still doing very well. We have a very big share of replacement business that is not directly linked to the economic environment. I always say to our team we don't need that strong of a GDP growth that we can actually deliver good growth ourselves. And we are very much in that mode we are still in an investment mode, we are in an offensive mode across the world including Europe and it's up to us to compensate maybe some slowdown in the economy and still deliver good results and so far all the indications support the statement. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Arias with Citigroup. Daniel Arias : Good afternoon guys, thanks, Olivier, maybe on the other side, can you just expand on the Americas in a bit it sounds like things are pretty good there. And I think Shawn's previous outlook was for growth in the low to mid-singles. How likely do you think a 3% or 4% scenario is at this point you did five of an 8% year so coming back to five is a comp seems fairly favorable? Olivier Filliol : First of all, the environment looks healthy for us good, I am very happy with the results the team has been delivering. I'm very optimistic that we will continue to execute very well. We have some comparisons topics where we need to be a little realistic and we have the retail business that we already called out before we expect a decline. But absent of that I actually really feel good about the Americas and I expect again particular lab to do very well also in Americas. Daniel Arias : Okay, retail was actually my second question I mean I certainly understand your point and what you're trying to do there in terms of profitability. I am just curious if you do have a view on when you think that business might return to growth? Olivier Filliol : Ooh, I am not going to focus too much on that one, because I will focus really on the profitability, and with that we remain very selective with projects we pursue. It's also a lumpy business, and that's why we feel actually that we should deliver flat sales for the full-year, but for example, earlier in the year, we expect we're going to be down. And it's not a business that I'm going to say, okay, we're going to drive it to low to mid-single growth. As long as we grow profitability I'm fine. You need also to know we shift resources. We try to shift resources towards the lab business and industrial business because we see there sustainable long-term growth opportunity, we see good profitability and when you shift resources away from a business like the retail business, I want to be cautious and to expect growth mid or long-term. So yes, I hope this is giving you the necessary flavor. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Jack Meehan : Thanks, good evening. I was hoping if you could start just within the Lab segment if you could give us an update on the pharma customer class. You know, 2018 was a strong funding year, so what the outlook there is for that customer group and how - historically how quickly some of the funding gets deployed within that group? Olivier Filliol : So let me - if I take the big picture, I would split pharma and biopharma. Biopharma goes very well. We see a lot of investment in biopharma that benefits our core lab, but also process analytics very much. We have, for example, the pipette business that is very much also in biopharma. We see very, very good momentum there. If we look at the other pharma business, so small molecules business for example, we still have very good momentum, we grow very nicely, but I would also recognize that maybe the investments are not in the same degree as biopharma, but here we need also to differentiate by geography, you for example, have to fill in the emerging markets, China in particular a good underlying growth rate in pharma very much so. And so, on a global scale, I feel good about pharma and biopharma going forward. Jack Meehan : And you know just was hoping you could also give us an update on the deal landscape given some of the macro uncertainty that you talked about. Has there been any change in activity in the funnel and as it comes to leverage just the size of things that you would entertain? Shawn Vadala : Yes, hey, there's no change in our status. I mean, our pipeline is the same as it's been. We still continue to look at things, but things also have to be available but no change in our status or our approach. Jack Meehan : Thank you, Shawn. Shawn Vadala : Yes, you're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Dan Leonard : Thank you. Just a couple of quick ones for Shaw; Shawn, first off, on gross margins in the fourth quarter, they were a little lighter than we were expecting given the outperformance on the revenue line, I know foreign currency and tariffs were the headwinds. Was there anything else to explain the bridge on why gross margins were lighter year-on-year, was there a mix issue or anything else? Shawn Vadala : Yes, I mean, we still - you know, there's a couple of things Dan. So we're still experiencing some of these initial startup costs in the product inspection business that we've talked to you about over the last couple of quarters as well as some related new product introductions that we've also spoke to you about as well. But one thing that stood out a little bit more in the fourth quarter is we did have some negative mix as we kind of dug into that one. And it was kind of just a mix that was granular within businesses. It wasn't like this division versus that division. It was really something at a more micro level, but as you kind of look at some of those topics, maybe the silver lining is that at the operating margin level, those product categories or those businesses actually performed quite well. Dan Leonard : Okay. And then just a clarification, for the tax rate in 2019, did you say 20.5 or 21.5? Shawn Vadala : 20.5. Dan Leonard : 20.5, thank you. Shawn Vadala : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Brennan with UBS. Daniel Brennan : Great. Thank you for taking the question here. I guess, I wanted to go back to China if you would and with this - I think 17% of revenues - and I'm just wondering, given the exposure you have core industrial in China could you just help us think about like what's in that business in China and what the economic sensitivity of it is, because I think so far Lab's doing great and mostly your peers have discussed really not seeing any impact from slowing economic growth there, but I think the uncertainty, if you will, is just kind of that core industrial business. So if you can help us think about the exposure there and the sensitivity that you're baking into that business? Thank you. Olivier Filliol : Yes. So, if I look at the mix today, in China we have about 45% that comes from Lab, and then you have Industrial which is roughly 47%, but interestingly that's quite a change versus 10 years ago, particularly if I look at core industrial. Core industrial 10 years ago would have been more like 60%, as today it is about 40%. And if I look at this 40% of core industrial, the end-user segment would also be different to what we had in the past. Namely today pharma, chemical, and food are really dominant end-user industries that we are serving. And as you can imagine these are the industries that are more sustainable. They should offer very good mid and long-term growth. And I would expect them to be much less exposed to any tariffs or trade impact. And that's actually one of the reasons why we feel actually more comfortable that whatever the Chinese economy will do we will not see the same volatility as we have seen, for example, in 2015 [ph] where there was a significant downturn in China and we were heavily impacted in our industrial business. Lab had reasonable growth at that time, but the Industrial was very impacted, but as I described before our Industrial businesses today different, and feel more comfortable going forward on this. Shawn Vadala : Yes. And if you were to take our Laboratory business in China and add the faster growth segments of Industrial, it's about two thirds of our total Chinese business. Dan Leonard : Great. And then this is a follow-up, I'm sorry, it's another kind of macro question if you don't mind, but just given your comments, Olivier, they haven't seen any impact to date, but you know continuing to look at a lot of the tea leaves that are out there and kind of highlight the cautiousness that potentially could occur so are we to take that your guidance for mid single-digit growth this year and look at what IMF is forecasting, who knows if the economists can even come close to being right, but I think IMF and even our firm is forecasting that maybe 0.2, 0.3 percentage point decline in economic growth - is that what's kind of baked in? I know it's probably not that granular, but is that the level of what's baked in through mid single-digit, or is your cautiousness you know saying something even potentially worse? Thank you. Olivier Filliol : No, it doesn't imply something abruptly worse. It is rather a steady situation and it implies that we continue to execute well in this steady environment and we continue to take market shares. If the economy would take a downturn from the current steady state, I would still expect us to gain market share, but we would probably have a hard time to deliver this kind of growth that we are guiding you. But we don't see, in our numbers, any early negative indicators and with what forecasts are out, right now, from the economists we feel comfortable with our guidance. Operator : So, our final question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Steve Willoughby : Hi, good evening, thanks for taking my questions. I think two things for you, first, Shawn, you commented about tariffs earlier, can you just walk us through some of the moving pieces if tariffs stay at 10%? I know you're assuming that they'll go to 25%, but you talked about if they want to weigh, what happens in terms of the impact or flow-through if they stay at the current 10%? Shawn Vadala : Yes. Thanks Steve for the question. And just to clarify, there's two tranches of tariffs, the first tranche is at 25%, it's the second tranche that started at 10, and is still at 10. If we look at that and kind of model out what if it stays at 10, the benefit to EPS on a full-year basis would be approximately half a percent of EPS as opposed to the 1% if they all went away. Steve Willoughby : Okay. So following up on that, and just trying to think through the changes in your EPS guidance, based on my math it looks like less worse FX is about $0.10. You're guiding to slightly lower tax rate, which is about maybe $0.15. And then you previously assumed that the tariffs would jump to 25% as of January 1, which obviously hasn't happened yet. So that's some extra earnings here in the first quarter versus what you might have been thinking three months ago, so just trying to put those pieces together and then get to the only $0.10 increase in the full-year guidance? Shawn Vadala : Yes, sure. No. I understand the question. Probably I mean maybe I'll start with maybe the simplest way to think about the guide, and then I'll kind of acknowledge some of the puts and takes. So probably the easiest way to look at it is we maintained our growth rate of 11% to 12%. In terms of like kind of some of the puts and takes, we had our beat for Q4. Yes, we had the tax benefit that you mentioned. On the other side, we also had less pension income for 2019. That's largely related to the lower asset return that was impacted by global equity markets in the fourth quarter, particularly in the month of December that kind of went the other way on us. In terms of your comment on tariff delay, I mean keep in mind that is only January and February that's maybe two to three pennies, so it wasn't a significant consideration for us. And then in terms of currency, the currency, you're right, there's probably modest benefit today if we looked at where currencies were three months ago, but a lot of that has been volatility that's evolved over the last couple of weeks, and at this point in time we just think it's prudent to be a little bit cautious on that one, and we just kind of see how the currencies play out here and then we kind of update accordingly as we kind of get into the first - after we get into the first quarter. Steve Willoughby : Okay, thank you very much. Shawn Vadala : Thank you. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. Mary Finnegan : Thanks, Catherine, and thanks everyone for joining us tonight. As usual, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out. We are in Switzerland. So please send us an e-mail, we're happy to get back to you. Take care. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Jesse, and I'll be your audio coordinator for today. . I would now like to turn our presentation over to your hostess for today's call, Ms. Mary Finnegan. Please proceed, ma'am. Mary Finnegan : Thanks, Jesse, and good evening, everyone. I'm Mary Finnegan. I'm the Treasurer, and I'm responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo. I'm happy that you're joining us this evening. I'm here with Olivier Filliol, our CEO; and Shawn Vadala, our Chief Financial Officer. I need to cover just a couple of administrative matters. This call is being webcast and is available for replay on our website. A copy of the press release and the presentations that we refer to is also on our website. Olivier Filliol : Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call tonight. I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Shawn will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments and we will open the lines for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter are on Page 3 of the presentation. We had a very good start to the year with the first quarter results. Local currency sales growth was strong and better-than-expected as demand in our markets remained favorable and we continued to execute well. Total local currency sales grew 7% in the quarter. Food Retailing declined in the quarter. Excluding this business, our total sales grew 8%. We had excellent growth in our Laboratory and Industrial product lines, which more than offset the decline in Food Retailing. Growth in Europe and Asia was a strong and Americas, excluding Food Retail, also grew quite well. Our productivity and margin initiatives continue to drive good results, and despite a 7% gross headwind due to the adverse currency and tariff costs, we achieved a 10% increase in adjusted EPS in the quarter. Our outlook for 2019 remains positive. This week has brought some noise surrounding the trades tariff dispute situation with China. For now, we have assumed that the second wave of tariffs will increase to 25% as indicated by the administration earlier this week. Shawn will go over this in more detail including the potential upside to our 2019 guidance if the tariffs situation improves. Shawn Vadala : Okay. Thanks, Olivier. Sales were $679.5 million in the quarter, an increase of 7% in local currency. As a reminder, all growth is organic. On a U.S. dollar basis, total sales increased 3% as currencies reduced sales growth by approximately 4% in the quarter. On Slide 4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales grew 9% in both Europe and Asia/Rest of World. Local currency sales growth was 3% in the Americas but as Olivier indicated, sales were impacted in this region due to a decline in food retailing. Absent food retailing, Americas grew 6% in the first quarter. China had another excellent quarter with 13% local currency sales growth. We're executing well in Europe but also had some benefit from the timing of Easter this year versus last year. On Slide 5, we outline local currency sales growth by product area. In the quarter, laboratory sales grew 8%, industrial also increased 8%. Within industrial, core industrial grew 9% and product inspection increased 6%. Food retailing declined 5% in the quarter. As you heard from Olivier, Food Retailing reduced our overall sales growth by approximately 1% in the quarter. Slide 6 provides the P&L for the quarter. Gross margin in the quarter was 57.2%, a 50-basis point increase over the prior year level of 56.7%. Productivity and pricing continue to be strong contributors to margin growth. Partly offsetting these positives were tariffs from the U.S. China trade dispute as well as some initial cost and product launches. R&D amounted to $36.1 million, which represents a 9% increase in local currency. SG&A amounted to $204.4 million, a 6% increase in local currency over the prior year. The increase was driven by investments in our field force as well as higher variable compensation. Adjusted operating profit amounted to $147.8 million in the quarter, which represents a 6% increase over the prior year amount of $139.5 million. We estimate currency reduced operating income by approximately $5 million, which is about $1 million worse than what we had expected the last time we spoke. We also estimate that tariffs were a gross headwind to operating income by approximately $4 million. Absent adverse currency and the gross impact of tariffs, operating income would have increased 12% in the quarter. Olivier Filliol : Thanks, Shawn. Let me start by providing some additional comments on our operating results. Our lab business continues to perform very well, with 8% local currency sales growth in the quarter, which was against good growth in the prior year. Analytical instruments, pipettes and Process Analytics did particularly well. Market demand is good and this business benefits from these proper investments in field resources : Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives and R&D. We also see the nice benefit from good spending in biopharma in our Laboratory business and biopharma is a good example of how our Spinnaker sales and marketing strategy are targeting the most attractive and fastest-growing segments of the market. We serve both the upstream and downstream processes in biopharma that is R&D, quality control, process development, in-line process monitoring, such as bio reactors and pure water analytics. Operator : . Your first question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Muken : Just maybe starting out on China, it seems like performance in the quarter was quite good and most of our checks on the ground there are pretty constructive but obviously this week a little bit of a curveball relative to some of the trade and tariff debate. I guess, are you more concerned about domestic demand if something negative were to transpire on tariffs and they were actually going to be implemented tomorrow? Or do you think about it more in the context of what it does for global growth in general? I'm just trying to think through like where risk really lies relative to your business. I'm guessing more the Industrial than the lab side if at all and how you're just thinking through sort of some of the machinations there? Olivier Filliol : Ross, it's more the latter one and I'd say so because when I look at our business mix today in China, we are less exposed to the manufacturing side - sector and, particularly, discrete manufacturing sector that is more exposed than again to the export business. So I feel really that we have today a very favorable business mix in China with many industries that we serve that will depend on the domestic demand rather than export business. But of course, the global economy could be impacted here. We would probably see the effects throughout Asia, not just China. I think South East Asia, Japan, but also Europe would be impacted if this has further escalation. Ross Muken : Makes sense. And then maybe I think you sort of gave us some comments on product inspection. Obviously, the traditional package food guys have had particularly in the U.S. some volatility. I guess, the emerging market opportunity there given how far behind in their country seems obvious. But I guess, how are you thinking through how temporal some of these disruptions are and there's also been an uptick a bit in M&A in that world or consolidation. Does that matter? Is that a positive for you because it sometimes will stimulate the desire to upgrade and/or new hold. I guess, how are you just thinking through that backdrop? Olivier Filliol : I think the challenge is a temporary one. I mean long term, I think actually, this business offers excellent growth. The market dynamics are very good. We are very well positioned. And so I'm very positive about this business. It's a business that I think will contribute above the group average in terms of growth. But the things that you just mentioned will continue to have an impact here for a few more quarters. I don't think this is an immediate turnaround of the market environment. But I don't also want to portray here that the whole market is just challenging. For example in emerging markets, in Asia, we had good growth and I expect this to go on. But maybe in the West, it's where you have big companies there. We feel it - particularly where we feel it is the global roll outs. We had in the past this big global companies that were committed to very significant investments for global roll outs. We see fewer of these and that's the kind of impact that we have to go through, particularly this year. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Daniel Leonard : The geographic distribution of your growth is a bit different than what we've seen from others this earnings season, particularly in Europe. So Olivier, heard the comments on the businesses. But could you elaborate further on what you think you're doing well in Europe and why your performance would be so discordant from the macro? Olivier Filliol : Yes. Hey, I definitely feel that team is executing very well. We have these different programs in place, and they very well resonate also in Europe. All this topics that I mentioned at the end of the prepared remarks about Spinnaker approach, its sales force guide, big data analytics, very much applies to Europe. And so that's one effect but I don't want to also ignore the fact that it against an easier comparison. We have a 9% growth. We will not repeat this kind of growth going forward. And if you look at 2-year growth, however, I'm still very pleased. I like it. And particularly because it was across all the core businesses, the lab did very well, Core Industrial did excellent and product inspection actually did also well. So happy about that. And last, I would also mentioned there was a certain Easter impact that helped us this year. Yes. Daniel Leonard : And maybe just a quick follow-up. Is it possible to quantify how much you think the Easter timing benefited you? Shawn Vadala : Dan, this is Shawn. Hey, it's of course difficult to estimate was it 1% to 2% maybe. But probably the best way to look at it is if you look at our guidance for Q2, we're thinking of more like low single-digit for Q2 in Europe. So on a year-to-date basis for the first 6 months of the year, Europe is going to be approximately mid-single-digit. Operator : You're next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Ruizhi Qin : This is Julia on for Tyco. So regarding China, obviously you still have very strong results Industrial and lab, both up double-digit like you said. So given that I mean do you think there is room for updates to your full year outlook which I think assumes high single-digit for lab and low single-digit for Industrial? I mean, I understand you - why you might want to invent some conservatism there but given the Industrial performance so far, do you think low single digit is still a reasonable expectation for full year? Shawn Vadala : Julia, this is Shawn. Thanks for the question. So for Industrial, I think you're right. I think given the start to the year, we would look at more like a mid-single-digit on the Industrial side in China. And on the lab side, probably a high single-digit. So overall, we are now looking at more high single-digit for China for the full year. Ruizhi Qin : Okay. Got it. And then regarding the front office resource shifting initiative, could you maybe give a little bit more color on the magnitude of the benefit both in terms of top line and bottom line? And how soon you expect to generate that benefit? And if any of those benefits are embedded in your current guidance? Olivier Filliol : So the way you need to look at it - this is a multiyear program that we are running here. We have started with the Field Turbo program already a few years ago, and then started to expand it with the Shift 5 program. The way I look at it is how many additional field resources we have versus the previous year as a combined program. And here, we are talking about roughly 200 resource for 2019. This is not so different to what we did in the past, and I would - in that sense, I'm not suggesting that this is - you can see an incremental benefit that is not already built into the guidance or I'm not suggesting here that you will see a further acceleration next year. It's a part of our overall Spinnaker 5 program and it's an enabler also for all the other things that we are doing. Internally, we - when we look at these programs, we look at reasonable payback times because sometimes you have some pre-investments like recruiting and so on. But yes, it's not - this would be on top of what we have budgeted or guided. Ruizhi Qin : Got you. That's helpful. And then lastly, I think last quarter, you noted that some of your competitor price increases were higher than yours in light of the tariffs which facilitated some share gain. Have you seen that dynamic continue to play out in the first quarter? Shawn Vadala : Yes. So hey, Julie, just to maybe clarify, I think what you're referring to. So when we were talking about specifically about our midyear pricing last summer in some of our Industrial product categories in the United States, we had noticed that we went out with a robust price increase midyear. Some of our local competition went out with a slightly higher increase in that particular business. We went out with another robust increase during the 2019 annual increase. We're off to a very good start with pricing. And I think we're probably just under 2.5% for the first quarter results, very much in line with what we expected and kind of feel good in terms of where we stand versus competition. Operator : Your next question comes from Daniel Brennan with UBS. Daniel Brennan : I was just hoping to - Olivier, I think you touched upon possibly some of the knock-on effects from the China trade, if there isn't one, maybe impact on global growth. Maybe you could just speak to, I mean, is there any risk around kind of relation the ability for China to look for local suppliers again to maybe company like yourself if in fact, it was a retaliation investments? Maybe a high-level question about the competitive dynamics between what you offer and maybe what some local suppliers offer? Olivier Filliol : I think we are well positioned here. Mettler-Toledo is viewed as a local company in China. We have been there for so many years. We have excellent relationships. We have so many plants there. So I feel really confident on that side and the fact that we have - as a company, we have always been viewed as a global company - there is this Swiss element in it. So I'm not worried about that. It's - we are well positioned also in terms of well differentiated products. They've not - we will not be easily substituted. I think the bigger topic is just the economic development, the global economic evolution. Daniel Brennan : Got it. and then you spent a fair amount of time discussing your offerings within pharma, probably more than we've heard you elaborate in the past. Maybe can you just address kind of collectively, you're kind of pharma end-market, what that grows at today and possibly with some of the investments you're making, could we see a benefit to you forward growth rate given the fairly strong dynamics within pharma? Olivier Filliol : Just one additional comment and I wanted to make in China about this whole trade. Of course, there is currency movements that also come with that. We talked about global recession but the currency movements are always very important too and can have ripple effect on other economies, including the Southeast, Asia economics and so on. So I just wanted to also highlight that effect. Now back to pharma, life science industry. What I tried to highlight here is the prepared script is particularly also the subsegment of biopharma. Often we have in previous calls, talked about the pharma and the life science customers of us. In this call, I highlighted the biopharma because, of course, that's one that has a particular dynamic and a good growth momentum. And I wanted to share with you that we have a nice exposure there, that it's growing nice. We have, for example, the Process Analytics business where it's a very significant share. That business has been growing very nicely for us for many years. And we benefit that there's a lot of investments going in biotech and in particular, also on the production side. We - in terms of investment in these and returns, I think this is a gradual thing. We are, today, with our sales force programs in place, with our shift resources and so on, we all are focusing more on pharma, chemical and food industry. And I think that's one of the benefits that we translate in good growth that we have here in Q1 and previous quarters. It's multiple effect. I would be hard-pressed to give you a specific number that would just come from pharma or biopharma in isolation. Operator : Your next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Brandon Couillard : Olivier, a question on the product inspection business, specifically. Could you sort of give us a breakdown between what the service side is doing versus the equipment side? And with some of your food packaging customers kind of let's say lengthening out their budgets or with muted budgets right now, are you seeing them leaning more on service needs? Olivier Filliol : Yes. So we don't specifically break out within a business line. But I certainly can share that the service business continues to outperform the product side, that's a trend that we have now for many years. And service does actually, particularly well it's also very nicely profitable. We care very much about the service business and product inspection because it's a key differentiator that we have. You might remember when we were down in Tampa for the Investor Day, we had also a session on the topic where we highlighted the fact that we have about in U.S., for example, 7x more service technicians than our nearest competitor. That's a unique differentiation and so part of the package. So again, this is going very well and nicely profitable. In terms of the exact impact of the large food companies and their evolution, no, I could not give you here a specific breakout. It's - I would want to refer to the point that I made before about this big global rollout that are missing. It's on an individual account and local size. It's less of a topic. It's more the global rollout that are missing at this point. Brandon Couillard : One from Shawn. Cash flow off to a pretty good start in the first quarter here. Any updates to your free cash flow expectations for '19? Shawn Vadala : No. Our free cash flow expectations for the full year is still kind of like in the $510 million range. Yes, we got off to a great start. Some of that is timing of how things are going to play out during the year on different topics. But overall, feel very good about it. Our working capital statistics are at an excellent level, very similar to where they were a year ago. So no change in terms of guidance. Operator : Your next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Jack Meehan : Shawn, I was hoping you could give us - help us quantify some of the changes on the gross margin line, at least the expansion year-over-year. It looks like one of the strongest in about 1.5 years. So I think we have the tariffs number, how much did price contribute and how much was FX year-over-year? Shawn Vadala : Yes. Sure. So if I just kind of walk it down. So yes, pricing came in pretty much similar to what we expected as I mentioned earlier. That's probably like about 100-basis point improvement on the margin, kind of offsetting that was the gross tariff impact, which was about a 60 basis point headwind on the margin. Currency had about a 20-basis point benefit, and then we had a bunch of other stuff kind of lumped together that went kind of 20 basis points the other way or whatever - however, the math works. Maybe that's 10 basis points. But you kind of get the picture so that's kind of I think the highlights. Jack Meehan : Great. And then just to clean up on the buyback. Is your expectation still $545 million and look like you're off to maybe a quicker start for the year? Just what's driving the pacing there? Shawn Vadala : So for the full year, it is going to be just under $750 million. So sorry as a reminder, it would be a free cash flow plus estimated option proceeds plus an incremental $200 million to increase our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage to 1.5 by the end of next year. So just to clarify for everybody, we'll do an incremental $200 million on our share repurchase program this year and next year, and this is consistent with what we've previously communicated to you back the last couple of quarters. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Patrick Donnelly : Maybe just one on the Core Industrial growth continues to be strong, in spite of some macro signs pointing a little down. Does that mix shift seem less sensitivity to general macro trends compared to the historical certainly seems to be the case. So maybe just help us think about what kind of has driven this dislocation again softer macro yet the core Industrial results continue to be pretty robust. Olivier Filliol : Yes. We never really know if we are early or late cycle and all of these things. It's really difficult to measure. I think first, we need to look at us on a comparable basis, I talked before about how Europe and core Industrial was extremely strong, but it was against a little bit weaker comparisons. But I am very happy how we do in Industrial. I think it's a reflection of a good execution in the market organization. We have also a very strong product portfolio. We have this effect that I mentioned before, so that it's focused more on pharma can food that it is playing out. So different factors. I wouldn't attribute it too much to the economic cycle. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. And then maybe just one on lab, another strong quarter even against 10% comp as you mentioned. This type of growth has almost become standard for you guys. So it seems broad-based, areas like liquid handling and process analytics. Anything else to call out on this kind of sustained strength that we've seen for the past couple of years here? Shawn Vadala : Yes. We were particularly pleased with our analytical instrument growth in the quarter. As you mentioned, we tend - we've been seeing really good trends on some of the biopharma categories like liquid handling and Process Analytics. But we are seeing excellent growth throughout the portfolio. I think one of the standouts in my mind is our analytical business in all areas of the analytical business. And then as I think you're familiar we've had a lot of product introductions throughout the entire lab portfolio with - so I could also comment on Laboratory balances which has particular - a very strong momentum at the moment too. So we feel really good about the lab business when you look at the portfolio of products as well as the execution of the market organization, combined. Operator : Your next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Ryskin : This is Mike on for Derik. Most of the question have been asked, I'll just throw in two quick ones. One was I thought you mentioned something in the prepared remarks about you had some benefit from timing in core Industrial. I was wondering if you could clarify that a little bit sort of the magnitude there and whether that was tied to the Easter comment on Europe or whether that was a separate event. Shawn Vadala : Yes. Mike, I'm not - we're kind of looking at each other. I'm not sure when you mentioned timing of core Industrial. I think maybe what you could have referred to is that we did mention something about a little bit of benefit in our transportation and logistics business. Yes, that business has a tendency to be lumpy with projects when it has an impact we bring it to your attention and call it out. So we kind of acknowledged that, that's had some benefit in the quarter. But even, excluding that, we were still high single-digit in our core Industrial business. So still feel good about it. Michael Ryskin : Yes, that is exactly what I was referring to so appreciate the color. And then another quick one. Just thinking broadly, I was ignoring all the - trying to ignore all the things happening this week and potentially some of the headlines that could or could not happen tonight as far as the tariffs are concerned. Could you just speak broadly to your view on sort of the visibility you have in your key end markets going through the rest of the year? In the past, you've talked to, you know you want to take a cautious stance because of some increased volatility in the macro picture. Has that changed broadly excluding the tariffs story over the last year or so? Is it a 3, 6 months visibility appropriate to comment on in market conditions? Olivier Filliol : We still feel the same as we - when we talked last time. Actually, we are recognizing that there are clouds out there, but it's not that we are seeing it in our numbers. I feel confident with early indicators. What I hear from my teams pretty much around the world is actually positive, is encouraging. But we do recognize that things are fragile when it comes to the economy and that there are signs, like PMI, things like that, that are - that could make us feel a little bit more cautious. I think we are alert, we are agile to react if anything would happen. But we have no internal indications, and that's why we continue to invest. That's why I was talking about Field Turbo's and all these things. Very confident in that sense about what the upside is. But prepared if things would change. Operator : Your next question comes from Richard Eastman of Baird. Richard Eastman : Olivier, could you elaborate just a little bit when you were talking about the lab earlier, the lab segment earlier, you did call out this biopharma production, the bio process production applications that you are growing within the Process Analytics business. Could you just - is that business big enough at this point to move the needle? And is that a newer effort because I didn't really - I haven't placed you guys in the bio process manufacturing process before and I'm just curious if you could maybe shed a little bit of color on that and if you are large enough, is the method of production within biopharma. Is that a benefit to you, or is it more about absolute level of investment? Olivier Filliol : Interestingly, the bio piece is the region and the core of Process Analytics. I know it well because I started there 18 years ago. It was the pH measurement, in-line measurement with pH and very much this was a parameter used in the fermentation particularly for bio reactors but then also in the beer industry and that has always been an important customer segment for us. And there are parallels between the beer industry and the bio reaction industry with cell growth. And pH measurement and  oxygen have always been a strength of ours. We are clearly the leader in that segment. And then over the years, we have expanded the portfolio and we have added for example, CO2 measurement, which is a similar technology, but we have also added TLC, for example, and more recently - bioburden and these are parameters that you use to - for water purity, and the water purity is very important in pharmaceutical processes, but including also in the bio processes. So the answer is we have been in this business for a long time and we have benefited from the growth of that industry not just in the recent quarters but actually in the recent years. We are also in the business of the single use bags where we provide the sensor for. And I think we highlighted it just on this call because there are multiple products we think Mettler-Toledo portfolio, not just Process Analytics that goes into that end-user industry, we feel that we have actually also good marketing programs to it. We have good databases. And we wanted to highlight it because it had a little bit more attention in the analyst and investor community in recent quarters. Richard Eastman : Yes, yes. Okay. Is there - in lab and total in the 8% local currency growth that you referenced in the first quarter, is pricing in lab above the 2.5 corporate average? Did that contribute at all? Shawn Vadala : Maybe, probably. I don't think there's a significant difference this quarter between lab and Industrial. We did more bolder increases on the Industrial side given the tariff situation between the midyear stuff and the stuff we did for the annual price increases as we entered this year. Richard Eastman : Okay. And then just the last question if I may. Within your European business, was there any positive benefit from the Brexit, let me just say push? In other words any buy forward or inventory levels or anything that you saw we've seen that in a number of companies? Olivier Filliol : Not really. No. We - basically, we have prepared ourselves with safety stock, absolutely. But from a customer standpoint, I have no indication at all and I visited actually the U.K. just a few weeks ago, and this was a non-topic with the team. In general, I'm surprised how that Brexit, so far, has a limited impact on our business, other than what we take precautions of safety stock. But from a customer's reaction, not much impact. It's also not that we see that many of our customers are shutting down their investments or so, lucky enough not too much impact. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Stephen Willoughby : Just one question for you, Shawn. Just sort of question on guidance here. You beat your first quarter guidance by $0.05, you've obviously raised by $0.05, but you took up the full year organic growth by 50 bps so I just was wondering why there wasn't more flow through into earnings. Shawn Vadala : Yes. No good question, Steve. So I think that best way to think about it is that the 5.5% or the 50 basis points improvement on sales had largely - was largely related to our Q1 beat. Similarly, our EPS increase was largely related to the Q1 beat. But the one thing that probably stands out in our minds as we were giving the guidance that kind of goes the other way is the currencies have worsened a little bit over the last quarter, particularly in the last couple of weeks. We didn't necessarily adjust for 100% of that, but certainly, it's something to call out. Stephen Willoughby : One quick follow-up, Shawn. Just to confirm, there is no M&A contribution in the quarter? Shawn Vadala : That's correct. Entirely organic. Operator : . Your next question comes from Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery. Paul Knight : Congratulations Olivier on the quarter. On the bio production side of the business, are you applying the original - are you implying systems direct or are you going through DE Sartorius network into part of their systems? Olivier Filliol : So the big majority of our business also for Process Analytics is direct but there are relationship with system integrators that are building whole plans. And for single use applications, we are working with multiple companies in that space. However, it's always important, even when we go to any system integrators or partners or so, the decision are normally done by the end user and in that sense we have, strong relationship with the end user and the end users know the Mettler-Toledo brand very well. Paul Knight : And Olivier, what do you think your market share is in the  area and then also, in the beer side of the market? Olivier Filliol : Let's say, I feel we are a strong leader in all these applications. Again, this fermentation, bio reactor for the specific parameters, the specific analytical parameters, we are viewed as a global leader. Operator : There are no further questions. I turn the call back to the presenters for any closing remarks. Mary Finnegan : Thanks, Jesse, and thanks, everyone, for joining us tonight. As always, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to give us a call or easy as we're traveling, or easiest to send us an email. Take care, guys. Bye-bye.

Olivier Filliol : Thank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call which we're doing from China. It is Friday morning for us and Thursday evening for most of you on the phone. I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Shawn will provide details on our financial results and guidance. I will then have some additional comments and we will open the lines for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter are on page 3 of the presentation. We had a good second quarter results. Local currency sales growth was solid, and we are particularly pleased with the excellent growth in our Laboratory business and very solid growth in Core Industrial product lines. Total local currency sales grew 5% in the quarter. Excluding Food Retailing, which declined in the quarter, local currency sales grew 6%. Growth in the Americas and Asia was very good. We had another quarter of good operating margin growth, and despite headwinds from currency and tariffs, we achieved a strong increase in EPS. Shawn Vadala : Thanks Olivier. Sales were $731.4 million in the quarter, an increase of 5% in local currency. As a reminder, all growth is organic. On a U.S. dollar basis, this total sales increased 1% as currencies reduced sales growth by approximately 4% in the quarter. On slide 4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales were 7% in both the Americas and Asia/Rest of the World. Growth in the Americas, excluding Food Retailing, was 9%, a level we're quite pleased with. Sales growth in Europe declined 1% in local currency and was impacted by a decline in our Product Inspection business. Absent Product Inspection, growth in Europe was up 3% in the quarter, which is quite good particularly given the 9% sales growth we had in Q1, which included some benefit from the timing of Easter holidays. Finally, China had another very strong quarter with 9% local currency sales growth. The next slide shows year-to-date results. Local currency sales growth increased 4% in Europe during the first half of the year; 5% in the Americas; and 8% in Asia/Rest of World. In total, sales grew 6% in the first half of 2019. On slide 6, we outline local currency sales growth by product area. In the quarter, Laboratory sales grew 8%. Industrial increased 3% with Core Industrial up 5%, and product \u2013 while Product Inspection was down 1%. Food Retail declined 8% in the quarter. As you heard from Olivier, Food Retailing reduced our overall sales growth by 1% in the quarter. The next slide shows sales growth for the first half of the year. Laboratory sales grew 8% in local currency; Industrial grew 5%, with Core Industrial up 7% and Product Inspection up 2%. Food Retailing declined 6% during the first 6 months of the year. Overall first -- overall for the first half, total sales were up 6% in local currency, 7% if we exclude Food Retailing. Olivier Filliol : Thank you Shawn. Let me start by providing some additional comments on our operating results. Our lab business continued to perform very well with 8% local currency sales growth in the quarter, which was against a good growth in the prior year. Analytical instruments, pipettes and automated chemistry did particularly well. All three regions showed good lab growth. Our laboratory business continues to benefit from disproportionate investments in field resources, Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives and R&D investments. We expect market demand to remain favorable and expect good growth in the second half of the year. It won't be quite at the level we had in the first half, principally driven by more challenging comparisons. In terms of our Industrial business, Product Inspection was down slightly in the quarter. This business continues to do well in Asia and we saw better growth in the Americas, but it was more than offset by a decline in our European business. We continue to feel very good about this business over the medium-term. We would expect to see growth in the second half of the year likely in the low to mid-single-digit type range. Core Industrial did quite well in the quarter with growth of 5% in local currency. Growth was good in all regions. We would expect continued solid growth in the third quarter in Core Industrial and then they will face particularly challenging comparisons in the fourth quarter. Finally, Food Retail was down 8% in the quarter. This was slightly worse than we expected. This business faces challenging market demand and the timing of customer project activity, which is further impacted in that we are managing it for profitability and not for sales growth. We expect market conditions to remain challenging and this business will be down meaningfully this year. Operator :  Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Tycho Peterson : Hey thanks. Maybe Olivier we'll start out with product inspection. Given what we've seen from some of your industrial peers, data points haven't been great. You're talking about a back half of the year recovery. Can you maybe just talk to your confidence in Product Inspection particularly getting better in the back half of the year? Olivier Filliol : Yes, let me comment. So, we had already good growth in Americas and Asia. And we expect solid growth in Q3 in these regions as well seeing also better spending from food manufacturers in these regions. It was really the Europe that was weak, but also against strong comparisons. For Europe, I feel Q3 to be relatively flat, but overall, I expect low-to-mid single-digits growth this year overall. This is below our long-term trend, and it's below what I expect also here if I look a couple of years forward. But I certainly also expect packaged food customers will return to growth. And hey, we are really, really well-positioned. We have leading positions here in multiple technologies. We see that customers combine more and more of these technologies, so-called Combitech is becoming more important. We have a unique position with our service network. So, I feel very, very good about this. And, of course, quality control in packaged food remains something very important. And just think about all the macro trends here that help us with the growing population in Asia and American markets, changing consumer trends. So, feel good, but I recognize that in the short term, we could have expected a little bit more. Tycho Peterson : And then I guess as a follow-up if we think about just your Industrial business more broadly can you talk to leverage you can pull if the macro continues to deteriorate? And then the guidance reduction seems mainly on the tariff front. Obviously, there's another 10% tariff coming our today, I assume that wasn't factored in, but how should we think about the impact of that? I know it's a little bit soon. Shawn Vadala : Hey Tycho, this is Shawn maybe I'll answer the second part of the question. In terms of the tariff that came out today, that one has very little impact on our business. As a reminder, more than 90% of our imports from China are already subject to a tariff. So, if we kind of like look at the last piece, it's probably on a gross basis, it's probably like $0.5 million a year on an annualized basis. Olivier Filliol : Back to the Core Industrial, I think we had actually really good growth across all the regions, another one in Q2, but actually for the whole first half. That reflects solid market conditions. But I want also to remind ourselves, as long as the economy is good enough, we feel actually -- we can actually drive replacement business we can go for market share gain. Our segment marketing here helps really very nicely because we can go after the industry segments that have good growth potential. I certainly also feel that the team is executing very nicely. We have very good momentum in the Spinnaker initiatives. So, I expect for 2019 year, mid-single-digit growth. Good growth for this business, although a little lower than what we had in the last two years mainly due to strong comparisons especially in Q4. We're going to have very strong comparisons coming up. But in terms of how we're performing, I feel good. And also as a reminder, the key industry segments that we serve here are a little bit less exposed to the economic cycles. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan from UBS. Your line is open. Dan Brennan : Thanks for taking the question. Olivier, back to China if you don't mind. One of your peers, Sartorius, obviously discussed slower lab formation in China. I'm just wondering it sounds like things are -- remain very robust for you there. But maybe can you discuss your lab business in China. And is there anything on that front that you're seeing? Olivier Filliol : Hey, very happy how the lab business has been performing in China in the last couple of quarters. And I had a deep dive into the lab business also last Friday when I met our market organization team. I feel we are executing very well, and I see really the team to go after the many opportunities that are around. Now, what's helping here of course is our lab business serves a broad range of end-user industries, a lot of different applications. And the price points of our solutions are at the low end. And so it's -- yes, we don't see a slowdown here. I think rather we have the comparisons topics in the terms that multiyear, we had really good growth. But absent of that, I feel really very, very good. And all these programs that we have in place, the Chinese team is executing very well on it. Dan Brennan : Got it. And then, -- thanks Olivier. And then maybe just one other just related to China. I know a few of the peers, and I figured that Tycho already addressed this, but a few of the peers have discussed how the government there seems to be trying to favor non-U. S. players in certain areas, and I'm not sure if it relates to any of your businesses. But is that something -- I know you've been in the country for 30 years, and all your managers are local, so you're kind of part of the local fabric there. But is that something that you're seeing at all? Or is that something that could pop up and impact you? Thank you. Olivier Filliol : Yeah. Valid question, but really -- we have -- we don't see any of that, and we talked about that. And one of the reason is what you just said, 13 years in China. We are viewed as a local company. We have such a big presence. We have local management team. We have been around for so long. The Mettler-Toledo brand is viewed as a local brand, local company. And then first also, because the big majority of the products that we sell are locally manufactured, and we -- the big remaining part of imported products come from Switzerland. And we have hardly any products coming from U.S. So, it's for us. It's a non-topic. And we -- again, we are viewed here in a very good way. So, yeah happy to report on that one. Dan Brennan : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Mike Ryskin : Hey. This is Mike on for Derik. Thanks for taking the question. I want to talk about the -- you called out another robust quarter for service in the quarter. Anything in particular that stands out? It seems like it's just been a very wrong -- very long runway there. So wondering how the dynamics there play into the guide. And then a follow-up was going to be on the pacing of 3Q to 4Q. You gave a lot of comments on your expectations for Food Retail and slowdown there, but even sort of if you backed that out, it looks like slightly more moderate expectations for the second half. I know part of that you talked to the general uncertainty in the macro and Industrial. Just curious if there's anything more specific on that or if it's just general caution. Olivier Filliol : Yeah. Okay. Let me take the first part, and then Shawn will general address the second part. So service, yes indeed, very good performance here that we have now performed many quarters. We have shared with you our strategies on service. We are very focused on executing on that one. It's something that we have global programs that we are executing across all the businesses. And really every country is involved. I see also pretty much every country with very solid service growth. And as a reminder, service is today about 23% of our sales. We had the 7% growth in Q2 as well as year-to-date. And I -- my expectation is that we're going to continue to grow above group average with service. We have these programs that have many more years to go. We are far from being saturated on that one. And there are also different markets where we are kind of at the beginning of the journey. I would include also China where we have solid growth in the last couple of quarters. But, when you look at the percentage of service in total, there's more room to go. And I would also add one additional associated business and that's the consumable business. That's also one that we are very focused on. I sometimes also look at service and consumables together, which is today about a third of our business. That one if combined, we had even better growth than service. So again, very happy how we performed on that, and services is very much also an execution topic. And you need to be on top of all the tactical aspects of that, and we do well on this. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Mike in terms of the other part of your question. We don't see any particular changes between Q3 and Q4 in terms of moderation in the business. But the one thing I would maybe highlight to you is that we do face a very difficult and challenging comparison in the fourth quarter of last year. Overall, we were up 8%. But in particular our core Industrial business was up 13% in Q4 of last year. And also Europe had a pretty strong number too. So that's maybe just a comparison topic. Mike Ryskin : Got it. Appreciate that. Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. Mr. Willoughby, your line is now open. You may now ask your question. Steve Willoughby : Can you hear me now? Shawn Vadala : Yeah, we can. Hey, Steve. Steve Willoughby : Okay. Sorry about that. Good morning. Shawn, I believe if I heard you correctly, you said that you're assuming FX and tariffs to be a negative 4% headwind now. And I had it down for -- you're saying that was negative 4.5% before and so I\u2019m just trying to figure out the moving pieces between your old guidance and your new guidance and how that all settles out? And then I just have one quick follow-up. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Hey, Steve it might be more of a rounding topic. I'm not seeing any particular changes in terms of like the tariffs versus what we talked about before. And if anything the FX is modestly a little bit worse than the last time we spoke. Steve Willoughby : Okay. And then just double checking here. Shawn, at the end of your prepared comments you'd mentioned that you're not assuming any change in market conditions. But then near the end of Olivier's commentsm he commented about how the markets are more challenging in the second half than the first half. So how are you -- what are you assuming in terms of the overlying and underlying end markets overall? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Hey we continue to feel very good about our execution. And what we're seeing in our business is, of course, it's always hard to look out beyond the quarter in front of us. Right now when we look at our bottoms-up submissions from our units, we feel good about our Q3 guidance. I mean especially if you exclude Food Retailing. So at this time, we don't feel like we need to build in any particular anticipated slowdown in the fourth quarter. But we also tried to be transparent with -- we fully acknowledge that there are uncertainties out there in terms of moderating economic statistics, the trade tariff dispute, which is obviously a very dynamic situation, which back to Tycho's question the direct impact on our business is very insignificant. But with this announcement what impact that may have on the global economy is probably a bigger question. Steve Willoughby : Sure. All right, thank you very much. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mr. Steve Beuchaw from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Steve Beuchaw : Hi thanks for the time here, and thanks for the questions as well. I'll ask two. One, I actually want to revisit a topic that was -- you touched on very briefly later but I wonder if you could give us a bit more detail on it. And that is you mentioned in your prepared remarks that in the event that the environment were to become more challenging there are steps that you can take to offset those headwinds in terms of -- I believe your implication was the earnings power of the company. So it would be helpful to know what those steps might be and how big an impact do you think you could have if the macro does get worse. My second question actually relates to food specifically. I appreciate that some of what's going on in food is in Europe but it sounds like in food the U.S. is also a little tougher. Be really helpful to understand thematically why it is that food has gotten so much tougher here relative to your expectations coming into the year. And what would you recommend that we keep an eye on as we try to diligence and keep an eye on what's going on with the pulse of that particular segment of the revenue stack? Thanks so much. Olivier Filliol : Let me start and then Shawn will add flavor to this. So in terms of how we can react, if the economy changes or the market changes. So foremost that I would highlight is this flexibility that we have how we can allocate resources. We have programs in place and we have a strong tool set that allows us to go after the pockets of growth in the markets that exist particularly around segment marketing. We can guide our sales force to visit a certain type of customers by segments. And we can drive this also to our leads generation program. And then we have shown also in the past that we are quite agile in shifting resources from one business to the other. So that's one avenue that we always leverage. And the second one is, of course, we implement a discipline in our cost structure. And this is not certainly something that we also have a good track record and we have this agility in the system. Yeah, I think that's the core that I would give. And, of course, we monitor the markets very cautiously and try to anticipate these things and it very much depends how severe it is. And the very high diversification that we have in our business helps us tremendously. As you can imagine we have a huge diversification by country and we have a huge diversification by business and the end-user industry and that comes to a big advantage to us. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Hey Steve I wouldn't add anything to what Olivier said, other than he implies that we also tailor our actions to the situation. And so we leverage these programs. We're constantly looking for productivity gains and we'll adapt if necessary. Olivier Filliol : The second part was the Food Retailing. Here as a reminder for -- we always said we run our Food Retailing business for profit and not for growth. It's -- we call it kind of noncore to us in these terms. I'm very committed to the business but it is a business that is below group average in terms of profitability. And so we have always managed that way including also in recent quarters where we have taken some steps to reduce the complexity in the business. We have taken some step also to take some cost out of the business. And so that's one effect that we have. But the second effect which is even bigger is that the whole Food Retailing market is lumpy and it's certainly also impacted by changes going on. And we see here this year a bigger downturn than we expected. And we are not trying to fight that, but rather actually adjust to it again in terms of measures that we are taking. I'm not particularly worried about it in terms of from a strategic standpoint and from my group -- or a business franchise. We are comfortable with that. But of course, it hurts our top line numbers. But this is more for Q3 and the year. As for next year, I'm not that pessimistic at all. Steve Beuchaw : Okay. Really appreciate that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Patrick Donnelly : Great. Thanks. Maybe one for Olivier. I know it's been asked a few different ways, but just on the Industrials the Core Industrial's outlook. Obviously, we've seen a bunch of mixed data points, particularly even in the space. Can you just talk through I guess your visibility into the back half confidence level maybe even by geography how you're feeling about that market overall? Olivier Filliol : Yes. If I look at our performance year-to-date, it has been really strong in all regions and not only here in Q2, but really for the whole first half. We feel that we have good enough market conditions in pretty much all the areas of the world. I feel strong execution from the team. And so for the whole 2019 I expect mid single-digit growth. The -- here also in Q3 where we have good visibility, I feel really good. But want to be cautious about Q4 just because of the comparisons. We are going to face a much stronger comparison here in Q4. That's the main reason. Then I would also highlight here what I said at previous occasions or in the context also of China for Industrial, we serve a very broad base of end-customer segments. We can apply segment marketing to also guide our sales force to the most promising applications in the industry even if some end-user industry would be hit more strongly by a tentative economic slowdown. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. And then maybe just one more just on the Americas. That continues to be a source of strength for you guys. Can you just parse out what segment has been particularly strong here? And then the outlook I think you said mid single-digits ex Food. Could there be upside there? And what would be the upside levers? Olivier Filliol : So indeed very happy with the performance year-to-date and certainly also in Q2. The lab continued to do particularly well. We had good strength in our product offering. The investment in field resources pays off very nicely. Industrial was also solid here. Core Industrial as well as Product Inspection was nicely up in the quarter. And I expect solid growth in this business also here in Q3. The one that was down was retail that was significantly down. And I expect also Q3 retail would be down again. But otherwise, yes feel very good about the execution. The team did very well. Our program -- sales and marketing programs show great fruits here in that region. Patrick Donnelly : Thanks. Olivier. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Baird. Your line is open. Richard Eastman : Yes, good afternoon. Could you just maybe Shawn, just give us a snapshot here of how pricing was in the second quarter? And then the cadence of price increases last year in 2018 if I -- I think I have this kind of noted properly, but it would seem that pricing might be a little bit more challenged year-over-year in the back half of the year. I mean, would be plus 1% to 2% in the back half of the year? Shawn Vadala : No... Richard Eastman : No? Shawn Vadala : Well I fully agree that pricing will be more difficult in the back half. And Rick that's also consistent with what we've been saying in our public commentary as well. And this is very much related to like you said the timing of the significant midyear price increases that we've put in place last year. I'd say it might be more like the 1.5% to 2% range in the back half of the year. And then maybe just to respond to the first part of your question I mean the program -- the execution around the world in the program is really fantastic at the moment. I feel very good about it. We're in the -- we probably did 2.5% or so in Q2 and I feel very good about how we're executing around the world. Richard Eastman : Okay. And then also Olivier within the Lab segment, you're kind of underexposed so to speak to a lot of the industrial process markets. But you do have some chemical exposure there maybe petrochem exposure, just any inflection or just change in trends within lab that you might associate to those more industrial-oriented markets. Olivier Filliol : No particular that I would highlight. I think here again this diversification plays a role. And even in -- within the chemical industry, there are so many subsegments from fine chemicals over to bulk chemicals and everything. We have different applications. On the prepared remarks, I highlighted for example the China dynamic where we are benefiting from a heightened focus on safety due to all these explosions that is triggering additional demands for us in the chemical industry particular for automated chemistry, partially also for material characterization and process analytics. So, while you might have one segment that is maybe a little bit down for example the chemical industry, that is also serving the automotive world, but then you have other segments that are up. All-in-all, we see the chemical industry still being good for us and I expect it to stay that way. Richard Eastman : Okay, okay. And just the last question for me. Is there any color you could shed -- you could provide on maybe the M&A pipeline? Is there a few things in there? Or is there anything active? How do you approach that these days just kind of keep refreshing it? But maybe you can give us some thoughts there. Olivier Filliol : Yes, yes. No problem Ric. Hey very consistent on that one. It's -- the way we look at it the way we approach it is very much from my strategic standpoint. We are focused on adjacencies that fit the strategy where we have important synergies. We don't need an additional leg. We certainly feel we are well diversified already. We have a very strong franchise. We don't need an additional leg. What we want is to acquire companies where we can add value and we add value for our customer solutions. And so the targets that we have are typically bolt-on opportunities in particular Lab Product Inspection area. We have -- if you look back, we have done a few acquisitions with Biotix and Troemner. And I would rather -- our target universe would be that kind of company. But it's not that we have something here just around the corner. I think these are very much dependent on the availability of such companies. It's -- and the -- what I also want to add, we are very disciplined when it comes to valuation. We always have and we will also continue to be. And yes, so I expect us in the couple of next years to continue to pursue that strategy. Yes, I think that fits well. And while we welcome M&A, it's not a must and it's not -- yes, we are very focused on this organic growth story. Richard Eastman : Okay, very good. Thank you. Operator :  And your next question comes from the line of Jason Rodgers from Great Lakes Review. Your line is open. Excuse me Mr. Jason Rodgers, your line is open. Jason Rodgers : Can you hear me now? Hello? Shawn Vadala : Yes, we can. Jason Rodgers : Okay. Thanks. China, I might have missed it, but did you give expectations for growth in the second half of the year? Shawn Vadala : Yes, we're looking at mid to high single-digit growth for the second half with good growth both in our Laboratory and Industrial businesses. Jason Rodgers : And then looking at Europe, the expected improvement that you're looking for in the second half, is that primarily from better results you're expecting in Product Inspection and the slightly easier comps? Or are you looking for some type of improvement economically in that region? Shawn Vadala : Yes. I think the best way to probably look at Europe is on a year-to-date basis. We have this Easter timing topic that we talked about in the first quarter. So, on a year-to-date basis, Europe is plus 4%. For the second half of the year, we're probably like low to mid-single digit, but it's going to have a little bit of this retail effect. If you exclude retail, we're probably more in the mid-single-digit range. So, we're not expecting any particular changes in the second half. We're kind of assuming that the economy continues to be good enough for people to stick to their replacement cycles. And as we look at the third quarter outlook from our organization, we kind of feel good about what we're seeing in the execution in our business. Jason Rodgers : And then moving on to the Field Turbo program is 200 -- is that still the figure for the planned additions for the year? And any issue in finding qualified candidates there? Olivier Filliol : Believe me I have more proposals that I can approve just because I think it's a good process to always be selective and go for the most attractive one. As a reminder, this is kind of a bottom-up top-down review process and we continue to have very good opportunities. But we also review the opportunities in the context of how we reach the economic -- the economy and in particular also when it comes to countries and industry segments or business lines. I feel good about the projects around Turbo that are already approved. And Shawn and I will be on our annual budget around here in the coming weeks and that will be certainly also a topic that we will further review. But I feel good about the program and we are still in the investment mode. Jason Rodgers : And then lastly, any change to the share repurchase expectations for the year? I think $745 million was the last number given. Shawn Vadala : No, changes at all. No. Jason Rodgers : All right. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your line is open. Brandon Couillard : Thanks. Good afternoon. Shawn, sorry if I missed this. But could you just help us with the gross margin bridge year-over-year between the components of currency pricing and the tariffs? Shawn Vadala : Yeah, sure Brandon. So as I mentioned before pricing was good in the quarter up about 2.5%. That had an effect of positive 100 basis points to the margin. Kind of offsetting that was the gross impact of tariffs, which was about 50 basis points. And then we had a variety of things kind of going both ways to make up the bridge. Brandon Couillard : Super. And then just an update on net interest and other expense for the year. Shawn Vadala : Sure. So interest expense for the year, we'll have Mary double check for you. $139 million for the year. Oh, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry. Looking at the wrong line\u2026 Mary Finnegan : 37. Shawn Vadala : 30 -- oh, sorry. $37 million. Yeah, $37 million for the year. And what was your other question? Brandon Couillard : I guess just net interest and other kind of all rolled up together. Shawn Vadala : Okay. And then other would be about $4.5 million. And that would be income by the way. Brandon Couillard : Okay. Super. Thank you. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Operator : As there are no further question at this time, you may continue speakers. Mary Finnegan : Thank you. Thanks Maria. Hey, thanks everyone for joining us this evening. As always, if you have any questions just let us know. Hey, we are in China, so probably the easiest way to get a hold of me or us is through email, but we're happy to get back to you. Take care everyone. Have a nice night. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Mike, and I will be your audio coordinator for today. . I would now like to turn our presentation over to your hostess for today's call, Ms. Mary Finnegan. Please proceed, ma'am. Mary Finnegan : Okay. Thanks, Mike. And good evening, everyone. I'm Mary Finnegan, I'm Treasurer and responsible for Investor Relations and happy to have you joining us this evening. I'm joined here today with Olivier Filliol, our CEO; and Shawn Vadala, our Chief Financial Officer. Olivier Filliol : Thank you, Mary, and good evening, everyone. I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Shawn will provide details on our financial results and guidance for the remainder of this year and for 2020. I will then have some additional comments and we will open the lines for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter are on Page 3 of the presentation. Sales growth in the quarter was very good in our laboratory and industrial product lines. Food Retail declined 15%, worse than we expected the last time we spoke. Total local currency sales growth in the quarter was approximately 4.5%. And excluding Food Retail, sales growth was 6%, which is in line with our expectation at the beginning of the quarter. Excluding Food Retail, growth in the Americas was excellent while growth in Europe and Asia/Rest of World was solid. We achieved very strong growth in operating margins and earnings per share despite meaningful headwinds due to adverse currency and tariff costs. Overall, we are very pleased with the strong results for the third quarter. As we look to the remainder of 2019 and our initial thoughts for 2020, we face somewhat of a balancing act. On the one hand, we remain confident in our growth initiatives and our ability to continue to execute and gain market share. These initiatives have strong momentum and are well ingrained in the organization and surface well in an environment in which it is more important than ever to focus on the best growth opportunities within our markets. Shawn Vadala : Okay. Thanks, Olivier. Sales were $753.9 million in the quarter, an increase of approximately 4.5% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, total sales increased 3% as currencies reduced sales growth by approximately 1.5% in the quarter. On Slide 4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales grew 7% in the Americas, 2% in Europe and 4% in Asia/Rest of World. Sales growth in Europe was particularly impacted by the decline in Food Retail. Absent Food Retail, Europe had sales growth of 4% in the quarter. Food Retail reduced sales growth in the Americas by 2% and 1% in Asia/Rest of World in the quarter. China had growth of 5%, pretty much in line with what we expected and was impacted by strong multiyear comparisons. The next slide shows year-to-date results. Local currency sales growth increased 5% in the Americas year-to-date, 3% in Europe and 7% in Asia/Rest of World.  On Slide 6, we outline local currency sales growth by product area. In the quarter, laboratory sales grew 7%, industrial increased 5% with core industrial up 7% while product inspection increased 3%. Food Retail declined 15% in the quarter. And excluding Food Retail, our overall growth in the quarter was 6%. The next slide shows year-to-date sales growth. Laboratory sales grew 8% in local currency, industrial grew 5% with core industrial up 7% and product inspection up 2%. Food Retailing declined 10% on a year-to-date basis. Overall, total sales were up 5% in local currency and 6% if we exclude Food Retailing on a year-to-date basis. Olivier Filliol : Thanks, Shawn. Let me start by providing some additional comments on our operating results. Our lab business continues to perform very well with 7% local currency sales growth in the quarter, which was against very strong growth in the prior year.  Most product lines did well, particularly if you look at it on a 2-year basis. Sales growth in the Americas and China was particularly strong. Our laboratory business is well positioned to continue to gain share. We spent a disproportionate amount in lab on investments in field resources, Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives and R&D investments. We expect market demands to remain favorable and expect solid growth in the fourth quarter and in 2020, although we face more challenging comparisons after several years of very strong growth. Operator : . Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JP Morgan. Ruizhi Qin : This is Julia on for Tycho. So maybe to start off, regarding your commentary on Europe, I think I heard you saying that industrial was particularly strong in that region. We're just comparing to some of the other commentary we've heard from your peers. So could just give us a little more color on that? Olivier Filliol : Yes. Indeed, we were very happy about the performance. I think it's a reflection of an economy that is good enough for us, but then a very strong execution by the team in terms of the Spinnaker initiatives, in terms of focusing on the right end-user segments. And we had also some good product launches that helped us. So indeed, really a good performance.  What I, however, would also add here, the part of the economy that is particularly weak in Europe is not necessarily one that we have a focus on, so thinking of machinery, automobile industry and so on. These are not the most important industry segments for us. Ruizhi Qin : Got it. And -- sorry, go ahead. Shawn Vadala : Yes. It's fine, Julia. Ruizhi Qin : Okay. And then regarding Food and Retail, I'm just wondering what drove the negative surprise in the quarter. And how has your visibility into that business line has changed? Because I think you previously said that you typically have pretty good visibility a quarter ahead. So just wondering, are there any changing dynamics there that you'd like to call out?  And then as we look at your 2020 guidance, obviously, for lab and industrial, you're still having pretty strong momentum there. So with the 4% constant currency growth, is that all sort of due to food weakness that you're expecting for next year? And what would be the guidance excluding food? Olivier Filliol : So I will take the first part and then Shawn covers the second part of the question. So back to retail and visibility, indeed, we have a reasonable visibility within the quarter. But our visibility is supported by good diversification across regions and across businesses. And so I think in retail, we certainly have a reasonable visibility to very large projects, but then there is an underlying business that we can't properly predict the whole quarter.  What plays also in the weakness of retail is that the big projects did not come in as expected. And so we experienced that weakness in particular also from that end. We expect, as we did talk on the prepared remarks, retail to continue to be a challenge here for another 1, 2 quarters. It's also because we are managing this business too with profitability and not top line. And yes, I -- it's not a fundamental shift, but we do recognize that this market in food retailing is a challenging market right now. We expect that the latter part of next year will look better for us. Shawn Vadala : Yes. In terms of the second part of your question, Julia, if I look at 2020 for retail, for the full year, we probably imagine modest growth of low single digit. But during the first half of the year, we wouldn't be surprised if we see it down slightly during Q1 and Q2, but down in kind of like low-single-digit kind of a range. If we look at the full year, excluding Food Retail, not as much of an impact as we would have seen in 2019, but modestly better than the 4%.  And if I just kind of like walk down the divisions or the business areas, lab, we're probably looking at lab in the mid-single-digit range next year. I mean keeping in mind, we have very good momentum in that business, feeling very good about the execution, but just acknowledging we're coming off of several years of very strong growth there. On the core industrial side, probably looking at more low single digit next year. We've been growing very fast in that business since the fourth quarter of last year. As a reminder, the core industrial business grew 13% in Q4 of last year, and we've been at very strong growth levels in the high-single-digit range for most of this year.  And then if we look at product inspection, probably more in the low- to mid-single-digit range next year. This is acknowledged below our longer-term expectations. We still feel very good about the business from a long-term perspective, given our many competitive advantages, but just acknowledging some softness in the packaged food segment. Ruizhi Qin : Got it. That's very helpful. And then lastly from me regarding China. I think last quarter, you had double-digit lab growth in China and a high-single-digit for industrial. It seems like it has moderated a little bit. So just wondering if there are any comp dynamics that you'd like to call out and how should we think about your outlook for China in the near term? Have there been any changes? Olivier Filliol : So indeed, there is a comp topic. We had here in China many quarters of very good results, and that starts now to play in. Absent of that, we feel still very good about our business in China. We have an excellent leadership position there. We have, in average, probably a 25% market share, which is about similar to what we have in the group. We have the Spinnaker programs that are executed really particularly also well in China. And we are benefiting from a good diversification of the end-user markets that we serve.  So these are all very strong assets that we bring here, and I feel that our end-user industries that we are focused on are actually still going well in China. So all in all, good, but then we have these comparison topics and, of course, we also see that there are parts of the Chinese markets that are weaker. We are just less exposed, but I'm not pretending that we are totally immune to that one. Operator : Your next action comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays. Jack Meehan : Just back on the core industrial business, that's kind -- despite some of the macro commentary, seemed to continue to do well. I was wondering if -- you did mention some discrete projects, which may help the quarter, what would the growth have been like otherwise? And then, Shawn, as we're thinking about 2020, is there any phasing within that low-single-digit outlook you talked about for 2020 as you look at the year for core industrial? Shawn Vadala : Yes. Jack, I mean, we called out a little bit some project activity in our T&L business. We actually see excellent momentum in that business kind of continuing for the medium term. There are some very interesting things going on in that business for us. So I wouldn't view it as necessarily a onetime topic for next year. But if we exclude that, I don't have that number, but it -- I don't think the number is also that significant on the overall division.  What's been really interesting to us is that the growth in industrial has been extremely broad-based geographically and in a lot of our product categories as well. And I just feel like the -- this focus on the more attractive segments of the market really has gained momentum over the last year. And as I mentioned in my previous comments with Julia, I mean, we grew 13% in core industrial in Q4 of last year and we've really seen strong execution throughout this year.  As I look to 2020, I haven't thought too much about pacing, but I can imagine Q1 might be a little bit lower than the other quarters, could be flat, more flattish to modest growth just given that we have a very difficult comparison in the previous year, but frankly, haven't put a lot of thought into that one and we don't have very good visibility going out that far at this moment in time but, of course, we'll give you an update the next time we talk. Jack Meehan : Yes. That's fair. And then on the gross margin, so up 60 basis points year-over-year. I think that's the best progression you've had in a while. Can you walk us through some of the moving parts with FX, tariffs and pricing, just what the drivers of that were? Shawn Vadala : Yes. Sure. Again, no, very pleased with the margin expansion in the quarter, also came in line with what we had expected at least. Price realization did well. It was about 2.5%. Again, that was probably a little bit better than what I was thinking when -- the last time we would have spoken. That would have had a benefit of about 100, 110 basis points on the margin. Kind of offsetting that was the gross impact of the tariffs of 50 basis points. And so I think those are really the 2 items that -- to call out. There was certainly a lot of things offsetting each other that were smaller in nature going either way, but nothing worth really mentioning. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan from UBS. Daniel Brennan : Olivier, just back to geographies or, Shawn, just for a moment. Just I don't think you mentioned this, but just how do we think about China and Europe, specifically, as you look at the fourth quarter in 2020? I think it may have been asked earlier, but I'm just kind of -- think about, yes, the comps are a little bit easier for 2020, but just trying to get a flavor for how you're kind of modeling it. Shawn Vadala : Yes. Right now, -- yes. Thanks, Dan. So right now, for Q4, we're looking at probably more mid- to high-single-digit growth. But as we look to 2020, right now, we're assuming mid-single-digit growth. I would imagine the lab business will do better, maybe high single digit but probably a more cautious view on the industrial business, not that we're particularly seeing anything in our business, but just given the overall environment there that's kind of how we're thinking about it right now. Like every year with China, there's always upsides and downsides and things can change quickly. Daniel Brennan : Got it. And then I'm sorry, for Europe, Shawn, I don't know if you gave those numbers for 2020, just wondering how you think about it. Shawn Vadala : For Europe, right now, we're thinking probably low single digit in Europe, and then just to be clear, for Americas, mid-single digit. Daniel Brennan : Got it. And then, Olivier, I know you talked about the global economy and kind of where we're at. You guys are kind of powering through with the exception of Food Retail. But just kind of your sense for 2020, I mean the guide of 4%. Is it there anything you see? Are there -- I mean like what indicators do you watch because you've been kind of highlighting the risks for about 4 or 5 quarters and yet, with exception of Food Retail, the business has held in well. So I'm just wondering about -- it seems like you're warning that something may come, but maybe it won't come. So just can you give us a flavor for what are some of the indicators you're watching? Olivier Filliol : All the indicators that we have internal still look favorable. I think we commented before, we have in retail and in the packaged food area some end markets that are more challenging. But absent of that, all our KPIs that we have internally, leads growth, all that stuff looks favorable. We are very pleased about the team being focused on execution. We see good results of our sales and marketing programs. So that's unchanged. And we feel good.  I think the overall economy, we look at PMI metrics, we look at economics, and we want to take that in our consideration. And in that sense, we continue to talk about also clouds, economic clouds. I think that was one word that I used a year ago. And I would still apply it here. But it's not that we see something particularly worrying or that the clouds get really dark here. Yes, in that sense, not anything that is so different to what we experienced the last few quarters. And we always said, the economy needs to be good enough for us to grow, and we feel the economy is good enough. Daniel Brennan : And then maybe one final just on Food Retail. I know it's a small part of the business, but is it -- so in 2020, it gets better from a comp basis. And then as you look out, are there fundamental issues or kind of benefits that will improve do you feel like with the supermarket industry or the other parts of the industry you're serving just given the pressure from the Internet? Olivier Filliol : I think the challenges will remain, but we will have adjusted to that. The comparisons will become easier, of course. But we have been also proactive in restructuring parts of this business, and we will have the benefit of that behind us. That's also one of the reasons why we feel like the second part of next year will be better. And that should position us well also for the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Olivier, just maybe one on the 20 comments you're making. If I understand it correctly, what you're saying is we want to be cautious but you haven't seen any deceleration in either industrial or food versus what you're seeing right now. This is more of a cautious tone you're just taking, but from an actual trend that you're seeing so far, you haven't seen any deceleration. Is that a fair comment? Olivier Filliol : Yes. That's a fair comment. And in contrary, I would say, what we are seeing year-to-date in the business, absent of product inspection and food retailing, we are very pleased that we have not seen a slowdown in the momentum from -- so it's yes. And this is true for all the relevant KPIs. So not just kind of the reported sales we -- growth activity, leads generation and all that stuff. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful. And then maybe one on the assumptions around '20. It looks like just based on at the EPS, maybe there's some moderation in margin expansion for next year, not sure if this is FX or what kind of FX you're assuming. Maybe any comments on incremental margins next year? Shawn Vadala : No. I mean, I think when I look at our guidance for margins, I feel actually pretty good. From an operating profit margin perspective, there might be a little bit of currency noise there. But excluding currency, we're looking at operating margin expansion of about 90 basis points, which is closer to the higher end of our typical guidance of 70 to 100 basis points. When I look at the incremental margins, I mean, we're looking at 40 -- north of 40%. And when I look at the gross profit margin level, it probably is in the 40% to 50% kind of a range. So overall, yes, we feel pretty good about our margin expansion story. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Wolfe Research. Stephen Beuchaw : I wanted to ask just one housekeeping question for Shawn, and then a couple on customer dynamics for either Shawn or Olivier. Shawn, I wonder if you could just speak to the tariffs impact that you have embedded in the guidance for 2020. Just operationally, how and where is that manifesting? And then I have a couple on customer dynamics. Shawn Vadala : Yes. Sure. Thanks, Steve. So for tariffs right now, the direct impact of the tariff is about a 0.5% headwind to EPS next year. And just to maybe proactively address the currency it's probably -- well, close to a 1% headwind next year as well, too. Stephen Beuchaw : Sorry, but the question was with tariffs, is it -- what is it about the tariffs? Is it about redomiciling something operationally? Or is it a direct -- more direct impact? Olivier Filliol : No. No. It's a direct impact. It's the costs that we incur because we import products out of China. To recall, a significant part of our production is based in China and then we export. And when they arrive in U.S., we have tariffs that apply to that. And the -- always the assumptions that we use on these calls is what has been communicated, and we are not taking any speculation of what might change or not. Shawn Vadala : Yes. Just to be clear, we're assuming the 25% rate on the enacted tariff stays in place. Stephen Beuchaw : Okay. Perfect. So then two on customer dynamics, and then I'll jump back in queue. One is on pharma. You guys have pretty substantial exposure to pharma as a customer base. Can you talk about what you've seen in terms of demand trends there and what the assumption is for 2020?  And then on China, I appreciate the comments about the operating environment. Certainly, they're making a lot of sense. I just want to make sure that in your narrative when you are not calling out any more challenging tender dynamics or local competition or local preference, any of those items, just to make sure you're indicating that you're not seeing any of that. Olivier Filliol : Yes, thanks. Let's start with life science or pharma. Actually, why I say life science, that's the way we look at our business. We don't particular narrow it down just to be pharma. Also, our life science business has big pharma, CROs. We include also biotech companies. So it's relatively broad-based. This is about 30% of our revenue. And it has been a market that is doing well for us. We have very good competitive positions. We have -- this is an end use these competitive differentiations that we have, and there are also additional beneficial things happening like data integrity, which is becoming more important also. So it is a very good end-user industry, going well for us globally. And what's important to us, at the end of the day, it's a market that is still nicely diversified because we have not just big pharma; it's small and big and it's across geographies. And historically, what we have seen is there were times when big pharma was restructuring in the West, but then you saw a lot of CROs coming up in the East. And we have benefit from that and I -- looking forward, I see that underlying diversification, that is also beneficial for us, but we certainly count strongly on life science industry. We continue to invest in it. And it's certainly one of the markets that we expect us to continue to win market share. The second question, Shawn, do you want to take that one or... Shawn Vadala : Yes. I think the second question was in China, any local preference. I think the short answer is we're not experiencing that like some of the other peer-group companies are. In China, we're very much viewed as a local company. We've been there for over 30 years. We employ a lot of people. We make a lot of products there, very strong reputation in the market. If anything, we would be probably secondly viewed as a Swiss company in China as opposed to an American company. Olivier Filliol : And so bottom line, we don't have any disadvantage here or we don't see any problems coming up or so. I think contrary, I would say we have a trend in the Chinese market where quality really matters and people are, in that sense, willing to pay premiums also for Western brands, so we feel good about that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Derik De Bruin : So just a question, just sort of thinking about some of the past brands when we saw you give relatively conservative balance and then sort of like beat that. Is -- when we look for next year and you look into it, was there any sort of like pockets of where people didn't buy in lab and industrial because they were worried about tariffs or worried about trade? I'm just basically saying is like do you think there's some catch-up spending to be done in 2020? Is there -- thinking about what happened back in the 2016, '17 time frame when you had the catch-up trading, what the -- when your China industrial business was down so much, just wondering if that dynamic will repeat for next year. Olivier Filliol : No. I don't -- I think we referred that in the past as pent-up demand. I don't see that. And I see it -- and I say so because I don't see that we are experiencing a particular  declining here or -- we are expecting that the economy remains about the same as it is now. And I used the term also before \"good enough.\" So the good enough actually implies that there isn't customers holding back and then we would expect a pent-up the following year.  And in terms of our guidance being conservative or so, I would say we did it in the same -- similar way as last year. Of course, to our guidance there are upsides and downsides, but I don't feel that we are more conservative or more bullish than last year. Derik De Bruin : Great. That's helpful. And then just -- I mean, I realize that you're guiding based upon what the current political situation looks like. But if the tariff situation between the U.S. and China goes away, does that -- or normalizes, does that impact your ability in any way at all to sort of like how you would get pricing for next year, i.e., would you not get as much pricing because you took some this year? Olivier Filliol : So if tariffs would go away, I would see an upside in our EPS and our margins. I feel like we kind of keep the current pricing power that we have. There are a few things that would -- we would reverse. But in general, there is a significant upside to EPS if the tariffs would really go away and particularly, because I would think that currencies might also change everyone there. But what I would not automatically assume is that the top line would improve because of that. Again, I don't feel we lost business because of the trade war. Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Stephen Willoughby : A couple for you. First, I guess, Shawn, just a few housekeeping items. I apologize if you did mention it, but have you -- did you provide specific operating margin, tax rate and share count guidance for next year? Shawn Vadala : I think so. But I don't mind going over it again. In terms of operating margin, we're looking at margin expansion excluding currency of 90 basis points. In terms of tax rate, we're assuming we maintain our rate of 20%. And in terms of weighted average shares, we're estimating just over $24 million -- I mean 24 million shares. Stephen Willoughby : Yes. And then just a follow-up question maybe for Olivier. The product inspection business, if we take a little bit longer-term view, going back a few years, it was a business that consistently grew in the double-digit range. And it's been closer to flattish or low-single-digit growth over the last 2 years. I understand that some of these customers are under financial pressures, but just wondering what your view is on kind of the longer-term potential growth in this business as I wasn't sure how much of the sales from customers are discretionary versus more kind of driven by regulation. Olivier Filliol : Just to clarify, we might have had quarters with double-digit growth, but we are more high single digit. And the high single digit, sometimes in quarters, we can have a very big project and therefore, it can be the double digit. But medium term, long term, I expect us to have this mid- to high-single-digit growth in product inspection. It is driven because we have really an exceptional strong market position. We are the only one that will -- or have a lead in all the core technologies. So including check weighing methods, x-ray and vision inspection. We have a fantastic service network that customers really value. And we are really a partner to global accounts to -- for global rollouts. And these global rollouts are driven by requirements to protect the brand.  It is regulation-driven but indirectly. In a sense, the regulation specifies how recalls need to take place. And that incurs a lot of cost and, again, also damages to brands when you need to do recalls. But it's up the different accounts to decide how they protect themselves. And we certainly feel that installing our instruments at the end of a packaging line is the best insurance and allows to really protect the interests of the company and provide the best quality to customers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney. Paul Knight : Olivier, could you talk about the particular products that you are driving this accelerating growth in lab products as 2020 rolls out? Olivier Filliol : I wouldn't narrow it down to any particular product. We talked about this on past calls, that we have the most modern product portfolio in lab that we have ever had, but this across all the product lines. So this is true for pipette, this is true for analytical chemistry, this is true for our automated chemistry, it's also true for our lab balances. So it's the whole portfolio.  It's not things that I would say only benefits us in the last 2 quarters. This is an ongoing thing. We benefited last year and we're certainly going to benefit next year. In our business, as an individual, new product doesn't really move the needle. It's the sum of things and having this technology leadership that allows us to win new customers and also allows us to raise prices, gives us this pricing power. Paul Knight : And then what is pricing power a year? Is it 100 bps, 200 bps, low single digits? Shawn Vadala : Yes. Going forward -- I mean, Paul, of course, this year, we did very well. We're 2.5% year-to-date. We've been north of 2% in the last couple of years. As we kind of guide, we typically think about 150 bps. As I look at next year, 150 to 200 basis points is probably a reasonable range. Paul Knight : Okay. And then lastly, you had mentioned earlier that consumables were 10%. How much is the software content now and service content of Mettler-Toledo? Olivier Filliol : So service is 23%. And then we have -- it's 10% from consumables, that's why we say we have about a 1/3, which is really recurring. And both have been growing very nicely this year, about the 7% range. Paul Knight : Okay. Congratulations. Olivier Filliol : Thanks. Shawn Vadala : Thanks. Operator : . Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Brandon Couillard : Olivier, just curious if you could share an update on Stern Drive with us and perhaps quantify the net savings from that program in '19 and the incremental opportunities you see in '20. Olivier Filliol : Yes. So it has really good momentum. Happy to -- that you raise the question because yes, it's one of the contributors to our margin expansion. We have really all the producing organizations across the world engaged in this. We really see benefits in terms of productivity on the shop floor. We see benefits in material costs. We have very good new additional initiatives of sub-projects also for next year. You might recall at an earlier call, we mentioned that we have about 300 sub-projects on the Stern Drive, and we have a similar number of projects also going into next year.  In terms of results this year, we're very happy about this and so, in that sense, achieving our target. And I expect about the same benefit over next year from the program. And to highlight, we look at Stern Drive in a similar way as to Spinnaker. It's a journey, i.e., I expect this to be incremental every year, and I wouldn't be surprised if in 10 years, we are still going to talk about Stern Drive on this call. Brandon Couillard : Very good. And then, Shawn, could you give us the CapEx number for '20? Shawn Vadala : The CapEx number for '20, just 1 second, Brandon. Just under $110 million. Operator : That was our last question. At this time, I will now turn the call back over to the presenters. Mary Finnegan : Thanks, Mike, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this evening. As always, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Have a good evening, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

My name is Shantel, and I will be your audio coordinator for today.  Please be advised, that today\u2019s conference is being recorded.  I would now like to turn our presentation over to your hostess for today\u2019s call, Ms. Mary Finnegan. Please proceed, ma\u2019am. Mary Finnegan : Thank you and good evening, everyone. I\u2019m Mary Finnegan, and responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo and happy that you are joining us. I\u2019m joined here today with Olivier Filliol, our CEO; and Shawn Vadala, our Chief Financial Officer. Olivier Filliol : Thank you, Mary, and good evening, everyone. I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Shawn will provide details on our financial results and updated guidance for 2020. I will then have some additional comments and we will open the line for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter are on Page 3 of the presentation. Sales growth in the quarter came in better than expected and was quite good given the excellent 8% growth in the prior year quarter. Total local currency sales growth in the quarter was 4%, growth in the Americas and China was strong. We again face meaningful headwinds in the quarter due to adverse currency and the impact of tariffs. With the benefit of our productivity and margin initiatives, we were able to overcome these challenges and delivered strong growth in operating margins and EPS growth. For the full year 2019, we exceeded $3 billion in sales and achieved 5% growth in local currency. Food Retail was down significantly in 2019, excluding this business, we have 6% growth in local currency sales. We achieved a strong improvement in operating margins and a 12% increase in adjusted earnings per share. Given the material headwinds we faced in 2019, we are quite pleased with this performance. One final comment on full year 2019, we generated more than $530 million in free cash flow, a very strong level. Shawn Vadala : Thanks, Olivier. Sales were $844 million in the quarter, an increase of 4% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, total sales increased 3%, as currencies reduced sales growth by approximately 1% in the quarter. On Slide number 4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales grew 6% in the Americas, 1% in Europe and 5% in Asia/Rest of World. China had growth of 8% a little bit better than what we expected the last time we spoke. The next slide shows year-to-date results. Local currency sales for the year grew 5% and as Olivier mentioned, excluding Food Retail, local currency sales growth was 6% in 2019. By region for the year sales increased 6% in the Americas, 3% in Europe and 6% in Asia/Rest of World. On Slide number 6 we outlined local currency sales growth by product area. For the fourth quarter laboratory sales grew 6%, industrial increased 2% with core industrial up 4%, while product inspection was flat. Food Retail declined 2% in the quarter. Olivier Filliol : Thank you, Shawn. Let me start by providing some additional comments on our operating results. Our lab business continues to perform very well with 6% local currency sales growth in the quarter. Most products lines did well, particularly if you look at it on a two-year basis. Sales growth in the Americas and China was particularly strong. Our laboratory business is well positioned to continue to gain share and we\u2019re pleased with our robust product portfolio. We expect market demands to remain favorable, especially in pharma life sciences. We also sell our lab instruments into other end markets and see some pockets of weakness in certain end market. Overall, we expect good growth in our laboratory business in 2020, although we face more challenging comparisons after several years of very strong growth.  In terms of our industrial business, product inspection was flat in the quarter, in line with our expectations. We continue to believe this business will grow low-to-mid single-digit in 2020. As we discussed last quarter, we have not yet seen the large food manufacturers return to full investment mode, particularly with respect to global rollouts. We believe this is a matter of timing and are well positioned to capture growth once these food companies return to investment mode. Core industrial did great in the fourth quarter, increasing 4% against 13% growth in the prior year. This was better than we had expected and we are very pleased with the performance. We\u2019re executing well in core industrial as this business continues to gain traction with a Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives. Core industrial is also benefiting from innovation. Underlying market demand is good enough and we can capture growth given the diversity of our products, customers, end markets and geographies. Finally, Food Retail was down 2% in the quarter, pretty much on target with what we had expected. However, our outlook for this business has deteriorated since the last time we spoke. We expect it to be down double digits in the first quarter and be down for the year. Underlying market demand is weak and although we have easy comparisons, we don\u2019t expect meaningful improvement until later \u2013 in the later part of the year. We had assumed last time we spoke that given the lower level of project activity in 2019 we would have some recovery in 2020. Based on our outlook for Q1, we don\u2019t see this happening until later in the year. As a reminder, we are managing this business for profitability, which also makes forecast in sales a bit challenging. We have enacted cost reduction actions over the last year in light of the challenging conditions. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. I will start with Europe, which was up low single-digit. Lab had growth, while core industrial and product inspection were down against very strong growth in the prior period. We continue to think this business will be up low single-digit for the year. We would expect a modest decline in the first quarter, principally, due to significant decline in Food Retail as well as the 9% growth in Q1 2019. Americas continues to do very well with 6% growth in the quarter. Lab and core industrial had strong growth. We expect market conditions to remain favorable and expect solid growth in 2020. But this region will be impacted by prior year comparisons. Finally, Asia/Rest of World had solid growth with most business lines doing well except for Food Retail. China had strong growth in the quarter with double digit lab growth and high-single-digit industrial growth. Excluding the temporary impact of the coronavirus, our outlook for this region remains favorable, but they will continue to face strong multi-year comparisons. I want to point out that in Q1 last year China grew 13%, the strongest quarter of the year. Due to this tough comparisons and the impact of the virus we discussed earlier, we now expect Q1 sales in China to be down mid-to-high single-digit. Our full year sales growth in China remains unchanged from our previous level of growth in the mid-single-digit range for the full year, principally, due to strong multi-year comparisons and the slightly more challenging industrial environment. One final comment on the business. Service and consumables together represent about one-third of our sales growth and both grew 7% in 2019, very happy with this strong accomplishment. That concludes my comments on the different pieces of the business. We often speak to you about how we view our Spinnaker sales and marketing programs as key differentiators in the market. Another important differentiator is the strength and breadth of our product offerings. Let me give you some additional insights, starting with our laboratory offering. We can provide more than 40% of the instruments that the scientists or chemists uses daily in a typical analytical lab. These instruments range from balances and pipettes to analytical instruments such as pH Meters, Titrators and UV Vis. And finally to our automated chemistry solutions, which can help in drug process development. We compete against different players across these product categories. No one has the breadth and the leadership of bench instruments than we do. Our LabX software can link these instruments and provide connectivity to our LIMS or Laboratory Information Management System. This is a very powerful competitive advantage as none of our direct competitors has anything close to this capability. More important than the number of instruments, we can provide is, the value of these instruments provides to our customers. Across the portfolio of instruments, we focus on three important value dimensions. First is automation. Our instrument provides greater efficiency, highest sample throughput, and less errors in daily laboratory tasks and analysis. Second is information. Our instruments can perform complex analytics often with one-click of a button and also can improve the integrity and traceability of the data. This is especially critical in regulated environments. The final dimension is measurement quality. We provide services such as calibration and good measurement practices to support the quality of our customer processes. We refer to the value outlined in these dimensions as the power of the bench. Our focus is to leverage and response to global trends that our customers face, such as demand for greater productivity and digitalization and data management needs. Our lab solutions ensure compliance and data integrity and provide real advantages in terms of automation and productivity. We have additional product launches and R&D developments in 2020 that will continue to win forth the strength of these value dimensions. Likewise, on the industrial side, our product offering is very strong and we continue to distance ourselves from competition with the breadth of the offering. Our industrial customers are constantly striving to improve the productivity and streamline data management. We are launching several highly innovative products and applications that help with these challenges. For example, InVision is our breakthrough innovation for manual workplaces, where weighing, counting and packaging tasks have high error potential. InVision uses machine learning and combined weighing technology and camera recognition for fail-safe parts identification in milliseconds. Guided working steps, automatic data capture and process verification significantly increases production, quality and worker efficiency. The instrument directly connects to the customer\u2019s production and ERP systems, providing full data visibility and visual proof of order fulfillment. We expect customers could achieve productivity improvements of up to 30% with this evolutionary product. This is just one example of many new product developments underway, where the combination multiple sensor technology, the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence enables us to develop breakthrough innovation with unique new value proposition. Furthermore, by utilizing the R&D expertise throughout the world, we can develop these products at very short time period. These are just a few examples of the strength of our R&D innovation that continues to be an important component of our market share gains. That concludes our prepared comments. We\u2019re very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter and full year 2019. While uncertainty exists in the global economy, we believe we are well positioned to gain share and deliver good earnings growth and solid cash flow generation in 2020. Now I want to ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator :  Your first question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brandon Couillard : Hey, thanks and good afternoon. Olivier or Shawn, as we sort of think about China and the virus impact on the first quarter, which segments would be more impacted than others, is lab versus industrial? Would you expect to recoup most of that in 2Q or more over the balance of the year? And would you remind us how much of the China manufacturing is for the export market versus domestic consumption? Olivier Filliol : Okay. So referring to the segments with the biggest impact, first, I want to start the fact that offices are closed here for additional days it has an impact across the business. The second impact that I want to highlight is the restrictions of the field sales force in terms of traveling. And again, that\u2019s quite broad-based. On that latter part, however, we can take a mitigation measures. We are, for example, very active already this week in rolling out a broad training program to our own sales force as well as our indirect channel partners to be more effective in telesales. In the past, we did telesales with a focused team. Now we want to make sure also fail-safe people are experts in telesales and leveraging that. Now this is kind of the short term impact. Now what \u2013 when we think about segments, we need to think also the demand side that will be impacted here in Q1 and as an example, the one that we expect to be most impacted is the retail business. The retail business is impacted because the Chinese consumers behave differently at this stage. And that we will feel in a quite strong way. The lab business, I would expect to be actually much less impacted. There might be even some upside later in the year. Now in terms of how fast this comes back, we do expect a pent-up demand. We do also expect that from a Chinese government standpoint there might be some stimulus that will help. I would hope that we see already some of that in Q2. But certainly expect that it\u2019s going to take Q3 and Q4 to fully recover, so certainly not the full recover in Q2, absolutely not. And then in terms of the supply chain, you asking how much of the products we produce in China and then export to the West, I would first say, we have a part where we produce in China, but of course, we also source components and that\u2019s quite significant. But on the good news is, we are very close on this whole supply chain impact. Our local Chinese team has done a fantastic job in assessing the impact and taking mitigation factors. I have also my global supply chain team very actively on that one. We have, for example, contacted all our suppliers and all our Chinese suppliers. So far, it has given us green lights. We feel comfortable. We have also taken mitigation factors. At this stage, we do not expect any significant impact on our global supply chain. I do not expect any significant delivery issues coming out of that. But this is also assuming that operations will come back on February 10. And if there are not, I still feel mitigation factors will help. But of course, it called loss for weeks. Brandon Couillard : Thanks. And just one more, the core industrial business is pretty remarkable given the tough comp in the fourth quarter. Do you sort of elaborate on some of the drivers there? If there was any perhaps fourth quarter budget plus dynamic and maybe speak to some of the innovation and maybe new products that might be supporting the strength? Thanks. Olivier Filliol : So indeed very happy about the results, did also exceed expectations. I really feel this is a reflection of very good execution by the teams around the world. Because the end user markets that we serve with core industrial were not particularly strong as mentioned that we even saw some pockets of weaknesses. Nevertheless, we did here very well. I feel the core industrial benefits from things that we shared with you at previous occasions in the context of Spinnaker sales force guidance for example, helps really very nicely in the core industrial, because it helps us to guide the sales people to the industry segments that are the most relevant and most interesting for us. We had, for example, particular focus on life science industry and pharma industry for core industrial. That helped. So on the one hand, this whole how the go-to-market dynamic and the marketing then was strong and then we had a good product portfolio. There were many smaller innovations, but all together they make a difference. We had hardware products, but we had also software products that we had into use the last two years that benefited. At the previous occasions, I had shared that with you, for example, a new portfolio for the floor scales, but also in the area of counting scales and so on, so good product. On the prepared remarks earlier, I just highlighted the product InVision that we definitely also feel is prove of strong leadership in innovation. Now none of these products will be important enough to really make a difference to the top line, the group sales. But in aggregation together they make a difference and they sometimes help us to open new doors and sell significant solutions to key accounts. Brandon Couillard : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Derik De Bruin : Great. Thanks for putting me early, before all the questions get asked. Just quick one. You mentioned some softness in the lab business, some type of softness. Could you elaborate on that one? I would assume some of that could be your thermal analysis portfolio? Olivier Filliol : Let me quickly jump in. We\u2019re talking about certain end markets that have weaknesses, not, okay. So it\u2019s really end markets. And when I talk about end markets, and this wasn\u2019t just slapped, this is kind of overall, if you think one-third of our revenue roughly comes from pharma life science and the other two-thirds come from many different industries. And we have industry \u2013 end user industry like metal, plastic, electronics and even some chemical industry that wasn\u2019t particularly strong. And it depends a little bit by region. But for example, in Europe you have the automotive industry that is really weak. Now automotive itself is not an important segment to us, but there are suppliers to the automotive industry that are relevant for us, plastic, but also again components at all. And so we had these end user markets. Now when you will say, hey, that\u2019s more relevant for industrial. No, actually for lab too, because we have a lot of instruments that go in quality labs. And so we saw, so for example, thermal analysis would go and be relevant there also weighing and so on. Even that, when you look at the whole product category for us, we did well, but when we analyze it by end user segments, we saw some pockets of weakness. And that was what I tried to highlight, kind of also say trying to say, hey, we have here an economic environment that is good enough for us. But that doesn\u2019t mean that every end user segment is as strong as life science. Derik De Bruin : Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. And I guess just sort of looking at those pockets or just looking about those things that there\u2019s, I mean, do you think there\u2019s \u2013 when those segments do recover, is there pent-up demand in those segments? I mean, given that they\u2019re sort of like outside in the life sciences area? Olivier Filliol : Derik, I think for these segments we are rather late cycle and in that sense, I think right now, we are in that situation. We saw it in Q4. We will also see it in Q1. But I think actually there is upside on that one. I rather think we see it also in certain PMI statistic and so on that these segments should actually start to recover. But let\u2019s be also cautious. The overall global economy is fragile. Derik De Bruin : Yes. Great. And then just one follow-up. Obviously, tariffs had been a headwind for you and we\u2019ve got this trade deal on the horizon between the U.S. and China. Can you sort of talk about your expectations sort of for the trade outcomes and sort of like how that could impact it if things get resolved? Olivier Filliol : So the deal that took place doesn\u2019t have a direct benefit to us. So the tariffs that we are impacted on are still in place. And I don\u2019t think there is anything near term here that could change. However, the fact that there was a deal between U.S. and China helps the overall economy helps confidence in China and that\u2019s good for us. Again, I do not expect that tariff situation will change you in the near term. And so we are assuming for tariffs, the status quo. And that means, we still have headwinds for tariffs for another two quarters. Shawn Vadala : Yes. So just to be clear, we\u2019re going to have headwinds for Q1 of about 2%. It was the gross impact of tariffs and then we\u2019ll have a little bit of impacting Q2. Derik De Bruin : Great. And just one final question, Shawn. What\u2019s the embedded number for operating margin expansion in your 2020 guide? Shawn Vadala : Excluding the impact of currency, we\u2019re probably looking at about 70 basis point improvement in 2020. But currency will probably right now we\u2019re looking at it, it could have a headwind of up to 20 basis points. Derik De Bruin : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Your line is open. Patrick Donnelly : Great. Thanks, guys. Olivier, maybe just on the guidance since the last update last quarter, we now have the headwind from Food Retail turning negative for 2020, a little bit of uncertainty around coronavirus, a bit of a headwind in 1Q at a minimum. I\u2019m just kind of think through, how it seems like a few things have turned against you guys yet, you\u2019re maintaining that overall guide. Was there just enough conservatism in the original number, you\u2019re able to absorb these headwinds, maintain the guidance, maybe it\u2019s more fair now there\u2019s a little bit of a cushion removed or other just things in the portfolio improve a bit to allow you guys to maintain that number? Olivier Filliol : I would say, I highlight two things. First, we did better than expected in Q4 and that day was \u2013 even more confidence in our execution, it shows that our programs are really going well on. And so that played a role. And the second one is, you mentioned here a few things that we are more concerned now, but then I would highlight core industrial that I feel better. And I highlighted, we had really a very good results here in Q4. And we have better confidence for the full year. So I think that\u2019s a combination of things. Net-net, I feel as comfortable about the guidance for this year as I was in November. And that\u2019s really why we keep the full year guidance even that we see here for Q1, a bigger target. Shawn Vadala : And as we mentioned in the past too, one of the big questions we had a quarter ago is, what is it going to be like when we start to lap some of these tough comparisons in core industrial? I mean we just lapped 13% last year and we have one quarter behind us in that regard and now it gives us a little bit more confidence in the momentum in that business. Patrick Donnelly : That\u2019s helpful. And then just on the recovery of the sales later in 2020 in China specifically, could you just talk through what gives you the confidence that those are going to come back? And then on top of that, just, any metrics that could help us think about, if this headwind does keep going, if China is shut down a little bit longer than February 10, how sensitive is the business to another week, another two weeks, et cetera, anything you can provide would be helpful there. Olivier Filliol : So we \u2013 from experience, we have seen that if you have \u2013 if we have a significant slowdown, we have the pent-up coming back and that\u2019s just based on experience and we have every reason to feel the same way here. And as mentioned before, I do expect that the government will also support the economy and that we will benefit. And there are certainly areas where we probably going to see more investments, particularly in the area of life science as an outcome of this. The second question, it\u2019s not an easy one to answer. To be honest, we have spent a significant time to review here with our local team. The impact now for this February 10 we sought. So I think it will mostly depend what kind of actions the government takes. If the government would suddenly extend this lock periods for operations that people would not allow to go back to the facility or so. That\u2019s one. But the other one is they might restricts travel. And I can\u2019t be give you good numbers here for all the different scenarios. From today\u2019s perspective, I\u2019m not particularly concerned about the supply chain. I think we can master that and we have reasonable contingency, even if this takes a few extra days, I don\u2019t see that as a big problem. The bigger question is actually how our customers will react in that situation. That\u2019s the big one. I think what we can manage things we \u2013 you heard me saying before, we have contingency plan. When we think about alternatives, we have this tele-channel that we can activate and all that stuff. But it\u2019s difficult to anticipate what the customers will be. And we have so many different customers in China. You have international customers, you have the local ones, you have food, you have life science. So every extension will impact our numbers. No question. But I think with our guidance that we gave you and the details we gave you \u2013 we gave you already quite some indication that this extra days of closing has a significant impact on our numbers. And if this is extended by one or two weeks, then you need to assume that our numbers will be worse than what we are guiding you right now in Q1, right. Patrick Donnelly : I appreciate the color, Olivier. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tycho Peterson : Hey, thanks. On the cost side of things, you had flagged some cost reduction actions last year. I felt like they may be over in the first part of this year, but it seems like those programs are continuing. Is that a correct assumption? And are you accelerating any cost actions on the food business in light of what\u2019s now a lack of recovery there? Olivier Filliol : Yes. And so we initiated the front cost actions. There were cost actions related to the Food Retail business. These were executed throughout last years and we\u2019re going to have the benefit also ongoing list here. There were also cost actions that we did in the area of IT, back office and so on. These were executed mostly in Q3. And so we have more benefits coming in this year. So yes, different things, we have benefits in 2020 coming from that. And we build it in our guidance. Shawn Vadala : And then on top of that, of course, we have our ongoing programs under the stern drive umbrella that we\u2019re constantly doing as well too. Tycho Peterson : And then Shawn, can you quantify the price contribution in the fourth quarter and you had the question before on tariffs, but as we think about those eventually kind of getting unwound, just your latest thinking on ability on the capture price this year in the environment? Shawn Vadala : Yes. Sure. So in pricing, we\u2019re very pleased with the quarter. It came in very much as we expected, just slightly under 2.5%, which kind of puts us right at that same kind of number on a full year basis. And then in terms of tariffs, on an annualized basis, the gross headwind is about $25 million. As we\u2019ve kind of communicated in the past, if it all went away, some of the mitigation actions would also go away. We\u2019ve kind of mentioned in the past that we would see probably an EPS growth benefit of 1% to 1.5%. I\u2019d probably say sitting here today it\u2019s maybe closer to 1.5% kind of benefit on an annualized basis. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then just lastly, given the unchanged China outlook, setting aside the coronavirus impact, are you factoring in any government stimulus versus a macro slowdown there in the base business? Shawn Vadala : We haven\u2019t \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s not like we have a formula where it\u2019s so micro, but I mean certainly it\u2019s in our thinking to give us confidence that we can still meet the midyear \u2013 I mean, I\u2019m sorry, the mid-single digit sales growth guidance for the full year for China. As kind of Olivier, kind of already mentioned with the expected recovery in the second half of the year. But certainly, that could be an upside that we could see in the latter parts of this year. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Dan Leonard : Thank you. Circling to China again. Can you elaborate on the fourth quarter performance, it came in better than we were looking for. Where did you exceed plan? And some of the other companies and analytical instruments talked about some weakness in China in Q4 and towards year end. Apparently you didn\u2019t see that. Can you discuss maybe what the differential trends you were seeing? Shawn Vadala : Yes. We were very pleased with China, came in a little bit better than we expected 8% growth. On the laboratory side, we were double-digit growth. So we\u2019re very pleased with that given the stack comps that we\u2019ve talked to you about in the past, but equally very happy with the industrial business. I mean, our industrial business was up high single-digits, very strong high single-digits. So we\u2019re very pleased with that type of growth as well to. Offsetting that is we had a weaker results in the local retail business there. But otherwise very pleased with what we saw in the quarter. And frankly, we were feeling very good entering 2020 before the coronavirus situation. Olivier Filliol : Yes. I would actually put it to really good execution by the team. I think the team does a fantastic job. They are very effective in implementing Spinnaker. And they are really good at going off to the industry segments that have the best opportunities. And that was very helpful in that environment that we experienced here in China last year. Dan Leonard : And then my follow-up, how are you thinking about Europe into 2020? You\u2019re coming off three quarters here, where growth was barely about flat. You have a tough comp in Q1, so that\u2019ll be four quarters that type of result. How are you thinking about the outlook for that region looking forward? Thank you. Shawn Vadala : We expect to get off to a slower start there. As you mentioned, we have our toughest comp there with a 9% growth in the prior year. Europe will also have a little bit of retail effect in the first quarter as well. But right now, we continue to feel like the economy has been good enough there. But we\u2019re very much aware of where PMI has had been over the last year. We continue to monitor it closely. But as we always say, as long as customers stick to their replacement cycles, we feel pretty good. And similar to China, we also have a very strong execution by our sales and marketing organization in Europe. And given that it\u2019s our largest direct business, we often get the most impact from a lot of our Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives there. Dan Leonard : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Arias with Stifel. Your line is open. Dan Arias : Afternoon guys. Thanks. Olivier, on the food business. It sounds like this will end up being a pretty prolonged period of just challenging conditions by the time all said and done. I guess I\u2019m wondering, once you recovered a bit, do you think there might be some new market share opportunities? Is that in the picture or is the competitive landscape pretty settled with a bunch of big players in it? Olivier Filliol : I think the competitive landscape is quite settled because we are not running the Food Retail business for market share. We really run this business for profitability. We are focusing particular on large accounts. We are focusing on the most attractive countries. And in that sense, we have refined our strategy and are executing that strategy and we\u2019ll stick with it even when the market will recover. Yes. I think we are really \u2013 we want to be very disciplined on that business. We have been running this strategy for quite a few years. And of course, it hurts when we see that it impact our top line. But this resource shifting that we are doing in the organization helps us to grow many businesses with excellent profitability, with excellent long-term growth opportunities. And the Food Retail business, we did less of that. And as a consequence, it became smaller in percentage of the total business. Today, Food Retail is about 7% of our revenue. This is much less than what it was couple of years ago. And I feel this is the right strategy. So I\u2019m not irritated by these temporary challenges, but of course it hurts, no question. Dan Arias : I got you. Okay. And then Shawn, I guess maybe this is a housekeeping question. But anything from a pacing perspective across the quarters of 2020 that look either different or clearer than they did back in October, aside from the obvious with the virus and food factors more additional on their fundamentals. Shawn Vadala : Yes. No, of course the recovery from the coronavirus is now like the topic that\u2019s going to impact Q2 versus Q3, but nothing really standing out from my mind when I look at the rest of the year at this point in time. Dan Arias : Okay. Thanks much. Operator : Your next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open. Andrew Wall : Hi, this is Andrew Wall on for Jack. Turning to product inspection, can you walk us through some of your customer segments in the trends and spending? Olivier Filliol : The biggest category is packaged food. And that\u2019s the biggest one. But you would also have, for example, the cosmetics industry also a little bit of pharma and you also have a meat, which can be unpackaged meat. So these are kind of the different categories. They are typically big companies. Many of them have global operations. Yes, that would characterize kind of the key end user segments. This packaged food companies, the branded packaged food companies have a rather difficult period. There are new market trends from consumers that impact things. You have channel topics that they face, these branded consumer package companies. And you see that also kind of the overall performance of these companies\u2019 market caps and so on. And that has an impact on their investment behavior. And we feel that. Andrew Wall : That\u2019s great. Thank you. And in Europe, have you seen any impact from stalking related to Brexit? Olivier Filliol : No. The whole Brexit topic has not been a particular relevant one for us. Now we had our contingency plans in case it would have been a hard Brexit. Now things are really calm for us. And of course, if at the end of the year this hard Brexit becomes again a probability, then our contingency plan will be very relevant. But I want also to remind the UK it\u2019s about 3% of our revenue. So even if Brexit would have some demand implications, it\u2019s not so relevant for the group level. Operator : Your next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Vijay Kumar : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Olivier, just maybe a big picture on the revenue side. I appreciate all the macro comments. But if you just look at over the last few years, lab products, it\u2019s running pretty hard. It did slow down in 2019. In 2019 you also had food, which was severe and you had tariffs, which were incremental. If the macro really hasn\u2019t changed, I\u2019m just \u2013 where is the delta coming in when you look at versus 2019 versus 2020. I think, putting all the pieces together, I think you\u2019re trying to say macro hasn\u2019t changed. But we\u2019re trying to be prudent. So maybe just walk us through on some \u2013 where you think could be the plus and minus. Olivier Filliol : Let me have Shawn to respond here just to clarify a few things and then I\u2019ll come back. Shawn Vadala : Yes. So Vijay, maybe one thing is that in 2018, if you\u2019re comparing it to growth in 2018, included a little bit of acquisition growth. So I think if you look at 2019 and 2018 on an organic basis, were both \u2013 above, I think it was 7% in both years. So from our perspective, we don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s any difference or slow down. And especially when you look at our growth on our multi-years stack basis, we feel very good about the business and the momentum. And if you look at inside the business, I think, particularly interesting this year as you saw very, very strong growth across many of the product categories. And so it just shows you the breadth of the portfolio really working the robustness of the portfolio, lots of new products coming out in the last few years. And of course, lab benefits disproportionately from our Spinnaker initiatives just given the end markets and a lot of the focus. So we actually felt very good about lab entering this year, recognizing people might\u2019ve wanted us to guide higher than mid-single digit, but really it was very much just related to the multi-year stack comp. Olivier Filliol : Yes, I leave it, I totally agree in that sense. I don\u2019t think there is a particular effect here that we need to highlight. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And then maybe one last one. And Shawn, maybe I missed this. But the pricing assumption for 2020, is that consistent with 2019? And anything on the tax line, pluses or minus for 2020 versus 2019. Shawn Vadala : Yes. So on the pricing side, we had kind of previously guided between a 150 basis points to 200 basis points, acknowledging that the last few years we\u2019ve been in that 200 plus basis point range. But I think it\u2019s also fair to say in the last few years, we\u2019ve also been able to take advantage of some inflationary situations or the tariff situation. We kind of entered 2020 with a lower inflation environment around the world. So I think we probably will see something more the 150 basis point to 200 basis point range. And then in terms of the tax rate, no change to 2020. We expect to be at 20% before discrete items in 2020. Vijay Kumar : Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Steve Willoughby : All right, thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess, first Olivier, based on the feedback you\u2019re hearing from either internally or externally, how confident are you at this point that things get going again next Monday in China? Olivier Filliol : From today\u2019s perspective, everything point out to this, but honestly things have changed a lot every day. We have been on the phone and the email exchanges every day and there was always news. I think in that sense, I am confident with the information that I have. But I have also seen that individual provinces make their own decisions and that can also influence us. It can be travel restrictions specific to provinces and so on. But again, from today\u2019s perspective, we do expect that we can re-launch our operations. Steve Willoughby : Okay. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on that. Are you expecting any \u2013 in terms of the revenue headwind from this kind of extended holiday, does it impact the segments equally or would \u2013 one of the segments impacted more in the near term here? Olivier Filliol : As I covered early on, first, we are impacted now just by the fact that we can\u2019t meet our customers. And that we can\u2019t really take orders or initiate quote and all these things. I would say, independent across all the industry segments. But then there are industry segments that will be impacted in terms of demand in Q1. I was highlighting that for example, retail will probably be more impacted than life science pharma customers, maybe even packaged food companies. So there will be differences. Steve Willoughby : Very good. Shawn, just one quick one. If I have my notes correctly from a quarter ago, I had written down that you were thinking about 90 basis points of margin expansion this year, when backing out FX and I think you said, 70 basis points. I just wanted to clarify that. Shawn Vadala : Yes. We were a little bit more optimistic on the margin maybe three months ago. One of the things kind of mitigating that was higher pension service cost. So there\u2019s a benefit below OP on that for the non-service part, but the service part is above OP. So they kind of largely offset each other in terms of EPS, but it\u2019s a little bit more of a drag on OP. Steve Willoughby : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Brennan with UBS. Your line is open. Dan Brennan : Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking the questions. Olivier or Shawn in terms of the 2020 kind of making up the temporary shortfall here in Q1. Does that work equally for both consumables and instruments? I would assume instruments, again, you likely kind of make those up, but I\u2019ve figured consumables, whenever research isn\u2019t done or whatever things aren\u2019t done in Q1 probably get lost. So can you just speak a little bit to, I know you\u2019re more instrument heavy. But how do you characterize kind of the ability to make up both instruments and/or consumable whatever\u2019s loss in Q1? Olivier Filliol : On the consumables topic, most of our consumable is actually related around liquid handling pipettes. Actually the pipette business could be one that has some upside from the whole thing. You can imagine, but pipetting is very important and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised that we saw a trend to on will be intensified. It\u2019s even an area that where you right now see in our Chinese business. So I don\u2019t think that we will lose on the consumable business for the full year. And even the other part of the consumable, I don\u2019t think will be much impacted. The consumable piece is impacted by the research activities and in the area of production. For example, when I think about process analytics and so on, I don\u2019t think that the demand would be impacted for the full year. Shawn Vadala : And we might see something in field service. But that\u2019s a smaller part of the Chinese business versus our global average. Dan Brennan : Great. And then I know you addressed this earlier, but I wasn\u2019t clear, maybe I just missed it. Are you assuming in the full year guide that the government does produce some additional stimulus or that Shawn, I think you may have actually said to Tycho\u2019s question that would actually could lead to upside. I just want a clarification on that. Olivier Filliol : It\u2019s part of the pent-up recovery that we were mentioning before. It\u2019s not huge, but we have it\u2026 Shawn Vadala : It was a consideration. Dan Brennan : Got it. And then this might be hard to do, but given coronavirus is kind of impacting a lot of things outside of China. But is it possible to kind of step back from coronavirus and say, you\u2019ve been pretty consistent since last year flagging these uncertainties and some pockets of weakness, but we have seen PMIs tick up a little bit here. Is it possible to look at \u2013 separate coronavirus from what you\u2019re seeing globally? And do you think as you look back over the last couple of quarters, are things looking any better or is it stable/worse? Because the language seems similar, I just want to see how you\u2019d characterize the global environment for your businesses. Olivier Filliol : It didn\u2019t change too much. I think, I was highlighting before that I felt better about our execution in Q4, particularly also in core industrial, but also overall I felt better on that piece. What came in weaker is Food Retail. And certainly we have certainly global economy things, but I wouldn\u2019t give too much weight on that. So net-net, I feel the same. Dan Brennan : Got it. And then, maybe one more just on product inspection. What could we look forward in terms of visibility kind of the environment getting better? Is it packaged food CapEx? Are there any trends we can watch ourselves just to kind of see or get ahead? And when this market could begin to recover and you kind of see that investment spending happening? Olivier Filliol : Package food CapEx is certainly a good indicator for that. This is an indication how much investment is going in packaging equipment and all the things that is. And in general, I would say when the consumer packaged food \u2013 consumer package companies recovering we will see investment going back into it. Dan Brennan : Great. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to the presenters. Mary Finnegan : Thank you. And thanks everyone for joining us this evening. As always, if you have any questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out. Take care and have a good night, everyone. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2020 Mettler-Toledo International Earnings Conference Call. My name is George, and I will be your audio operator for today.   I would now like to hand the conference over to your hostess for today, Ms. Mary Finnegan. Mary Finnegan : Thank you, and good evening, everyone. I'm Mary Finnegan, responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo and happy that you're joining us this evening. I am on the call today with Olivier Filliol, our CEO; and Shawn Vadala, our Chief Financial Officer. I want to cover just a couple of administrative matters. The call is being webcast and is available on our website. A copy of the press release and the presentation that we refer to is also on the website. Olivier Filliol : Thank you, Mary. Good evening, everyone. I want to start by saying that I hope this finds all of you safe and well. We face unprecedented times, and I hope that you are adjusting. I'm doing this call from Switzerland, while Shawn and Mary are in Columbus, Ohio. I will start with a summary of the quarter, and then Shawn will provide details on our financials. I will then have some additional comments, and we will open the lines for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter on Page 3 of the presentation. Local currency sales declined 3% in the quarter. The negative impact of COVID-19 to our sales in China was greater than we originally estimated. Local currency sales in other countries, particularly in Asia and Europe, were also negatively impacted by COVID-19.  Despite the challenges to sales, with the benefit of our marginal productivity initiatives as well as some immediate cost containment measures, we increased gross margins and maintained adjusted operating margins consistent with the prior year at 21.8%. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was slightly below the prior year. The global spread of COVID-19 has impacted our businesses throughout the world. Our primary concern is protecting the health of employees and customers. We have diligently instituted safety protocols throughout the world, which is allowing us to continue to provide instruments and services to our customers, a majority of which are in the essential industry including pharma, food manufacturing, chemical, transportation and logistics and grocery stores. Shawn Vadala : Thanks, Olivier. I also want to say that I hope this finds all of you well and adjusting to this new environment. Sales were at $649.2 million in the quarter, a decline of 3% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales decreased 4% as currencies reduced sales growth by approximately 1% in the quarter. On Slide number 4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales grew 3% in the Americas and declined 5% in Europe and declined 8% in Asia/Rest of World. China local currency sales declined 13% in the quarter. While sales in the quarter were negatively impacted by COVID, I want to also highlight that we had strong local currency growth in the prior year. In particular, Europe had 9% sales growth and China had 13% growth in Q1 of 2019. On Slide number 5, we outline local currency growth by product area. For the quarter, Laboratory sales grew 1%. Industrial declined 5%, with Core Industrial down 3% and Product Inspection decreased 8%. Food Retail declined 16% in the quarter. Food Retail reduced our sales growth by 1% in the quarter. Let me now move to the rest of the P&L, which is summarized on the next slide. Gross margin in the quarter was 57.7%, a 50 basis point increase over the prior year level of 57.2%. Pricing in Stern Drive contributed to the margin growth. R&D amounted to $34.4 million, which represents a 5% decline in local currency. This decline was impacted by the timing of activity and the 9% local currency growth in R&D in the prior year. SG&A amounted to $198.7 million, a 2% decrease in local currency over the prior year. We continue to make investments in our field force but this was more than offset by some immediate cost containment measures and lower variable compensation. Adjusted operating profit amounted to $141.3 million in the quarter, which represents a 4% decline over the prior year amount of $147.8 million. We estimate currency reduced operating profit by approximately $3.5 million. Despite these headwinds and challenges to the top line, operating margins were 21.8% in the quarter, consistent with the prior year. Olivier Filliol : Thank you, Shawn. Let me start with a few comments on health and safety. I'm very pleased we were able to quickly adopt important safety protocols throughout the world regarding social distancing, hygiene, health monitoring, split shifts and remote work. The organization has adapted quite well, reflecting not only our execution but also our agility. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JP Morgan. Tycho Peterson : Olivier, I thought it was interesting in your comments, you called out the lab reactors as potentially having a vaccine tie-in. I'm just curious as we start to think about potential tailwinds, are there other areas you think you could disproportionately benefit? And any preliminary views on labs opening up, academic labs opening up in the fall in the U.S. at this point? Olivier Filliol : Yes. So the AutoChem business, as highlighted, will benefit. We will continue also to benefit with the pipette business. And then I do expect that more investment will go into bioproduction and that will benefit again our AutoChem business, will also benefit our process analytics business, in particular with this Ingold products, and then industrial will also get some benefits. And in general, I do expect that there will be industries, end user industries that will suffer for quite a while in this environment and the other industries that will be more attractive on one hand short term. And we are working on this already when I talked about shifting the priorities for our sales force. But then there also medium-term segments that I do view as more attractive going forward. I certainly expect that there is a desire from western governments to bring back certain active substance production. And that, for example, would also benefit us. And when we think about big data analytics, and when we think about driving our sales force to these opportunities, we look at industry segments, we look at specific accounts and we certainly also look at announcements that companies are doing in terms of investments. Tycho Peterson : And then one of the initiatives you've had is to get more of your clients on annualized service contracts. In the context of your comments earlier on service, can you maybe just remind us where you are in that effort? What percentage of your service is annualized? And how much cushion that might give you in the near term? Olivier Filliol : So about half of our service revenue is contract-based. And that business at this stage, we see no reason why it shouldn't recover. We didn't, or we have good renewal rates and we didn't have cancellations. In that sense for that piece, I expect a V-shaped recovery. When it comes to break, fix and auto preemptive maintenance work, we certainly see that this is heavily impacted, but typically this would be rather delayed than canceled. In general, I would view our service business as being resilient. But I do recognize, particular in the industrial world that capacity utilization and the wear down of our products has also a certain impact on service. Service will be severely impacted here in Q2 but I do expect that we have good recovery in the remainder of the year. Tycho Peterson : And then just one last one on China, you said up mid-single digit in the second quarter. Can you just comment on the April order book? And what gives you the confidence in mid-single digit for the second quarter? Thanks. Shawn Vadala : Yes. Hey, Tycho, this is Shawn. Maybe I'll take that one. So for China, yes, we're thinking mid-single digit for Q2. If you kind of think about it in terms of the different businesses, we're probably thinking the Lab business will be more like low to mid-single digit. We're expecting more on the Industrial side, maybe more like mid- to high single digit. But part of that maybe gives you a little bit of a flavor for how things are playing out. Like on the Industrial side, we had a much more significant decline in the first quarter. It was down in the mid-teens but it also shows you that the recovery isn't necessarily a V-shaped recovery. While on the Lab side, in the first quarter, we were down low single digit. And then that kind of just shows you that it's maybe a more moderate situation there. And then in terms of April, nothing in particular I'd really want to comment on there. But of course, we understood the month of April as we were kind of providing guidance for the second quarter. Tycho Peterson : Great. I appreciate the color. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin. Your line is open. Mike Ryskin : Hi. Can you hear me? Shawn Vadala : Yes. Mike Ryskin : This is Mike Ryskin on for Derik. I want to follow up on that last one there on the China comment and then also loop that into your general thoughts on the recovery. You made a couple of comments in the prepared remarks that you expect a little bit more of a U-shaped recovery, and so 3Q should be not that different than the 2Q range. Is that just some of the differences in terms of how quickly you expect the Labs and Industrial to bounce back in Americas and the U.S.? Is there some conservatism built in there? Or is there something else you're seeing in terms of ordering patterns and how these countries -- how these other geographies beyond APAC region have gone through the lockdown so far? Just thinking about labs reopening and sort of the pace of ordering as we go through the summer and fall. Olivier Filliol : Yes. I think we're going to see big differences in the different geographies but also in the different business lines when we think about recovery. We talked about Service that should have kind of a V-shaped recovery before. I do expect that certain industry segments, for example, R&D labs and so on, they have a sharp drop here in the lockdowns but then we should certainly see a recovery. This is particularly true for more the lower-cost instruments that we have. But then to contrast that, we definitely have a business that is more project-oriented. We have businesses like thermal analysis, automated chemistry, high-end balances, titrators. And then on the Industrial side for example, checkweighers and x ray. These are not instruments that customers buy within weeks. These are projects that typically take long renew cycles and evaluations until they commit and then we ship. So early in Q2, we are still benefiting from a pipeline that existed before COVID. And then we have a situation in the lockdown now where very few new projects are initiated at customers for multiple reasons, but one is certainly also that people are operating out-of-home offices. Other reasons are that companies are slowing down their CapEx. And then sometimes it can be also that sites are not easily accessible. People don't want to bring additional disruptions by bringing new instruments and so on. So there are different reasons. Now if I bring you all these businesses together, and if I think about the different geographies, I, it starts to sum up more to a U-shaped recovery. And this is actually also the context why we are working with an operating model that Q3 will not be better than Q2. And only Q4 will start to see improvements because we do expect by then that our project pipeline will be filled again and that we have customers that are again initiating larger projects. Mike Ryskin : And then right along those lines, if you could go down the P&L on the OpEx side. I appreciate all the color on the 2Q cost-cutting steps. Should we anticipate sort of a similar cadence to that for 3Q, and then again flexing that back up later in the year and then 2021 as demand recovers? And could you also touch on decremental margins to their gross margin line? Shawn Vadala : Yes, sure. Yes. Thanks, Mike. Yes. So hey, of course, we're working on and planning cost reductions at the moment. But I wouldn't want to quantify the magnitude of what we're going to do for Q3 at this point. I think it's important that we get closer to the quarter, and then we can differentiate our ultimate execution as we enter the third quarter. In terms of decremental margins, I mean, I think there's a lot of variability at the moment with our guidance. I think probably the, what I would focus on a little bit is maybe just on the gross margin line, maybe this is what you were referring to. But if we look at the first quarter gross margin, very pleased with the results. We're continuing to benefit from pricing. Pricing realization was just under 2% in the quarter, so towards the higher end of our guidance there. We'd expect something similar here in the second quarter as well. We also had some good benefit from our Stern Drive initiatives around material cost savings. But of course, offsetting that is the volume impact. And so as that plays out in the second quarter, we're going to see a bigger impact from volume. We'll mitigate some of that with some of our cost savings initiatives but most of our cost savings initiatives are below the gross margin line. So when we look at gross margin for Q2, if I kind of like look at the midpoint of our guidance, we'd probably be looking at minus 80 basis points for the second quarter. But I caution that there could be a larger range of expectations here than normal just given the impact of volume. So for example, if we were at the better side of the sales guidance in terms of minus 8%, gross margins might be down 50 basis points. But if we were at the worst side in terms of minus 12%, gross margins could be down like more like 120 basis points. So it gives you a little bit of a flavor for how the outcomes can be quite different with volume. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar. Vijay Kumar : One, I guess just on the macro side here, Olivier, coming out of lockdowns, right, when you think about recession, recessionary impacts in the back half. Maybe just give us a big picture sense on how is the portfolio structured to weather recession? And what kind of growth rate should we look at? Is 2008, '09 relevant to look at the company now, a decade later? Or is that a good analogy on how we should be thinking about top line? Olivier Filliol : Yes, hey, interesting that you make this analogy, and it has certainly also been one thing that we studied. Very early on when the crisis started, we started to do revenue scenarios and we used different data points for us. I think one, in particular one that we care most is to look at the different industry segments and how they will be impacted or how we expect them to be impacted. And then we look those at sensitivities around what we have experienced 10 years ago. Unfortunately, I am now already in my second crisis as a CEO, and so I still remember well that crisis. Now a couple of things to consider when you compare it. And first, we are today much better positioned than we were in 2009 in terms of the exposure. If you think, Lab is now more than 50% of our sales, significantly higher share than in, at the time. Service and consumable is now 33%, also much higher. Core Industrial is smaller percentage of sales, while emerging market is a larger percentage. So all in all, we are not immune to the economy but we do believe we are less reliant on it than in the past downturn. And the second point is we have today much stronger Spinnaker tools, data analytics and change management capabilities that we did not have in 2009. These are very important practices, and really I have seen the power of these tools and approaches in the last few weeks. I was referring in the prepared remarks about a fundamental change in our go-to-market approaches. We have countries where customer visits went down by 90% in the last few days, weeks. And we have to compensate this customer access through other means with other tools. And really Spinnaker and all these other technologies that we have already implemented in the recent past but also new digital technologies that we have piloted and now can scale up our big bets. So the environment today is very different. But in terms of recession impact, there are certainly learnings out of 2009, and we use these learnings also when we build our operational models. You have seen us being here very action-oriented, very far in terms of cost measures. I think that has also been the learning from last time. We know how to do these things, and our organization knows how to respond to these things. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, and\u2026 Olivier Filliol : Yes. So I think that's kind of the way I would look at this 2009 comparison. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful. And Shawn, one on the cost actions and margins side. I think I heard you say OpEx will be down 9%. And if revenues are down 10% at the midpoint, are we looking at OpEx being down in line with revenues? And the implication would be if 3Q revenues are down, then we're looking at OpEx down but margins could still end up being down. In the context of if that's the right way to be thinking about margins being down for '20, should 2021 be a hyper-normal margin year for you guys? As given the cost actions you've taken and volumes come back, the margin benefit should be above your typical 75 bps of annual expansion? Thank you. Shawn Vadala : Yes. No, hey, thanks for the question, Vijay. Hey, I think of course it's a little early to try to look out to 2021. But I think it's good that you asked the question because it highlights on these cost actions. I think it's important to understand that these are temporary -- largely temporary actions. So these -- a lot of these topics will come back next year. So we won't see the next -- necessarily we won't see the same level of pickup that maybe you might be implying otherwise. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly. Jesse Klink : This is Jesse Klink on for Patrick. Could you just remind us of what percent of your sales generally come within the last few weeks of the quarter, and just kind of your visibility into the second quarter as you're preparing guidance there? Shawn Vadala : Yes, sure. So I'll take this, Jesse, it's Shawn. So we're not a hockey stick kind of business. I mean the third month of a quarter typically is higher from a seasonal perspective than the first month of a quarter, but it's not so back-ended in terms of a hockey stick in the last 2 weeks. But as we kind of like provided guidance for Q2, there's a lot of ingredients that kind of go into that. I mean of course, we have the benefit of seeing that the trends develop throughout the quarter.  We see how the month of April came together. But as Olivier kind of mentioned in his, in our prepared remarks, there's a lot of other KPIs that we've been monitoring literally on a daily basis in our virtual war room. And so we've been doing that for quite a while now and to keep kind of a close pulse on the different businesses. So at a high level, those are a lot of the different factors that we had as we kind of provided guidance for the second quarter. Jesse Klink : Okay. Now... Olivier Filliol : As the question I feel that one really change in an interesting way that we, what Shawn refers to the war room, we really from the first week on installed a whole new set of metrics that allows us to really monitor country, business and end-user industry-specific, all the key metrics like lead generation, the number of customer visits, the number of phone calls that we're facing, the number of opportunities, quote levels and so on.  And we are using all these metrics on one hand to manage the sales force to manage and guide them, but then at the same time also to get additional visibility for our forecast. And I stress that point because it's obvious that we cannot just extrapolate from the past metrics that we have. In the past, we didn't look at on a daily basis on all our metrics, as today we do. Jesse Klink : Okay. Yes, that's really helpful. And then just one more on the capital deployment front. You guys, I think, bought back 200 million of shares in the quarter and talked about suspending that. But what are you kind of looking for to maybe get back and take advantage of lower share prices or look for other areas of deployment, whether it'd be paying down debt? Or just kind of how you're thinking about that throughout the quarter? Shawn Vadala : Yes, sure. So hey, I mean we strongly believe in the share repurchase program, very strongly believe in it. Our philosophy has not changed at all. For us, it's not, it's never been about trying to time the market. So share price will not be a factor in terms of when we try to reenter. We'd expect that we'd restart hopefully in the second half of the year here. In terms of capital deployment, I think this is still going to be our strategy going forward. I mean of course, we still like bolt-on M&A as well if there's some opportunities that are available. But we, in the end, it just came down to caution, just given the significant uncertainty in terms of forecasting as we talked about. And we recognize that it's a cautious view. We have a very, very strong balance sheet. We have very strong liquidity. And I think you'll see us get back into share repurchases in due course and kind of continue to work towards this leverage ratio of 1.5x that we've talked about in the past. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby. Steve Willoughby : Just one follow-up question first on that last question regarding buybacks, Shawn. When you do look to potentially reenter and restart the buyback in the back half of the year, would you expect to restart at a similar rate as what you had been doing? Shawn Vadala : Yes, it's a good question. I mean, I think we need to kind of see what the situation is, Steve, in terms of like what the future looks like at that point in time. Probably yes, I think, yes, it could go in different directions. It really will depend on how the world looks when we restart. And, but I would expect us to get at this, kind of keep at this 1.5x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. And I wouldn't expect that we'd want to wait too long to kind of march towards that ratio. Steve Willoughby : Okay. And then secondly, I was just wondering maybe if Olivier or Shawn could provide a little bit more color as it relates to your pipette business. You highlighted it, I believe you said strong or very strong in the first quarter. Just was wondering if you could help either quantify that at all? Maybe talk about what you're expecting that business could look like during the second quarter or over the back half of the year, if you're taking out manufacturing capacity off of that business? Just any more color on the pipette business. Olivier Filliol : No, it's not that we're going to have to expand capacity specifically. On the short term here in Q1, we had a very strong demand. But partially it was also because customers wanted to secure supply, and then they would also stock up a bit. And that certainly required also some capacity expansion short term for us. For the full year, we're going to have good growth. But I don't think that it's going to impact the group results in a material way. So don't want to overstate the growth coming out of this. Steve Willoughby : Okay. And then, Olivier, if I could just add in one more real quick. Last quarter, you talked about the potential for some government stimulus in China. I was just wondering if you had any updated thoughts on that potential enough I guess. Olivier Filliol : Yes, so that's an interesting one. Because of COVID, the Chinese government councils were postponed on that. This is happening right now, and we just got also updates on the topic in the last few days. We do expect stimulus money, the stimulus money will however be very different to what we had 10 years ago. It's going to go to different end markets. Last time, it was very much also infrastructure related. This time, what's -- what the rumors are, it's not less being infrastructure. And there are partially big sectors that would not benefit, but us, there are orders that we like. We do think that CDC hospitals will benefit from it. We do think that pharma production will benefit from it. And so we're going to see some benefits to us but certainly not in the same magnitude as we have seen it 10 years ago. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard. Your line is now open. Olivier Filliol : Brandon? Shawn Vadala : Brandon? Mary Finnegan : Operator, could you check the line, please? Operator : Hello, Brandon, your line is now open. You may ask your question. Mary Finnegan : Why don't we go to the next question then? Operator : I think his line is open now. Brandon? Brandon Couillard : Can you hear me, guys? Shawn Vadala : Yes. Olivier Filliol : Yes, now we can. Brandon Couillard : Okay. All right. Great. So just one more time. Olivier, I'm curious to get your thoughts as to why or why not China would be a relevant proxy to think of in terms of the pathway that the U.S. and Europe might take as restrictions are lifted. Olivier Filliol : Can you just repeat the question? I'm not sure I fully got it, sorry. Brandon Couillard : Sorry. Just curious what your thoughts are in terms of looking at China as a relevant proxy for European and U.S. recovery as restrictions are lifted. Olivier Filliol : Okay. Yes, good, good, sorry. Actually good question. China was an ideal learning case for us as a company to learn how to prepare for when the COVID pandemic was coming to different regions. And we were well prepared in terms of lockdown and all these things. When it comes to the recovery, it's actually more challenging in the west than in China. I do not expect that the demand will come back that quickly. The lockdown in the west seems to have a more fundamental impact on the economy than it has in China. And in that sense, I'm very happy to see how our Chinese revenue has recovered here in April and the rest of Q2 as we expect today but I do not expect the same in the west. So to summarize again, China was a good learning case for us in the downturn but I'm not so sure it will be a downturn. Operator : We have another question from Dan Brennan. John Sourbeer : Hi. This is John Sourbeer on for Dan. Olivier, I just have a question around customer behavior. Any thoughts around instrument replacement cycles over the next year, and how long that these can be deferred on replacements? Olivier Filliol : You asked an interesting question. So when I answer that, I need to differentiate between lab and industrial applications or industrial environment. In a lab environment in west where it's mostly replacement business, customers will delay the replacement because the driver for replacement is often that new product has better functionality, better accuracy and precision. You have software features that's on.  But if CapEx budgets are cut or people are not in the office and are not focusing on getting the latest instruments, they will delay these things. And in the industrial world, the driver for replacement is actually the wear down and the drive to productivity. And in that sense, capacity utilization is one of the key drivers for the industrial business. Accordingly, the two businesses behave differently across the economic cycles. Both businesses will ultimately have a pent-up demand but the timing of the pent-up demand will be different. What I just said applies to the replacement business, in particular, the west. Of course in industries or countries where you have capacity expansion in terms of investments in new production plants, there you have another driver for pent-up demand. John Sourbeer : And just to ask a follow-up, can you unpack the Core Industrial a little bit? In the past, management has discussed how this segment is less cyclical with more exposure to pharma, food, chemical. I'm just wondering if you can provide some color on demand trends you've seen within the Core Industrial. And how do you think this drags into 3Q and what a recovery could look like? Shawn Vadala : Yes, hey, good question. So we're definitely benefiting lot from the more favorable mix in our Industrial business. If you kind of go back to the question on how do we look in terms of 2009 and now, to me that's part of the, that's part of it too. It's like even though our Industrial business is a smaller part of the business, it's also in a lot more attractive businesses like, and in the segments that you kind of mentioned. I think that when I kind of look at Q2 and I look at how the business has kind of held up in Q1, certainly I think that is going to be a differentiator for us. I think also as we look at the different segments, when you think about something like chemical, just to be clarifying chemicals, a lot of, we don't have a significant exposure on the oil side of chemical. We'll be more so unlike the specialty chemical side of it. So there's pockets of chemical that are actually doing better than others. And so we're having a little bit of a mixed experience there at the moment. The other thing is that if you look at a lot of our Industrial customers in general, we are serving a lot of essential businesses. And I think that's been a real, that's been very favorable for us. And again, I don't want to overplay this that we're not immune to the economy. I just want to play that we're better positioned than we were in the past. And I think if you even look at some of the things that we've done from an innovation perspective in the last couple of years, like, for example, in our Transportation and Logistics business, there's definitely some good stories there as well. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. You may continue. Mary Finnegan : Thank you. Thank you, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this evening. Take care. And of course as always, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Take care and good night. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating.

I will then have some additional comments, and we will open the lines for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter are on Page 3 of the presentation. Local currency sales declined 4% in the quarter, which was better than expected. Demand in our end markets continues to be negatively impacted by COVID-19. However, we had good growth in China, and our lab and industrial businesses proved more resilient than initially expected. Contributing to this resiliency is that the majority of our sales are to essential end markets, including life sciences and food manufacturing. Furthermore, we have significant products and end-market diversification and are doing well in redirecting resources to the best growth opportunities. With the continued benefit of our margin initiatives, centered on pricing in Stern Drive as well as the quick actions we took to temporarily reduce our cost structure, we achieved improvement in both gross and operating margins in the quarter. Despite negative currency headwinds, we had positive growth in adjusted EPS. Finally, cash flow generation in the quarter was very strong. Overall, given the very challenging environment, we are pleased with these results. I will have some additional comments shortly, but let me now turn to Shawn for the financials. Shawn Vadala : Thanks, Olivier. I also want to say that I hope this finds all of you well. Sales were $690.7 million in the quarter, a decline of 4% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales decreased 6% as currencies reduced sales growth by approximately 2% in the quarter. On Slide number 4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales declined 7% in the Americas, 5% in Europe and increased 1% in Asia Rest of the World. China local currency sales increased 8% in the quarter. The next slide shows sales growth by region for the first half of the year. Local currency sales declined 2% in the Americas, 5% in Europe and 3% in Asia Rest of World. China local currency sales declined 2% in the first half of the year. On Slide number 6, we outlined local currency sales growth by product area. For the quarter, laboratory sales declined 4%, industrial declined 3% with core industrial down 1%, and Product Inspection down 5%. Food Retail declined 11% in the quarter. The next slide shows sales growth by product area for the first half of the year. Laboratory sales declined 2%, industrial declined 4% with core industrial down 2%, and Product Inspection; down 7%. Food Retail declined 14% for the first six months. Let me now move to the rest of the P&L for the quarter, which is summarized on the next slide. Gross margin in the quarter was 57.6%, a 20 basis point increase over the prior year level of 57.4%. Our margin initiatives centered on pricing and Stern Drive contributed to the margin growth. We also benefited from temporary cost actions undertaken earlier in the quarter, offset in part by higher transportation costs. R&D amounted to $31.2 million, which represents a 15% decline in local currency. The decline is principally driven by timing of activity as well as some temporary cost savings measures. I would expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be in the historical range of 5% for the full year. SG&A amounted to $190.1 million, a 7% decrease in local currency over the prior year. Our temporary cost containment measures as well as lower variable compensation were principal contributors to this decline. Adjusted operating profit amounted to $176.6 million in the quarter, which represents a 1% decline over the prior year amount of $177.7 million. We estimate currency reduced operating profit by approximately $4 million in the quarter. Despite the challenges to the top line and the foreign currency headwind, we increased operating margins by 130 basis points to 25.6%. We are pleased with our ability to drive operating margin growth in this very challenging environment. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $13.9 million in the quarter, interest expense was $9.6 million in the quarter. Other income amounted to $2.9 million. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.7% before discrete items and adjusting for the timing of stock option exercises. The rate is lower than we expected as compared to the last time we spoke and is being driven by the impact of deductions and some better income mix. For the full year and for the next two quarters, we now expect our tax rate to be 20.5%. This is also likely to be the rate we will have in 2021. Moving to fully diluted shares, which amounted to $24.2 million in the quarter and is a 3.5% decline from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $5.29, a 3% increase over the prior year amount of $5.16. On a reported basis in the quarter, EPS was $5.22 as compared to $5.06 in the prior year. Reported EPS in the quarter includes $0.12 of purchased intangible amortization, $0.03 of restructuring and a $0.08 difference between our quarterly and annual tax rate due to the timing of stock option exercises. The next slide shows our first half results. Local currency sales declined 3% while operating profit declined 2%. Operating margins in the first half increased 60 basis points. Adjusted EPS amounted to $9.28 versus $9.26 in the prior year. That is it for the P&L, and let me now cover cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $170 million as compared to $113.4 million in the prior year. We are pleased with this level as we made a concerted effort on accounts receivables, collections and cash flow management during this period. DSO in the quarter was at 40 days, while ITO came in at 4.3x. For the first six months, adjusted free cash flow was $218.3 million as compared to $193.5 million in the prior year. On a per share basis, this is a 17% increase. Let me now turn to guidance. Forecasting continues to be challenging, given the significant uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 and the ultimate repercussions for the global economy. We are a short backlog business and the timing and pace of a global recovery is difficult to ascertain at this time. With our Q2 results, we now believe we have better information and insight into our business to provide Q3 and full year sales and earnings guidance. It is important to note that visibility is limited and market dynamics are very fluid, and changes in customer demand can happen quickly. For the third quarter, we would expect local currency sales to decline 1% to 3% and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $5.80 to $6. For the full year 2020, we would expect local currency sales to also decline 1% to 3% and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $22.70 to $23.20. Let me provide some additional insights as you analyze our financial results. We expect to continue to benefit from our Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives, which we believe are particularly important competitive advantage in the current environment. We will also benefit from our margin initiatives centered on pricing and Stern Drive. We will continue to benefit from the temporary cost containment measures and discretionary cost reduction actions in the third quarter. For Q3, we would expect to reduce operating costs approximately 4% to 5% as compared to the previous year. Interest expense is estimated at $9 million in Q3 and $38 million for the full year. Amortization is estimated at $14 million in Q3 and $56 million for the full year. Other income, which primarily represents pension income, is estimated at $2.5 million in Q3 and approximately $11 million for the full year. As already mentioned, we estimate our full year effective tax rate before discrete items will be 20.5% in 2020. Finally, currency is estimated to increase sales growth by approximately 1% in Q3 and will be neutral for the full year. We are targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.5x by the end of 2020 and estimate we will repurchase shares of $200 million in Q3 and $700 million for the full year. That is it from my side, and I now want to turn it back to Olivier. Olivier Filliol : Thank you, Shawn. Let me start with some comments on our Q2 results. Our Lab business proved more resilient than we had anticipated with a 4% decline in local currency in the quarter. Process Analytics did particularly well, while balances were more negatively impacted by COVID. Our Analytical Instruments business was down modestly, contributing to the resiliency of our Lab business is the diversity of our products and end markets and our ability with our sales and marketing techniques to direct resources to the best opportunities. Our Industrial business declined 3% in the quarter. Product Inspection was down mid-single digits with modest growth in our European business, but declines in the Americas as we still face challenges, gaining access to food customer sites, and these customers are currently focused on other priorities. Core Industrial did well in the quarter, declining only 1%. We benefit from an excellent product portfolio, strong sales and marketing initiatives and diversity in our product offering as well as our end markets. I will have some additional comments on Core Industrial shortly. Finally, Food Retail was down 11% in the quarter. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales in Europe declined 5% with both Lab and Industrial in this range. Americas declined 7% in the quarter with retail down 20%. Lab declined slightly more than Industrial, driven in part by strong double-digit growth in Lab in the prior year. Finally, Asia Rest of World grew 1% in the quarter with both Lab and Industrial showing modest growth and retail down double digits. As mentioned, China had 8% growth in the quarter with both Lab and Industrial doing well, while retail declined. One final comment on the second quarter. Service and consumables were flat in the quarter. That concludes my comments on second quarter results. As we look to the second half of the year, the sales decline we are expecting in Q3 is modestly better than what we experienced in Q2. As I mentioned last quarter, as we entered Q2, we had the benefit of our quote order pipeline that we built up in the first quarter. As we enter Q3, we don\u2019t have the same buildup. In terms of geographies, our western markets are in better shape than they were four months ago. While China likely won\u2019t have the same level of pent-up demand that they had in Q2. Taken all together, these dynamics are resulting in low single-digit sales decline in Q3. We will provide more insights into our Q4 expectations on our next call, but our full year guidance assumes there is not a deterioration in operating conditions in the second half of the year. It is worth repeating that our visibility is limited, and we fully acknowledge that market conditions can change quickly, given the unprecedented nature of COVID-19 dynamics. Let me provide some additional insights of how we are managing the business and seeking out growth opportunities. In March, our sales organization quickly adapted our go-to-market approach to telesales and remote sales due to the reduced access to customer sites. We accelerated our planned 2020 adoption of Microsoft Teams, which has proven instrumental in keeping us connected to our customers. Also in March, we launched eDemo lights, which highlights product features in an easy-to-use video format. Since then, we have had more than 12,000 video co-housing sessions with customers. Enhanced training videos and sample conversations and documents available in our digital library are helping our sales force to generate new sales and cross-selling opportunities. We also have found that the current environment can be an ideal time to showcase our technological expertise through webinars, seminars and online training. Using advanced analytics and sales force guidance to prioritize customer segments have proven to be very important, given the very challenging market conditions. Certain end markets and subsegments such as pharma, biotech, testing labs and food manufacturers are showing growth, while other more industrial end markets are showing significant declines. Through an in-depth customer segment analysis, we have identified thousands of customer sites with growth potential even in the current environment. Redirecting resources to the best growth opportunities has always been fundamental to our sales approach, and our ability to quickly adapt to rapidly changing market conditions is helping dampen impact of this very challenging environment. Finally, we are using sales activity monitoring, our new dashboards to obtain real time information on our opportunity pipeline, quotes and bookings so we can quickly react to market conditions. The resiliency of our results is being driven by the diversity of our end markets and our ability to redirect to the best opportunities. We also have an advantage from the diversity of our product offering. Our Core Industrial business is a good example of this. While our core standard industrial business is being negatively impacted, other businesses within core industrial, including Transportation and Logistics, which is focused on freight forwarding companies is holding up. Our technology leadership is also setting us apart in this environment. For example, last year, we launched an innovative dynamic pallet dimensional, which is helping our customers more easily optimize load planning and accurately charging for freight. Until now, pallet has to be placed on the static dimensional, which slows and disrupt operations. Our new dimensionals captures pallet while they are in motion and can be integrated with our floor scale and software. Another example within Core Industrial is our recent launch of a technology platform for the industrial internet of things. As part of the industrial internet of things, conditioned monitoring and production data collected from devices can be used for predictive maintenance and machine learning to improve equipment uptime and product quality. Our new device provides a seamless exchange of long time critical data between our weighing solutions and the customers\u2019 cloud and ERP systems. It can connect both new scales and the existing scales, enabling the upgrade of the installed base to modern technology and is particularly targeted for customers in chemical, food, pharma and logistics. These are just two examples of our technology leadership within Core Industrial. Within our Lab business, we also benefit from diversity in our end markets and our product range. A prime example is our Process Analytics business in which we are a global leader in real time measurement of key process control parameters. Process Analytics is benefiting from strength in bioproduction, where pH and dissolved oxygen are critical parameters to control processes in bioreactors. In pharmaceutical manufacturing, there are three parameters that require monitoring in an ultra-pure water system : conductivity, TOC and bioburden. We are the only supplier that can provide a portfolio of solutions for online measurement for these three parameters. Beyond biopharma, we have also extended our liquid process analytics offering into the gas analytics market with a unique offering of fast and easy-to-use instruments. Raising concerns for safety and environmental compliance in the chemical end market is also driving growth. Although the chemical market is more challenged this year, we are still seeing good demand for our products. Our Process Analytics is just one example of the breadth of our product offering and diversity of our end markets. That concludes our prepared comments. The current environment continues to be the most challenging. We have been able to quickly adapt and adjust our operating model, including changes necessary in our go-to-market approach. The numerous adjustments we made to our supply chain and manufacturing and the temporary actions we took to our cost structure. While much uncertainty still exists in our markets, we remain confident we can continue to gain share during these challenging times and that we will be well positioned for growth as the recovery gets underway. Now I want to ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. You may proceed. Tycho Peterson : Olivier, I\u2019m wondering if you could break out how much of the beat this quarter came from, end market resiliency versus a redirection of commercial focus to specific areas. And then I guess going forward, I\u2019m curious about the sustainability of the trends. We\u2019ve seen EU research funding have some negative headlines around some of the cuts there. China has got flooding right now. So I\u2019m curious about the headwinds you could talk to in the back half of the year as well. Olivier Filliol : On the first question, very difficult to break that out. I think both played well. I think the key part was that very early on in the crisis, we did our heat maps. We did heat maps on all the different industry segments that we are serving. And then we even went on account level. And using this analysis allowed us then to guide our sales force to the most attractive accounts\\segments. And in that sense, we are in the good position that being so diversified, there were absolutely enough accounts and the industry segments that are really resilient. And yes, as a fact, Mettler-Toledo is, in particular, exposed to biopharma and packaged food testing labs and chemical, and these have certainly been the most resilient ones. You might wonder about chemical as a overall category challenge. But then within chemical, you still have attractive subsegments and accounts, and that was the benefit of the analysis and then leading the sales force to go to this right opportunity. So even within chemical, we could spot quite a few attractive growth segments. Regarding the second question, sustainability, I think the environment remains challenging. I certainly also see that in \u2013 here in Q3, we\u2019re going to experience COVID challenges as well as economic challenges. But I trust that our programs that we put in place will continue to yield good results. I certainly feel that we are gaining share here in a stronger way than usual. And that will also play here in Q3 even that challenges remain. And I\u2019m not particularly concerned about what you just raised like European funding topics or so. Tycho Peterson : And then on margins, a nice job with the cost controls, and you brought up pricing proactively. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about the pricing impact on gross margins and the pricing strategy in this current environment? Shawn Vadala : Yes, Tycho, this is Shawn. Yes. So we were very pleased with our execution on pricing. We really spend a lot of time with the organization to stay disciplined in this environment. We talked about that a little bit, I think, on our last call as well. Overall, our price realization for the quarter was about 2%, which was a similar number to what we experienced in Q1, maybe a notch better. The impact on margins was probably about 90 basis points. But maybe if I stay on margins for a second and then go back to pricing, our margins also benefited from \u2013 good benefits from our Stern Drive program as well as some of the temporary cost savings initiatives that we\u2019ve been talking about. And those benefits were able to offset the decline in the volume as well as some higher costs that we saw in terms of freight. As we look at pricing for the rest of the year, we feel very good about, again, the execution and the momentum in the program. Hey, the environment, I think, is going to be more challenging as we kind of proceed in the lower inflationary environment. But I would say we still feel very strong about the activities around the program. We still feel like we have a great foundation with pricing, as you know, with lower price points selling directly to end users. And we have a wonderful culture around it in the organization. Tycho Peterson : And then just one last clarification on Core Industrial. Can you break out how much of that is actually bioprocessing, biopharma at this point? And any notable vaccine therapy tailwinds from any of the COVID work for you guys at this point? Olivier Filliol : Yes. Actually, that\u2019s basically we want to quantify just isolating bioprocess here for Core Industrial. We have some business in Core Industrial bioprocess, but I don\u2019t want to overstate that. The Lab business certainly is more exposed to bioprocess than core Industrial. And it would be too early to say that we already had some benefit on the production side. Obviously, there are certain companies and are investing in expanding bioprocessing capacity. I would say that has already been a healthy market for quite a while. And we are benefiting, but it\u2019s not big enough here to call out. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. You may proceed. Mike Ryskin : This is Mike Ryskin on Derik\u2019s line. Thanks for taking the question. I\u2019ve got a couple of quick ones. First, could you comment a little bit more detail on the pace of recovery from 2Q to 3Q? You gave some interesting color on what\u2019s going on in Europe and the U.S. by end market. I\u2019m now just wondering, are there any areas that you see sort of recovering back to prior run rate faster than others versus some that are having some bottlenecks? And I was also curious, in 2Q, some of that China strength, you touched on pent-up demand that you saw building over the course of the first quarter. How much of that plus anything do you think could have been sort of spillover from 1Q versus what you think is sort of underlying China results in the second quarter? Olivier Filliol : Yes. So let me take the first one and then Shawn, maybe the second one. So on the first one, indeed, there are differences by industry segment and the regional differences exist, they are related to the timing of the lockdowns. And \u2013 but when I think about the recovery patterns, it\u2019s more about industry segments. And so what we are seeing, the Lab business that is \u2013 has \u2013 had a bigger impact because you have a lot of labs that were closed, people working from home and not having the need for new instruments and making decisions on this one. So for this, you \u2013 we have a decline. And then when the labs reopened, we see a pent-up demand. When it\u2019s about industrial applications, we have a different dynamic. Our customers typically have not closed down the operations. But they are very careful about not disrupting their production. They don\u2019t want to have upgrades of equipment unless it\u2019s necessary and so on. But business has been ongoing, and we certainly have ongoing projects. And accordingly, for industrial applications, I expect less decline, but also not much of a pent-up. As for lab environment, sharper declines with some pent-up. And where you would see it the most extreme, but I want to cautious, it\u2019s not such a big market for us is academia. Academia activity is very much down. And I see that we have much less visits, actually a significant decline of sales visits to academia. We have less leads generation and less quoting opportunity, but I would expect that this will recover. So \u2013 but that\u2019s the most extreme. On the other hand, you have, for example, pharma production, where things were going quite normal and even project activities for the future still look very healthy. Shawn Vadala : Yes. Mike, so... Olivier Filliol : Shawn you want to add... Shawn Vadala : Yes. In terms of the second part of your question, yes, I think it\u2019s a fair comment. It\u2019s hard to obviously always quantify these things. But if we look at China, they had a much more severe decline in the first quarter, given the nature of their lockdown. So in Q1, as a reminder, they were down 13%. And here in Q2, we had 8% growth. We particularly felt like our Industrial business there benefited from some of that pent-up demand in China. If you kind of like looked at the different pieces of the business in China in Q2, our Laboratory business was up high single digit, while our Industrial business was up low double digit. Mike Ryskin : Okay. Great. And can I ask a quick one on the P&L then? Some of your comments about 3Q, I think you said a 4% to 5% decline in OpEx year-over-year. It was about an 8% in the second quarter. Some of those cost initiatives you\u2019re taking, how temporary are they? And is there \u2013 is this cost that sort of permanently cut out and never comes back? Because it\u2019s tied to travel, things like that. How much of it needs to be caught up later either in 4Q or 2021? Shawn Vadala : Yes. No, as we said before, and it\u2019s consistent to how we see it right now. Most of the actions are temporary in nature. We are continuing to assess the environment and adapt our plans accordingly. I think we\u2019re very proud of the organization and the agility in the organization. Of course, as we proceed throughout the situation, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have some learnings and identify savings as we normally would do that we\u2019ll consider as we go into next year. But at this point, kind of too early to kind of comment on anything for next year or for Q4. I think the key is that we stay agile, and we continue to monitor things and adapt accordingly. Mike Ryskin : Got it. Thanks Operator : And our next question comes from Dan Arias with Stifel. You may proceed. Dan Macek : Great. Thanks for the question. This is Dan Macek on for Dan Arias. Just thinking about coming out of COVID in China, are you seeing share gains? Or do you see the potential for share gains as some of the smaller players could be shaken out there? Olivier Filliol : So in general, yes, we are convinced that we are winning share. No questions. The one hesitation when you use the word shakeout, we have hardly seen exits in our industry. This \u2013 our competitors all benefit also from a certain installed base. And in China, there are a lot of competitors, but there are smaller competitors operating more on a regional level. And they don\u2019t compete in the similar quality and price range. So therefore, when I talk about share gain, I really mean mostly to the bigger global maybe regional players. The small Chinese companies that you are referring to that might be shaked out has not been really key competitors for us and I don\u2019t think will change too much in the future. But I want to reinforce that this environment gives us the opportunity to really win share to better superior execution. I think all this go-to-market change programs that we have in place have been very beneficial. And in that sense, I feel that our numbers that we reported exceed the market growth. Dan Macek : Okay. And then recognizing, it\u2019s obviously a very fluid environment. I believe in the second quarter \u2013 sorry, the first quarter commentary, you thought maybe Europe would be a little worse than Americas. It just turned out to kind of be the opposite. But is there anything more you can provide there? Or maybe we should know in terms of what was different from expectations and maybe if that could affect the outlook going forward? Olivier Filliol : Yes. I think the European situation got for us also better because the lockdowns were released earlier than we expected. In general, the COVID health crisis in Europe developed more favorable than we thought. And then what\u2019s also Product Inspection in Europe did better than expected. And in the U.S., the retail business did a little worse than expected. So we have here maybe the glow \u2013 the overall environment that play the role and then business line specific things that impacted us. Dan Macek : Thanks. I appreciate it. Operator : And our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. You may proceed. Vijay Kumar : Thanks for taking my question. Maybe the first one, Olivier, for you. You made some interesting comments about coming out of COVID. You\u2019re really well positioned for share gains. I\u2019m curious, has this changed? How do you go to the customers? How do you reach out to them? And I\u2019m wondering if it has any margin implications when you look at over the medium term. So I\u2019m looking at the guide here, it still suggests that margins are going to be down this year, if I\u2019m doing the maths correct. So maybe just address on coming out of COVID from a margin perspective, if anything\u2019s changed for you guys? Olivier Filliol : Yes. So I\u2019m going to have Shawn to comment specifically the margin evolution also going forward. But just a quick comment, as go-to-market change that we do has absolutely an operating cost benefit at this stage. Of course, travel and expenses is very significantly down. And we have a certain productivity gain because we can operate here without traveling. However, this is not something that will stay in that way when it comes to operating expenses. We certainly plan to go back in an operating mode where we want to see our customers where traveling will play an important role. But there are going to be a lot of changed management that we implemented here in Q2 that we\u2019re going to keep. And this is not just about remote selling. It\u2019s all about the sales force guidance topics. The whole crisis has helped us to accelerate many Spinnaker practices and innovate new things and introducing new sales tools that we will maintain and will be very powerful for us to drive organic growth and drive share gains. But I would not take them as important driver for margin expansion. I see it much more a driver for share gains. The margin improvements come actually from all the other programs like Stern Drive, pricing, material cost savings and so on. Now maybe back to Shawn to comment quickly about the margin expansions in Europe. Shawn Vadala : Yes. So Vijay, just to clarify, for the full year, we would expect our operating margin to be up about 20 basis points, and this is the midpoint of our guidance, by the way. But the midpoint of our guidance would be, our operating margin would be up 20 basis points for the full year. And then if we look specifically at Q3, we\u2019d be up about 40 basis points. One thing I think you\u2019re going to see in the second half of the year versus Q2 is that, as I mentioned before, some of these temporary cost reduction initiatives, we\u2019re going to slowly start to pull back on some of those initiatives during the second half of the year. Vijay Kumar : That\u2019s extremely helpful, Shawn. And just one clarification. Did I hear you guys on the $700 million towards share repurchases? Because I\u2019m looking at the guidance, EPS at the high end. If 3Q comes in at the high end, the implied growth \u2013 EPS growth for 3Q versus Q4, I mean, it suggests all of the share repos being done in 3Q. So maybe just clarify the share repo comments. Shawn Vadala : Yes. No, no. Happy to clarify. So as a reminder \u2013 so the $700 million would be for the full year. As a reminder, we did $200 million in Q1. We expect to do about $200 million in Q3 and then the remainder would be in Q4. Vijay Kumar : Got you. Thanks guys. Operator : And our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo. You may proceed. [Operator Instructions] Dan Leonard : Apologies, I\u2019m here now. So for starters, can you please elaborate on trends you\u2019re seeing in the packaged food in Food Retail industries? Olivier, I know you mentioned site access and customer priorities are still an issue. But it seems like your customers\u2019 fortunes have improved, just people are cooking from home. The earnings of your customers have been pretty good this week. Any comments on whether this is showing up in your funnel or future demand forecasts? Olivier Filliol : Yes. We remain actually very positive about the Product Inspection business. As you highlight, it\u2019s an end-user industry that did well in this COVID crisis. We have really great value propositions, and we really see that as an attractive end-user market. In the short term, it\u2019s going to remain challenging. It is really that all these food companies have different other priorities. Their number one priority is really to keep production up, and they are very reluctant to let any people in their plants. And their engineers are actually working on other topics, mainly really to keep the operations up and running. I see or unsee that less than right, and in particular, true in Americas. I think in Europe, the situation is a little bit better as well as in Asia. But it\u2019s going to take still here a couple of months before the situation will improve. But I\u2019m confident here for the midterm. When it comes to Food Retail, that\u2019s a little bit of a more complex one in the sense that we \u2013 in Food Retail, we depend on big projects, sometimes also tenders. We did already know early in the year, even before COVID that we\u2019re going to have here some challenging quarters. And we clearly also talked about that in previous calls. And of course, the COVID situation didn\u2019t help here in the sense that we provide you equipment for stores and stores here, customers, again, don\u2019t want us to \u2013 or customers don\u2019t want to make any changes in stores at this current stage and a certain reluctance to make investments because a lot of the retail business is also moving to online. But we do expect that the second part of the year will be better than the first part. And that\u2019s consistent also with what we have guided here early in the year. Dan Leonard : Okay. That\u2019s helpful color. And Olivier, as a follow-up, I think you made a comment in your prepared remarks about not having the same quote pipeline entering Q3 as you did entering Q2. Did I hear that correctly? And if so, could you elaborate on the significance of that? Is that a function of challenges to build a quote funnel when folks are working from home, staying at home? Any color you could offer on that? Olivier Filliol : Yes. So indeed, the home office of our decision makers and customers are relevant enough. But it\u2019s also that fewer new projects are initiated, maybe also fewer new expansions, CapEx investments and so on. So we did anticipate that. And if you can imagine, leads generation, for example, and quote request were certainly challenged here in Q2 and were at a lower level than we would usually have but then all our own activities and tactics here did offset a good part of that. And so that gives us the confidence that the guidance that we have here in Q3 that things will be modestly better here than Q2 is actually well founded, even that we have this challenge that the pipeline is different than when we entered Q2. Dan Leonard : Okay. I appreciate thoughts. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research. You may proceed. Steve Beuchaw : Good afternoon and thanks for the time here. I wanted to ask a couple of maybe bigger picture questions as your customer base has been parsed pretty finely here. The first one I wanted to ask for Olivier is, if I think back historically about what has made Mettler such a good grower really across the board. Your proficiency in terms of identifying opportunities and being really nimble in terms of how to direct the sales force has been such a big part of that. And you\u2019ve referenced that a couple of times you\u2019re on the call that you\u2019re doing that a little bit more acutely and in a more adaptive way, given that the environment has evolved so fast. I wonder if you could maybe put a different lens on it, and say, okay, we may have learned a few things in the last few months, which have been so tough for everyone about how to do that, about how to do what we do. I have a hunch that you have some new ideas and you\u2019re thinking in new ways about how to leverage your phenomenal CRM and data capabilities, not just right now and in this environment, but into the future. I wonder if you could speak to that. And then I have a follow-up. Olivier Filliol : Yes, yes, yes. I would phrase it that way. We all recognize today even more how powerful it is what we have here. And how powerful our data cubes are that we build based on internal data, CRM data, but very much also based on external data. And these data cubes that we use for data analytics is so powerful that we could do, for example, this Industry segment heat maps. This is the heat maps we did, basically, in Excel with different data points that we took from banks, from statistics, from whatever. And then we did overlay this heat maps over our data cubes and then could really generate some great sales force guidance information. So the technology, the data has been around, but we could apply it in an extremely fast way. And of course, when you are in a crisis mode, the openness of your management team and the sales force around the world is a totally different one. So I would phrase it that way. The crisis allowed us to accelerate change management like we would have never expected it before. It accelerated in that sense the power of the tools that we have. And the beauty was that you certainly have a sales force that has more capacity, not just because you have less customer demand leads but because they didn\u2019t have to travel. And so they are open to test new things. They see the success, and that\u2019s, of course, reinforcing. So yes, we are extremely excited when we look forward in using all these tools. No questions. Steve Beuchaw : Okay. Much appreciated. I love data almost as much as you do, I think. The other thing that I wanted to ask about, it\u2019s actually a reference back to a comment that you made on the 1Q call, which I thought was really interesting. You were one of the early observers to say, look, this is going to be an enormous disruption, but at some point out in the future, there\u2019s going to be a lot of pent-up demand. And let\u2019s think about this as a disruption. Maybe I\u2019ll borrow the Ben Bernanke reference and say, it\u2019s sort of like a hurricane in a way, right? It sweeps through and a lot happens, but you come out the other side. I wonder how your thinking is evolving on the pent-up demand concept, not necessarily for 3Q. This is really not a 2020 question at all. But if you think about whether there might be pent-up demand in 2021 or even beyond, what do you think that\u2019s most likely to emerge? And what have you learned about that over the last few months? And then I\u2019ll jump back in queue. Olivier Filliol : There were other people that were more aggressive in the sense that they saw a V-shape, and the V-Shape was certainly hinting to a big pent-up. I think we were definitely more cautious on that, even talking about a new shape recovery, but one that will offer pent-up demand in different application, industry sectors and so on. And we have definitely experienced that. I think China is a very good example. In China, we have experienced already good pent-up demand here in Q2. I think for Europe and Americas, it\u2019s not going to happen in the same way as in China, but there are certain applications\\industry segments where I think we will have similar effects like, for example, when certain labs will reopen, we will see that they will set up their orders. And there are certainly also areas like we talked about product inspection and so on where things are on hold and then will come back. The good thing about this, I do not expect that it would happen all at the same time in all industry and regions at the same time. And so it\u2019s going to be spread here across the next couple of quarters. And as you hinted into 2021, I do not expect that this thing \u2013 this whole pent-up demand will be a Q4 topic at all. So it will be gradual. But let\u2019s also keep in mind, there is an offsetting to this, and this is the global recession. There is a recession out there, and we are not immune to that. And so even that we have easier comparisons maybe next year and we have pent-up demand, we face also a recession. And so it\u2019s very much as it was going to be about us executing very well to tap in the growth opportunities where they are. Steve Beuchaw : I really appreciate. Always help for perspective, Olivier. Operator : And our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. You may proceed. Patrick Donnelly : Olivier, maybe just on China, you guys put up pretty strong results there. There\u2019s been a lot of mixed data points across the industry. Your business seems to be performing a little bit better than peers. Can you just dive into what\u2019s leading the recovery there? And then maybe just more specifically in terms of end market trends, how you saw performance across the different industrial customers, academic side and biopharma? Olivier Filliol : Okay. I want to start, our team in China did just a fantastic job. I really think they executed extremely well. We were one of the first company and factory that was back live. We had, in that sense, an excellent context to serve our customer actually really very, very well. I had also our market organization in China that even throughout the lockout \u2013 the lockdown was reaching out to customers not just in a sales mode, but also kind of be in front of them to making sure that we are available, that we are helping. And then when the lockdown was relieved or people could really get back to work, huge efforts to really get our revenue back on track, and our Chinese team did also execute all these go-to-market initiatives that I talked about. This played particularly well into China because you had a situation where there were enough customers that went back to investment mode. The liquidity in the Chinese market is good for state-owned companies and medium to large companies. What my understanding is that the smaller companies, however, still have a difficult time, but these are not our most important customers. So yes, I would say, actually, a good market environment for us with excellent execution. Good market environment because you have, particularly the biopharma, the testing labs, the partially also chemical that are doing well. This is \u2013 actually, I would say, throughout Asia, we see quite good dynamics, but then in China, in particular. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. Great. And then maybe just one on the cash flow, nice performance there. It sounds like CapEx came down a little bit. Was that more on the timing side? Or was it a concerted effort to pull back? And then just how should we be thinking about that side heading into the second half of the year? Shawn Vadala : Yes. So in terms of cash flow, hey, we\u2019re very pleased, of course, with the results in the quarter. In terms of cash flow \u2013 I mean, I\u2019m sorry, in terms of CapEx, I mean, some of that was timing. If you look at Q2 of last year, it was a bit of a higher number. We have some facility spend topics going on there a year ago. But otherwise, hey, we\u2019re being disciplined, of course, with how we\u2019re managing the cash flow. But I \u2013 but in terms of like the project activity and things that investing in the business, we\u2019re still investing and doing the right things for the long-term health of the franchise. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : And our next question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. You may proceed. Steve Willoughby : Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Two things for you. One, I guess, first, if you could just comment on your performance and your outlook within your pipette business. And then second, last quarter \u2013 I know Olivier just gave some good color as it relates to China. But last quarter, you were talking about how you thought you could potentially see some stimulus in China. I just was wondering if you still think that is the case. There\u2019s also been some talk about maybe some budget cuts in China. So just anything from a monetary standpoint in China in addition to the pipettes? Olivier Filliol : Yes. Hey, on pipette, there \u2013 initially, the pipette business was quite impacted by lab closures and that was a bit of a challenge. But then at the same time, the \u2013 of course, there is more research activities also around COVID that has been beneficial. At the beginning of the quarter, there was also some supply chain topics for some of the competitors that we didn\u2019t experience and that we benefited. So an interesting dynamic throughout the quarter, but then certainly happy how they performed in the full quarter. And then just quickly on the stimulus. Yes, stimulus is \u2013 we see it in China. There are different subsectors that benefit from that, particularly in the area of public health, pharma, CDC testing labs. There is also somewhat the stimulus money that would go to 5G, energy and power segments where we benefit a bit, but I would say, less so than everything that goes to public health. However, I don\u2019t want to overstate here. The impact, I would say, in Q2 that wasn\u2019t particularly significant, but we should see some benefits here in the second half. Steve Willoughby : Thanks very much. Mary Finnegan : And operator, are there any final questions? Operator : And our next question comes from Dan Brennan with UBS. You may proceed. Dan Brennan : Thank you very much. Last but not least, hopefully, congrats on the quarter, everyone. So maybe first question would just be, Olivier, as you\u2019ve come off historic lows and then have a steep ascend here. And I\u2019m just wondering, the second half guide no longer implies that you may be a gradual ascend. But I\u2019m just wondering, is there any reason why we shouldn\u2019t see a typical snapback in demand from Mettler come a few quarters after the PMI recovery, say, as we look into early 2021? Olivier Filliol : I would be very cautious with that assumption. First, PMI is one indicator, but it\u2019s not really the best one. There is not a super good correlation here. And there is definitely so many other effects. Look, I made the statement before. I feel very strong about our execution. I feel strong that we can win market share. But I still believe that there is a recession here that will also impact us. And in that sense, next year will continue to be challenging for us, but there is some positives that will help us. Comparisons will be easier. Pent-up demand, we\u2019ll see some of it. But then offsetting is a recession that will go on, and I \u2013 at this stage, I\u2019m reasonably confident about Asia, but Europe and Americas will continue to have a difficult economic environment. Dan Brennan : And then maybe just one on lab, which all the businesses did better than we had forecasted, lab down for certainly above our low double-digit decline. Just wondering, like, within lab, could you just speak to some of the different customer groups? Because I know it\u2019s not a \u2013 it\u2019s somewhat of a heterogeneous customer. But maybe give us a little color like what happened within your Lab business across your key customers? And maybe how those trended through the quarter and kind of what\u2019s expected in Lab going forward in the back half? Olivier Filliol : Yes. So maybe not surprising. The customer groups that have labs that were closed was the most challenging ones for us. The more resilient pieces were the quality labs, the testing labs that continued to do well. And then, for example, in biopharma, you can imagine that there is a lot of our lab equipment also used in production areas or in QC labs, that was actually a favorable environment. And then we have businesses in life science that I hinted before, for example, for the pipette business a bit well. And then last but not least, Process Analytics did particularly also well. Process Analytics is more exposed to biopharma, and that has been an attractive segment to be in. Dan Brennan : Great. Thanks, Olivier. Operator : This concludes our Q&A portion of today\u2019s conference. And I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to your host for any closing remarks. Mary Finnegan : Thank you, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this evening. As always, if you have any questions or follow-up, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out. Take care, everyone. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Let me now turn the call over to Olivier. Olivier Filliol : Thank you, Mary. Good evening everyone. I hope this continues to find you safe and well. I'm calling in from Switzerland tonight, while Shawn and Mary are in Columbus, Ohio. I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Shawn will provide details on our financials. I will then add some additional comments, and we will open the lines for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter are on page 3 of the presentation. Local currency sales increased 6% in the third quarter, which was much better than we expected. Demand in our end markets continues to be negatively impacted by COVID-19. However, we had excellent growth in China and the performance of our Lab business was very strong. With our strong product portfolio and the innovative sales and marketing strategy, which we have successfully adapted through the challenges of the new environment, we believe we are gaining share. We have very strong growth in operating margins, due to the benefits of some of our temporary cost actions, as well as our ongoing margin and productivity initiatives. Shawn Vadala : Thanks, Olivier, and hello everyone. Sales were $807.4 million in the quarter, an increase of 6% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased 7%, as currency benefited sales growth by 1% in the quarter. On slide number 4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales increased 3% in the Americas, 4% in Europe, and 10% in Asia/Rest of World. China local currency sales increased 17% in the quarter. The next slide shows sales growth by region year-to-date. Local currency sales declined 1% in the Americas, 2% in Europe, and increased 1% in Asia/Rest of World. China local currency sales increased 5% on a year-to-date basis. On slide number 6, we outline local currency sales growth by product area. For the quarter, Laboratory sales increased 9%, Industrial increased 1%, with Core Industrial up 8%, and Product Inspection down 9%. Food Retail increased 5% in the quarter. One question I know you have is, how much benefit did we have from COVID tailwinds in the quarter. We estimate our local currency sales growth benefited between 1% and 2% in the third quarter from COVID. Olivier Filliol : Thank you, Shawn. Let me start with some comments on our operating results. Our Lab business had outstanding growth in the quarter. Pipettes had excellent growth and benefited from COVID related activities. Process Analytics and automated chemistry also had very good growth, driven by the overall strength in biopharma trends. Most other product lines showed modest growth. Sales growth in all regions was strong. We expect the strong biopharma trends to continue to be favorable as we enter 2021 and believe the first half of the year will benefit from a vaccine research and testing as well as bioproduction scale-up and production. We spent a disproportionate amount of R&D and sales and marketing investments in Lab. And believe we are well positioned to capture growth. In terms of our Industrial business, Core Industrial was up 8%, driven by strong double-digit growth in China and slight decline in both, Europe and the Americas. China is benefiting from strong demand, across most product lines, in part due to pent-up demand. Overall, we are very pleased with the resiliency of our Core Industrial businesses in 2020, given the challenges of the end-market. Our outlook for this business is solid, as we expect to continue to identify pockets of growth. However, we are not immune to the overall economy. Product Inspection was down a little more than we expected in the quarter, with declines in all regions. In the near-term, market conditions continued to be challenging, as large packaged food companies are focused on COVID-related safety, in the manufacturing site and on operational execution. We are more optimistic for Q4 and are well positioned once packaged food companies return to a more normal operational mode and believe we will benefit from pent-up demand. Mary Finnegan : Operator? Operator :  Our first question will come from Vijay\u2026 Mary Finnegan : Operator, hold on just one second. Olivier, are you still on the line? Operator, I think, Olivier was disconnected. Can you connect him? Operator : Okay. One moment, please. Hi, is this Olivier? Hello, is this Olivier? Mary Finnegan : Operator, we are on here, but should Olivier just dial-in again to the same number? Operator : He is dialing in. Olivier Filliol : Yes. Where did \u2013 you need to guide me. I don\u2019t know\u2026 Operator : Olivier, has rejoined us. Mary Finnegan : Thank you. Olivier Filliol : Okay. Yes, I am back. Apparently, I will be to update soon and just signaling me by video that I \u2013 where I stopped. So I will continue on and I will just finish instead talking about marketing initiative and I am coming here at this point. Digital sales and marketing tools are one component. We also use advanced data analytics and machine learning to identify thousands and thousands of customer sites that have potential sales opportunity. During this past year we also leveraged heat map of customer segments that helped us navigate COVID resilience and recovery. Internally these opportunities generate sales alert that we provide to our front-end organization. The alerts include insightful information such as product descriptions cross-selling opportunities, contact data, CRM activity, site pictures and specific value-selling guide for associated products and more. We have structured our front-end so that back office sales resources can qualify these sales alerts. They have knowledge of our customers and can determine if the computer-generated alerts have the expected potential and if so the ideal timing for customer interaction. This helps us guide our direct field sales force to the best opportunities and with all the necessary materials for an effective customer interaction. We also leverage our front-end via telesales reps to sell to smaller or less complicated accounts. The digital sales tools available to our field force are also fully available to our telesales teams thereby supporting their efforts to articulate the value of our products to customers. With the investments we have made in inside and telesales resources over the last several years our front-end is now structured. The field reps spend the majority of their time on non-customers or existing customers with strong cross-selling potential. The combination of our strong product portfolio, the innovations we have made to our sales and marketing tools and the investments we have made over several years to our front-end organization is leading to accelerated market share gains versus our direct competitors. There are still relatively small gains overall but they have allowed us to help offset the challenging market conditions of the COVID environment. The COVID challenges have helped us accelerate improvement not only in our sales techniques and approach but also in our margins and productivity initiatives. Our supply chain teams around the world had to overcome numerous obstacles this year including obtaining necessary protection supplies compensating for component shortages, orchestrating global safety stock, navigating freight capacity and adapting to changing trade restrictions. We were one of the first manufacturing facilities to have opened in China and we did not have a single day of shutdown in our western facility. At the same time the team continues to make progress on their Stern Drive initiatives which are focused on productivity improvements in our manufacturing and back-office operations. Globally more than 130 projects have been completed this year with 350 projects currently underway. That concludes our prepared comments. The current environment continues to be the most challenging and unique we have ever faced. We are executing very well and while much uncertainty still exist in our markets, I remain confident, we can continue to gain share regardless of economic conditions and are well positioned for solid results in 2020 and 2021. I want now to ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator :  Your first question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a really good print here. Olivier, maybe on the China comments, the 17% growth here, could you maybe help clarify what portion of that 17% was perhaps pent-up demand? And I think you guys mentioned one to two points of COVID tailwinds. Is the COVID tailwind the same as pent-up demand, or is that a separate item? Olivier Filliol : Let me do the second part first, because that's easy to answer. No, it's not correlated with pent-up. The tailwind from COVID is mainly coming in tips business that we have with our Rainin and biotech businesses. They serve the testing markets, the COVID testing markets. So we got that tailwind as pent-up is not labeled that way. China -- to isolate the pent-up aspect of the China growth is not so easy to quantify. But, I think another way to look at our numbers in China is the year-to-date. As you will recall, in the early part of the year China had a significant decline and here we have seen a very good recovery in Q3. And in that sense, there is a significant aspect of that is pent-up demand. We see kind of a V-shaped recovery. But beyond that, I certainly feel we have won good market share gains here in China. The team has executed extremely well during the whole COVID crisis. We -- when there was a lockdown, our Chinese team continued to stay in contact with customers. We were very fast in bringing deliveries back and have certainly gained a lot of confidence with the customer base. And then, we had the whole go-to-market change in management that I described before in the prepared remarks. This is -- we did roll that out globally, but also particularly in China, and that has benefited us also in Q3. So, different aspects that drove very nice growth, but pent-up demand, was certainly one of them. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful. And then now for my follow-up, I guess when you look at the 2021 preliminary outlook 4% to 6%. I'm curious are you assuming any share gains within that 4% to 6%? And perhaps comment on what's being assumed for the different segments. Olivier Filliol : Yeah. So let me take the first part and then Shawn can take the second part. In terms of share gain, yes, we do count on share gains. But I -- our whole strategy is not for bold share gains but actually share gains every year a few basis points, because that adds up to something significant when we think about organic growth. We have experienced here maybe in the last two quarters was a bigger shift in share gains. I would hope that in next year we can still also have maybe a little bit an above average share gain but not in the same magnitude as we have seen in the last two quarters. Shawn, maybe to the second part of the question? Shawn Vadala : Yes. Hey, Vijay. Let me start first with the product categories, and then I'll talk about the regions. So for 2021, we currently would expect the Lab business to be mid to high-single-digit growth. In the Industrial business, we're currently thinking the Product Inspection business will be about mid-single-digit growth with the Core Industrial business being more like low single-digit growth. And we expect Food Retailing to be more like low-single-digit growth. From a regional perspective, we would -- we're currently thinking that Europe will be more low to mid-single-digit growth while the Americas and China will be more like mid-single-digit growth. Vijay Kumar : Appreciate the comments, guys. Thank you. Shawn Vadala : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Tycho Peterson : Hey, thanks. Actually Shawn, I want to pick up right where you left-off on Europe, being flat in the fourth quarter low to mid-single-digit next year. Obviously COVID cases going up a lot there. The Horizon's 2020 budget has been cut. What gives you kind of confidence in that market being relatively stable? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. I mean hey, Tycho, I think our guidance right now is based upon -- we're assuming market conditions remain the same in terms of where we sit today. As we kind of think about COVID cases, of course, it's a very fluid situation. We're currently not experiencing anything in our business where customers are not allowing us on-site to do installations or we're not seeing it affect their behavior at this time. But of course, there's certainly risk with COVID and we certainly acknowledge that. But as you can kind of see too our guidance for the fourth quarter for Europe is flattish. So it's modestly a little bit down from where we were in the third quarter. And then for next year, again, we're thinking more like low to mid-single-digit growth. Tycho Peterson : And then, Product Inspection, you mentioned that was a little bit worse than expected. You're talking about mid-single-digit growth there next year. So, are you getting leading indicators from your consumer, packaged goods customers and others that that demand will come back sooner rather than later? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. I mean it's an interesting one. We certainly have conversations with customers that indicate that there's certainly an interest to do projects. But right now, we do see that a lot of customers are distracted with their own operational challenges at the moment, not -- in terms of having the time to really initiate new projects is something that we're still looking forward to. But nonetheless, we -- from a cadence perspective, we do feel like the fourth quarter will be better than Q3 and we certainly are more optimistic going into next year. And as you know, we feel very good about this business in terms of our overall competitive advantages and the general dynamics that drive growth in this business around topics like food safety and things like that. So, we're much more optimistic for the mid-term. It's just a little bit difficult to tell at exactly what time we'll start to see customers returning to more of an investment mode. Tycho Peterson : And then lastly, for Olivier, there was a lot of talk on the call about market share gains, and that's great to see. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about where those gains have been the greatest. Anything you can kind of quantify? And then, with the digital infrastructure now built out, how will they step up share gains going forward? Could they start to accelerate? Olivier Filliol : Yes. Actually, quantifying it very difficult. Of course, we don't have particular market data from our direct competitors. We have some data points from our peers that give us a lot of comfort. I think it's more information that we get from our markets around the world. We see it also in terms of many new customers that we can gain. We have some KPIs that we use internally to monitor how much of our business comes from existing customers and how much comes from new customers, that all gives us these indications that we have been winning share. I would be really hard pressed to come up with a number. Also what I want to say is, we feel this is something we achieved across the world across businesses. And this is also very much driven by all these programs that I described that we apply really across everything. What we certainly also see the biggest benefit is in our direct business and our direct business has been also growing faster than for example the indirect business. That's probably another indication why these programs work really well. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Mike Ryskin : Hi. It's Mike Ryskin on for Derik. Thank you for taking the question. First I want to follow up on the guidance comments for 2021 both on the top line and on the adjusted EPS. Just curious as you obviously posted strong results in 3Q and you've got a mid-single-digit guide for 4Q when you go into next year you're going to be facing significantly easier comps in the first half of the year and your comp for all of the fiscal year '20 is going to be a little bit easier? So I'm just wondering is this more of a -- not a lot of visibility in the second half of the year? I know we walked through some of the geographies and the business segments. But just curious where you're seeing the puts and takes given what should be a very easy setup for first half 2021? Shawn Vadala : Yes. Mike I'll take this one. It's Shawn. Hey as you know we're -- we don't have a lot of backlog in our business. So we're only about 1.5 months of backlog at a time. So of course it's always a little bit challenging to put out our first guidance for next year. As we kind of look towards the year you're right, we will benefit from easier comparisons in the first half of the year. But then we look at topics like China in Q3 of next year and we'll have more difficult comparisons there. So overall I would say, we feel good about the business. We feel good about our execution. We feel good about our momentum. but it's always a little bit challenging to kind of -- to guide with some of the uncertainty out there. If I look at like maybe puts and takes I would say that China is always one that can be an upside or a downside. China we always like to say things can move -- can change rather quickly in China. And I think over the last nine months we'd certainly see things change in both directions very quickly there. So we're looking for upsides and downsides. I'd say, I point out and highlight China. I think another one that I would also highlight is Product Inspection. It's also a similar size of our total business. We feel very good about this business as I mentioned with Tycho's question. That's also a business that can have upside or downside based upon some of the dynamics that I described earlier. Mike Ryskin : Great. That's helpful. And then a quick follow-up along the same lines. If we sort of look at the P&L. if my math is right for 2021 obviously you're guiding to about 40 basis points of margin expansion give or take on the operating margin. So just trying to think through what changed in 2020 relative to your initial expectations? Is this just a lot of the costs that you pulled back on this year coming back, or is this additional incremental investments on top of what would normally happen just sort of looking at the '20 to 2021 move there? Shawn Vadala : Yes. So I think we'll probably do a little bit better than that Mike, but you're right it's going to be a little bit lower than our typical guidance of 70 to 100 basis point range which we still feel very good about from a medium term perspective. We also have to keep in mind that we're coming off of a strong year of operating profit margin growth in 2020 of 120 basis points. In terms of the program supporting our margin, we feel really good about the momentum that we have in terms of the pricing program as well as our Stern Drive program. But you're right one of the things that will be maybe a little bit of a headwind next year is the temporary nature of some of the cost savings measures that we had in 2020 that we now need to bring back into the cost structure for 2021. Mike Ryskin : Okay. Excellent. Thanks so much. Shawn Vadala : Thanks. Operator : Your next question will come from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Brandon Couillard : Hey good afternoon. Shawn sticking with the 2021 outlook. Free cash flow guidance a little below 10%. Can you speak to any working capital needs for next year? And then what are you penciling in for CapEx? Shawn Vadala : Yes. Just one second Brandon. Let me pull it up here. So let me start with the second one. So for CapEx we have $103 million in our model for next year. So that's going to be up about $10 million from this year. We have some facility investments that we're going to be making in the first half of next year. Otherwise we feel good about our overall free cash flow growth next year. I think it's going to be kind of in line with our operating profit growth generally. There's always maybe timing topics from one year to another. But I think especially if you look at like the two years combined like this year and next year overall, we're very pleased with the growth. I mean you saw the cash flow generation that we had here in the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis really, really impressed with the execution in the organization on a lot of different management of cash initiatives and I feel like we'll continue to have that momentum as we kind of go into next year as well. Brandon Couillard : And then one more. Can you talk about what's embedded in terms of net pricing capture in 2021? And as we think about gross -- or margin expansion generally would that be leaned more on the gross margin side than OpEx given some of your comments about some of those cost items coming back into the P&L? Shawn Vadala : Yes. Sure. So in terms of our gross margin for next year right now like for this year right now we're we did just over 2% in terms of price realization for Q3 and I think we'll probably be at that kind of a level for 2020. As we look to 2021, we do have good momentum in the program but at the same time we're looking at a lower inflationary environment. So at this point in time we're right now thinking that we'd be more like in the 1.5% kind of a range for next year for price realization. And then if we kind of like look at the overall gross margin expansion next year probably something in the 30 kind of basis point kind of a range that would exclude maybe a little bit of unfavorable effect of currency. One of the things that we have as a headwind also to our gross margin next year is going to be some of these temporary cost savings that we talked about that come back that will also be a little bit of a headwind in terms of our gross margin expansion next year as well. Brandon Couillard : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : This is Jesse on for Patrick. Just wanted to touch on the 1% to 2% of COVID-related tailwinds. Wondering if you could break that down a little bit further between the areas you laid out between testing and vaccine research and bioprocessing? And then just curious what's implied there for 4Q 2020 and 2021 guidance? Olivier Filliol : So as mentioned it is related to the tips business and pipettes. It's related to testing kits or for testing centers where pipettes and the tips are used. That's the part that we call tailwind because, obviously, this is tied to the number of tests being conducted and the tips demand associated with that. This can have a very high volatility in demand and we see actually that volatility also following the waves and different regions. So the 1% to 2% was for Q3. For Q4, we would expect more like 1%. And when we think about next year, we could still see some tailwinds at the beginning of the year and depending how COVID evolves it would start to diminish and then we would start to have some headwinds from a comparative standpoint. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then just looking back at the earlier days the pandemic in relation to China saw a pretty strong drop-off in 1Q, but strong recovery in 2Q and 3Q. So as we look ahead would we expect kind of a similar dynamic if there is -- the country was to shutdown kind of due to the resurgence of cove cases, or do you think kind of with this new go-to-market strategy you can see more resiliency within China even if we do see quite a big resurgence of COVID this quarter and into 2021? Shawn Vadala : Yes. I think what changed is every country learns to deal with COVID in a more differentiated way. I see that I experienced that myself being based in Switzerland and Europe, the second wave has a totally different impact on the business world. And it is because governments react differently, but of course also because business and individual people react differently to that. We are so much more knowledgeable about things. We have today face masks that protect us and so on. And so the B2B world that we are living in is not impacted as much anymore. I see also the reaction of all the -- our customers to be much more controlled in that we have semi-lockdowns for example in Europe right now we don't see it in the same way in order entry leads generation and so on. And the second factor is what you just also mentioned that we have already adjusted our go-to-market approaches. And in that sense I do expect a much smaller impact on our business from any second wave that are -- is taking place right now. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please proceed with your question. Jack Meehan : Thanks. Good afternoon. I was hoping you could tease out for us just how much of the sales in the quarter you think might have benefited from some, sort of, catch-up from earlier in the year? And are there any dynamics looking at sort of the three businesses you should just be keeping in mind going into the fourth quarter that catch-up might impact? Shawn Vadala : Yes. Hey, Jack, this is Shawn. Hey, of course, it's always difficult to try to know or to quantify that. I think the one region that certainly stood out the most from our perspective was China in terms of catch-up and as we talked about we definitely see more of a V-shaped recovery in China compared to maybe some of the other regions. In terms of some of the other geographies it's a little bit more difficult to say. Was there a little bit of catch-up in Europe? Maybe -- but very difficult to say. But I think I'd maybe just then kind of pivot towards how we're currently seeing the fourth quarter in terms of guidance and those types of factors would have been considerations for us as we kind of provided our guidance for the fourth quarter. Jack Meehan : Great. And then wanted to follow up on R&D investment. Just a clarification. I think I heard 5% of sales, but I wasn't sure if that was for the full year or for the fourth quarter. And regardless I think you're calling for a nice step-up going into the fourth quarter. Just maybe talk about where you're finding new projects. And do you think you'll continue to invest at these probably more normalized rates in 2021? Olivier Filliol : So the 5% is more for the full year. And the 5% is actually a good number for also mid-term. We always have a little bit of a fluctuation from quarter-to-quarter. But, yes, when you think about it -- when it's independent of product launches or particular events then the 5% applies. The reason why you saw this summer a bit of a slowdown in the spending was on one hand the timing of projects including also product launches and some of the temporary cost measures that we had including also curtail by the furloughs in Europe had also some impact on the R&D spending. And in that sense, yes, Q4 will resume more normal level maybe even a little bit higher level of R&D spending. Operator : Your next question will come from Richard Eastman with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Richard Eastman : Yes. Thank you, and thanks for the question. Olivier when you look at the -- or Shawn the Core Industrial business was up 8% in the quarter. And I may have caught that you said Americas and Europe was down modestly. So was the growth -- was that the case? And was the growth of 8% pretty much derived from China? Shawn Vadala : Yes. Olivier Filliol : Yes, it was. Very much. So China was very strong. Richard Eastman : Okay. Olivier Filliol : Also related to this pent-up demand effect that we were talking about before and then the overall strong momentum that we see in our Chinese business. And then you might also recall that the Core Industrial in China has a little bit of higher percentage of the business mix than the rest of the world. So, in that sense, a double effect. Richard Eastman : Yes. And given there's a cyclical element obviously, COVID would have impacted the business there as well just access I guess if nothing else. But if you think about the cyclical aspect of core industrial in the Americas and Europe, how does it feel? If you sift through COVID, does it feel like that business is maybe bottoming when you think about capital budgets and expenditures on Core Industrial in the two bigger geographies there? Olivier Filliol : So, if you would have asked me two quarters ago or even one quarter ago, I would have thought that Core Industrial would be impacted more by COVID and the recession. I mean in that sense pleasantly surprised. And I certainly explained it on one hand that the global economy recovered faster than we expected. But the second one also is we were very successful in shifting our resources to the more resilient industries. And the more resilient industries for example being biopharma hold up very nicely and we certainly feel we could gain share there also with our Core Industrial business. So, yes, I'm happy to see that it's less cyclical than we would have expected and shows that we have also good execution on it. There are individual segments like we call it the MPE market, materials plastic and electronics market that is clearly down and suffering from the economic environment. Richard Eastman : And you -- when you talked about earlier in your presentation Olivier, when you talked about the digital marketing tools, do these -- does that account for some of this more resilient -- I mean is that part of how you shift your resources? Do you deploy those on the Core Industrial side as well? Olivier Filliol : Yes absolutely. We really deploy it everywhere. And I think there is a multitude of tools that are helping. So, one hand we do the segment analysis and heat map that show us which account sites have the most potential and we guide our salesforce go after these opportunities. And then we use the digital tools sales tools virtual sales tools on top of that so that for example our salespeople also for Industrial business would engage customers not only by physical visits, but more and more by video calls by online webinars that are dedicated to accounts. We have a digital library and all that. All these topics apply across the business including Core Industrial. Richard Eastman : I see. Okay, very good. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question. Steve Willoughby : Hi, good evening. Two questions for you. Just wondering if you could break out -- you commented that consumables and services was up 6% in the quarter. If I remember correctly, I believe service was down year-over-year in the second quarter. Just wondering if you could give any -- a little bit more color between consumables and service. I guess along with that too where do you stand in terms of being able to meet demand for pipettes these days? Are you building backlog at all given the increased demand in pipettes any CapEx you need to do? And then my second question or topic is Mary looks like you're stepping up the share repurchases in the fourth quarter versus what you were expecting 90 days ago. How much in share repurchase activity is implied within the guidance you gave? Olivier Filliol : Good. Shawn do you want to take the first one, I take the second one, and Mary the third one? Steve Willoughby : Perfect. I got everybody. Shawn Vadala : Okay. Good. Hey Steve so on the first one I want to also clarify in the script, we realized that the 6% should be on a year-to-date basis for service and consumables. So, in the quarter service and consumables were actually up by 12% and that included about 4% growth in the core service business with very strong double-digit growth in our consumables business. Steve Willoughby : Got you. Olivier Filliol : So, on the second one, the pipettes themselves are less of a capacity constraint issue. It's more the tips. And on the tips side you have capacity problem in the whole industry so not just that. We are in a reasonable situation because we have three production facilities. We have one in Mexico, we have one in California, and we have one in China. They are all running at full theme and of course we leverage the three different facilities for the global supply not just for local supply. We have been successful in increasing the capacity over the last few months and will continue to further expand capacity. There are different levers that we have. We feel good about it. And we certainly feel that this capacity increase will also allow us to further gain share. The demand is certainly here and I think we are in a good position to be faster to orders in terms of raising the capacity. This includes also a bigger facility expansion or new facility that will go live next summer. But our whole focus is actually to expand capacity already here in the next couple of weeks and certainly also into the first quarter. Mary, you take number three? Mary Finnegan : Sure. So, in terms of share repurchase as Shawn mentioned on the call we want to keep our net debt to EBITDA in this 1.5 times range. And so of course, the actual amount we do next year will depend a little bit on your assumption in terms of EBITDA and cash flow. If I just look at the midpoint of our range, we would be repurchasing somewhere around $850 million level. And of course, it could be a little higher, a little lower, just depending on how things play out. Steve Willoughby : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question will come from Dan Arias with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Dan Arias : Good afternoon guys. Thank you. Olivier maybe just packing around the edges and sticking with the market share gain conversation. Obviously, that's easier to do in some places than others. So, I guess, I'm just curious on the segments or areas of the market where you found it to actually be more difficult to take share. What is it about the competitive offerings that's allowed them to kind of hold share more than others? Is it customer loyalty price? What are the factors that are hardest to overcome that you're finding? Olivier Filliol : It's certainly in the air that we have talked about also in the past and that's retail. In Food Retail, our Spinnaker approaches, our sales and marketing approaches have not the same benefit. In retail, we clearly see that we have a highly competitive market because it's more difficult to do value-selling to differentiate in front of the customers. The projects are typically also bigger. So that's certainly an area where we are not focused on market share gains, but actually on profitability.  The second differentiation I could make is direct or indirect channels. Wherever we go direct channels these approaches play much better to our benefit. We are introducing Spinnaker and applying Spinnaker approaches also to indirect channels. But you can imagine, we don't have the same impact and we can't implement all the tools in the same way. So that's probably the way, I would mostly differentiate.  From a geographic standpoint, I don't -- wouldn't differentiate. And for the core business outside of retail and if it's not a particularly big project or so all of what we do here is applicable and would help us on the share gains. Dan Arias : Yes. Okay. That's great color. Maybe just operationally, are you guys through the SAP implementation within Product Inspection? And then on Blue Ocean when you think about where or how you finish the year there, what percentage of users do you think are fully under the umbrella of Blue Ocean by that point? Olivier Filliol : So indeed we had the last implementation in Product Inspection going live in Q3 in Tampa. This was the most demanding and the most complicated facility and operation to go into Blue Ocean go live. And you can imagine it was even more difficult to do that under COVID, very difficult people being in home, offices, international teams not easily being traveling. Given all these challenges, we are happy with how things went. It nevertheless had some impact on our Q3 numbers as Shawn highlighted before and we still have some more work to do in terms of -- every implementation of Blue Ocean has been a challenge.  Also after the go-live, there is always challenges in workflows that need to be optimized. It still has material data that needs to be optimized and so on. We are still going through these. But I do expect that in the next couple of weeks we will have full stabilization and then we'll start to have the benefit like we have seen in all other units including the Europe PI unit. I want to recall that a few years ago, we went live with Garvens and Blue Ocean, the checkweighing business that initially was very difficult. And today this checkweighing business is so much benefiting from the Blue Ocean implementation in terms of material cost savings, operational efficiency. I do expect that these things will also come to Tampa. But right now, we are still kind of streamlining things that we have to implement. And Shawn, do you want to talk about the second point? Shawn Vadala : Yes. So we -- most of the units remaining are I would say smaller units in the company. But we have a handful of smaller units in Europe still to go as well as in Asia/Rest of World. The largest unit that we would have would be our French market organization which will go live in a couple of years. In terms of the overall users, I'd probably estimate it's in the 80% kind of a range, that are currently on the system. Olivier Filliol : All major producing organizations are now on Blue Ocean. That was the key part missing with Tampa and that's also one of the reasons why the majority of the benefits that we can get out of Blue Ocean are now in operational mode. Dan Arias : Yes. Very good, guys. Thanks a ton. Operator : And we do have one final question in queue and that will come from Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Dan Leonard : Thank you. So for starters, could you be specific on the growth in China between Lab and Industrial? If you disclosed that earlier I missed it. Shawn Vadala : Yes. We had high single-digit growth in both of those areas, Dan. I mean, I'm sorry not high single -- I'm sorry double-digit growth. I apologize. We have double-digit growth in both the areas in both Laboratory and Industrial in China in the third quarter. Dan Leonard : And safe to assume Lab was above 20%? Shawn Vadala : No. Actually our Industrial business was stronger than our Laboratory business in the third quarter, which is kind of supports our comments on why we thought like there was pent-up demand on the industrial side. Dan Leonard : Got it. And then my follow-up. Shawn, can you help me think about how you're framing any year-end uncertainty in your fourth quarter guide? Is it fair to assume that your 4% to 5% local currency assumption reflects a better result than that during the month of October with more caution around December, or are you assuming more linearity in your performance? Shawn Vadala : Yes. I think it's always difficult to try to comment on any particular month. I mean, there's obviously prior year comparisons that can come into play here, but I would just say that hey we feel very good about our guidance. We feel good about how we entered the quarter. Of course, we had the benefit of seeing the month of October when we provided our guidance, and we don't have any -- we didn't factor in anything particular from an uncertainty perspective other than that we acknowledge that there is uncertainty in the market and things can always change quickly. Dan Leonard : Great. Thank you. Have a good night. Shawn Vadala : Thank you. Operator : We do have one other question that just came into the queue and that is from Dan Brennan with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Dan Brennan : Hey, guys. Sorry about that. I guess, we just didn't queue in appropriately. So thanks for the question. And congrats on the quarter. Maybe just two questions Olivier or Shawn. So the guide for 2021 and I don't think this is covered, but like the core growth at low single just seems really potentially conservative. I know you're assuming that the world is still kind of -- we're not there yet with COVID, but nonetheless given what you just posted this quarter. And then also for China I know there were some questions earlier, but just maybe give us a little flavor for those two particular guides kind of what goes behind that? Are you assuming maybe things get a little worse from here and that's what's baked in? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. No. Hey, Dan I'll take the question. This is Shawn. So on the Core Industrial side, as Olivier mentioned, before we're really pleased with the resilience of the Industrial division recently and actually for the past couple of years. So we feel very good about the execution there. We feel really good about our ability to target the more attractive faster-growing more resilient segments of the market, but nonetheless we're not immune to the economy. And so when we look historically, we do have that in the back of our minds that this business historically is the more susceptible to the global economy. And that -- and so that's a little bit on our mind with the low single-digit growth. And then maybe the second thing is that, we just had extremely strong growth in China and Industrial as we just mentioned a few minutes ago. And so we're going to have a much more difficult comparison in China when it comes to the Industrial business next year. And as we mentioned earlier China is a disproportional percentage of the mix for that business compared to our other businesses. And then I think the second part of your question was China for next year, or was it\u2026 Dan Brennan : Yes. I know you covered it several times, but could you just maybe in closing just give us a flavor for kind of what's happening now? I think there was a question earlier about was there any kind of catch-up. I think maybe Jack asked it. So just to be clear did China benefit from a catch-up this quarter? And if not the 5% next year is really just conservatism or the comp, or just any color there. Thank you. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. So just to clarify in the third quarter China was up 17%. We had double-digit growth both in the Laboratory business and the Industrial business with stronger growth in our Industrial business. We did feel like there was a pent-up demand in China in the quarter. I mean, if you kind of look at the sequential quarters starting with Q3 being down 13% in China, it's very much of a V-shaped type recovery. We feel like the team is doing well. We feel like we're executing extremely well. All the digital marketing approaches that Olivier mentioned earlier also benefit in China. We feel like we're gaining a little bit of market share there. So we feel very good about our execution. Of course, we also feel very good about the growth prospects of China kind of going forward especially from a medium to longer-term perspective, especially with trends in biopharma and things like that. As we think about 2021, I always like to say, in China things can always change very quickly. And so -- and we saw examples of that going in both directions already in the last nine months. So we're always a little bit cautious in that regard when we try to forecast in China. But currently sitting here today, we feel like mid single-digit we feel good about that. Could it be higher? Could it be lower? We'll see. We tend to think that the Laboratory business will be stronger in terms of growth for 2021, compared to 2020, compared to our Industrial business. And a lot of that is just coming off this very strong quarter on the Industrial side in Q3 and just kind of acknowledging that we're going to have a harder comparison in the second half of next year. I think we're going to start the first half of the year very strong in China. They'll have a much easier comparison in Q1. It's really about the second half of next year. Dan Brennan : Great. Thanks, Shawn. Shawn Vadala : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And at this time, we have no further questions in queue. I will now turn it back over to the panel for closing remarks. Mary Finnegan : Thank you, and thanks everyone for joining us this evening. As always, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Take care. Bye-bye.

Patrick Kaltenbach is also joining the call with me from Switzerland, and we are excited to have him on board. Patrick and I have had very productive onboarding sessions over the last few weeks, and he most recently has begun to meet with the senior leadership team who is very happy to welcome him. Patrick, I will turn it to you, as I know you want to make a few comments. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks, Olivier. And good evening, everyone. I am very happy to join this call tonight and more importantly, to be part of Mettler-Toledo. I spent my time so far working with Olivier, meeting senior leaders virtually throughout the world and studying thorough strategy documents, comprehensive materials on Spinnaker approaches and detailed R&D and still enjoy priorities. Olivier Filliol : Thank you, Patrick, for these very kind words. From my side, we're off to a great start and I look forward to our continued teamwork. I will start with a summary of the quarter and then Shawn will provide details on our financials. I will then have some additional comments and we will open the line for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter on Page 3 of the presentation. We ended the year with a very strong fourth quarter, which came in better than we expected. Local currency sales increased 7% in the quarter and growth was relatively broad based throughout the world. Our laboratory business and our Chinese business did particular well, in the quarter. We benefited from strong execution and we're well positioned to capture growth as customer demand improved. However, we continued to be negatively impacted by COVID-19 in certain areas. From the onset of the global pandemic, our focus has been to identify and pursue pockets of growth within our end markets and to be well positioned to capture growth as demand improves, which is what we saw in Q4. Our innovative go-to market approach really played very well into this environment, and allowed us to capture this growth. Good cost control and the continuous benefits of our margin and productivity initiatives contributed to strong growth in adjusted operating profit and very strong growth in adjusted EPS in the quarter. Finally, cash flow not one in the quarter, but also for the full year was excellent. 2020 was an extraordinary year with some of the most challenging market conditions we have faced in more than a decade. Our organizational ability helped us to quickly adapt approaches and processes to the new environment. A broad end market diversification and the use of sophisticated data analytics allowed us to shift our sales and marketing focus to the most promising end markets early on. Shawn Vadala : Thanks, Olivier, and hello, everyone. Sales were $938 million in the quarter, an increase of 7% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis sales increased 11% as currency benefited sales by 4% in the quarter. On Slide number 4 we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales increased 8% in the Americas, 7% in Europe and 8% in Asia rest of the world. Local currency sales increased 12% in China in the quarter. The next slide shows sales growth by region for the full year 2020. Local currency sales increased 2% in the Americas, 1% in Europe, and 3% in Asia rest of the world. China local currency sales grew by 7% in 2020. On Slide number 6 we outlined local currency sales growth by product area. For the fourth quarter laboratory sales increased 12%, industrial increased 1% with core industrial up 5% and product inspection down 5%. Food retail increased 7% in the quarter. We estimate that we benefited 1% to 2% from COVID tailwinds in the quarter related to our pipette business for COVID testing. The next slide shows sales growth by product area for the full year. Laboratory sales increased 5%, industrial declined 1% with core industrial up 2% and product inspection down 7%. Food retail declined 4% in 2020. Let me now move to the rest of the P&L for the fourth quarter which is summarized on the next slide. Gross margin in the quarter was 59.6% a 60 basis point increase over the prior year level of 59.0%. Our margin initiative centered on pricing in Stern Drive, as well as temporary cost savings contributed to the margin growth offset in part by higher transportation costs and unfavorable business mix. R&D amounted to $39.9 million, which represents a 6% increase in local currency. SG&A amounted to $226.4 million a 5% increase in local currency over the previous year. Increased variable compensation was offset in part by our temporary cost savings and ongoing cost containment initiatives. Olivier Filliol : Thank you, Shawn. Let me start with some comments on our pricing results. Our lab business had exceptional growth in the quarter, pipette had excellent growth and benefited from COVID related testing demand. Process analytics had another quarter of strong growth, while demand for analytical instruments and balances recovered nicely in the quarter. Sales growth in all regions was very strong. We expect lab to continue to be very strong in the first half of 2021, due to favorable biopharma trends, vaccine research and testing and bio production scale up and production. Lab will face tougher comparisons in the second half of the year. With our excellent lab product portfolio, including our power band solutions focused on automation, digital interfaces, and data management and proven Spinnaker sales and marketing strategies, we believe we're well positioned to continue to capital share. In terms of industrial business, core industrial did well in the quarter with a 5% increase, driven by double digit growth in China. We returned to growth in core industrial in Europe, while Americans was flat, although they have very good growth in the prior year. We are particularly pleased at how resilient our core industrial has proven throughout 2020, given the challenges of the pandemic. We believe this reflects the strength and diversity of our product portfolio, our success in identifying and pursuing pockets of growth and strong focus on execution. Our outlook for core industrial remain solid, but we acknowledge we are not immune to the overall economy and we'll face difficult comparisons in China during the second half of the year. Product inspection came in weaker than we had anticipated, with a 5% decline in the quarter. Both Europe and Asia declined while Americas was flat with the prior year. While our outlook has improved for this business, and we expect to start 2021 with solid growth, we are cautious as large packaged food companies continue to face operational challenges at their manufacturing sites related to COVID. We believe pent up demand exists for our instruments, but ultimate timing is still hard to determine. Food retailing came in better than we expected with 7% growth overall and growth in all region. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales in Europe increased 7% in the quarter with excellent growth in lab and good growth in core industrial and food retail. We expect solid growth in Europe in 2021. Americas increased 8% in the quarter with excellent growth in lab, offset by flat results in both product inspection and core industrial. We expect good growth in Americas in 2021. Finally, Asia rest of the world grew 8% in the quarter with both lab and core industrial doing very well. As mentioned, China has 12% growth in the quarter with excellent growth across product lines. We expect market conditions in China to be very favorable as we start 2021, while they face much tougher comparisons in the second half of the year. One final comment on the business, service and consumables were up 13% in the quarter and 8% for the full year. That concludes my comments on the business. As I reflect on 2020, I'm very pleased with our performance given the exceptional challenges we faced. This performance would not have been possible without the strong foundation and well ingrained corporate programs that we have in place, which allowed us to quickly pivot and adapt to the new environment. We have always considered agility and focus on execution, a key pillar of Mettler-Toledo. And I think you saw evidence of both of these in our results. Probably most important, however, our success in 2020 sets the stage for us to continue to capture growth in 2021 and beyond. Our strategy over many years has been remarkably consistent. As a leader in fragmented markets, we have established strategies that allow us to gain a little market share each year, while continuously expanding our margin. The initiatives within these strategies will involve and evolve, but strategies remain the same. As we look to 2021, let me comment on how we are going about this. I will start with our Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives. As we discussed on our last call, we made some leapfrog advances in digital transformation during 2020 that positioned us very well for the future. We will continue to refine our sophisticated analytics to guide ourselves force to the best opportunities. We will continue to support our market organization with tools and methodologies to increase sales force time, with the most strategic account, while leveraging our value selling and cross selling tools to further penetrate opportunities. We will also continue to leverage digitalization to develop new approaches that drive sales force efficiency and refined techniques to improve the effectiveness of telesales teams, but also look forward to returning to visit accounts to generate new opportunities. Finally, we'll look to execute more telemarketing campaigns and have tools to increase order conversion. Service will continue to be essential element of our customer value proposition. Our almost 3000 service technicians are an important competitive advantage for us. This year, we will focus on further AI based penetration and utilizing many of the same sales force guidance telesales and digital tools that we use for product sales to further drive service sales. Our team in China did an exceptional job in 2020, not one and continuing to serve customers and penetrate growth opportunities, but also in terms of manufacturing and supply chain. The team's priority is to continue to optimize the organization to focus on high potential growth areas, and attractive segments and further leverage digital technology to engage customers and generate leads. Introducing products for the local market such as an entry level X-ray instrument for our product inspection portfolio is also an important element to growth in China, and throughout emerging markets. We remain very optimistic about the growth potential, not one in China, but throughout emerging markets over the medium-term. Constantly coming to market with new product launches is another important strategy. Given the diversification of our product portfolio, a new product launch will never be material by itself. But together these launches reinforces our market leadership, helps trigger replacement an existing customers, help open doors to new customers, and help support our price differentiation. Later this month, we will launch a new automatic laboratory balance that will set a new standard for weighing of powders and liquids in research lab. Testing labs and quality control labs. Addressing the need in the laboratory for donation, smaller sample sizes, flexibility, ease of use, and seamless documentation, these new balances offers an unmatched value proposition. It is a simple, fully integrated solution that will support our customers in their everyday operation. It is just one example of the many product launches we will have this year, but illustrates how we are continually focused on bringing products to market that demonstrate clear value to our customers. Similar to the continued evolution of growth strategies, we also continue to develop our pricing and productivity initiatives. We have good developments within pricing, utilizing analytics and machine learning to most effectively price our offering. On the supply chain side, team was able to continue to make progress on their Stern drive productivity goals in 2020. But we will be able to make further progress in 2021, when the team won't have as many challenges as they faced last year. Finally, I think you will continue to see us market strategic acquisitions that leverage our technology leadership and global distribution. I acknowledge that we have not had an acquisition for a while, but continue to believe if we can benefit from acquisition. However, these acquisitions will be smaller and strategic, not transformational. I believe our franchise is stronger than ever, as demonstrated in how we performed in 2020, despite all the challenges. As I look back over the last decade plus years, we have made much progress in many areas. Our continuous improvement programs of Spinnaker, sales or marketing, and stern drive productivity, which I just discussed, are well ingrained throughout our organization, and will continue to evolve and be important ingredients for the future. Emerging Markets, an important growth driver of 35% of sales today, compared with 25% in 2007. Similarly, our faster growing laboratory business is now 54% of sales up from 44%. Finally, service and consumable is now 33% of sales, as compared to 28%. Redirecting resources and investments to fast growing businesses has always been at the heart of our initiatives. And these businesses will continue to fuel growth in the future. The strength of the organization and how well we are positioned for the future contributed to my decision to step down as CEO. Under Patrick's leadership, I believe we have the organization, corporate programs, senior leadership team and tools in place to continue to gain share, and continue our successful track record. That concludes our prepared remarks. And now I want to open the line for questions. Operator :  Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Tycho Peterson : Hey, thanks. Oliver, I know you have one more quarter so we will strive to get you on the transition just yet. But maybe thinking about the service and consumable numbers you highlighted quotes sales up 30%. Can you maybe just talk about the durability? How much of that was pent up versus maybe some of the newer initiatives, especially on the server side? Olivier Filliol : Yes. So we would estimate that the COVID tailwinds was about 1% to 2% for the group. That was really related to the consumer business mainly, or almost exclusively around tips that we produce in our Rainin and Biotech facility. So that was actually really strong. But then the remainder of the service and consumable business was healthy and quite sustainable. I was actually pleased to see how we continue to perform service well, even under, again more difficult lockdown situations particular also in Europe, started end of Q4. And nevertheless, our service business could nicely hold up. And I would expect the same for this year. So I would almost say for our service business, we have a healthy environment. And I continue to expect similar growth as we had in the past. Tycho Peterson : Okay, that's helpful. And then product inspection, I know you've been talking about pent up demand with the CPG customers for a while, obviously, we're not seeing it yet. Maybe talk a little bit about what you're hearing in that channel. Olivier Filliol : Yes. So, indeed, we still see good demand for quotes. We feel we have a very good market position. But we see that customers are just not committing to great and new packaging lines and so on, which is not surprising. All this food companies really need to protect the protection -- protect their production from any COVID exposures. And you can imagine, they have very rigid safety procedures, not wanting to let in any external suppliers. And that really drive the demand. And I wouldn\u2019t be surprised that this takes the six months, there are many production companies that really hold back on CapEx. And as a reminder, about more than 70% of our revenue in product inspection is coming from food production. So, we count on the second half that we would really see a strong pent up demand. But I do expect that already in Q1 we will see better numbers, but not necessarily coming from pent up. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then lastly, on China last quarter, you talked about some pull forward, you still had good growth 12% overall, industrial double digits. Maybe just talk a little bit about the sustainability. And then if you could quantify what is baked in the guidance for China's growth this year? Olivier Filliol : So let me take the first part regarding the specifics, then Shawn can add in. Yes, indeed. We are very happy about how Q4 came together, the Chinese team did perform really, really well. There is also a good market for us. We see that the Chinese local investment is going very well and we benefit from that. The investments also go in the right market segments for us that we can benefit from. And I would certainly expect that this momentum will still go on for a while. We have here, for example Q1, I still have good expectations. For the second part of the year, however, we are going to face tougher comparisons, and that's certainly one of the reasons why we guys, when it comes to China a good start, but then a slowdown in the second part of the year. Now, Shawn, do you want to add some flavor to that last comment. Shawn Vadala : Yes, sure. Thanks, Olivier and, hi, Tycho. Yes, so for the full year in China, Tycho, we're now looking at high single digit growth for the full year. That's an improvement from our previous guidance where we were saying mid-single digit. And right now we're feeling that high single digit would be both in the laboratory and the industrial business. But as Olivier mentioned, the pacing is going to be pretty unique just given the whole situation with the comparison in Q1 of last year, and then when we look at the second half of last year as well. So just to be even a little bit more specific on that, in Q1, we expect China to be up mid to high 20s in terms of growth. But again, that was versus a minus 13% in Q1 of last year. And then, of course, we're going to have to lap some of these tougher comparisons, which included 17% growth in Q3 of last year and now 12% in Q4 of this year. Tycho Peterson : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Derik De Bruin : Hi, good afternoon. How are you doing? Shawn Vadala : Yes, hey, Derik. Derik De Bruin : So I guess the first question is, how did pricing come through in 2020? And just sort of curious that you've got better pricing than normal given the huge demand for pipette. And just if you took some price advantage there. And just sort of like, what are you expecting in the '21 numbers for pricing? Shawn Vadala : Yes. So hey, Derik, I'll take, it\u2019s Shawn. So in the fourth quarter, we did just under 2.5% in terms of price realization. So that was a little bit of an improvement from what we were seeing earlier in the year. I think each quarter we started to see things progressively get a little bit better. Part of that improvement was that we were able to take a little bit more price in the area of pipette, as you just mentioned. We also were able to do a couple of other things where we're trying to offset some of these higher transportation costs as well. As we look to 2021, we were previously guiding a little bit more cautiously in the 150 basis point kind of a range with the concern that inflationary forecasts a few months ago were quite low for 2021, but still feel extremely good about the momentum in the program. Olivier also alluded to a few of those things in the prepared remarks as well. At this point in time, we're looking at probably a range of 150 to 200, wouldn't be surprised if we were more towards the higher end of that range. As we kind of see some of the dynamics in the market, we do see some opportunities to maybe gain a little bit more price than we saw maybe a few months ago. And we'll see how that plays out. But that's certainly something on our mind right now. Of course, the other side of that is that some of these opportunities and price are also looking at higher material costs in certain areas that we're mindful of that, that we might be facing as well, too. Derik De Bruin : Great, that's really helpful. And Olivier, you made an interesting comment in the opening remarks just talking about accelerating market share gains in many categories? Can you sort of give us a little bit more color on that? Olivier Filliol : Yes. Like always, it's difficult to have parse data on that. Our competitors do not publish specific comparable numbers. And so we need to base this on the observation of our field force. We certainly also observe it kind of growth momentum we see in the different industry segments and what we can expect. And based on that, we feel actually really good. We have also clear anecdotes that we are winning share, and I feel we are outpacing the market. We have this MGDP benchmark, and I certainly feel that we are outpacing that. And so that gives us all this confidence of the share gain, there are some other data points that we use internally. I mentioned that we leverage data analytics to guide our sales force. Last year, we had a special effort to guide the sales force to non customers. We did so because suddenly our sales force spend much less time behind the wheel. They have much more time doing cold calling and engaging new customers through virtual demos and virtual calls. And that that was at the base for us to expand the targets to our sales force. And we were very pleased to see the results in converting more than ever non customers. So that is a kind of confidence that this allows us to win share. So in a nutshell, we feel that we've protected well our existing customer base, while we accelerated the access of the conversion to non-customers. Certainly a strategy that we're going to pursue. I many times said, the crisis last year was for us an opportunity to leapfrog some of the changes, and in terms of go to market leapfrog the adaptation of internal new tools and techniques, and one of them was certainly all about the sales force guidance and reaching out to non-customers. We are going to certainly maintain that one. Derik De Bruin : Great. Thanks for the detail. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hey guys, congrats on a nice springs here. Olivier, maybe I'll start with a high level question for you. The guidance here 5 to 7 it's a pretty solid guide. What is it assuming from a business environment perspective? Are you assuming the environment is back to normal? Or is there some cushion for perhaps disruption from second wave? And then your comments on M&A, it felt like a tone change, I'm curious if we read that the right way is that a change in tone? Olivier Filliol : Let me take the first. We assume a relatively stable environment in terms of second wave. In Europe we are in the middle of the second wave. We are definitely on a quite a strict lockdown in many of the countries started already before Christmas. It feels very different to the first lockdown. The business while many of us are in home offices, we have here an infrastructure and then understanding with our customer base that businesses is going on. We definitely leverage all these. We have also less customer visits but effective relationships, and we do not see that the core customer base is putting investments on hold. So that's why this second wave is very different to the first wave when it comes to the business impact. On personal levels, it feels kind of similar, but not on the business level. If the environment stays about what it is right now, that's probably our base for our guidance here. And I am not particularly worried that the lockdown situation will significantly impact our business, and that means if the lockdown gets more severe or if everything would suddenly ease up, it looks like we have built here a certain resilience in our own business approach, as well as the business or the industry segments that we are targeting. I want to also remind, we did quite a shift last year in terms of the industry segments that we are targeting, and that shift we are going to maintain. Don't we too much around the M&A language. It's really in the sense that reinforcement of the strategy that we have been running in the past. We are very interested in adjacencies. We are interested in companies that fit well in our current business focus. And my point was even now that we have here leadership transition, Patrick and I share a common understanding here that we don't need any transformational acquisitions. We are not seeking any additional lag to the company. We feel we have an excellent franchise, but we want to leverage the franchise when there are good opportunities out there. Again, technology synergies or selective market consolidation opportunities. These are the typical adjacencies that we did in the past and that we certainly are going to continue to pursue. Vijay Kumar : Understood. Shawn, one quick one for you. On the margins, looks like the margin guidance, it's implied it's gone up versus the prior guide. Is that a fair statement? Shawn Vadala : I'm sorry, Vijay, can you repeat that question? Vijay Kumar : On the margin guidance, it seems versus your prior expectations margin expansion perhaps is closer to triple digits at the high end of the guidance? Is that correct? Shawn Vadala : No, no. So for the full year, well, I mean for Q1 of course, we have triple digit numbers, but for the full year, just to be clear, we're expecting the operating margin to expand about 60 to 70 basis points, if we exclude the impact of currency. So currency will be favorable to operating profit, but it will actually have a negative impact on the margin. And that negative impact will probably be in the range of 20 basis points. But then just to kind of link it back to your comment about what we were saying before, we were saying before that we would be a little bit below our typical guide of 70 to a 100 in terms of our midterm expectations. So we might be slightly lower, but we're a little bit more optimistic just given the higher sales volume as well in terms of what we'd expect. And I think the other thing to always remember is, we did a 130 basis points this year. So now when we're looking at the two year combined growth, we're probably in the 190 to 200 basis point expansion, excluding currency, which we feel really good about. And as we kind of mentioned in the comments before, we feel like there is really excellent momentum on all the different margin expansion initiatives, whether it\u2019d be pricing or stern drive, et cetera. Vijay Kumar : Understood. Thanks guys. Shawn Vadala : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Thanks guys. Olivier, maybe just one on the core industrial side certainly proved a lot more resilient than we expected. It sounds like maybe you expected as well. Can you just pull back the curtain a little bit in terms of what you saw in 4Q and then also the expectations going forward? Again, kind of held in there a lot better, particularly in the developed markets than we would have expected. So we would love a bit more color on the performance and then the expectations as we go through '21 here? Olivier Filliol : Sure. Yes, our expectation was that our industrial business would be more exposed to the slowdown of the economy. I am very pleased to see how Q4 came together across the globe pretty much, and also across the different product lines in industrial. And I expect this will continue on to be relatively healthy. But of course, then in the second part of the year, then comparisons might then also play again and certainly also China, where of course, we have a very significant industrial business. I would attribute it to a little bit the same things that we see for the whole group that we early on did go for the pockets of growth that still exist in this market, redirecting our resources and our attention to the most attractive accounts and that played well. There are industry segments that are very healthy at this stage. The whole pharma production, there is transport and logistics that is healthy for us and many other sub segments. And in combination with the sales force guidance topic that I raised before offered really good opportunities in spite that the overall economy is challenging. So there are segments that are down for us and other segments that when I say up and it is really up to us to focus on the right ones. Patrick Donnelly : Yes, understood. And then maybe, in a response to the last question seems like you kind of acknowledge there's potentially some upside to the revenue guidance, maybe its baking in more kind of status quo than much of a recovery. I guess when you think about that, 5 to 7 for '21, when you look at it, what do you think are kind of one or two segments that have the most upside in terms of the lever if you kind of end up beating that number, where do you think the most conservatism is in your projection kind of when you go through the numbers there? Olivier Filliol : I wouldn't talk about conservatism. I think it's we recognize that there are some industry segments with good upsides and orders that will be more difficult. At this stage, we would extrapolate kind of the trends that we have seen also in recent months where we say biopharma is strong and certain chemicals sub-segments are strong, and that should remain that way. Then I would expect that in the second part of the year, we're going to see a good growth in PI pent up demand, as we mentioned before. But then on the flip side, you have, of course, the comparison topic. So China will, for example, be rather down than to say, not the same growth rate in the second part of the year. So that's a bid. In terms of where we might experience positive or hopefully not negative surprises, product inspection in China are certainly the ones that have potential in both directions. Patrick Donnelly : Understood. Thanks, Olivier. I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Stifel. Dan Arias : Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. Shawn just to follow up on Tycho\u2019s question on products inspection and then some of the comment that Olivier just made there. I think the comp NPI gets 8 points easier for you guys next quarter than it was here in 4Q. So I certainly appreciate Olivier\u2019s point on maybe some of the pent up demand drying up, but I think you said up 5% this quarter. Is there a reason why you wouldn't get the high singles, maybe even low doubles in 1Q in product inspection? Patrick Kaltenbach : So, hey, Dan, just to clarify. So for Q4 product inspection was down 5%, it wasn\u2019t up 5%, it was down 5%. Yes, so that probably helps a little bit. But you're right, it does have an easier comparison in Q1. But, as we kind of look at product inspection, this continues to be the one business in the portfolio that's been the most negatively impacted by COVID in high case counts. And as Olivier was describing earlier, these customers really are operationally distracted at the moment. We do think that there's a really great opportunity for pent up demand at some point that the timing of course is just very difficult to predict at this point in time. But when we look at the guidance, mid-single digit is kind of what we're looking at for Q1 and mid-single digit is kind of what we're looking at for the full year. Dan Arias : Okay, very good. Thanks for the clarification there. Olivier, on your point on new product launches, if I think back to the last time you guys actually held a site visit down in Tampa, which seems like a long time ago. We were focused on the PI business, obviously, just given where we were. But you guys talked a lot about what you were doing in terms of product development for biopharma. Do you feel like 2020 was a year where you saw some traction there, just given the things that you were doing? Or should we think about 2021 kind of being the year that 2020 could have been just given the pandemic related headwinds? And also the fact that it sounds like some of the launches this year are pointed in that direction. Olivier Filliol : Yes, I don't want to overstate the impact of our product launches on the top line. We often talked, our strategy is to continuously upgrade and launch new products. And they add up. But I would say, from one year to an order, there is not that much difference. Of course, the products that we showed to you in Tampa, these were particular also products in the area of auto cam. These products are going very well, very happy with the adoption rates. They will also continue to contribute very well this year. But they are made in all other categories, being it processed analytics, being an industrial. I talked before about lab balances. And all the moments I talked in the analytical space about new products we had for you , for example, and so on. So this is the whole portfolio that makes the difference to keep the technology leadership, but it's a continued thing. And again, last year or also 2021, I wouldn't highlight a particular product that will make the big difference to the top line. Dan Arias : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research. Steve Beuchaw : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for bringing me on here. I wondered, if I could spend a little time just trying to understand more deeply Olivier. How it is you think the operating environment evolve around COVID over the balance of the year? Just that we have as much context as we can for your planning assumptions. Sorry, I hate to try to put words in your mouth. But my sense is that you think that in the back half of the year, there will still be some amount of macroeconomic pressure. Maybe there's a lingering impact of the virus and so the macro is a little tougher. That's part one. Part two is, it also seems like you think that in some of the life sciences categories, maybe around pharma, that you've had some good tailwinds and that that those also maybe sort of taper off in the back half of the year. I just want to make sure I'm understanding that correctly. Is that a fair characterization? Olivier Filliol : You're right, we are cautious about the microenvironment also for the rest of the year. I don't think the microenvironment will just immediately improve when the lockdowns go away. I think there are too many drivers for a microenvironment and so we have not particularly forecasted here an improved microenvironment. We more or less assume things remain about what they are today. So don't know, I wouldn't say this is particularly cautious. I think we just don't know if all these industry segments that are today down will suddenly recover. I would think that the momentum that we see in the industry segments, like in bio production, I don't think it goes necessarily away in the second part of the year. I think that can be actually quite sustainable. Yes, and we had modest benefit from investments in vaccine production. But in terms of share of our total revenue remains very small. So if that would slow down, that wouldn't necessarily have a big impact on us. The investment in pharma production and particularly also bio production, I think has a long way to go. So, in essence, I feel like the current microenvironment that we have could last for quite a few more quarters, including the industry mix. Steve Beuchaw : Okay, that was extremely helpful. Thank you for that perspective. I've got one more follow up to ask, but before I ask it, I know it's too soon to say goodbye to Olivier. But I am going to say hello to Patrick, it's good to hear your voice again after a little while. Thank you for being on the call here. Shawn Vadala : Thanks, Steve. Steve Beuchaw : The question I would leave with is sort of a follow up to one that was asked earlier. There was a question asked which, frankly, I would have liked to have asked too about market share gains and the success of what you've done in this operating environment where some of your nimble approaches really pay off in a unique way. I wonder if maybe we could just zoom in, though. Maybe talk about it, particularly as it relates to service where your ability to get people in the field in an appropriate way of course, in the right place might be particularly helpful. Can you talk at all about the extent to which you might see service attached rates or service relationships evolving during the pandemic environment? And then, sorry after some very long winded questions, I'll get back in the queue. Thank you. Olivier Filliol : Yes. On the service side here, I would say this is more of an operational topic very early on. We were extremely forced in making sure that we equip our service technician with all the safety gears, and we went very early on made sure that our customers knew about that. And then we keep really operations going. You will recall, when we talked about Q2, how we did many good things to maintain production going. We were one of the first ones that we do production also in China. And similar things that we did also for the service technician. So we will really up and running. And what we benefit continue to benefit from is we do this net promoter score. And we had a very nice jump in customer satisfaction in Q2 that we saw in our NPS, and it went on throughout the year. And I feel this gives tribute to really our service force, how well they are performing. Having 3,000 people in the field here is powerful, then you need also to know that for service our biggest competition are local, I would almost say family owned companies. And for these companies, it is much more difficult to operate in the current COVID environment than for us, where we have a global organization and we have a lot of professional support of the field force. That's one. And the second one, our efforts to migrate to contract-based service was very beneficial. That protects a lot of our business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Brandon Couillard, your line is open. Brandon Couillard : Thanks. Shawn, on the working capital front DSOs continue to trend lower. You talked about applying some analytics and better productivity tools, which I think are new, I may be wrong. But are you finding new ways to apply these in that area? And how much more room do you think is left there? Shawn Vadala : Thanks, Brandon, thanks for the question. These are new tools, and so I'm kind of happy to be able to respond to it. So like many other things in the company, I think it's just a really good example of agility. So back in March, we really kind of launched into a variety of crisis management initiatives, around COVID. And then one of those initiatives, of course, was managed for cash, that's what we refer to it as internally. And so within that initiative, we challenged ourselves to come up with some new analytics, but even more importantly, to try to make the connection between the analytics in the actions to be more efficient. So we literally are broadcasting today individual KPI charts that are highly actionable with like top 10 lists as well, on a very daily basis to each finance organization go into the leader every single day. And we found that that in itself has become very actionable and it's allowed them to work with their local management teams, and really get people behind areas for improvement. And so that's just one example. We've done a lot of other things in the manage for cash initiative during the course of the year. In terms of more legs, we'll see, I think we just hit another good milestone, but when I take a step back, I think the best way to look at it is that our free cash flow conversion this year was over 100%. When we look at next year, we'll probably be right around 100% again. And so I think this is a level that, I don't think it's going to get too much more than 100%. But I just think that flow through around 100% is a good range. I'm comfortable looking at that for 2021. And I think as we go out, we'll kind of take it on a year-by-year basis. But right now, we feel really good about the cash flow conversion. Brandon Couillard : That's it for me. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : Thanks. Good afternoon. First one for Shawn. I was just wondering if you could walk us through the different factors that led to the EPS guidance raise for 2021 at this point. I think, I caught China pricing FX and tax rate. What did I miss? Shawn Vadala : So, probably even bigger picture, Jack. So we have increased sales overall for the group. So that's not just China, that's just the overall group. The next thing I would say is that we would have and probably within that, yes, you have China being a little bit better, you have Europe being a little bit better, you have core industrial being a little bit better, and you have lab being a little bit better. And then we have the second thing would be our 2020. You have a more favorable currency environment. And then of course, we have the reduced tax rate. And so when you add that all up, I think that's how you bridge our guidance. Jack Meehan : Great. Thanks for walking through that. And then just one on food retail. So saw a nice little rebound in the second half of the year. But I was just wondering if maybe that was some deferred sales from earlier in the year and if your thoughts have changed all around the outlook for 2021 there? Shawn Vadala : No, we still look at food retail as a low-single-digit business for 2021. The business always can be a little bit lumpy. We're very much tied to customer projects and buying cycles. So I wouldn't necessarily read anything particular into the fourth quarter results. Although, I would say that we are looking at a more favorable outlook again in the first quarter and probably will start the year more high single digit there. Jack Meehan : Great. Thanks, Shawn. Shawn Vadala : Yes, welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with UBS. Dan Brennan : Great, thank you. Thanks for the questions. Hoping to dig in a little bit on lab. I know you've talked about a lot of the initiatives there, but it was a nice beat in the quarter. So I'm just wondering, as you guys flush out, like, how would you prioritize what the biggest reasons were for the upside? And for 2021, I think previously you were thinking mid-single, high-single, is that still the case? Or it sounds like it's kind of ticked up a little bit? Maybe you can just kind of walk us through a little bit of lab drivers. Shawn Vadala : Yes. So, maybe I'll start with the last part of the question, Dan. So we're thinking high single digit for lab for the full year for 2021 and then for Q1, we're looking at low teens. In terms of the results in Q4, we really felt good about the whole portfolio. I mean of course the pipette business is of course continuing to do well. We probably had a little bit better in terms of the COVID tailwinds, in terms of what we were expecting. But if I look at the other categories, like Process Analytics had a great quarter and we also did really well in our analytical instrument business as well as our laboratory balanced business. So we feel like generally there is really good momentum there globally, good market trends. Of course, there's also pockets of challenging in other industries, but in particular, biopharma is doing very well. Dan Brennan : Great. Thank you. And then just the second one. Some product inspection, just given the delayed spending cycle that's been ongoing here, like how much pent up demand is there? Like in the food manufacturers put this stuff off and they're going to be a big catch up. So how do we think about product inspection? I know you talked about a nice recovery in the second half, but then kind of what happens beyond that, just any color on that would be helpful? Olivier Filliol : That's probably quite difficult to quantify, but a little bit the way to see you. We had now a few quarters of decline. I would expect that we can catch up quite a bit of this. The big question will be how fast. And is it going to be at the same time in U.S. as in Europe or not. There might be also differences by industry segments. For example, the meat industry in the U.S. has been very much impacted by COVID, certainly in area where there was very little investment or activities. So hopefully that will come back not too far away and then to be seen. So internally, I would say we count on the second part of the year. We were just talking also today with people from the industry. They were kind of hinting to us that the decision making might really start to ramp up again in Q3, as customers that would, yes, support our hypothesis. It should go along then into next year. I would certainly hope that 2022 has also some good PI quarters. Dan Brennan : Great. Thanks, Olivier. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Steve Willoughby : Hi, everyone, all of my question -- most of my questions have been asked already, but I just want to touch on one as it relates to pipettes. I believe you have some new capacity coming online this year for pipettes. So just wondering, given the demand you're seeing these days where you stand today in terms of being able to meet the demand that you're seeing? And any comments on if you're seeing sort of like backlogs or order books get extended and what that new capacity means for your pipette business? Olivier Filliol : So at this stage, we cannot fully satisfy the demand. We have capacity issues. This is around tips so not on pipette, but mainly on tips. The tips are used in COVID testing. We do expect that this is something that we have a spike right now and will then flatten or go back. We do already extraordinary efforts to increase the capacity, we have increased the capacity in Q4 and will continue to increase herein Q1. In the summer, indeed, we have an additional facility in Mexico, a new facility in Mexico that will go online. But it of course, will also take a few weeks that we can fully leverage that, that will bring additional capacity. But most important is that we can maximize capacity here in these days in these weeks. It's commercially attractive, but of course, it has also relevant -- it\u2019s our contribution also to the help situation in the society. And so the teams are very motivated here to do the utmost. Steve Willoughby : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Matt Sykes : Thanks for taking my question. And I'll be quick, I just have one. Just on Oliver you mentioned stern drive that if you do the challenges that you faced in 2020, you might not have gotten as much out of the program as historically have. I'm just wondering, are there particular cost savings projects that you have kind of lined up that we should expect some momentum in terms of cost takeouts as we move through 2021? Olivier Filliol : Yes, stern drive is about, really, dozens if not even hundreds of projects. Actually, last year, I think we were working on 300 projects. And just due to COVID, we had to put on hold or had some delays on a part of these 300 projects. We will resume the full speed on them here in 2021. The results in 2020 were still good. And I still also expect good contribution in 2021. But the programs have proven to be very powerful. I'm extremely happy about stern drive and wouldn't be surprised if down the road stern drive could have even a bigger impact. And I certainly also see Patrick to be passionate about the topic, he had his first review meetings around stern drive and came back in a very positive manner about it. And he will certainly engage on this and that will give the team and even more momentum. So you're going to continue to see us talking about stern drive and having benefit from it. Matt Sykes : Great. Thanks, very helpful. Operator : And I'm showing no further questions. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to the company for any closing comments. Olivier Filliol : Yes, thank you. Hey, let me end this call with a simple thank you to you analysts and shareholders listening here on this call. Thank you for your support and commitment to Mettler-Toledo over the many years. I have truly appreciated your engagement and the rigor you brought to our various interactions during this time. While my focus over the next two months is successful hand over to Patrick, and still delivering a very strong Q1. But I also very happy to remain involved with Mettler-Toledo in the future to my board role, as well as supporting Patrick on marketing and all the organizational matters. I wish you all a very successful 2021, and again, a big thank you and all the best to you. Bye-bye, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Mary Finnegan. Please go ahead. Mary Finnegan : Thank you, and good evening, everyone. I'm Mary Finnegan. I'm responsible for Investor Relations, and I'm happy to welcome you to the call tonight. I am joined today with Patrick Kaltenbach, our CEO; and Shawn Vadala, our Chief Financial Officer. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks, Mary, and good evening, everyone. I'm happy to host the call tonight, which I'm doing from Switzerland while Shawn and Mary are in Columbus, Ohio. I want to start by thanking you for your interest and commitment to Mettler-Toledo. I knew many of the analysts on the call have covered us for quite some time and know us well. We also have very long-standing shareholders who are also listening in. I look forward to our future interactions and hope that they can take place in person in the not-so-distant future. Let me make some brief comments on my impressions of the first several months at Mettler-Toledo. It is clear that the company's strategies and initiatives are well developed and well ingrained throughout the organization. A high level of accountability is evident throughout the company, which underpins the culture of strong execution. I am impressed with the interactions I have had with colleagues around the world, and I share their passion for customers and innovation, that is very apparent in how they approach their responsibilities. Shawn Vadala : Yes. Thanks, Patrick, and good evening everyone. Sales were $804.4 million in the quarter, an increase of 18% in local currency. On a US dollar basis, sales increased 24% as currency benefited sales growth by 6% in the quarter. On slide number 4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales increased 14% in both the Americas and Europe and increased 29% in Asia/Rest of the World. Local currency sales increased 44% in China in the first quarter. On slide number 5, we outline local currency sales growth by product area. In the quarter, laboratory sales increased 20%, industrial increased 17% with core industrial up 26% and product inspection up 5%. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks, Shawn. Let me start with some comments on our operating results. Our lab business had outstanding growth in the quarter. Pipettes had excellent growth and continued to benefit from COVID-19 related testing demand. All other product categories had also robust sales growth and growth in all regions was very strong. Biopharma trends continue to be very favorable and we also experienced improved customer demand in other segments such as chemical. We expect Lab to be very strong in the second quarter due to favorable biopharma trends, vaccine research and bioproduction scale-up and production. We also expect to continue to benefit from pent-up demand in segments outside biopharma. While Lab will face tougher comparisons in the second half of the year, we believe we are well positioned to continue to capture share, given the strength of our product portfolio and continued strong execution of our Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives. In terms of our Industrial business, Core Industrial did very well in the quarter with a 26% increase in sales, driven by China, which had growth in Core Industrial in excess of 60%. Europe and Americas also had strong low to mid-teens growth in Core Industrial. Improving market conditions combined with the strength and diversity of our product portfolio and our focus on attractive market segments contributed to the strong results. Operator : Thank you.  We'll have our first question coming from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is open. Derik De Bruin : Hi, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my call. So a couple of questions to start. I think the first one, I appreciate the color on the pipette tailwind that you've seen. I am a little surprised though that you're talking about this slowing down. I mean, the -- whenever I read the scientific Twitter feeds there's still tons of articles and complaints about the pipette shortages. I'm just interested -- I just would like a little bit more color there. And also how has that been contributed to your overall pricing? I assume that if there's a pipette shortage and that means that people are willing to pay more for it. So can you talk about have you seen some incremental pricing gains in the business as a result of that and so do those dissipate as well? Thank you. Patrick Kaltenbach : Okay. Thanks Derik. I'll start off and then let Shawn comment on the pricing topic specifically as well. Well, first on the shortage of pipettes and pipette tips in the market right now. You're absolutely spot on. There is still a shortage in the market especially related to COVID-19 testing. But as Shawn elaborated, we definitely expect the testing demand for COVID-19 going down towards the second half of the year. And there's probably not the same amount in life science research or other areas that would compensate fully for that demand. This is why we are more cautious about the outlook and don't expect the same tailwind from the pipette business in terms of revenues in the second half. On pricing we had the first pricing round this year already and I'll let Shawn also comment about the overall impact of that. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. So Derik, yeah, so we -- our pricing in pipettes is I'd say a little bit higher than where it would be in a typical year. That's probably been a situation that's been going on now for the last couple of quarters but maybe more recently with the increase in resin costs, we did come out with a price increase more recently in that respect. So you'll start to see actually even higher price increases for pipettes in Q2 and probably for the remainder of the year at least until as long as these higher resin costs continue. Derik De Bruin : And so what's embedded in your overall guidance for pricing just on a full year basis? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. So for-- well maybe I'll start off with like how we did in Q1 and then I'll talk about the rest of the year. So we did about 2% in the first quarter. In addition to the price increase for pipettes, we also did some price increases in other parts of the business to try to mitigate some of these material cost challenges that we started to see in the first quarter. At the moment we probably think of pricing in the 2.5 percent range for the second half of the year. Maybe there's an opportunity to do a little bit better than that. And then in Q2 we'd probably be somewhere between the 2% to 2.5%. Derik De Bruin : Great. And then just one final question. What's your overall bioprocess exposure I guess in dollar amount right now? And just Mettler historically has not been one, the company that sort of pops up on the list when you think about it. Can you just give us some context so we can put it measured against some of the peers in the space? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. We don't have a specific number for bioprocess specifically, but we probably continue to say that about one-third of our business is sold in the life sciences. Of course bioprocess is an important part of that third with the acquisition of PendoTECH, of course, we further increased our exposure into bioprocess as well. Derik De Bruin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will be coming from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Vijay Kumar : Hi, guys. Congrats on the nice ones here. Maybe Patrick I'll start with the big picture question for you. Perhaps it's coincidental, but what does seems to be changed? We did have an acquisition. I'm just curious as you've had some claim here, what are your strategic priorities? And how should we be thinking about capital deployment, capital allocation for overall Mettler? Patrick Kaltenbach : Very good question Vijay. And thanks for the computations on the quarter. We are very proud of this quarter as you can imagine as we really performed much better than we expected. Now to your question regarding acquisitions, look Mettler-Toledo has historically a very strong organic growth story and also success in organic growth. Our business model is really on increasing market share every year by better go-to-market strategy with our Spinnaker sales and marketing technologies having unique products in the market in terms of our design, usability, et cetera they are very much favored by our customers. And we see that growth story to continue for quite some time. We still have plenty of headroom to grow. That will not change. It's fundamentally an organic growth story. We continue to do bolt-on acquisitions, tuck-in acquisitions. You could all recall them wherever we think it makes sense from a technology perspective or where it complements our product portfolio. So I'm personally, of course, very committed to the organic growth strategy, which doesn't mean we are looking at potential acquisitions as they would make sense. I think Mettler-Toledo overall is a great platform for such small or medium-sized tuck-in acquisitions, bolt-on acquisitions but the underlying story definitely is an organic growth story. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And then perhaps one on the guidance here. It's a pretty impressive guidance. I look at some of your peers. Feels like they've been a little bit conservative, your guidance by far this is the best in the group so far on a comp-adjusted basis. I think you mentioned something about pent-up demand. Perhaps did it benefit in Q1, or is that based on your 2Q guidance or perhaps the back half, any commentary on what's driving this underlying strength where Mettler is coming in well-above peers and thoughts on pent-up demand I think would be helpful. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah. Let me start off and then I'll pass it off again to Shawn regarding some -- to give some additional flavor on the guidance question. So, of course, the increased guidance is number one based on our strong Q1 result and our confidence in our Q2 number. We see how well our products are received in the market. We see how strong our go-to-market strategy around Spinnaker sales and marketing really plays out. As I said in my commentaries already is, I think we prepared the team extremely well to capture the market demands that we covered. And we guide our sales force very effectively to the opportunities out there. And that gives us strong confidence for Q2 and also of course for the remainder of the year, even in light of the potential headwinds and risks and uncertainties that we mentioned like, shortages in semiconductors and maybe some of the shortages in material supplies, which we factored into this forecast. But overall, I would say, be -- our confidence in this guidance range is very strong. Shawn, do you want to add some additional flavor? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Sure. Hey, maybe just to echo a little bit what Patrick said, I mean, if you look at Q1, and then you look at our Q2 guide, and you put them together, almost 20% growth in the first half of the year. So of course, we feel really good about that and the momentum in the business. Of course, it's always difficult to assess topics like pent-up demand and stimulus. But as we kind of like look to the second half of the year, we typically only sit on 1.5 months' worth of backlog. So it's always a little bit difficult. We will start to face more difficult comparisons in the second half, especially when we look at like China in Q3, which grew 17% last year in Q3. And then, we have this, -- we won't necessarily have the same level of COVID testing that we talked about in the first question, from Derik already. But if you kind of look at the second half of the year, maybe the best way to think about it is that, we're looking at being at -- or assuming a more normalized multi-year growth rate in the second half of the year, again on a multi-year type basis. Vijay Kumar : Just to be clear Shawn, so there is no pent-up demand baked in the second half, that's correct? Shawn Vadala : No. We're not expecting any pent-up demand per se, at this point in time for the second half. Vijay Kumar : Okay, fantastic. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question will be coming from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tycho Peterson : Thanks. So I'll just pick-up, where we left off. On the pent-up demand was that greatest on the industrial part of the business? And Shawn, can you comment on the order book? I mean, I know you said, you only carry 1.5 months of backlog, but how is the order book coming out of the quarter? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. I mean, hey, it's always difficult to talk about your quantified pent-up demand quite specifically. But certainly the industrial business had a tremendous quarter if you look at the core industrial business. What was really impressive there Tycho is that, China has now had three really strong quarters in a row, in core industrial and we started to really see very strong momentum in China which had many different growth drivers to it maybe I'll let Patrick, add some more color on that one, when I kind of finish the comment. But the other thing is, we saw is, really strong growth in the core industrial both in Europe and in the Americas both, grew and kind of like the low-teens kind of a range. But then, if you look at the Lab business, I mean, biopharma has continued to do really well, but we also felt like there was like a pent-up topic there. If you look at segments outside of biopharma like, Chemical, we felt like Chemical was very strong, but we also started to see a lot of other end-markets recover as well too. What was the second part of your question, Tycho, I couldn't remember. Tycho Peterson : Well, I think you answered it. It was on the order book and then just... Shawn Vadala : Well, the order book. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Tycho Peterson : Patrick, maybe just I'd ask you to reflect back a month into the job, if you kind of think about your 180-day strategic review or your initial kind of outlook in the business. Can you maybe just talk the strategic priorities? I mean, that was obviously a very well-loved business to begin with, but are there kind of things that are top of mind for you, as you step into the role? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah. Excellent. Very excellent question, Tycho, look, I mean, as I came into Mettler-Toledo, actually I would almost say, I found what I expected, it's a very well-run organization, very focused on the strategic priorities and really focused on execution. The strategic priorities for the company will not change. I mean, our strategies are very well ingrained, throughout the organization. We are focusing on our end-market opportunities, in terms of the areas where we can gain market share. We continue to evolve also the underlying strong programs and strategies we have put in place around, Spinnaker sales and marketing which is -- has been an evolution in strategies for more than 10 years or 15 years already. The same is true on the Stern Drive program, regarding operational excellence and productivity projects across the company. But I will definitely continue to work with the team on those both of those programs because we think and we are convinced they still have a lot of headroom. I was talking a little bit about our opportunity to gain market share. It's very tangible for us. We see the opportunities. We see the market opportunities. We guide the sales force into the right directions. And frankly, we also have very solid product development, new product development program underway that we continue to exit. That will be definitely also a strategic focus area for myself to make sure that we launch products into market segments where we see the strongest underlying growth. Over the last 10 years, 15 years, Mettler continuously made a shift more towards faster-growing market spaces in the Lab and life science market, which continues to grow. And there's definitely again an emphasis also on my side, to continue that trajectory to find identify and capture these faster-growing market segments for Mettler-Toledo. Then on our strategy priorities for me clearly also working on next-generation leadership, as you would expect from every CEO. Have a strong focus on that as well to make sure that we internally also develop leaders for the company, that can drive the company forward and continue this exceptional growth story. Tycho Peterson : Okay. That's very helpful. And then, just last one on -- going back to the industrial markets for a second. Consumer packaged goods has been challenged for a while. I'm wondering if there's, any signs of that improving. It didn't sound like it from your commentary. And then, also separately, how are you thinking about infrastructure and stimulus here in the U.S. if we do get a big package? Shawn Vadala : Hey Tycho, so maybe I'll take that one. So in terms of packaged food, I think the situation, you're right. I think it's generally similar to the last time we would have talked. The packaged food companies continue to be challenged by COVID. There's still a reluctance to have visitors on-site. But we do see increased activity there, in terms of quotations and things like that. We still feel very good about the business in terms of being positioned for a pent-up opportunity here. We didn't necessarily build that into our guidance, but we do feel like we're well positioned there. But it's still difficult to tell the timing and when that's all going to happen. In terms of government stimulus, also difficult to judge, I mean, we -- I would expect we would have some level of benefit. Some of it probably more, indirect than, direct. We don't have necessarily, a significant NIH type of exposure. But on maybe some of the infrastructure stuff our Industrial Business could benefit from some of that. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will be coming from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Your line is open. Patrick Donnelly : Hey. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Shawn, maybe on the guidance, now that it's bumped a little higher, do you mind just running through the segment outlook in terms of what you're thinking by segments for the rest of the year with the new range? Shawn Vadala : Yes, sure. So Patrick, maybe I'll start with the divisions and then I'll talk about the regions. So if I start with the lab division for Q2, we're looking at mid-20s growth and for the full year low to mid double-digit growth. In terms of industrial business, we expect our core industrial in Q2 to be in the 20% kind of a range and then for the full year in the low double-digit kind of a range. And then, with the product inspection business being more mid to high single digit in Q2 and maybe mid-single digit plus for the full year. And then food retailing for Q2 to be high single digit and then for the full year to be more like mid-single digit. And then, if we look at the geographies, I'll start with Europe, which would be kind of like high teens to 20% kind of a range. And then, for the full year, high single digit to low double digit. Americas high teens for Q2 and then for the full year, also, high single digit to low double digit. China, we're looking at mid-20s for Q2 and then, high teens for the full year. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. That's really helpful. Maybe just to zone in on China, since you just finished with it, high teens for the year, obviously, you've put a monster number this quarter with 40 plus. Can you just talk about, I guess, the durability? Obviously, the comps get a little bit harder. How you're thinking about that the rest of the year? What you saw this quarter that -- was there some kind of pull forward or anything like that that's one-time. Just wondering in terms of the guidance for the full year versus, obviously, the first half is going to be quite a bit higher than that. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Well, let me take it Patrick. Look, we are really, really happy with our results in China. I think it was truly exceptional, much better than we expected and we commend the team for the excellent execution and capitalizing on the growth opportunities we have there. There have been several dynamics that you should consider when evaluating our China results. First, the number looks very high for the first quarter, but the comparisons are very easy, because they were down 13% in the prior year. However, the two-year combined growth rate is still very good. We are very strongly positioned in China, with our sales and marketing initiatives, which are allowing us to gain share and support customers. We also have worked over the last numerous years to adapt our products for the local market, which helps to support our leading position in many of the product categories in China. And in terms of the underlying dynamics, Shawn said, we see strong recovery in many of our end markets. Life Sciences, in particular, is very strong and continue -- we continue to expect growth from this end market. Other dynamics we are seeing is that, although, we primarily serve local markets in China, our local customers there see some greater demand from the western world actually. And that, of course, fueled some of the end markets for us like chemical. And finally, I think we're also benefiting from the government spending. If you look at China's five-year plan and the investments behind it in things like new labs, funding research also continue to fund safety in food supply, also in packaged food is impacted as well, that plays out for us very well. And then, last but not least, similar to the rest of the world, there is an increasing focus also on automation, which plays very well for our offerings in China. So we are pretty confident that the momentum in China will continue and we strongly believe we will have a very good Q2. And then, as we said also more moderate growth because of tougher compares in the second half of the year. Patrick Donnelly : That's really helpful. Thanks, Patrick. And maybe, just a quick last one on the product inspection side. Nice to see that we're back to mid-single digit growth. It sounds like the guidance is still calling for it, more mid-single. We're not bumping that too much. What do you need to happen to get that segment going a little bit? It has been a little bit sluggish for over a year now? Would love some color on that front. Thanks. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes, definitely, I can take it as well. Look, for product inspection, I think, for us pretty much it will be that the investment in the end market comes back and the confidence in the end market comes back and that customers will be willing again to invest in their facilities to bring people into their facilities. They have been pretty restrictive given the COVID-19 situation. As I said I think in my introductory remarks, the product line has been facing issues even with bringing service people into some of the customer sites, because they were so afraid of the COVID-19 situation there. So as that market, as the COVID-19 situation eases up, we think that some of the pent-up demand of our customers will then materialize for us also into somewhat higher growth rates towards the second half of the year. Patrick Donnelly : Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question will be coming from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is open. Nisarg Shah : Hi. This is Nisarg on for Jack. So there's been a lot of discussion around supply chain challenges related to the pandemic. How do you see this impacting the business? Shawn Vadala : Yes. In terms of supply chain, I mean, I think we're really impressed with our team over the past year. If you kind of go back to just over a year ago in China when the pandemic started, we already had supply chain challenges. And then if you kind of go over the last 15 months or so, it's been a tremendous journey for them. The agility in the organization has been really tremendous. We still -- but at the same time, we have challenges as well. I just feel like, the team has done a good job of overcoming those challenges. In the short term, right now we're not -- we haven't built anything in particular in terms of our projections in terms of any supply chain disruptions. And right now we feel like we can continue to manage it. We also benefit, I think, a little bit from the diversity in our business. And so, if there is a component shortage in a particular area so far, it hasn't been that significant to the overall group. But certainly, don't want to downplay it either. It's certainly a topic that the team's working really hard at globally. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. So if I might add some flavor there as well. Definitely, it's a very -- it's very high on our radar stream, so to speak, to make sure that we address the potentially upcoming topics. In some areas we have built some safety stock, especially in areas of semiconductors that are under pressure right now, as you have heard from other parts of the industry. Take the automobile industry, where they have sent thousands of workers home last week, for example, in Germany, because of shortage of electronic components. Again, our supply chain team is working with our vendors very closely to make sure that we understand the overall supply chain situation, build safety stock wherever possible and then continue to mitigate. We also continue to mitigate internally looking into even potential design changes where it would be adequate to make sure that we can continue to manufacture with other components if needed. Pretty unpredictable right now. I would say that the supply chain spends more energy than ever on this topic to ensure that we are not facing any major shortage, but we are certainly not immune from the overall trends. So no guarantees, but I can tell you that we at least for the most competitive components we know of we handle them also with some -- we have some safety stock et cetera. Nisarg Shah : Great. That makes sense. And can you update us on what your target is for gross margins for the year? And are there any notable factors to call out around fixed cost leverage? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Hey, so in terms of gross margin for the year, we're kind of like looking at the second quarter will probably be overall similar to the first quarter could be a little bit lower. And then for the full year, the gross margin level we're thinking in the 50 to 60 basis point kind of range in terms of margin expansion. What you'll kind of see as the year progresses, I think you'll start to see a little bit more improvement from the pricing program that we talked about in the initial question from Derik. We'll continue to also have benefits, especially in the second quarter from higher volumes. But kind of on the other side of that, we do have higher costs related to material costs as well as freight. And then another dynamic that we're going to see in the second quarter is that if you think back a year ago that's the quarter when we started to have a lot of temporary cost savings in the business. And a lot of those cost savings will now be coming back into the cost structure in the second quarter. And so that would be kind of like a something kind of going the other way. Operator : Our next question will be coming from the line of Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Matt Sykes : Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Just the first one, you spent some time on PendoTECH. And so I'm just curious as the integration kind of starts coming along and they're already facing a very strong market in bioprocessing and you integrate it into your global platform. What kind of new opportunities do you think you can open up for PendoTECH in terms of new customers or new geographies? I know they have a presence in Europe. But I'm just curious about what Mettler can add to PendoTECH as you continue to integrate them into your platform? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah. Good question. And let me comment on this. So as I said extremely pleased with the acquisition of PendoTECH. I think it's really complementary also to our strength that we already have in some of the bioprocessing and even some single-use sensors that we also have at Mettler-Toledo. So it's complementing the portfolio very nicely. PendoTECH definitely stronger in downstream. We are more at the moment stronger in upstream. But if you look at the combination of the two businesses as I said, it's actually very beneficial for customers to have the same window for both upstream and downstream applications. I think we from as Mettler-Toledo bring a lot to the table for PendoTECH in terms of our global reach, global footprint, our customer base and expand actually the market reach for them worldwide. We also have definitely sensor technology know-how in areas where they don't play today. But they have on the other hand a lot of design knowhow of how to implement sensors in single-use designs that are used in downstream applications. So I think there's a lot of technology leverage that comes together as well as a good market leverage in terms of our strength and our global reach that we have as Mettler-Toledo. The integration is going extremely well. We are very pleased of how things are going. There was zero disruption for our customers. Actually the response we have received from PendoTECH customers was extremely positive. We are helping them also on the supply chain side securing supply for actually increased demands in -- for their products as well. So I think this is really a combination of two companies that will provide a lot of benefit for customers in the biopharma space. Matt Sykes : Great. Thanks for that. That's very helpful. And just -- I know we spent some time on product inspection, but given the level of potential pent-up demand given what the business has been going through over the past couple of quarters, could you just help me with the sort of the sales cycle in terms of from when a decision is made to when a product is shipped and installed. I'm just -- what I'm trying to get at is like how quickly could this turn around once those companies decide to refocus back on spend? Patrick Kaltenbach : Look typically, I'll start off with this and I'll let Shawn then chime in as well since he has longer experience with this product line than I have. But I can tell you that the sales cycle of course for investments like you would see it in product inspections are definitely longer. I mean these products are in most of the cases is it designed for the specific application and the specific line of the customer. So you have to think about the customer has basically a food manufacturing line and they will ask -- they want to add some specific product inspection whether it's metal detection whether it's X-ray whether it's visual inspection and the devices have to fit their manufacturing line. So part of the process is basically that our sales rep would come in and work with the customer on number one what -- what his needs are in terms of the subject that he wants to detect in there whether it's x-ray whether it's metal detection, whether it's visual or check lane even. And then it comes to the point where we say okay we have the right solutions. And then it comes to designing to the installed base of the rest of the manufacturing line that is in place there. So it fits. And that cycle actually takes a couple of days to several weeks to get through to final approval process with the customer as well and then the system is built. So it's not something that's will turn around in a couple of weeks when you talk about pent-up demand. What we're doing however is we start -- we increased our marketing efforts. We also brought our demo trucks back on the road especially in Europe to be close to customers who cannot go to trade shows etcetera. So we bring the product to customers so they can see them, how they look like and then can basically start the conversation with the, our sales rep about potential investments for the next couple of quarters. Shawn any additional flavor you want to... Shawn Vadala : No. I think you did a really good job answering it Patrick. I wouldn't add anything to that. I think that's very much the nature of that business which is different than our other businesses. Matt Sykes : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Next question coming from the line of Dan Brennan with UBS. Your line is open. Dan Brennan : Great. Thanks for taking the question guys. I appreciate it. So just in terms of the full year guide just wondering if you think about the back half of the year I think this question was already raised, but I'm just wondering Q2 guide. So if Q2 does assume a bit of a deceleration when you look at like whether 2-year or 3-year stack comps. Is that just conservatism? Is that any reflection that PMIs are peaking and you just kind of think about what the business could do, or just maybe again really strong quarter just wondering, how you would characterize kind of what's implied for Q3, Q4 just in terms of the -- kind of what got you to that level? Shawn Vadala : Yes sure. So when we look at Q2 just to clarify I wouldn't characterize Q2 as any a deceleration from Q1. In fact I think if you look at the multiyear stack, it's actually going to be very similar even excluding the PendoTECH acquisition. I think as we look at the second half of the year as we kind of talked about earlier there's a few different factors. One, we have a more difficult comparison but I guess that would neutralize in the multiyear. But if you look at the this Q1, Q2 and even as we kind of ended 2020 we did feel like there was an element of pent-up demand and various dynamics kind of going around already starting in China in Q3 of last year starting to accelerate in other parts of the world in Q4. And then we saw a very significant momentum gain here in Q1 with other markets outside of biopharma really starting to recover. And so, it's always difficult to really determine and quantify how much is attributable to pent-up. Right now as we talked about earlier, we're just not assuming that there's any additional pent-up for the second half of the year. But if you look at our multiyear growth rates for the second half I think it's more consistent with our historical normalized growth rates. And okay of course, we'll see how Q2 plays out and we'll update everybody as we kind of get to the end of the quarter. Dan Brennan : Great. Thanks. And then when you think in kind of rest of world regions and there's a lot more volatility and kind of vaccine rollout's been slower to come by. I'm just wondering, can you just comment on the rest of world just kind of what's baked in and kind of what trends you've been seeing there? Shawn Vadala : Yes. So what's interesting is not only in rest of the world but we've kind of been really monitoring this even closely in Europe, when as soon as like the variants started coming out. And what we've kind of observed here with this second chapter of COVID if you will is that, it has less impact on our end markets. And it seems to be affecting things more from a social lockdown perspective and less business impact. I'm not saying that -- I'm not saying, we're - the economies are resilient to COVID and that there couldn't ultimately be some kind of a knock-on risk effect. But if we just observe things like Europe's been in a pretty heavy lockdown for the last few months and you see the business environment. But then you look at the rest of the world, like a country like India who's going through a very severe situation at the moment, our end markets are still actually doing well there. We'll continue to monitor that. Of course that's 2%, 3% of our business probably more in the 2% kind of a range. But other than India we're not necessarily seeing anything significant in other parts of the world. I mean Latin America we have I'd say a smaller exposure and not necessarily seeing impact on our business at least at this point in time. Dan Brennan : Great. Thanks Shawn. Operator : And our next question will be coming from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brandon Couillard : Hey guys, good afternoon. Just one for me, Shawn. I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks plans to add some commercial sales resources under Field Turbo in the second half of the year. Can you just talk about the magnitude of those plans in terms of headcount. And would those be targeted in any certain geographies or specific business lines? Thanks. Shawn Vadala : Yes. Thanks Brandon. Hey we're excited to restart the Field Turbo program. I think it also demonstrates how we feel about the business and the growth potential especially as we're kind of preparing for 2022. We're going to be making investments in the Field Turbo program as well as other investments for growth and other types of investments for growth in other parts of the business as well too. When we look at the program it is global in nature. And -- but it will have a little bit of a disproportional investment in China just given the significant opportunity we see in China in the medium to long-term. And if you look at the types of resources it will be kind of similar to the past where there'll be kind of a good mixture of field resources, but also inside resources, including telesales resources. And we just continue to see really excellent returns in terms of our investments in the field, but also the inside resources. I mean the telesales program continues to generate very significant leads for the company. These resources also do a fantastic job of leveraging our field sales so that they're even more effective as well too. So we feel very good about making these investments and I think you'll start to see them happen in the second half of the year. Brandon Couillard : Great. Thank you. Operator :  Next question will be coming from the line of Josh Waldman with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Josh Waldman : Hi, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. And I just have two questions. First, just one last follow-up on the full year guide. I wondered if you'd be willing to more specifically kind of lay out how much of the increase to the full year was due to the 1Q beat versus an improved outlook and your assumptions for the remaining three quarters? And then second, I wondered if you could walk through how you're seeing orders shape up from kind of the process -- within the Process Analytics business. I believe this was an area that performed quite well throughout 2020. And I guess just seeing -- wondered if you're seeing any signs of the business slowing and maybe how you're thinking about growth in that business within your full year guide? Shawn Vadala : Yes. Hi, so maybe I'll take that one Josh. So in terms of a high-level bridge to the guidance, if you look at the Q1 beat, of course, that's part of it. But from a sales perspective actually a bigger part of it was our Q2 is much higher than what we would have thought three months ago as well as a modest improvement in the rest of the year. And then, of course, it also includes 1% for PendoTECH. And if you look at it from an EPS perspective I'd say just under half of the increase is related to the Q1 beat. And then probably something more like in the 60%, kind of, range was related to higher sales volume as well as a little bit of benefit from currency which improved a little bit since the last time we spoke offset by some of these growth investments that we talked about. In terms of process analytics maybe I'll start that one and then I'll let Patrick add some comments if he has any additional color. But, hey, Process Analytics is doing extremely well about half of the business or so has an exposure to bioproduction, as you can imagine that part of the business is doing really well. We've had a lot of really great photo ops in that business actually around the world over the last few months with leaders around the world visiting bioproduction plants and then our equipment's behind it. A recent one was when President Biden was at the Pfizer plant in Michigan. So that business is doing really well. We've always felt very strongly about that. Patrick talked about that when he talked about PendoTECH as well. But what we're also seeing is that the end markets other than biopharma are also coming back quite strongly there also. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Absolutely, Shawn. And I mean the only thing I could potentially add here is as you know this is also a strong consumables business so to speak because the sensors have to be replaced on a regular base, which builds a very healthy revenue stream for us given the strong installed base we have. And then also we have new technologies like the intelligent sensor management technologies which is very attractive for many customers which allows us to upgrade them and even replace some of our competitors in the space. So we are looking actually a very healthy funnel for our Process Analytics business. Josh Waldman : Thanks, guys. Operator : And we don't have further questions coming in. I would like to hand the call back to Mary. Mary Finnegan : Thank you. Hey, and thanks everyone for joining us this evening. As always, if you have any questions or any follow-up please don't hesitate to reach out. Take care everyone. Bye-bye. Operator : And this concludes today's quarterly conference call.

After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ms. Mary Finnegan. Please go ahead. Mary Finnegan : Thank you, and good evening everyone. I'm Mary Finnegan. I'm responsible for Investor Relations at Mettler-Toledo, and happy to welcome you to the call. I\u2019m joined on the call today with Patrick Kaltenbach, our CEO; and Shawn Vadala, our Chief Financial Officer. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks, Mary, and good evening, everyone. I am pleased to host the call tonight, which we are doing from Switzerland as Shawn and Mary are here with me too. I\u2019m excited to report another quarter of excellent results. Several factors contributed to these results. First, demand in our markets was very strong and broad-based. Second, we were able to capture these growth opportunities as a key priority since the onset of the pandemic was to stay close \u2013 in close contact  customers and be strongly positioned once customer demand recovered. And finally, the teams around the world have done an excellent job in execution and customer support. Our supply chain team has had more than the share of challenges due to parts availability and logistics complications, while our market organizations have executed well to meet increasing customer demands. Our teams have shown resiliency and agility in an environment where conditions change rapidly. Shawn Vadala : Thanks, Patrick and good evening everybody. Sales were 924.4 million in the quarter, an increase of 27% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased 34% as currency benefited sales growth by 7% in the quarter. The PendoTECH acquisition contributed approximately 1% to sales growth in the quarter. On Slide number 4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales increased 29% in the Americas, 23% in Europe, and 28% in Asia/Rest of the World. Local currency sales increased 35% in China in the quarter. The next slide shows sales growth by region for the first half of the year. Local currency sales grew 23% for the first six months, with a 22% increase in the Americas, 18% in Europe, and 28% growth in Asia/Rest of the World. On Slide number 6, we summarize local currency sales growth by product area. For the second quarter, laboratory sales increased 35%, industrial increased 20% with core industrial up 27%, and product inspection up 9%. Food retail increased 9% in the quarter. The next slide shows local currency sales growth by product area for the first half. Laboratory sales increased 27%, industrial increased 19% with core industrial up 27% and product inspection up 7%. Food retail increased 11% for the first six months. Let me now move to the rest of the P&L, which is summarized on Slide number 8. Gross margin in the quarter was 58.1%, a 50 basis point increase over the prior year level of 57.6%. We benefited from volume and pricing, which was offset in part by challenges in the global supply chain, namely higher transportation, logistics, and raw material costs. These items are even more challenging than we had expected the last time we spoke. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks, Shawn. Let me make some comments on our operating businesses starting , which had an outstanding growth of 35% in the quarter. Pipettes had excellent growth. All other major product categories also had robust sales growth and growth in all regions was very strong. Biopharma continues to be very favorable. And continuing the trend we saw in the first quarter we see strong customer demand in other segments such as chemical. We expect demand for our laboratory products to continue to be positive, due to favorable biopharma trends, vaccine research and bioproduction scale-up and production. While we face tougher comparisons in the second half of the year, we remain confident we can continue to capture share, given the strength of our product portfolio, and continued execution of our Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives.  In terms of our Industrial business, Core Industrial did very well in the quarter with a 27% increase in sales. All three regions of the world had robust core industrial growth. Improving market conditions, including some benefit from pent up demand, combined with the strength and diversity of our product portfolio, and our focus on attractive market segments contributed to the strong results. Similar to my comments on laboratory, we will face tougher comparisons for the second half of the year, but our outlook and our confidence in gaining market share remains positive for this business. Product inspection had increased momentum and solid sales growth of 9% in the quarter. We saw good growth in all regions. We expect good growth in product inspection for the remainder of the year as we are gaining better access to our customer facilities, and belief we will benefit from some pent-up demand in the business. Food retailing grew 9% in the quarter. Let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales in Europe increased 23% in the quarter with excellent growth in Lab, Core Industrial, and Food Retail. Americas increased 29% in the quarter with excellent growth in Lab and Core Industrial. Product inspection did well in the Americas, while Food Retail declined. Finally, Asia/Rest of the World grew 28% in the quarter with outstanding growth in laboratory and industrial. As you heard from Shawn, China had another quarter of stellar growth. You would expect another good quarter of growth in Q3 in China, although not at the same level of the first half as China faces more challenging comparisons. We are strongly positioned in China and the team is executing very well. Operator :  The first question will come from the line of Dan Arias with Stifel. Please proceed. Dan Arias : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for the question. Patrick or Shawn, pretty major growth you're seeing in China right now. What are you guys thinking about for the back half of the year? And I know we're a quarter away from the 2022 guide, but is there anything you can sort of offer when it comes to just thinking about, sort of the multi-year growth rate that makes the most sense as a forecast for China when you think about the strength of life sciences, the moving parts and industrial and just pent-up demand versus sustainable demand? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Hey, Dan, I'll take that one. This is Shawn. Hey, so, why don't I \u2013 I'll talk about maybe Q3 specifically, and then I'll talk about the full-year, and then you can kind of like, you know, back into what that implies for maybe Q4. But for Q3, right now, we're looking at high-teens growth for Q3. And then for the full year, we're looking at mid-20s. But, you know, we fully agree, you know, we enter the second half of the year with extremely strong momentum in China, also very strong execution from our team there. There's many favorable dynamics in China at the moment, whether it's life sciences, whether it's investments in industrial, whether it's trends towards automation, and digitalization, you know, many strategic investments in different sub segments, like micro electronics, or lithium batteries. And I feel like our team continues to do an excellent job of capturing these opportunities. You know, one of the challenges we start to have in the second half, though, of course, is that we start to lap some pretty significant comparisons to the previous year. And as you said too, like, there is a topic of pent-up demand. And, you know, when the recovery started in Q3 of last year, you know, that was very much a local recovery. And then this, kind of, we started to progress through 2021, it became \u2013 China was benefiting much more from the global recovery. And what's, you know, what's always hard to tell is how much are we benefiting from pent-up, and there also is an element of stimulus in China. We talked a lot about this last quarter as well, but clearly, the government's investing very heavily in many different sectors, whether it's programs related to the 5-year plan, or whether it's investments in the industrial sector, you know, further developing the Economic Zone going out to the western part of the country. And it's always difficult to tell how much we're benefiting from these trends as well. Dan Arias : Yeah. Okay. That's helpful. Then maybe just on product inspection, it seems like things are picking up there as well. I think you have favorable comps in the back half of the year. I think like the average, over the two quarters is something like down seven. So, I'm just curious, when we think about, you know, regional dynamics, are there any things in the key geographies that make you think that the different regions are going to, sort of move at different paces or there's a trajectory for one that might be different than the other? I guess I'm just sort of asking for a little bit of detail on how we should chart the course for PI over the next, you know, call a couple of quarters? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. I mean, right now, you know, we were, we're definitely encouraged with some increased momentum. I think we\u2019d started to talk about some improvement in the pipeline last quarter. You know, we were pleased with how we landed on, we ended Q2. And if we kind of like look at guidance for Q3, you know, we're looking at low-double-digit and Q3, and high-single-digit for the year. So, we're starting to see definitely some improvement there.  If we start to think about it more geographically, I think we're going to see higher growth in the Americas right now. But I think, you know, there's still this pent up opportunity for all geographies as we go forward. I think there will be an element and I think we're well positioned for it. I mean, but there's also going to be an element of the, you know, the COVID variants and how that could potentially impact access to plants and timing of projects. And that creates a little bit of uncertainty, but we definitely enter Q3 feeling encouraged by increased momentum from what we were seeing last quarter. Patrick Kaltenbach : Shawn if I might add \u2013 sorry . Shawn\u2019s comments here about the region's I think we have definitely good opportunities across \u2013 around the world, but we also just recently launched a new mid-range version for the X-ray detection in China, which was actually specifically initially developed for the Chinese market to be very competitive in the mid-range market. So, we are looking also with quite some optimism on their development in China as well. Dan Arias : Okay. Shawn, just to finish the thought on the comment you made on the Delta variant, or any other variant for that matter, are you starting to see any skittishness on the part of customers that are maybe, I don't want to say closing their doors, but just getting a little bit more nervous about access or is that just sort of the natural fear that you might have if we head in the direction that it feels like we're heading in? Shawn Vadala : No, we're not. I mean, I'd say that we continue to see really, I mean, the variant, of course, impacts, you know, social activities, I think around the world. There are still lockdowns in certain countries, but that's more of a social perspective. From a business perspective, we don't see really any impact on our business at the moment. The reason why I mentioned it with product inspection, though, is if you just think back from the beginning of the pandemic, product inspection has been the one business that's, you know, arguably been the most impacted just from some of the dynamics in the food manufacturing sector.  We're not necessarily \u2013 we've seen improvement in those dynamics over the course of this quarter. Things are starting to, I'd say; reopen more, so we have more access to plants and facilities to work on projects than we did a quarter ago. But I just mentioned it because those things \u2013 dynamics can also change quickly if the variants start to create a situation where packaged food companies start to prohibit access to their facilities. Dan Arias : Yeah. Okay. Thank you guys. Operator : Your next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Please proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, this is Paul on for Vijay. Just a quick two-parter. So, 15% annual guide sort of implies mid-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter, given the 3Q guide of 11% to 13%, somewhat similar comps, what's causing the 4Q step down? And then I guess what is the new guide contemplating for segment growth, what changed from the prior? I know you already talked about product inspection, but what about lab and industrial? Thanks. Shawn Vadala : Yeah, sure. So, hey we're of course, very pleased with our year-to-date results. We're also pleased with our outlook. You know, as I kind of mentioned on the China comment, it's always difficult to assess, you know, how much we've been benefiting from topics like pent-up demand stimulus. And as we kind of look towards Q4, there's always the topic of budget flushes well. And as you all know, it's, you know, we never have a significant number of months of backlog. You know, we're typically at, you know, 1.5 or a little bit more than 1.5 months of backlog. So, it's always a little bit more difficult for us to forecast beyond the current quarter that we're in. So, right now, kind of our planning assumption is to look at more normalized growth rates for Q4, but acknowledge there's always going to be upsides or downsides to our guidance. You know, maybe I can answer the second part of your question and just, kind of like walk down the different businesses and geographies just to, kind of get that out there as well too.  So, we kind of start with the lab business. You know, we're looking at mid-teens growth in Q3, and then we're looking at high teens for the full-year. If we look at product inspection, I think I already said this low-double-digit in Q3 and high-single-digit for the full-year. If we look at core industrial, we're looking at low-double-digit for Q3, and mid-teens for the full-year. And then if we look at food retailing, we're looking to be down low-to-mid-teens in Q3 and flattish for the full-year. And then by geography, we're looking to be high-single-digit for Q3 and low-double-digit for the full-year. For the Americas, we're looking to be low-to-mid teens in Q3 and mid-teens for the full-year. And then for China, we already mentioned high teens for Q3 and mid-20s for the full-year. Operator : Next question will come from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please proceed. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good afternoon. Good evening. I wanted to dig a little bit more into the Lab acceleration in the quarter. You know, even if you look at it on a compounded basis, I think it went from something like, you know 10%, 13% or so in the second quarter. How much do you think is funding versus mix shift in the portfolio? And  COVID made of  in the quarter? Patrick Kaltenbach : Well, I'll start and I\u2019ll let Shawn to chime in. Yes, so \u2013 again, very pleased of course, it's on momentum in Lab. I think a lot of it is based on our outstanding portfolio that we have, that we continue to improve. And you heard in my comments as well, about the new products we just recently launched. There is very strong demand across all regions in the lab business. As you know, over time, we have increased our share in Lab as a total part of the business significantly over the last years. And that will most likely continue as the underlying momentum in the end-markets is also very strong. I mean, a lot of it is driven by the life sciences market where we see a lot of adoption of our products. Our auto cam business is doing extremely well and is adopted also in new segments, like battery manufacturing and battery development for e-mobility. So, we have \u2013 we are very confident in our lab growth and that will \u2013 probably moving forward, given now as a strong link to biopharma beta one segment that will continue to lead the growth for all of the businesses. Shawn anything you want to add? Shawn Vadala : Yeah, maybe a couple additional comments, Jack. You know, I think our results were just very broad-based across most product categories and regions, but Lab really does stand out a little bit, you know, above some of the other divisions this quarter. And what was kind of interesting is that the results were very strong in each region of the world. And as Patrick mentioned, the trends in biopharma just continue to be very, very favorable. And then we started to, we continue to also see strong growth in end-markets outside of biopharma. And we don't have a significant exposure to academia, but that was certainly an end market that we saw improve as well during the quarter. Jack Meehan : And then, as a follow up was wondering if you could parse out how much pricing might have contributed in the quarter? I know you talked about the agility of the team there. Do you think, you know just curious how you see the landscape as it's changing? Do you think there could be even more pricing opportunities in the back half? Shawn Vadala : Can you \u2013 Jack, can you repeat the first part of the question? I didn't hear the word you used. Jack Meehan : Just how much pricing added in  and whether you think there could be more opportunity in the back half? Shawn Vadala : Okay. Yeah, yeah, no, thank you. Yeah, hey, so we were very pleased with our pricing results in the quarter. And we, you know, if you think about, last quarter, we were kind of guiding 2% to 2.5% in Q2, and then we were looking at more like 2.5% in the back half of the year. We ended up finishing Q2 at 2.5%, and at this point, we expect to do between 2.5% and 3% for the back half of the year. And I would expect to be at the high end of that range by the time we get into Q4.  The team and the global organization continue to execute really well on our various mid-year price increase topics. It's also, as Patrick mentioned in the prepared remarks, you know, we're also very agile in this area. You know, the cost inputs are also dynamic as well. And we're constantly looking for ways to optimize the situation, you know, and differentiate our approach to the market. Jack Meehan : Thank you, Shawn. Shawn Vadala : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question will come from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Tycho Peterson : Hey, good evening. I want to start with maybe earnings on the quarter, you know, you beat consensus by 6%, that's a lot less than the typical 20% to 30% beat. Can you maybe just talk to us some of the dynamics there? Was that inflation? Was that the supply chain challenges you talked about? Can you maybe touch on those? Shawn Vadala : In terms of the Q2 beat, Tycho? Tycho Peterson : Correct, correct. Yeah. I mean, it was less of an earnings beat than we've seen in prior quarters. And I'm just curious to know whether there were inflationary pressures or, you know that was supply chain pressures? Shawn Vadala : Yeah, absolutely. That's what it was. I mean, you know, we of course had the benefit from higher sales volume. The primary \u2013 there was maybe two things that was offsetting that a little bit, but the primary thing was higher costs associated with transportation and material costs. And, you know, if you kind of like, look at our gross margin for the quarter, it was down a little bit from what we were guiding, you know, initially in the \u2013 at the, you know, at the beginning of the quarter, and it was very much related to higher transportation costs and material costs. Tycho Peterson : And there was a lot more commentary in the prepared comments around supply chain. You know, if I go back to last quarter, you had a question, and I think you talked about building some safety stock, but it seems like things have maybe intensified on supply chain side, can you maybe talk to some of the steps you've taken there to alleviate some of the pressures? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah, let me talk to that Tycho. So, under the supply chain side is this, I would say the suppliers engagement is particularly challenging with respect to electronics, that's probably the most concerning part for us right now. And you hear it also from different part of the industries. In that regard, we are also facing longer lead times we are starting to battle obsolescence issues. We have shorter notices from our suppliers, which then will require also R&D teams to jump in and to redesign some of the products. On top of that, transportation and logistics, as Shawn said, are also challenging for our team. We do see bottlenecks and delays.  However, we are really doing the work \u2013 we're working on these topics to help offset. In terms of mitigation strategies, again, on material shortages, what we do for electronic components, some of it is redesigning short-term our products to make sure that we can deliver. We have been very successful so far. I would say we have been very successful fulfilling our customer demand this quarter, but it's definitely locking in more resources than we initially thought. And we also of course as Shawn said, we are facing some price increases on components, electronic components , for example, which going out through  situations may just have to pay much higher prices than you used to. And that impacts us a little bit on the gross margin side as well. Moving forward, we are closely monitoring the situation. Again, we have team prepared with mitigation strategies in case situations get more tricky, but it's hard to predict where it might hit you next. Again, we are most exposed currently on some of the chronic parts. Some of it will more impact retail for Q3 as well as retailers leveraging, also components that are used in consumer electronics, and those are the most pressure right now. So, again, there are several areas where we have to tackle these issues. We have the right teams in place. And of course, we also trying different ways to supply material. For Q3, I think it will not be \u2013 so far what we\u2019ve seen not be a major one, but we are on our toes to make sure that we can react as quickly as possible if this situation gets more intense. Tycho Peterson : Okay, that's helpful, and maybe one last one. I know it's a little bit early, you're not going to guide till next quarter. But any kind of higher level thoughts as we think ahead to next year? The Street said about 5% revenues, 9% EPS, obviously a lot of variables around the pandemic, but I'm just curious if you have any high level thoughts for next year at this point? Shawn Vadala : Yeah, no, it's still a bit early Tycho. I mean, you know, there's a lot of moving parts. And Patrick and I are actually about to kick off our annual budget tour here in a few weeks. And then, you know, we'll be doing that for about a month and like we do with our normal cadence every single year. And I think we'll have a much better perspective and feeling once we wrap up that tour. And you know we'll definitely provide an update during our next call. Tycho Peterson : Sounds good. Thanks. Operator : Your next question will come from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Derik De Bruin : Hi, good afternoon. Shawn Vadala : Hey, Derik. Derik De Bruin : Hey. So, a couple of questions. I guess the first one is, talk a little bit about gross margin progression in the back half. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. So, you know, you wanted me to start there or do you want to ask a second part first? Derik De Bruin : No, no. Start there, as opposed to  you with a whole  of stuff. Shawn Vadala : All right. So, our gross margin was up 50 basis points in Q2, as you saw. We're going to be flattish for the second half of the year. So, as I kind of mention in the pricing question, you know, we expect the benefits from pricing to slightly increase in the second half. But of course, going the other side of that is these increased material costs that Patrick was just speaking to. The other thing that we see in the back half is that we will not have the same level of benefit that we've had in the first half a year regarding volume. And so that's probably the other thing that kind of stands out in terms of comparing the first half versus the second half. So, if you kind of like put that together, the full year is probably up in the, whatever 20 basis point to 30 basis point kind of a range. Derik De Bruin : Got it. So, you know, the implied local currency growth in the fourth quarter was to be in the mid-single-digit range, and yet you're talking about potentially getting a 3% pricing tailwind. So that's implying, like 2% volume growth, that seems a little draconian of the drop off like that, I mean what sort of embedded in that? Shawn Vadala : Yeah, I mean, I don't know if I'd consider it draconian. I mean, I think we, you know, we're just kind of like looking at the limited visibility that we had not to repeat all the things that I mentioned before, about, you know, how much have we been benefiting from pent-up and stimulus and things like that, but yeah, I recognize that there's a, you know, an upside to it, if conditions continue to be favorable. Derik De Bruin : Got it. And just a little bit of a \u2013 just going back, I mean, the last time Mettler guided to 15% or something in the mid teens local currency growth was actually back in 2010, coming off at the financial crisis. And I think you did 14% in 2010, local currency growth, and that was off of a negative 10 comp. And now you're doing 15 off of a positive 1.8 comp. I'm just sort of curious on market dynamics, then now, and you know, because then, you know, then in 2011 you did 12% local currency growth the following year off of that. So, it sort of follows on to Tycho's question of, you know, why is 5% or, you know, why wouldn't we see-through like there's similar levels there, and what sort of like different about the market? Shawn Vadala : Yeah, I mean, hey, I think we're very pleased with our 2-year growth this year. Very different situation, you know, as you can appreciate versus 2010. Fully acknowledge that our end-markets are coming out of this, at least we expect them to come out stronger. We feel like we're coming out of this stronger. We feel like there's market trends towards automation and digitalization that benefit us. So, when we think over the medium-term, we feel very positive. To be specific about what it all means for 2022, you know, like I said, you know, there's, you know, we kind of need to go through our normal process here to have a better view on that more specifically. Derik De Bruin : Got it. Thank you. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Welcome. Operator : Your next question will come from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please proceed. Patrick Donnelly : Thanks. Maybe there's one on the industrial strength, you know, it's far more durable than maybe I expected among others. It sounds like the guidance is calling for a continuation in the back half and a little bit softer. But can you just talk through; I guess what you're seeing in that market? Obviously, China is an area of strength, but maybe on a geographical basis as well, just trying to get a better feel for the industrial piece. Patrick Kaltenbach : Sure. Thanks, Patrick. I'll take that. We are extremely pleased with another quarter of very strong growth for industrial. China has a big impact on core industrial, but we also have seen very strong growth in Europe, in Americas as well. I think Shawn mentioned the fact already that we are not only benefiting from a strong recovery in our end-markets, including some pent-up demand here. But we are also capitalizing on the screws with those specific sales and marketing tools around to Spinnaker, and to be able to benefit from our diversity of our product portfolio in our end markets. We see also in China, I would say particularly in China, some investments and benefits from government investments. And our customers, as Shawn said, demand for automation for connectivity, for digitalization, which plays really well in our product portfolio that we have. So, I think this also has clearly in excess, I thing the advantage of our product portfolio is the underlying momentum and the focus on automation and productivity gains will continue to help us to continue to drive this momentum. We are extremely pleased with core industrial, especially, and we see some slowdown, of course in Q4 based on the difficult compares. But we're also looking clearly a core industrial for us as a continued opportunity to take market share. Patrick Donnelly : That's helpful. And then maybe just one on, kind of the emerging markets outside of China, it seem to be coming back a little slower with low vaccination rates. And just, can you just give us a feel for what you see in terms of trends there as we work through the year? Patrick Kaltenbach : Outside of China, look, if you look at Asia Pacific on a broader range, I think we are still up in the 20% range in the quarter. So, if you would point to some specific countries, we have, for example, Thailand and Malaysia, where we are weaker this quarter. And, but the rest of it, say in a broader base also had a pretty healthy growth. Patrick Donnelly : Okay, appreciate it. Operator : Your next question will come from Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Matt Sykes : Great. Thanks, and congrats on the quarter. And thanks for taking my questions. Just one from me, and it's more focused on costs. And you guys have invested a lot in digital engagement, both in the sales and the service side, and COVID was a unique period of time where your customers are forced to engage with you digitally. I'm just wondering, as you've had conversations in the last month or two, and maybe these will fade away if, do the variance, but as you've had conversations with customers and getting back engaging in person, have you seen that customers are more \u2013 have a greater desire to actually continue that digital engagement and therefore, on the SG&A side, there might actually be some cost savings that are more durable than you might have thought or do you feel that customers just want to get back to the where it was before? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah, I'll take that. Thank you and look, what we're hearing from our customers, they actually love the new ways of \u2013 that we have engaging with them. I mentioned in my remarks up front, webinars where we really scale up significantly last year, we did a couple of hundreds of webinars and we now this year go to 2,000 because we see such a strong resonance from our customers on having that information  the action channel.  Then on top we have a really specialized Salesforce, which is also fully back in action. It gives us an opportunity to gain to use our direct sales force to really go also after competitive accounts and new accounts, approaching these with our solutions in it and their deep knowledge about our product portfolio, but use the broader digital channel, also for existing customers and begin broadcasting solutions in a much better way than we could in the past. Our customers I think at the moment, if you look at, you know the amount of trade shows that are for example available still limited. So, they're really looking over to us to say, give us different ways of how you can demonstrate your products in, if you're not a trade shows, if you cannot attend trade shows we use digital demos, we have studios, every major site to do virtual product demos, and that has been very well received by our customers and I trust that it will continue that way. We will have a very complimentary set up where our direct sales force will be, you know in terms of consultative selling and product solutions will be on customer sides. But we will use the broader channel on e-commerce channel, also digitally interface with customers. It will be \u2013 it will drive efficiency gains, is it cost saving? I would say it's an efficiency gain for us moving forward. We do not think about this is necessarily an opportunity to scale back our sales force. It\u2019s again an additional channel and in a competitive advantage for us to engage with customers on many different levels face to face interaction, as well as digital interaction. By the way, we also scaled up telesales over the last several years, significantly, to back up our direct sales force and that has been proven to be very effective as well. Matt Sykes : Great. Thanks for the detailed Patrick. Appreciate it. I'll hop back in the queue. Operator : Your next question will come from Josh Waldman with Cleveland Research. Please proceed. Josh Waldman : Hey, guys. Maybe following-up on Matt\u2019s question, a couple of questions on op expenses. Wonder if you could provide additional color on the magnitude and timing of the incremental investments you spoke of, I guess you know what level of step-up should we  for the second half. And any additional color on what these incremental investments are being targeted towards would be helpful as well. And then second, as we look to 2022 and potentially revenue growth maybe starts to normalize from the higher level this year, any concern in your ability to pull in costs commensurate to any slowing revenue or is there, you know, maybe some pull forward going on here in 2021 that de-risk 2022? Shawn Vadala : Okay, hey, so \u2013 hey, Josh, I'll take this one. This is Shawn. So, hey, of course, there's a lot of different moving pieces with our expense growth. I think one of the big pieces to not lose sight of is that we had prior year cost savings. And of course, you know, that optically affects this year's number, as we kind of bring back, you know, the workforce and things like that, where we had some workforce savings from last year. We still have an element and we also had some discretionary topics last year, as well, where we had savings. The one area where we have not brought things back a 100% would be in the area of travel, and I think that one will play out over time. And then, you know, but then, kind of another factor, of course, is variable compensation, you know, and so if you think about like, last year, we had much lower variable compensation This year, we're going to have much higher variable compensation. And then the third piece, I would say, is kind of this element of the investments.  And the investments are very much a sign of the strength of the organization in terms of our end markets, and trying to pursue growth opportunities for the future, and really take advantage of the situation. So, I'd say these are certainly incremental investments. There are a wide range of different types of investments. We talked about field turbo resources, during our last call, that program is going to be a little bit more disproportionally invested towards China versus the rest of the world, but it is a very global program.  We're doing other things that are more sales and marketing in nature, that we, you know, do on an ongoing basis, but we're going to do a little bit more than we normally do, you know, during the second half of the year, and then we're investing in other things, you know, in terms of \u2013 from a product perspective, and \u2013 but I wouldn't say we're necessarily accelerating things, but we certainly are, you know, working down our priority list, you know, and so, you know, I think every company has a priority list and we are able to work down that list at a more accelerated rate, just given the strong results that we see in the business. Josh Waldman : Got it. And then how should we think about the magnitude of the capacity investments you're making? Are those expected to hit more in 2022 or could it be partially seen in 2021 as well? Shawn Vadala : In terms of manufacturing capacity, you're speaking specifically to? I wouldn't say, I'd say there's, you know, different investments in different parts of the business. I mean, I think it's going to be nothing that will be coming all at once. I think you'll see gradual improvements, nothing significant or material to any one quarter, but certainly things that will benefit, you know, each quarter, kind of going forward. And then some stuff will kind of kick in a little bit next year. So\u2026 Josh Waldman : Got it. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your final question will come from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please proceed. Brandon Couillard : Thanks. Good afternoon. Patrick Kaltenbach : Hey, Brandon. Brandon Couillard : Patrick, you talked about, sort of using Spinnaker in terms of cross-selling an issue. I could be wrong, I don't recall Mettler talking much about that historically, is that a new aspect to Spinnaker that you're looking to capitalize on and what segments or what areas of the business would be most impacted by that? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah. Thanks, Brandon. That's an excellent question. Yes, and it's not totally new, but we are definitely emphasizing it more because look, our product portfolio is broad, it goes across a broader part of the value chain of our customers, all the way from R&D, , into production scale up in manufacturing. And, you know, with Spinnaker historically we have been more focused on a very dedicated and prioritized save force along the different product lines. We are now looking at more intensely at cross-selling opportunities in the customer \u2013 on the customer side and also starting from, you know, from one existing sales contact on let's say, specific R&D contact to make sure that we understand better the customer side in terms of what other opportunities are for us to penetrate in the other parts of the customer organization, maybe QC, maybe manufacturing, maybe in production scale up. And they're using then these leads to then send basically other dedicated sales team members with the right background and knowhow to these other accounts within a customer count. Again, we don't use generalists. We have specialized work forces and this is where it's now, I would say different or enhanced from what they have done before. We are \u2013 we have more dedicated initiatives and actually as part of the recent leadership team meeting we had, we had that as one of the topic across all of divisional leaders and all of the business and market organization leaders on how we can do is more effectively moving forward to make sure that we capture all of the opportunities that we have at any given customer site. Brandon Couillard : Brilliant. That's all for me. Thanks. Operator : I would now like to turn the call back over to Mary Finnegan, for any closing remarks at this time. Mary Finnegan : Thank you. And hey, thanks everyone for joining us this evening. As always, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Take care. Bye-bye. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

Let me now turn the call over to Patrick. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks Mary, and good evening everyone. I am pleased to report another quarter of very strong results. Customer demand was robust and our growth initiatives continue to be very effective. Our teams throughout the world are executing very well. I want to give a special acknowledgment to our global supply chain team, which is navigating a myriad of challenges with respect to raw materials, components, and transportation. Our ability to continue to meet heightened customer demand while overcoming the dynamic challenges in the supply chain is proving to be a competitive advantage in this environment. Now, let me turn to our financial results. The highlights on page 3 of the presentation. And you can see, we have another very favorable quarter. Local currency sales were 16% and we had broad-based growth in all regions. Our Laboratory business had excellent growth and our industrial product lines also performed very well. Food retail was a headwind, drove all our sales growth as we had significant decline in the quarter. With our strong sales growth and good execution, we achieved a 19% growth in adjusted operating income and a 24% increase in adjusted EPS. Cash flow generation was very strong in the quarter. Our end-markets remain favorable and our strategic initiatives are very effective at capturing growth. Our Spinnaker sales and marketing approach provide the framework to identify and pursue the most attractive market segments, while also increasing our sales force exposure to the most strategic customers. We also continue to invest in the strength and breadth of our product portfolio, further extending our technology lead and reinforcing customer trust through our global service offering, which supports customer\u2019s productivity.  We have several -- we have successfully navigated the challenges of the global supply chain to date but are cautious as dynamic -- demand dynamics remain challenging and conditions can change rapidly. Although pockets of uncertainty exist in the global economy, we believe we are ideally positioned to gain market share.  With proven strategies, good demand in our land markets, and continued focused execution on our growth and margin initiatives, we believe we are in an excellent position to deliver stronger sales in 2021 and 2022. Let me now turn it to Shawn to cover the financial and guidance details, and then I will come back with some additional commentary on the business and our outlook for next year. Shawn? Shawn Vadala : Thanks, Patrick and good evening, everybody. Sales were $952 million in the quarter, an increase of 16% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased 18% as currency benefited sales growth by 2% in the quarter. The PendoTECH acquisition contributed approximately 1% to local currency sales growth in the quarter, while we estimate that COVID testing was a headwind of approximately 1% to sales growth.  Last year, the benefit of -- in our pipette business from COVID testing labs was particularly strong. On slide number 4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales increased 20% in the Americas, 10% in Europe, and 16% and Asia rest of the World. Local currency sales increased 19% in China in the quarter. The next slide shows sales growth by region year-to-date. Local currency sales grew 20% for the 9 months, with a 21% increase in the Americas, 15% in Europe, and 23% growth in Asia, Rest of World. On Slide number 6, we summarized local currency sales growth by product area. For the third quarter, laboratory sales increased 23%, industrial increased 12%, with core industrial up 11%, and product inspection up 13%.  Food retail came in worse than we expected with a decline of 19% in the quarter. The next slide shows local currency sales growth by product area, year-to-date. Laboratory sales increased 26%, Industrial increased 16%, with core industrial up 21%, and product inspection up 9%. Food retail declined 1% for the 9-month period. Let me now move to the rest of the P&L which is summarized on slide number 8.  Gross margin in the quarter was 58.4%, a 20 basis point increase over the prior-year level of 58.2%. We benefited from volume and pricing, which was offset in part by the challenges in the global supply chain, namely higher transportation, logistics, and material costs, as well as the impact of temporary cost actions we undertook in 2020. R&D amounted to $42.3 million in the quarter, which is a 19% increase in local currency over the prior period.  The impact of temporary cost savings undertaken last year, and greater project activity contributed to this increase. SG&A amounted to $240.7 million, a 16% increase in local currency over the prior year. The impact of the temporary cost savings that we undertook last year, higher variable compensation, and increased investments in sales and marketing were the principal factors driving the increase. Adjusted operating profit amounted to $272.8 million in the quarter, a 19% increase over the prior year amount of $230 million. We're pleased with this increase, which reflects very strong sales growth combined with good execution. Adjusted operating margins reached 28.7%, a 20 basis point increase over the prior-year level of 28.5%.  On a 2-year combined basis, our margins were up 270 basis points as the prior-year margin benefited from the cost actions we implemented due to the pandemic. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $16 million in the quarter. Interest expense was $11.8 million in the quarter. Other income in the quarter amounted to $3.3 million, primarily reflecting non-service-related pension income.  Our effective tax rate before discrete items and adjusted for the timing of stock option deductions was 19.5%. Fully diluted shares amounted to $23.4 million in the quarter, which is a 3% decline from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $8.72, a 24% increase over the prior year amount of $7.02. On a reported basis in the quarter, EPS was $8.71 as compared to $6.68 in the prior year.  Reported EPS in the quarter includes $0.18 of purchased intangible amortization, $0.02 of restructuring, offset by $0.19 due to the difference between our quarterly and annual tax rate due to the timing of stock option exercises. The next slide shows our P&L year-to-date. Local currency sales grew 20%, adjusted operating income increased 35% with margins up 210 basis points. Adjusted EPS grew 43% on a year-to-date basis.  That covers the P&L, and let me now comment on cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $243.1 million, which is an increase of 19% on a per-share basis as compared to the prior year. We're very happy with our cash flow generation. DSO was 34 -- 35 days, which is 2 days less than the prior year. ITO came in at 4.5 times, which is slightly better than last year.  On a year-to-date basis, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $615.3 million, an increase of 48% on a per-share basis as compared to the prior year. Let me now turn to guidance. While our end-markets remained favorable, forecasting continues to be challenging. There are pockets of uncertainty in the global economy, most notably in China. Furthermore, the widespread challenges within the supply chain and in transportation and logistics in the corresponding inflationary impact also creates uncertainty. Finally, we have seen over the last several months how COVID variance and lockdowns can occur quickly. We recognize the importance of remaining agile and adapting to unexpected changes in the environment.  We're very pleased with our ability to navigate the unprecedented challenges of the last 2 years, which we believe reflects the strength of our organization. While we remain cautious about factors outside of our control, we feel very good about our growth initiatives and our ability to continue to gain market share and drive margin improvement via our pricing and stern drive initiatives. Now let me cover the specifics.  For the full-year 2021, we now expect local currency sales growth in 2021 to be approximately 17%. This compares to previous guidance of 15%. We expect full-year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $33.35 to $33.40 which is a growth rate of 30%. This compares to previous guidance of adjusted EPS in the range of $32.60 to $32.90. With respect to the fourth quarter, we would expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 8% and expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $10 to $10.05, a growth rate of 8% to 9%. For the full-year 2022, based on our assessment of market conditions today, we would expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 6% and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $37.25 to $37.65.  Using the midpoint of 2021 guidance, this reflects a growth rate of 12% to 13% Some further comments on 2022 guidance, we expect a slight headwind to sales growth from the impact of COVID testing on our pipette business. We expect interest expense to be approximately $50 million in 2022, in total amortization including purchased intangible amortization to be $65 million.  Purchased intangible amortization is excluded from adjusted EPS and is estimated at $24 million on a pretax basis or $0.79 per share in 2022. In 2022, other income, which is below operating profit, will amount to approximately $13.5 million. This is higher than the $10.7 million expected in 2021 due to an expected increase in pension income. Finally, we assume our effective tax rate before discrete items will be 19.5% in both 2021 and 2022.  In terms of free cash flow for 2021, we now estimate it will reach $810 million, which reflects a 29% growth on a per share basis. For 2022, we would estimate free cash flow in the range of $845 million. Cash flow in 2022 is impacted by higher variable compensation payments related to the very strong performance in 2021.  Once we get beyond 2022, we expect free cash flow per share will grow in line with earnings per share and Net Income conversion will be in the 100% range. We expect to repurchase approximately $1 billion in shares in both 2021 and 2022, which should allow us to maintain a net debt to EBITDA ratio of approximately 1.5 times.  Some final details on guidance; with respect to the impact of currency and sales growth, we expect currency to increase sales growth by approximately 3% in 2021 and be relatively neutral to sales growth in Q4. In 2022, we would expect currency to decrease sales growth by approximately 1%. In terms of adjusted EPS, currency will benefit growth by approximately 4% in 2021 and be a slight headwind to adjusted EPS growth in 2022. We do not expect currency to impact adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter. That is it for my side, and I'll now turn it back to Patrick. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks, Shawn. Let me start with some comments on our operating results. Our lab business had outstanding growth in the third quarter despite having more challenging comparisons than it faced in the first half of the year. Almost all product lines and regions had very strong growth. We expect good growth in the fourth quarter, but it won't be the same level we have seen year-to-date.  As we look at 2022, we expect the strong biopharma trends to continue to be favorable and expect other end-markets to do well. But we've own benefit from catch-up demand segments like chemical, that we benefited from this year. We also expect a bit of headwind in our pipette business from normal COVID testing activity, although we believe we are well positioned to continue to capture growth and gain market share in our laboratory business.  An additional nice development within our lab business is that we obtained a $36 million grant from the U.S. Department of Defense to expand our pipette production in California. the estimate by the end of 2023, we will expand our global tip production by approximately 15% and the grant will also allow us to enhance manufacturing, automation, and warehouse, and logistics of our surrounding tips.  We're happy with this grant which allows us to cost-effectively increase tip capacity while at the same time improving productivity. Turning to our Industrial business, core industrial did well in the third quarter as we are benefiting from some catch-up in demand and have been well positioned to benefit from increasing trends in automation and digitalization. Core industrial should have a solid fourth quarter.  We will face tougher comparisons in Core Industrial in 2022, but expect to continue to drive market share gains overall. Product inspection grew 13% in the quarter. Growth was especially strong in the Americas. We expect good growth in the fourth quarter, and we're cautiously optimistic about solid growth in 2022, as we should benefit from some pent-up investments from large packaged food customers and our strong product portfolio.  Finally, food retail declined 19%, with pronounce declines in Americas, in Asia, and the rest of the world. Our production was impacted by shortages of electronic components, as these products use more standardized components that are also used in consumer electronic products. We were also impacted by the timing of project activity. You would expect food retail to also decline in the fourth quarter. We are not forecasting much growth in 2022 as we continue to manage this business for profitability. Now, let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales in Europe increased 10% in the quarter with very strong growth in lap. You would expect solid growth in Europe in 2022 against very good growth in 2021, America has increased 20% in the quarter with excellent growth in lap, core industrial and Product Inspection.  As mentioned earlier, food retail was down significantly in the Americas. While we will face challenging comparisons in the Americas in 2022, we expect overall good growth. Finally, Asia and the Rest of the World grew 16% in the quarter with outstanding growth in laboratory, and good growth in product inspection. Core industrial also did well.  China had good growth particularly given their strong growth in the prior year. We expect good growth in China in Q4 and in 2022, although it won't be at the same level we have seen year-to-date. We continue to feel good about China over the medium-term, but acknowledge that there can be volatility in the shorter term. We are very strongly positioned in China and the team is executing well.  One final comment on the business, Service and Consumables performed well and were up 12% in the quarter. We continue to be very pleased with the growth in this important and profitable part of the business. That concludes my comments on the business and now let me provide some context on our 2022 guidance. We believe we are emerging from this pandemic as a stronger Company and are further distancing ourselves from competition in several ways.  During the last 2 years, we have accelerated our digital transformation in sales and marketing. We had already started on this path, but the disruption from COVID-19 allowed us to significantly accelerate our digital approach. Our use of Desmos, our vast and expanded digital library of selling materials, drill development of selling guides, and greater utilization of telesales and telemarketing services are clear differentiators for remote selling.  And while we expect our face-to-face customer interactions to continue to increase in 2022. These digital tools allow us to expand our customer reach in a cost-effective manner. In addition to the digital gains in sales and marketing, we have also made great strides in sharpening our focus on the most attractive market segments, allowing us to accelerate market share gains.  Increasing sophistication in data analytics is fundamental to our ability to guide our sales force to the best growth opportunities. We continue to provide what we refer to internally as top . These alerts provide tailored, actionable information about potential sales opportunities, which our market organization, qualify and integrate into the territory of planning and target setting. You see the trend for greater use and sophistication of data analytics continuing in 2022 and beyond. Our global service network and our ability to continue to service our customers during this period has led to steady increases in customer satisfaction. Service keeps us close to customers, builds trust, and the customer is much more likely to purchase additional products if they utilize our service offering.  We continue to develop service tailored specific to customer needs. For example, we quickly developed a service tool for customers who utilized analytical balances in quality control to meet new requirements from the European Pharmacopeia that goes into effect in January. In addition, as software is becoming integral part of our solutions, harmonized services for software are becoming increasingly important.  The new service offering support our instrument control software LabX to enable customers to achieve consistent performance and meet regulatory compliance. These are just 2 examples. We have many more within our portfolio. We believe service will continue to provide a good opportunity for growth and differentiation from our competitors. And we used the same data analytics approach to leverage service opportunities within our install base.  New product development also continues to be core to our growth potential. I am excited about the many launches that will take place over the coming year. Our product pipeline continues to be very strong and product launches reinforce on our technology leadership. While most product and software development will continue to be done in-house, we will also complement these small acquisitions, like the one we completed in October. We acquired a software Company, Scale-Up Systems, which is a leading provider of scale-up and reaction modeling software for pharma and chemical customers. It is a great addition to our AutoChem offering, and we now have a comprehensive offering for process development and Scale-up for the pharma and chemical industries. Turning now to supply chain and margin initiatives.  As already mentioned, our supply chain team has shown tremendous agility in adapting to very dynamic market conditions and continuing to support customers. There are risks and increasing inflationary pressures in the supply chain and transportation and logistics markets. We have mitigation strategies in place to help offset, and believe we can continue to manage effectively, but are cautious as conditions can change quickly.  Our pricing program and Stern Drive productivity initiatives have good traction and will help us to offset inflationary pressures that we will likely continue to face in the coming months. I trust this provides some context to our guidance and shows the confidence we have in our ability to continue to capture growth, gain market share and deliver solid earnings growth in 2021, in 2022, and beyond. I would now like to ask the Operator to open the line for questions. Operator : As a reminder,  Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question will come from the line of Eric Chung from Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Eric Chung : Good afternoon, guys. This is Eric Chung, on for Dan Arias today. Thanks for taking the question. First, can you separate organic growth in China lab versus industrial? And within China, are you seeing any changes competitive dynamics emerge, coming out of the pandemic within China, and if there's any market share opportunities that look different, pre -COVID versus post COVID? Shawn Vadala : Yeah, hey Eric, this is Shawn, I'll take that one and maybe Patrick can add some color at the end of it. In terms of the third quarter, China was up overall, just hold on a second. I'm getting my notes here, 19%. We had growth particularly strong on the laboratory side of the business, in the high 30s but we also had double-digit growth on our Industrial business. We're really thrilled with how well both businesses are performing. And as a reminder, our Industrial business grew particularly strong in Q3 of last year, in particular, Core Industrial business was up by 24% in Q3 of last year. When you look at these numbers on a 2 year basis, we feel really good. Overall, we feel very good about the competitive environment. I feel like our supply chain in general has been a competitive advantage in China, as well as globally as Patrick mentioned in the prepared comments.  And then when you look at our competitive -- the competitive landscape in China, I feel like we continue to take market share there and we're positioned well, and as you know, our team there is a very strong experienced team in the region and they're just executing extremely well. Patrick Kaltenbach : Well, right Shawn. If I may have a little flavor here is for both businesses for lap and for industrial business. Open investments in lab is really driven by investments in new lab, and investments in research that we see in China. And that's a very healthy business for us. So I think our team is exceptionally well-positioned to serve that market. We follow products that we have high end as well as local products will be manufactured in China. I think we have the right portfolio to really continue to see growth in the lab side as well. And on industrial, the demand in China is actually not similar from what we see in the rest of the world.  There is a lot of demand in -- for automation and productivity solutions, and with our industry solutions, especially new products that we have launched, like the industry's 360 turnover, etc. We are extremely well-positioned to help our customers to drive productivity in automation and we see -- what I hear -- what I'm hearing from China is that that demand will not continue to slow down. They continue to upgrade installed systems and they are looking for ways to become more productive. Eric Chung : Great. That's helpful. And to pivot to the product inspection business, and I think it's been about a year or so since you got step up and running at the Tampa product inspection site, and that was something you guys saw as a driver of operational efficiency when you talked about it.  How is that translated into recognize benefits this year and are you seeing any concerns in that business over the next quarter given the Delta variant emergence in the U.S. along with rising cases in China? Patrick Kaltenbach : I can take it. Look, we're very pleased with the business and I mean, the south of Tampa side is really operating extremely well. The output is great and they are really we see strong demand for the products. I think operations is running at full capacity right now. So we have no concerns with regard of the operations on this side, I think it's a very effective side. When we consolidated a couple of sizes, couple of years ago in Tampa.  Of course, there was some initial effort to pull everything together, but now I think we are very well positioned to serve the market with that sight. In terms of the demand for Q4, actually we see still bearing good momentum for PI. And also, as I said, looking forward in 2022, we are cautiously optimistic that there is additional slow pent up demand in the market that we can continue to serve. We have an extremely strong product portfolio. We just recently launched a couple of new additions to portfolio, which on the lines of our technology leadership in the market and we continue to all to do that in China as well. In China, we launched -- I think just a quarter ago, products, particularly Ex-12 system, which is a mid-range market system to help us to also serve the mid-range market in China, and is also a great door opener for us and helps us upsetting on the product as well. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Kevin Cassidy : Hi. This is Kevin on for Vijay. Looking at guidance for 2022. Can you talk to the pricing assumptions behind guide? And what is being implied for operating margin expansion in 2022? Shawn Vadala : Yes. Sure. Kevin, I'll take that one. So for pricing for next year, we're kind of targeting something in the 3% a range. Of course we acknowledge we're not in an inflationary environment, and so we'll adjust as necessary as we proceed into the year. And then when we look at our operating margin expansion, we expect to be in the 100 basis point range on top of this year.  And when you start to compound that on a multi-year basis, we feel particularly good about that. If you look at this year, will be a 120 basis points higher than the previous year. So we continued to deliver at the higher end of our long-term guidance of 7200 basis points.  We feel very good about our various margin expansion initiatives, pricing, as well as our Stern Drive program. But at the same time, we acknowledge there's also a lot of challenges out in the world in terms of material cost, and transportation costs that we talked about in our prepared remarks. Kevin Cassidy : And the follow-up. Looking at food in the quarter being down 19%, can you talk more about the segment and outlook going forward? Shawn Vadala : So food retailing was down 19% in the quarter. That business, as you know, is a business that we manage for profitability and not necessarily for growth overall, it's only about 5% of our total business. That business can be lumpy impacted by the timing of project or customer orders.  At the same time that business out of all of our businesses was the one that was negatively impacted by some component shortages because we use common electronics components in our retail scales that are also used in certain consumer products. We expect, going forward, to be down similarly in the fourth quarter, But then for 2022, we don't expect much growth in the business, probably up low single-digit.  And as I always say, if you look at that business over a longer-term period of time, it's just probably a low single-digit business, but it will be lumpy every now and then from quarter-to-quarter. Kevin Cassidy : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Citi. Please proceed with your question. Elizabeth: Hi, guys. This is Elizabeth, on for Patrick. I'm just wondering, You guys talk a little bit about inflation in general. I was wondering if you could talk about internally, if that's affecting wages and what you're seeing in labor in general. Thanks. Shawn Vadala : Yes. So, in terms of wage inflation, we're going to experience higher wage inflation. I think like every Company in the world, there's certainly -- it's a competitive labor market in all parts of the world. As we look at our cost structure for next year, our overall cost structure will go up about 4% or so.  And of course, wages are a significant component of our overall cost structure. But if you look at it. By geography, of course it's going to be highly differentiated based upon local labor markets. Elizabeth: Great. Thank you. That's it for me. Shawn Vadala : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Jack Meehan from Nephron Research, Please proceed with your question. Nisarg Shah : Hey, good afternoon. This is Nisarg on for Jack. To start, the lab segment performed well despite supply chain challenges, are you expecting heightened impact here in the fourth quarter? Patrick Kaltenbach : Can you repeat it? Can we expect -- sorry we didn't get it. Can -- what was the question? Nisarg Shah : Sorry. The lab segment performed well despite supply chain challenges in the third quarter. Are you expecting a heightened impact in the fourth quarter? Patrick Kaltenbach : Okay. I can take a is. Sorry, we didn't get that part about supply chain. Now, look, all that -- the business, actually we don't really expect a bigger impact in the fourth quarter and you have seen in Q3. It is a very dynamic situation as I say out there. Both in trends -- and logistics on the material supply side -- for the products we have in lap. You will notice, exposed as we are in the retail business. So we are not already concerned for the lab business. Dare to be honest. Nisarg Shah : Great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Derik De Bruin : Hey. Good afternoon. I've been bouncing around between calls, so my apologies if I'm being redundant here. But how do you think about any of your digital marketing and campaigns, and your field turbo and some of the other ones where you put a lot of feet on the street, and now those costs are expanding and it's like, is there a higher return now or emphasis on pushing more into the electronic and digital? I guess, how much of those efforts can -- how much more do you need to spend on building out electronic -- your e-commerce capabilities and such versus hiring people? Yeah. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks. That's an excellent question. Looking in its -- it's a really good question, but you have to look at it also from 2 different angles and you mentioned both the digital closures as well as to fuel tubular. We see a lot of demand at the end as well, and widely, actually invested quite a bit this year and fuel tours have made significant investments there and putting more fleet industry because we saw demand, and that actually it's paying back very quickly for us is great returns.  And on the digital side, we continue to be mobile to ensure engine overall that it's some marketing engine that its direct sales engine, etc. We have very effective on that. It has been at has also provided for us great returns. And we will always have both -- we oversee both approach. We have a direct consolidate Salesforce, which is in the accremate with customers. For our very dedicated higher end products, etc. that also need more consolidated selling. And then, we have -- we continue to build out our digital capabilities to serve more transactional sales and continue to strengthen our digital marketing capabilities.  I think this year we did a significant number of more  and other things to interact with customers, which has been extremely well received. It's a great tool for us to increase leads despite all the things that we do on -- so we are -- again, I think we are very well positioned, we made great strides forward during the pandemic and actually accelerate a lot of investments and we see great returns on that.  Again, I'm always looking at a business. I'm monitoring a number of fleets that are generated by these capabilities, and we are very pleased of how well they perform and how well they are received by the customers. Derik De Bruin : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies, please proceed with your question. Brandon Couillard : Thanks. Good afternoon. There really is a small acquisition, small software deal in Third Quarter, but any material revenue, it is tied to that. touch on whether that fill the whole of the portfolio and kind of your thoughts on appetite for similar type of bolt-on deals. Patrick Kaltenbach : What's the question specifically? What type of revenues are linked to -- sorry, look, a software Company requires Scale Up System is not a large Company, but it compliments on our portfolio in AutoChem specifically very well. We are a very strong player in AutoChem that business has been growing double-digit for a long time now.  We are extremely pleased with that. And we certainly see the combination of our existing portfolio together with this new software capabilities that require that we continued to serve -- can serve our customers and additional customers much better in the future. We will have a much better reach into regions where Scale Up Systems couldn't go with  force. I think it's a very well-received solution by the customers.  And then we have received also very positive feedback by the existing customers with Scale Up Systems on the acquisition overall. They see that 1 out of 1 perform actually equals more than 2 in this regard. So -- and then to your other part, in terms -- the other part of the question here is in terms of bolt-on acquisitions.  Yeah, we will continue down that line. We've mentioned that I think in every call that we continue to make bolt-on acquisitions in -- either in technologies area -- technology areas, where we see we need technologies that complement our strength or if it's other parts of the portfolio that we think are necessary in terms of the overall customer workflows. But these are small and medium-size acquisitions and nothing huge transformation. Brandon Couillard : Thanks. Shawn, it would be helpful if you could walk us through, change your top-line assumptions by segment for next year, and be able to quantify the impact of the lower demand on lap growth next year? Shawn Vadala : Yes. Sure. Hey, maybe I'll start with the lab business, and you want me to do Q4 as well as next year, Brandon? Brandon Couillard : That'll be cheaper? Shawn Vadala : Great. Hey, I'll just run through this for everybody. For lab -- for Q4, we're looking at low double-digit which would put us in a 20% growth range for the full year. And then for next year, we look at high single-digit for lab for core Industrial. We're looking at high single-digit for Q4, which would put us at mid to high teens for the full year. And then for next year, we would be more like low to mid-single-digit. For product inspection, we'd be high single-digit for Q4, which would put us at high single-digit for the full year and also high single-digit for 2022. For food retailing, we're looking at a similar decline in Q4 to what we saw in Q3, which would put us down mid to high single-digit for the full year and then for next year, we'd be looking at low single-digit growth. By geography, we're looking at Europe to be low to mid-single-digit in Q4, which would be put us at low double-digit growth for the full year. For next year, we're looking at low to mid-single-digit growth. For the Americas, we're looking at low double-digit growth in Q4, which would put us at mid-teens for the full year.  And then for next year, we're looking at mid-single-digit growth. And then for China, we have -- we're looking at low double-digit growth in Q4 which would put us in -- to the mid-20s for the full year. And for next year, we're looking at approximately 10% growth.  And then in terms of the other part of your question -- in terms of the COVID testing headwinds that we would have next year, that would be -- it would be a slight headwind. I think it would be probably less than 1%. I don't know if it will quite round to 1%, but it would be a modest headwind next year. That's our baseline assumption. Brandon Couillard : Excellent, thank you. Shawn Vadala : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Josh Waldman from Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question. Josh Waldman : Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. I appreciate all the detail on the outlook. Just two for you, I guess. First, a quick follow-up on Product Inspection, wondering if you could, I guess provide more context on what you're seeing from an orders and quoting activity. I mean, it sounds like the U.S. was strong. What are you seeing in other geographies?  And then as you look forward, I mean, it seems like there's a bit of cautious optimism in the commentary, but the high single-digit seems pretty strong here based on the comp from 2021. Just any more detail on kind of what\u2019s giving you confidence for next year would be helpful. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Good question, Sir Josh. So, product inspections is that we're very pleased with the current quarter Shawn that -- Dave just gave it to you. The growth for Q4, how we think about that high-single-digits.  We see demand in the Americas. We see putting models on Europe. China, again, has momentum as well. I mentioned that we have launched a new product there just a quarter ago. Overall, there is some pent-up demands, the pent-up demands for being more superseding, including more in the U.S. and if I look at the older situation as well as the leads we're getting, there's actually pretty high lead activity right now. We see a lot of requests both from Europe and U.S. but they're even higher than in Europe. But having said that, we are again, cautiously optimistic about 2020, that we can capture that pent-up demand. We're well positioned for our product portfolio, and also we are -- in terms of our manufacturing capabilities, I think we are operating very well and very effective.  We have not seen a lot of impact on supply chain side for that product line. So, in terms of exposure to semiconductors and components, etc. it's not as exposed to as we mentioned it for retail. Josh Waldman : Got it. Thank you. And then I wondered if you could give us an update on what portion of your revenue now is coming from bio production, I guess, in light of some of the recent acquisitions, thinking PendoTECH. And then maybe what's built into your assumptions for 2022 from that business. Shawn Vadala : Yeah sure. So overall, we don't have a precise number on that, Josh, but we typically like to say that overall life sciences in total is about a third of our business. I think knowledge is probably a bit more than that right now just given some of the acquisitions we've done in the last few years in the high growth we've had in that area. And then a few breaks that down into pieces, of course, large molecule in general is an important piece of that, and then bio-production in particular is also an important part of that. If you like it, just the pieces of bio-production, the area that we benefit the most would be in our process analytics business, which is probably in the 10% range of our total business, maybe a little bit more in an important part of product -- of process analytics is in bio-production. But of course we also sell Industrial scales in other applications into the bio-production environment as well. Josh Waldman : Okay. Yeah, appreciate it, guys. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Tycho Peterson from JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Rachel: Hi. This is Rachel in for Tycho. Thanks for taking the questions. So you said service and consumables was up 12% in the quarter. I was just wondering if you could talk a bit about the trends that you're seeing within both of those. Currently, I think consumables was roughly about 10% of revenue and services is about 20%. What's your long-term goal for each of those? And then could you also just touch on, how are you competing against third-party service providers? Thank you. Patrick Kaltenbach : Very good question there. Looking at -- is it extremely pleased with the performance of service and consumables events, very profitable part of the business for us. In terms of growth rate for services think about it,  maybe high. It could times high-single-digit, more mid-single-digits growth rate. Consumables is higher right now. We are -- who is continuing to grow that portfolio moving forward both on the consumable side for our products, but we're also increasingly providing higher-value services for our products. And I mentioned the 1, for example, for the Europe Pharmacopoeia there's a solution out there that we just launched.  That is, I think we have a lot of opportunities for installed base of products that we have out there to increase service contracts overall and to provide more differentiated services to our customers. We serve a lot of our products. But as of course, also competition in some areas, like the Scale areas. We -- I think we're positioning ourselves also in the future by providing higher sophisticated services, preventive maintenance and other things, have very comprehensive inventory management as well, solutions as well. So, very optimistic about accrued opportunity. Again, we are very, very well-positioned in terms of the competitive position. As we are also linking our software solution, so a hardware solutions and services. And that makes it more difficult for competitors also, take over some of the services that they all can exclusively provide some of mobile products. Rachel: Great. That's it for me. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Skykes from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Matt Sykes : Hey, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate it. Just one question for me. Big picture question. Just looking at Stern Drive is sort of a program and how institutionalize that is become and how successful that has been over the years and the iterative process and productivity enhancements it gives you. I am just wondering, looking at this current environment just with inflation supply chain constraints, we just really haven't seen something like this in a number of years.  Has it caused you to think differently about how you implement certain driver-driven aspects of it, has it made you think about different ways you can implement it, or different levers you can pull, just given the change in the environment that we've seen from a cost and supply chain constraint perspective? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah. Good question. Stern Drive has many flavors, it's back-office automation ideas, it's manufacturing setup ideas, it's -- in some areas, it's product redesign, and the -- it's a program that has been running for many years, and the team is actually going through several waves of Stern Drive, we call it internally waves. We just launched the next wave this year.  The team has come up with a whole -- a long list of good ideas that we just recently had order fulfillment top-line chain showed us the potential of all these activities. We had some concerns this year that our stern-drive activities could be impacted actually, by all the other activities given -- that weren't that necessary, given the restrictions we have seen the market logistic challenges etc.  But I'm happy to say the team didn't skip a beat there and they actually delivered on the promised savings that they had promised us for 2021 as well, which helps to overcome some of the inflationary pressures. Now, do we make a significant shift in terms of the activities given the lock to see challenges right now? I would say no, because again, they're very focused on productivity gains sometimes, product 3D signs, driving productivity and efficiency. Behalf on the supply chain side, we have a dedicated team in place who take us all the other logistical challenges Almost look  slides like shipments and shipping alternatives, etc. Access to different suppliers when it comes to components, we have dedicated resources who constantly screened a market for best opportunities for supply.  I think this is also why we probably came through this crisis so far very well, not having a lot of issues with component shortages, except for retail that we mentioned. But not often we also use semiconductors, I think the team has been very effective in finding alternatives and also working closely, with the internal engineering teams in case we would have to redesign products and use alternative products.  But I think it's working very well. I mean, it was a long winded answer, but overall we are big extremely pleased with stern drive. I think it's still a lot of fun way, be driving this with constant improvement, process mindset. And again, they have dedicated teams in all of our major slides who capture these opportunities. Matt Sykes : Great. Thanks very much, very helpful. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions in queue, and I would now like to turn the call back over to Mary for closing remarks. Mary Finnegan : Thank you, and thank you everyone for joining us this evening. As always, if you have any questions or follow-ups, please don't hesitate to reach out. Take care. Bye-bye.

Let me now turn the call over to Patrick. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks, Mary, and good evening everyone. We had a great finish to 2021 with strong fourth quarter results. We capitalized on robust customer demand and executed very well, particularly we respect our supply chain to meet customer demands.  The strength and agility of the teams around the world are reflected in these results. The highlights of the quarter are on page three of the presentation. Local currency sales growth was 11% and we have particular strong growth in the Americas and Asia and rest of the world. Both our laboratory and industrial product lines performed very well. As expected, food retail was a headwind to overall sales growth as we again had a significant decline in the quarter. Despite pacing higher material and transportation costs due to challenges in the supply chain, we had very solid growth in adjusted operating profit and strong growth in adjusted EPS in the quarter. The fourth quarter was the end to an excellent year of results. For the full year we achieved an 18% increase in local currency sales, a 26% increase in adjusted operating profit, which resulted in a margin improvement of 130 basis points. We have \u2013 we had outstanding 32% growth in adjusted EPS and finally, cash flow generation in 2021 was excellent.  We not only achieved great results. We also strengthen our competitive position in 2021 as innovation nourished our excellent product portfolio and comprehensive services offering combinable with our Spinnaker sales and marketing strategies, helped us capture growth opportunities. We also did a good job navigating the hurdles in the global supply chain. Our agility and excellent execution further reinforced our already strong brand. Importantly, our impressive results last year allowed us to make important investments for future growth. We are confident in our ability to continue to gain share and believe we are ideally positioned to deliver strong results in 2022 and beyond.  I will have some additional comments later, but let me turn it first to Shawn to cover the financial results. Shawn. Shawn Vadala : Thanks Patrick and good evening everyone. Sales in the quarter were $1.037 billion. This represents our first $1 billion quarter, which was a nice way to end 2021. This represented a local currency increase of 11%. On a U.S. dollar basis sales also increased 11%.  The PendoTECH acquisition contributed approximately 1% to local currency sales growth in the quarter, while we estimate that the impact of reduced volume of pipette tips in COVID testing was a headwind of approximately 1% to sales growth in the fourth quarter.  On slide number four, we showed sales growth by region. Local currency sales increased 16% in the Americas, 4% in Europe and 14% in Asia, rest of the world. Local currency sales increased 12% in China in the fourth quarter.  The next slide shows sales growth by region for the full year 2021. Local currency sales grew 18% in 2021 with a 20% increase in the Americas, 12% in Europe and 21% growth in Asia rest of world. Local currency sales increased 25% in China for the full year.  On slide number six we summarized local currency sales growth by product area. For the fourth quarter, laboratory sales increased 15%, industrial increased 11%, with core industrial up 11% and product inspection up 10%. Food retail declined 20% in the quarter.  The next slide shows local currency sales growth by product area for the full year 2021. Laboratory sales increased 22%, industrial increased 15% with core industrial up 18% and product inspection up 10%. Food retail declined 6% in 2021. Let me now move to the rest of the P&L for the fourth quarter, which is summarized on slide number eight. Gross margin in the quarter was 58.5%. We benefited from volume and pricing, which was offset by challenges in the global supply chain, namely higher material and transportation costs, as well as the impact of temporary cost actions we undertook in 2020.  R&D amounted to $45.6 million in the quarter, which is a 14% increase in local currency over the prior period. The impact of temporary cost savings undertaken last year in greater project activity contributed to this increase. SG&A amounted to $242.4 million, an 8% increase in local currency over the prior year. The impact of the temporary cost savings that we undertook last year, higher variable compensation and increased investments in sales and marketing were the principal factors driving the increase.  Adjusted operating profit amounted to $319.1 million in the quarter, a 9% increase over the prior year amount of $292.8 million. The increase reflects strong sales growth combined with good execution. Adjusted operating margins were 30.8% and were impacted by higher costs associated with our global supply chain and transportation costs. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $16.9 million in the quarter; interest expense was $11.5 million. Other income excluding one-time items in the quarter amounted to $5.3 million, primarily reflecting non-service related pension income. We reduced our effective tax rate from 19.5% to 19.0% in the quarter. This rate is before discrete items and adjusting for the timing of stock option exercises in the quarter. We are pleased with this reduction and expect to maintain the 19% rate in 2022.  Fully diluted shares amounted to $23.2 million in the quarter, which is a 3% decline from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $10.53, a 14% increase over the prior year amount of $9.26. On a reported basis in the quarter, EPS was $9.94 as compared to $9.03 in the prior year. Reported EPS in the quarter includes $0.21 of purchased intangible amortization and $0.09 of restructuring. We also had two items impacting income taxes. We had $0.17 of cost due to the difference between our quarterly and annual tax rate due to the timing of stock option exercises and we had a $0.14 benefit from adjusting our tax rate to 19% for the first three quarters. Finally, we had a $0.26 acquisition charge primarily \u2013 principally reflecting an increase for the PendoTECH acquisition earn out due to their updated projections.  The next slide shows our P&L year-to-date. As Patrick mentioned, we had an exceptional year of results in 2021, with local currency sales growth of 18% and adjusted operating profit increased 26% and our operating margins increasing 130 basis points to 28.5%. Finally, adjusted EPS grew 32% to $34.01 in 2021. We are extremely pleased with these results and our ability to capitalize on growth opportunities and navigate a challenging supply chain environment. That covers the P&L, and let me now comment on cash flow.  In the quarter adjusted free cash flow amounted to $206.6 million, which was better than what we had expected and was impacted by the timing of tax payments. DSO showed further improvement in the quarter, with a decline of two days to 35 days as compared to the prior year. ITO came in at 4.3x flat with the prior year.  For the full year adjusted free cash flow amounted to $821.9 million an increase of 31% on a per share basis as compared to the prior year. The strength of our cash flow is apparent in our net income conversion which reached 103% in 2021.  Let me now turn to guidance : Forecasting remains challenging. Demand in our end markets is favorable, although there are pockets of uncertainty in the global economy, particularly in China. The challenges within the global supply chain and in transportation and logistics and the corresponding inflationary impact also creates uncertainty.  Finally, we acknowledge that COVID is not behind us and variance and lockdowns can occur quickly. We recognize the importance of remaining agile and adapting to unexpected changes in the environment. We remain cautious about factors outside of our control and remain focused on our growth initiatives. We believe we can continue to gain market share and drive margin improvement via our pricing and stern drive initiatives. Now, let me cover the specifics. For the full year 2022, we now expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 7%. This compares to previous guidance of 6%. We expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $38.15 to $38.50, which is a growth rate of 12% to 13%. This compares to previous guidance of adjusted EPS in the range of $37.25 to $37.65. Some additional comments on 2022 guidance. We expect a slight headwind to sales growth from the impact of COVID testing on our pipette business. We expect gross margins for the full year to increase in the 30 basis to 40 basis point range. However, we expect to see improvement in gross margins in the second half of the year as we see further benefit in pricing and other margin initiatives.  Interest expense is estimated at approximately $50 million and total amortization, including purchased intangible amortization to be $67 million. Purchased intangible amortization is excluded from adjusted EPS and is estimated at $25 million on a pre-tax or $0.86 per share. Other income which is below operating profit is estimated at approximately $14 million. Finally as I already mentioned, we expect our effective annual tax rate before discrete items will be 19%.  Turning to the first quarter, based on market conditions today, we expect local currency sales growth of approximately 10% and expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $7.25 to $7.35, a growth rate of 11% to 12%. A couple of further comments : A reminder that comparisons in the first quarter are particularly challenging as adjusted EPS grew more than 60% in Q1 last year. We would expect gross margins to be down in Q1 due to higher supply chain and transportation costs.  We will provide more insight on our next call, but it is worth mentioning now as you update your models, that Q2 will have a very tough prior year comparison as local currency sales were up 27% and adjusted EPS increased more than 50% in the second quarter of last year. Some final details and guidance. With respect to the impact of currency and sales growth, we expect currency to decrease sales growth by approximately 1% in 2022, and decreased it by 2% in Q1. In terms of adjusted EPS, currency is a little worse than the last time we provided guidance. We now expect currency will be headwind to adjusted EPS growth of approximately 1% in 2022 and a headwind of approximately 2% in the first quarter.  Let me comment on free cash flow. For the full year 2022 we estimate it will reach $855 million. As we mentioned on our last call, our cash flow this year is impacted by higher variable compensation payments related to the very strong performance in 2021. In fact we expect cash flow in Q1 to be down versus the prior year. Once we get beyond 2022, we expect free cash flow per share will grow in line with earnings per share and net income conversion will be in the 100% range. We expect to repurchase approximately $1 billion in shares in 2022, which should allow us to maintain a net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio of approximately 1.5x.  That is it from my side. And I\u2019ll now turn it back to Patrick. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks Shawn. Let me start with some comments on our operating results. Our lab business had very strong growth in the quarter despite having great growth in the prior year. Almost all product lines showed robust growth. We will start the year with very good momentum in lab in the first quarter while growth in the remaining quarters will be impacted by challenging mid-year comparisons. With our excellent product portfolio and effective sales and marketing initiatives, we believe we are well positioned to capture growth and continue to gain market share in our laboratory because. Turning to our industrial business. Core industrial did very well in the quarter and will have a strong start to 2022. We are benefiting from our attractive product portfolio, very good implementation of Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives, as well as increasing demand from our customers for automation and digitalization.  We will face tough comparisons as the year progresses, but expect to continue to gain share here as well. We are pleased with another quarter of good growth in product inspection, which increased 10% in the quarter. We expect a good start to the year and are optimistic that we will have good growth in 2022, as largest packaged food companies show more appetite for investments. Finally, food retail declined 20% in the fourth quarter. We were impacted by shortages of electronic components as well as timing of project activities. We expect low double digit decline in the first quarter and overall do not expect much growth here at 2022.  Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales in Europe increased 4% in the fourth quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Both lab and industrial had solid growth, while retail was down double digits. We expect good growth in Europe to start the year and overall solid growth for the full year 2022.  Americans had another quarter of very strong growth with 16% increase. Lab had excellent growth, while industrial also did very well. Retail was down significantly. Americas will also have a strong start to the year and then face more challenging comparisons as the year progresses.  Finally Asia, rest of the world grew 14% in the fourth quarter, with outstanding growth in laboratory and product inspection and very good growth in core industrial. China grew 12% with excellent growth in lab. We are very strongly positioned in China and the team continues to execute well. One final comment on the business; service and consumables performed really well and were up 10% in the quarter. We continue to be very pleased with the growth in this important and profitable part of the business.  That concludes my comments on the business. Well COVID is not yet behind us, we believe we will exit the pandemic in a stronger competitive position. Many factors have contributed to this, including our excellent product political, extensive service offering, well engrained and proven sales and marketing strategies and an agile and experienced supply chain team. Another important factor is our process and system harmonization program Blue Ocean, which is the foundation and enabler of many of our corporate programs and initiatives. Blue Ocean is a multi-year program that harmonizes how we do business, internally and with customers. It encompasses all aspects of our franchise : sales, service, supply chain, R&D, HR and finance. With harmonized processes and data, we can leverage a globally standardized single instance IT system that digitalize our processes and provides data that increases our business transparency.  Let me provide some additional insight. Blue Ocean supports the framework for our Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives. Our CRM and installed base provides extensive details on customers and potential customers that we use in marketing campaigns, sales, project alerts, cross selling campaigns and support for other data analytics techniques. It provides comprehensive data on customers purchasing activity.  Blue Ocean is also the foundation for our pricing program. It provides data analytics to guide us in our pricing decisions and also allows us to implement price increases efficiently on a global basis. Similarly, Blue Ocean harmonizes our services offering, allowing us to provide standardized services on a global basis. It also provides transparency in terms of field service productivity, service profitability by customer and highlights additional sales opportunities.  Our supply chain is highly complex as it involves more than 3,000 possible suppliers, 150,000 different SKUs, more than 800,000 components, 19 production organizations and three logistics hubs. Blue Ocean provides us with the transparency and real time data that is critical for mitigating supply chain challenges.  Agility and collaboration between our market organizations and business units allow us to leverage our supply chain as a competitive advantage in helping us gain share. Blue Ocean is critical to the success of our Stern Drive program as it provides the data and transparency to continually make improvements to our back office and manufacturing productivity.  Finally, Blue Ocean is instrumental in providing meaningful, real time information that has become particularly important during the last two years given how quickly market conditions have been changing. We develop specialized and tailored data alerts allowing us to see firsthand, the impact on our business and allow us to make decisions quickly. We will continue to evolve Blue Ocean and believe it has become a clear competitive advantage for us. Before I conclude, I also want to make a brief comment on our ESG initiatives. We are committed to sustainable development across the broad environmental, social and governance aspects covered by a long standing GreenMT sustainability program. We believe it is our responsibility to act in a manner that considers future generations. We have great accomplishments in ESG, including achieving carbon neutrality, which we expect to score one and two emissions and sourcing 100% renewable electricity.  We focus on five key areas : one environmental; two, sustainable products and services; three, responsible supply chain; four, engaged employees; and five, good corporate governance. While we have an excellent track record in ESG, we have set ambitious targets for the future. Importantly, we have recently committed to absolute emission reduction targets consistent with the latest criteria issued by the Science Based Targets Initiative. This will cover scope one, two and three emissions. We have also set a target to reduce our waste intensity by 20% and achieve zero waste to landfill by 2025.  To reinforce the importance of ESG, executive management compensation in 2022 will incorporate specific environmental, as well as diversity targets. I think both Blue Ocean and our ESG goals are great examples on how Mettler-Toledo focuses on the long term to enhance the value of our franchise. I would now like the operator to open the call for questions. Operator : . Your first question will come from Dan Arias with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Eric Chung : Hi, this is Eric on for Dan. Thanks for taking the question. Just one on capital deployment, could you just discuss your plan for that, for the year besides the $1 billion share buyback. Like are you finding any assets becoming more attractive given the recent market moves that might have you looking for ones that might be on a larger scale than the usual smaller tuck in deals? Shawn Vadala : Yeah hey! Maybe so, I guess there's two parts to that question. So you know in terms of our M&A strategy, I\u2019ll let Patrick kind of comment on that, but no change in our strategy. We still think we're a great platform for bolt-on acquisitions. We also feel very strongly about our organic story. So we're very selective in terms of the acquisitions.  But if you look at like the PendoTECH acquisition we did last year, I think that's a really excellent example of the type of acquisition that we're looking for and PendoTECH of course has been a great addition to Mettler-Toledo. In terms of capital deployment, you know we also feel good about our share repurchase program. The programs continues to be very successful from our perspective and we target about 1.5x net leverage ratio and right now we're expecting to repurchase about $1 billion of shares in 2022 and as a reminder, we do that on a very consistent basis throughout the year. Eric Chung : Okay. And then could you just provide a rundown of the top line assumptions by segment for the first quarter and for 2022, that they can see improved guide? A - Shawn Vadala : Yeah, sure. So hey, I\u2019ll start with the divisions. So I'll start with the lab division. Right now our guidance is low double digit growth for Q1 and high single digit growth for the full year. For core industrial, we expect high single digit growth in Q1 and mid-single digit growth for the full year. For product inspection, we expect high single digit growth for Q1 and high single digit growth for the full year; and for food retailing we expect to be down double digit in Q1, but grow low single digit for the full year. And then I'll also give you the geographies. For Europe we expect Q1 to be up mid-single digit to high single digit, and for the full year to be up mid-single digit. For the Americas we expect to grow low double digit in Q1 and grow mid-single digit to high single digit full year; and then for China we expect to grow approximately 10% in Q1 and approximately 10% for the full year. Eric Chung : Thank you so much. A - Shawn Vadala : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hey! This is  on for Derek, thanks for the question. So geographically a two-parter on China here. Are you seeing any impact in China specifically from lockdowns and also you know trade tensions are heating up with some touching, the bioprocessing, CDMO segment. Is there any concern that the trade issues could slow demand for lab products. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah, let me take that term. Look, I mean our business in China has been very strong. We have a very strong footprint in China. We have been there for 30 years. We served many customers that are broad based. Also as a reminder of more than 40% of all business in China is industrial business, but to biopharma and what we\u2019re seeing there is very healthy trends for us. We have overall not seen impacts from lockdowns in the last quarter and right now this is what we are hearing from the team, is they are not concerned of any of the impact that you mention regarding biopharma right now. Unidentified Analyst : Great! And then one more on the margins for the quarter. What were some of the \u2013 can you go more into detail on some of the pressures you saw and how do you kind of expect them to impact early on in 2022? Do you think there's going to be any carry over there? A - Shawn Vadala : Yeah, hey! So I'll take that one. So hey, maybe I'll talk more broadly about the margin and then kind of like, then kind of talk about 2022 as well. So as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, our gross margin was down 110 basis points in the quarter.  On one hand we had favorable price realization. Our price realization was just over 3% in the quarter, which would translate to approximately 140 basis point benefits to the margin. Of course we also benefited from our volume in the quarter. But the one thing that clearly stood out from our perspective was the higher material costs, as well as higher transportation costs in the quarter. And as we kind of like look to Q1, we are expecting to see similar trends overall for gross margin with probably very similar dynamics you know. Probably that pricing will continue to be in that 3% kind of a range, but we\u2019ll still continue to have like a bit of a headwind on material costs and transportation. So if we look at gross margin for Q1, I wouldn't be surprised if we're down another 100 basis points in Q1, but we still remain very confident about our ability to expand the margin. And so as we look to the full year, we still believe we can expand our gross margin by 30 to 40 basis points and we expect to still increase our operating margin overall at the higher end of our typical guidance. So as a reminder, we typically would say \u2018Hey! We can expand margins on an annual basis, 70 basis points to 100 basis points,\u2019 if you look at the mid-point of our guidance, towards the higher end of the range of that, probably about 90 basis points. So when you break that down, we are expecting a little bit better pricing in 2022 than we previously expected. We were previously guiding to about 3% for next year. Right now we're thinking it will be probably 3.5% or so and wouldn't be surprised if we get to the 4% kind of a range in the second half of the year, because of course we're going to continue to adjust and do actions as we see appropriate, especially as we saw some of the pressures in the fourth quarter on our cost structure. But it's not only about pricing of course. We're also going to be doing some things in terms of optimizing our supply chain as we continue to look for opportunities; for example, to reengineer components or look for other sources in the supply chain. Unidentified Analyst : Great! Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from Josh Waldman from Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question. Josh Waldman : Hi! Thanks for taking my questions, just a couple for you. Shawn or Patrick, I guess from a demand outlook perspective, could you talk through the product areas or the regions that improved versus your plan 90 days ago that led you to pull your organic growth up I guess early in the year. Patrick Kaltenbach : Maybe I\u2019ll start Shawn and let you chime in as well. So let me talk to the product categories. I mean we see sustained demand, healthy demand in our lab business moving forward, so we \u2013 and Shawn gave you the numbers in terms of the growth expectations, so lab I would say holds up very strong. It has been strong in Q4 ready. We are also pleasantly surprised by the momentum that we still see in industrial, driven by demand for automation and digitalization and our product portfolio that we have there really serves the demand very well. I think I mentioned in my comments also the fact that we\u2019re still seeing some healthy appetite in product inspections from some of the packaged food companies out there.  So overall I would say we are actually, on a broader front across these categories that I just mentioned, we are nicely surprised that we see stronger demand than we anticipated when we gave you the last guidance and that's why we raised the guidance. That's basically \u2013 I wouldn't point to any specific end market here, not to any specific region I would say. Overall obviously better demand than we expected. Josh Waldman : Got it, got it. Then Shawn, I wondered if you could provide us a bridge to the updated earnings guide. I mean it sounds like most of the increase was due to organic growth; I guess is that correct? And then if you could provide us kind of your assumptions for the low and the high end of the EPS range as it relates to maybe organic growth and margin, that would be helpful. A - Shawn Vadala : Yeah hey! So I'd say you know, if you kind of bridge EPS, you know it's like you said, a lot of it has to do with higher sales growth, increasing the sales growth. Of course we also added in our beat for 2021, which includes a lower tax rate you know at 19% and that was offset a little bit, that was offset a little bit by unfavorable currency. Josh Waldman : Can you provide the range or the assumptions that went into the range for the updated guide, EPS guide? Shawn Vadala : Yeah hey! We typically don't get too much into like the specific assumptions for the low end and the high end. I mean we \u2013 you know for the top line for example we said approximately 7%, so I don't want to try to start deviating from is the you know six point this or seven point that or you know the margin is a little bit lower, a little bit higher, but you know you could probably flex your model and get a sense for you know what that would translate in terms of an EPS range. But you know you can appropriate Josh. I mean there's a lot of \u2013 you know there's a lot of ingredients into the recipe. At this point and time of the year a lot of things can change as we get into the year. It\u2019s a very, very dynamic environment and so there's always going to be things that can be a little bit better, but there's \u2013 of course there's things that can be a little bit worse. Josh Waldman : Sure. I appreciate it guys. Shawn Vadala : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question will come from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi! This is Rachel on for Tycho. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter you guys. And so, a few questions here on lab. So lab was better than expectations. You guys grew about 15% growth guidance of low double digit for 4Q. So can you talk about if you saw any catch up spending on the lab side of things and then were there any other underlying changes in the market to drive the beat there? Patrick Kaltenbach : No, look I wouldn't say there was catch up or any pent-up demand. We see really strong demand for our products. We have a very strong product portfolio. I think it competes extremely well, but we also have been able to deliver to our end customers and that came to some extent as some cost as Shawn also mentioned that drives \u2013 that has a little bit of impact on our gross margin, because we do broker buys, etc. the make components more expensive, but it's very important for us to really make sure that we can deliver products to our customers. Overall, I think we see very strong demand for our products and it's reflected in those numbers. There's not a specific market segment that I would point to. Pharma, biopharma as we said is very strong for us in labs , but is also of course deployed in other segments like even in battery segment or if you look at the \u2013 some broader chemical segment of course. All of the last buy products from us and there is a demand from these end markets, none of them really specifically that sticks out in terms of change versus what we have guided regarding Q4. A - Shawn Vadala : Yeah, and you can see that strong momentum is also reflected in our Q1 guidance, you know of low double digit for lab. Unidentified Analyst : Yeah, I hope so. And then maybe going off that for the segment guidance, so I appreciate the comments around the expectations by geography as well. So it looks like you have an improved outlook in Europe and Americas for the year. So can you just talk about what's driving our confidence in those regions? Is it specific segments that\u2019s driving it or kind of what drove the increase there? Shawn Vadala : Yes, so the Americans yeah was up a little bit. I mean we just continue to \u2013 I mean you saw what we did in the fourth quarter in the Americans as well. I mean it's just really, not the overuse the word, but really good momentum, very broad based growth in the portfolio and that was despite our food retailing business being down in the quarter.  You know I would say our industrial business is \u2013 you know our lab business is doing very well, but our industrial business continues to be really resilient and performing well and as Patrick was saying earlier, you know we very much are benefiting from a lot of these trends towards automation and digitalization. I mean there's just a huge demand in the world to be more productive and we're just very fortunate to be in a position to be able to help serve that demand. And you know the teams have done just such a great job in this division. There's a lot of good innovation; there\u2019s also really good execution and you know as we've been trying to also pivot the business towards the more attractive market segments over the years, we continue to see that paying a lot of dividends. And then also as Patrick mentioned, you know there are these hot segments in the world, both on the lab side and the industrial side that we also have been good at in terms of capturing growth. Unidentified Analyst : Great! That's it for me. Thank you. A - Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah, thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from Jason Reiver with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Jason Reiver : Hey there! You got Jason on for Patrick. Congrats on a great quarter! Two quick questions for you; one, are you seeing strength in the industrial market? Just curious about the visibility into that strength into \u201922. And then two, just wondering on how PendoTECH is performing relative to expectations and any further color to shed there. Thanks. Shawn Vadala : Yeah, I\u2019ll take that. Good questions on industrial. I think it is \u2013 as we look into 2022, of course we will face tougher comparisons as I said as we\u2019re going deeper into 2022 towards the second half, but we see good demand in the end markets. It\u2019s driven efficiently in all major regions by demand automation and for digitalization; Shawn mentioned that as well. That\u2019s really a fundamental driver.  We have an outstanding performance \u2013 platform there on the product side to serve those demands and we are confident that also the new products that we launched this year like the industry 362 and one of our media presence, these demands nicely, and that we think it will continue in 2022. Of course, even if you have tougher comparisons you can all see the same growth rate in the second half, but we are competing extremely well that. On your comment regarding PendoTECH, we was very pleased with that acquisition. Actually it outperformed our expectations in 2021 and we see continued strong demand as we go into 2022 for the products. Jason Reiver : Great! Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please proceed with your question. Jack Meehan : Thanks and good afternoon. Another question on industrial, but was hoping you could weigh in. You know we're seeing higher commodity prices along with the talk around inflation. Was curious just from a demand perspective, if you saw that playing out in terms of any industrial customers for your coverage, just amongst your customer based on the industrial side. Shawn Vadala : No. Hey Jack, this is Shawn. We are not seeing that impact any of our customer demand at all. An interesting comment, but no, we are not seeing it from a customer side. Jack Meehan : Interesting! Okay, and then back on product inspection. So the guide for the first quarter high singles, you know the headline looks good, I have that compounding though, still kind of in the low single digit given the comps. Just to be curious, just to get a little bit more color as you're talking with your customers when you think, just the timing for when some of the reviews spend could be going in the CapEx. Shawn Vadala : I'm sorry, Jack. Patrick Kaltenbach : Okay. Jack, its okay. Shawn Vadala : Okay. Go ahead Patrick. Yeah. Patrick Kaltenbach : Okay Shawn, I\u2019ll take it, okay. We are really happy with the results of product inspection in Q4 and also with the full year results. We are clearly a leader in product inspections. We have the broadest product range and also the largest services network. Our outlook for 2022 is good and we are assuming that we see more investment from last manufacturing. So there's some pent-up demand and that's why we also guided to double digit growth in the first quarter and we expect this segment for us to perform really, really well.  But also as a reminder to understand, food manufacturers represented only about 70% of our product inspection business. And these customers have been impacted by COVID. Remember last year we talked about the fact that it was also difficult for all the service people to get in some of these accounts and deliver service. That is coming back. It has come nicely back, so we will also see better service growth that we had last year in this segment as well. Jack Meehan : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Patrick. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Matt Skykes with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Matt Skykes : Hi! Thanks for taking my questions, I appreciate it. Maybe Patrick just a high level one for you, as you think about the supply chain, you have been dealing with a lot of challenges there. It sounds like you\u2019ve been making a number of investments in Blue Ocean and other areas to try to improve that, and I'm sure this environment has probably led you to see a number of pressure points that you might be able to alleviate with spend. But I guess my question is, if we do come out of it and supply chain does start to loosen up, do you feel like the investments that you've made so far will lead to a greater efficiencies and productivity and maybe acceleration margin expansion if we get out of this, because of what you've already put into the business to make it better. Patrick Kaltenbach : We'll look \u2013 a very good question Matt, thanks. I mean we continuously invest in Blue Ocean since many, many years, so . We have right now about 85% of the overall business is on Blue Ocean. But we still have a couple of rolling to do, but we are making good progress there. Definitely the investments we are doing are all targeting productivity enhancements across the board, so we will continue to benefit from those. Whether it will be an acceleration of margin improvement, I don't think so. I mean we have some history. We have made all these good improvements in margin expansion. So I wouldn't put that into consideration when we move forward. We will make \u2013 we will continue to make improvements, but I think we will see acceleration just by the fact that we do these investments of Blue Ocean. We have done this in the past and making great process. We are absolutely convinced, it is a competitive advantage for us and it will continue to drive improvements, but not accelerate it. Matt Skykes : Got it. And then maybe Shawn, you had mentioned in your prepared remarks some uncertainty around China, you know which I think is pretty apparent, that you are looking for sort of 10% growth for the year. Anything that you are concerned about regarding China underlying that kind of uncertainty comment or is it sort of COVID related, lockdown related type issues. Shawn Vadala : Yeah, I mean we're not seeing anything specific in our business Matt, but it's just that general, you know knowledge that everyone has about, like there\u2019s just a lot of things going on there. I mean it could be \u2013 like you said it could be COVID, it could be lock-downs, the way that they handle COVID with their zero tolerance policy, you know could have implications on the business or in the local economy.  PMIs have been floating right around 50 on and off, but there's always uncertainty there and then there's always \u2013 and we always say things can change quickly there, right, they can go in either direction very quickly, that's always been our history there. So I think for us it's always important to remind people that when we give guidance to provide that type of caution so that people understand those risks. But when we look at China, and we look to the medium and the long term, we were very favorable. I mean we continue to feel very good about the growth, we continue to feel very good about our business. We feel like a lot of the government's focus with their five year plan, in terms of life-sciences and health and safety, a lot of the emerging industries that they are heavily investing in, they all played very well to our portfolio. And this general theme of automation and digitalization also is a big theme in China as well. And so \u2013 and as they continue to expand the economic development to the west, I mean we\u2019ll \u2013 our industrial business will also benefit. So we continue to feel very strongly about it, but in the short term there can always be volatility. Matt Skykes : Understood. Thanks, very helpful. Operator : Your next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Vijay Kumar : Hey guys! Congrats on a nice print year and thanks for taking my question. I guess I have two, one on the Q itself. The gross margin here is sequentially flattish. Historically you guys have had a very strong Q4 gross margin. I'm curious, was there any defining element here in the Q4 around what happened to gross margins? Shawn Vadala : No. Hey Vijay! This is Shawn. No, I mean \u2013 basically we just saw the cost inputs increase much faster than what we expected, and it was kind of broad based in a lot of different cost categories, but I\u2019d probably highlight electronic components as an area that was much higher than the others, and also transportation costs came in higher than expected which was a little bit of a surprise if you just think about like, it's not a new topic and we were already facing cost headwinds in terms of transportation going back to Q4 of last year.  But like we always say, like I think the key in this environment is to make sure that we have \u2013 you know the systems in place to be able to monitor these changes and so that we can react quickly and I think you know \u2013 and that\u2019s what we are doing. We are highly focused on it as an organization.  We are going to see some similar trends in Q1, but I think as you kind of look to the full year, we certainly still feel good about our ability to expand margins and as I said earlier, before we still believe we\u2019ll expand our gross margin for the full year, 30 basis to 40 basis points, and then from an operating margin perspective we\u2019ll expect to be at the high end of our typical guidance, probably around 90 basis points at the midpoint of the guidance. Vijay Kumar : That\u2019s helpful Shawn. And maybe one for Patrick here. The Q1 guidance here, your comps are really though. I'm just curious, given the lock downs here in China, what visibility do you have into those numbers or what is driving the  and the guidance raised for the year by 100 basis points, how much of that was a pricing versus margin if you will? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah well, I mean it's \u2013 look, I have to get that out. Our confidence in Q1 is driven by the demand we are seeing. As we said, we are dramatically impacted by any lockdowns in China right now. There is of course a little bit uncertainty moving forward. It might have some impact, but we are pretty confident that on 10% that we have given you for Q1. We see the demand, we see the regions performing not only Asia Pacific and not only China; it\u2019s also the US and Europe is performing as we expect and that gives us confidence that we will have a solid, really solid Q1.  In terms of you know the outlook questions, it\u2019s a little bit of both, it\u2019s a little bit of volume and it\u2019s also of course a little bit of pricing. I mean we don't want quantify it. Shawn already make comments on pricing, but it\u2019s a component of both. We have volume increase and we have some pricing impact as well. Vijay Kumar : Got it. Thank you guys. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Couillard : Hey! Thanks. Good afternoon. Just a couple for you Shawn. In terms of pricing for the year, should we think about that as being fairly similar between lab and industrial or is it more weighted towards one segment or the other. And secondly, looking at your gross margin outlook, is your expectation that kind of material transport headwinds paid by the second half or is that still a drag on the gross margin line? Shawn Vadala : Yeah, hey good question, Brandon. Hey! So in terms of pricing, it's probably slightly better on the lab side than on the industrial side. And if I just think about the portfolio, but of course you know we'll have good price increases in both divisions. In terms of material costs, I think we'll certainly see a drag, you know probably through certainly in the first half of the year. I'd like to think by the time we get to Q4 we are not going to see a drag and so hopefully there's a little bit of a benefit by the time we get to the fourth quarter. But I wouldn't count on too much right now until we see things play out. Patrick Kaltenbach : That's true for both, that\u2019s true for material but also transportation. We don't think that will ease up before the second half. Brandon Couillard : Got you, that\u2019s helpful. And then just one follow-up on China in the fourth quarter. Could you break out the lab versus the industrial businesses for the fourth and kind of what you are assuming for those two segments for \u201922, just within China? Shawn Vadala : Yes sure. So our lab business in the fourth quarter grew about high 20s and then our industrial business in the quarter grew mid-single digit, and you know kind of for the full year, we are expecting lab to be probably like low double digit and then with industrial probably like mid-single digit. Brandon Couillard : Okay. Thank you. Operator : You're not your next question will come from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Catherine Schulte : Hi! Thanks for the question. I guess first, you mentioned consumables and services were up 10% in the quarter. How sustainable do you think that growth is going forward and what\u2019s your expectation from those categories in 2022? Patrick Kaltenbach : Very good question Catherine, thank you. I mean look, I think we have very good potential in consumables and services. In services of course we are going after our installed base, making sure that those customers who do not have their products on the contract can also switch to contract, because it just gives them a more reliable service panel, all in terms of you know early maintenance, etc.  The 10% we have seen, both definitely very strong in Q4. I would say my expectation for services, it maintains in the high single digit range for 2022. It\u2019s a very profitable business for us and we are putting a lot of emphasis on making sure that our customers understand the benefits of our services and we are broadening the service offering over time. So I think this has quite some runway. Shawn Vadala : Yeah, hey Catherine! Maybe one additional comment on the consumables is of course, we won't have the benefit of the COVID testing that we've had in the past. So that could be a little bit of a headwind. Catherine Schulte : Yes, okay got it. And then in pharma and some other industries we've seen, a bigger push for on-shoring and creating redundancy in supply chain as COVID has played out. Where do you think we are in terms of that phenomenon and capacity build out? I\u2019m just curious how much longer you think that could continue to be a tailwind for the market? Patrick Kaltenbach : I think it will probably continue as it played out in 2021 and 2020 into probably next one or two years. That\u2019s what we are seeing at least from some of the accounts that we are closely monitoring, and I think it's not only pharma by the way. We see also some very good momentum in semiconductor where you know the big facility is coming up now in the United States where a lot of core facilities are coming back to the United States, which is also a very good business for us. So I think that again that will continue from our perspective at least through 2022 and may be also 2023. It's definitely some good tailwind for the overall market. Catherine Schulte : Great! Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from Lu Li with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Lu Li : Thank you for taking my questions. Just want to follow-up on the pricing. I think you mentioned 3.5% or even close to 4% for this year. Do you hear any push back from customers, and then does that impact your ability to further increase the pricing for next year? Shawn Vadala : Yeah, hey! So yeah, hey just to clarify, so I said that we\u2019ve \u2013 our guidance previously was 3% and we kind of like thinking it's about 3.5% or so for the full year, but we wouldn't be surprised if we were in the 4% kind of a range in the second half of the year. We continue to feel good about our ability to pass on price when we need to, when we face these inflationary challenges, and I think we'll continue to do that as market conditions change. Lu Li : Got it. Another question on the 7% of growth guidance. Does that change your long term growth outlook like, should we think about like 7% going forward? Patrick Kaltenbach : Very good question. Maybe, I\u2019ll start with some backdrop. We believe we have strength in our competitive position throughout the pandemic and tend to believe that we are coming out of COVID strong. We have a very strong foundation across many businesses, we have market leading positions, we have excellent product portfolio and a global service network.  I think we are able to adapt our sales and marketing tools and techniques to the new environment and as a result we continue to gain share as we mentioned it many times, despite a challenge in these environments. Our market is nicely rebounded in 2021 and it worked very effectively to capitalize on these growth.  Now looking forward, I still think you should think about us as a mid-single digit growth on an organic basis in the mid-term. That\u2019s about the dimension that we also think about it. It of course will depend on how the underlying market performs. It goes back to where it has been pre-pandemic. I think that\u2019s the wide range we are thinking right now. Of course if there is a momentum in the market, we will \u2013 again our goal is to grow above our underline market. But, I would like you to think still a mid-single digits. Lu Li : Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : At this time there are no further questions in queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mary Finnegan for any closing remarks. Mary Finnegan : Thank you. And I just have two additional comments before I let you go for the night. First, we anticipate holding an Investor meeting at our facility in Boston on Monday, November 7. We'll come back to you with more details in the coming months, but wanted to mention it to you now as you plan your calendars for this year.  Second, we are happy to announce that Adam Uhlman has recently joined our Investor Relations team. He was formally a Senior Equity Research Analyst at the Cleveland Research Company. Adam will take over the lead in Investor Relations later this year, as I will retire towards the end of 2022. It's great to have Adam onboard and I look forward \u2013 please join me in welcoming him, and I look forward to introducing him to you in due time. For the time being, please continue to director your Investor Relations matters to me. As always, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Take care everybody. Bye-bye. Patrick Kaltenbach : Bye-bye. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Patrick. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks, Mary, and good evening, everyone. I'm happy to be here with you tonight. Before I cover the quarter, let me make some overall comments on Ukraine. We are deeply concerned about the ongoing war in Ukraine and its impact on so many people. We are monitoring the situation closely, and it is a relief to know that our employees in Ukraine could find shelter in safe places. We sincerely hope that the war will stop soon and the suffering of so many will come to an end. Now turning to our results. We had a very strong start to the year with our first quarter results. The highlights are on Page 3 of the presentation. Local currency sales increased 14% as compared to the prior year. We had excellent growth in our Laboratory and Industrial businesses and generally saw broad-based growth in most regions. Food Retail was again a headwind to our growth. Our ability to navigate the challenges of the global supply chain and meet customer demand is again proving to be a competitive advantage. We did face higher costs associated with supply chain and transportation in the quarter. However, despite this, we had very good increase in adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share. This growth is particularly impressive given the extraordinary growth we had in Q1 of last year. We feel positive about our outlook for Q2 and for the full year, although we are facing greater macro uncertainties as compared to the last time we spoke. We recognize our agility and resilience will be pivotal to navigate the challenges of these market conditions. Later, I will have some additional comments on our business, but let me now turn it over to Shawn to cover the financials and guidance. Shawn? Shawn Vadala : Thanks, Patrick, and good evening, everybody. Sales in the quarter were $897.8 million, which represented a local currency increase of 14%. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased 12%. PendoTECH contributed approximately 1% to local currency sales growth in the quarter, while we estimate the impact of reduced volume of tips and COVID testing was a headwind of approximately 1% to sales growth. On Slide number 4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales increased 16% in the Americas, 10% in Europe and 15% in Asia Rest of the World. Local currency sales increased 16% in China in the quarter. On Slide number 5, we summarized local currency sales growth by product area. For the quarter, Laboratory sales increased 18%, Industrial increased 12%, with core industrial up 15% and product inspection up 9%. Food Retail declined 14% in the quarter. Let me now move to the rest of the P&L, which is summarized on Slide number 6. Gross margin in the quarter was 57.9%. We benefited from volume and pricing, which was offset by challenges in the global supply chain namely higher material and transportation costs. R&D amounted to $43 million in the quarter, which is an 11% increase in local currency over the prior period, reflecting increased project activity. SG&A amounted to $235.3 million, an 8% increase in local currency over the prior year. Investments in sales and marketing contributed to this increase. Adjusted operating profit amounted to $241.2 million in the quarter, a 15% increase over the prior year amount of $210.7 million. The increase reflects strong sales growth combined with good execution. Adjusted operating margins came in better than expected at 26.9%, which represents an increase of 70 basis points over the prior year. We are very pleased with these results, particularly since our operating profit increased almost 50% and our margins were up more than 400 basis points in the first quarter of last year. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $16.6 million in the quarter. Interest expense was $11.3 million in the quarter. Other income in the quarter amounted to $3.7 million primarily reflecting non-service-related pension income. Our effective tax rate was 19% in the quarter. This rate is before discrete items and adjusting for the timing of stock option exercises in the quarter. Fully diluted shares amounted to $23 million in the quarter, which is a 3% decline from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $7.87, a 20% increase over the prior year amount of $6.56. In the first quarter of last year, adjusted EPS grew more than 60%. So we're very pleased to have such good growth on top of last year's performance. On a reported basis in the quarter, EPS was $7.55 as compared to $6.32 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.22 of purchased intangible amortization, $0.14 of restructuring, $0.02 of acquisition costs and a $0.06 benefit due to the difference between our quarterly and annual tax rate due to the timing of stock option exercises. That covers the P&L, and let me now comment on cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $75.5 million, which came in pretty much as expected. As mentioned on our last call, first quarter cash flow was impacted by our variable cash incentives given our record year in 2021. We continue to make nice improvements on DSO, which declined approximately 3 days to 37 days as compared to the prior year. ITO came in at 4.1x. Let me now turn to guidance. Forecasting is challenging. On the positive side, momentum in our business is good and the team is executing well. However, there are greater challenges in the macro environment as compared to the last time we spoke. These include risks of COVID-related lockdowns in China as well as ongoing risk of COVID in general. It also includes tough dynamics within the global supply chain and in transportation and logistics and higher inflationary pressures. Foreign currency movements have also been volatile particularly with the strengthening of the Swiss franc versus the euro and the weakening of the renminbi versus the dollar. And finally, the global impact from the war in Ukraine is also a factor. A hallmark of our culture is agility, and we recognize the importance of being able to react to unexpected changes in the environment. We remain focused on the factors within our control and are confident in our initiatives. We believe we can continue to gain market share through our Spinnaker initiatives and our excellent innovative product portfolio. We will also drive margin improvement via our pricing and SternDrive initiatives. Let me make some general comments on the full year before covering the specifics. First, we are facing greater foreign currency - foreign exchange headwinds to our earnings growth as compared to three months ago. Specifically, we now estimate that foreign currency will be a headwind to adjusted EPS growth of approximately 3.5% as compared to 1% headwind when we last provided guidance. We expect to increase operating margins on a currency-neutral basis by approximately 100 basis points. Our reported margins will be slightly higher as currency is a headwind to operating profit but benefits margins slightly. Now let me cover the specifics. For the full year 2022, we now expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 8%. And - this compares to previous guidance of 7%. We are increasing our full year sales guidance primarily for our Q1b. We expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $38.20 to $38.50, which is a growth rate of 12% to 13% and a growth rate of 16% to 17%, excluding foreign currency. We are bringing up the bottom end of our previous adjusted EPS guidance range slightly while leaving the top end unchanged. Our Q1 beat is more than offset by increased unfavorable currency in the remainder of the year. For the second quarter, based on market conditions today, we expect local currency sales growth of approximately 7% and expect adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.70 to $8.80, a growth rate of 7% to 9% and growth of 11% to 13%, excluding currency. A couple of further comments. We would expect gross margins to be down slightly in Q2 due to higher supply chain and transportation costs, but we expect gross margins to be up for the full year. Some final details on guidance. With respect to the impact of currency on sales growth, we expect currency to decrease sales growth between 3% and 4% for the full year and decreased sales between 4% and 5% in Q2. In terms of cash flow, we continue to expect full year cash flow in the $855 million range and expect to repurchase approximately $1 billion in shares in 2022. We expect a net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of approximately 1.5x. That is it from my side, and I'll now turn it back to Patrick. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks, Shawn. Let me start with some comments on our operating results. Our lab business had excellent growth in the quarter with almost all product lines showing very robust growth. We expect another good quarter of growth in Q2 although it won't be at the level we had in the first quarter as comparisons are more challenging. We expect end markets to remain favorable. And with our excellent product portfolio and effective sales and marketing initiatives, we believe we can continue to gain market share in our laboratory business. Turning to our industrial business. Core industrial did very well in the quarter. We had expected a strong start to 2022, and it came in even better than we expected. Our strong product portfolio and good market demand which is driven in part by leveraging our Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives are driving the good results. We will have solid growth in the second quarter and expect to continue to take share but will face tougher comparisons. Product inspection came in pretty much as we expected. We continue to be optimistic that we have good growth this year as large packaged food companies have shown strong interest in our product offering. Finally, Food Retail was again down meaningfully in the quarter as expected. We were impacted by a lack of project activity, weak market conditions, especially in China and shortage of electronic components. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales in Europe increased 10% in the quarter with flat showing excellent growth, while Industrial had very good growth as well. Retail was a headwind to growth with a double-digit decline in the first quarter. Our sales growth in Europe for the remainder of the year will be modestly impacted due to a lack of sales in Russia. Otherwise, at this time, we are not assuming a considerable impact of European sales growth due to the war in the Ukraine. Overall, we expect solid growth in 2022 in Europe. Americas had excellent growth in the first quarter. Lab had great growth, while Industrial also had very strong growth. Retail had good growth as well. Americas will have tougher comparisons in the second quarter, but we expect good growth for Q2 and for the full year. Finally, Asia and the Rest of the World had excellent growth in the first quarter with outstanding growth in Laboratory and co-industrial. Retail was down significantly. China grew 16% with excellent growth in lab and core industrial. With respect to the lockdowns in China, our main manufacturing facilities are in Zhangzhou, which is about 115 miles outside of Shanghai. These facilities were not subject to the strict lockdowns that occurred in Shanghai. We do have a smaller production facility and offices in Shanghai, which were impacted by the shutdowns. We are one of the first group of companies to receive approval to reopen in Shanghai which we did last week. We also have suppliers in Shanghai that have been subject to the lockdowns. Our team in China has done a great job in navigating these challenging dynamics, but the situation is very dynamic and can change quickly. Assuming market conditions remain as they are today, we believe we will deliver strong growth in China in 2020. One final comment on the business. Service and consumables performed really well and were up 15% in the quarter. We are very pleased with the growth in this important and profitable part of the business. That concludes my comments on the business. The teams continue to show great agility in adapting to challenges in the macro economy, which has contributed to our strong results. Also contributing to these results is our continued focus on what we can control, namely providing solutions with clear value to our customers. New product development is an important component of our strategy and we are constantly coming to market with new products that enhance our customers' productivity, reduce their cost and support their data integrity requirements. With no one product by itself a significant to sales growth, together, our new product launches strongly support our organic growth strategy and market share gains and reinforce our innovation leadership. There are two important trends to our customers in both the lab and in industrial are facing, namely the need for greater automation and digitalization. Our solutions play very well in these prevailing trends. Let me give you some examples. I will ask customers are under increasing pressure for productivity improvement, while at the same time, facing labor challenges. Automated solutions can increase the productivity of workflows, minimized errors, improved safety and lower costs. We have some good examples of our products that support our customers' need for automation in the lab. Last year, we introduced our new automatic balance which sets a new standard for weighing by providing automated dispensing of powders and liquids, which speeds up and simplifies the often tedious and error-prone manual weighing process. The desired target amount is simply ended on the balanced terminal and the substance is dispensed directly into the container in a fully automated process. The balance is flexible and easy to use, can allow for smaller sample size and is a fully integrated benchtop system with a sample change that can be added to dispense up to 30 samples in a fully automated drum. This automated balance also supports digitalization needs of customers when paired with our instrument control software LabX, which can provide automatic data handling workflow guidance and central data storage, thereby meeting data integrity requirements of our lab customers. We also have good service opportunities in terms of installation, qualification and ongoing calibration. This balance is a unique solution and is a great example of how our innovation can support customers seeking to increase automation in their everyday operations. Another lab example is our automated liquid handler for titration that we recently launched. Titration for example, is used to measure concentrations, and requires fast and precise handling of sample solutions for analysis. Our new instrument allows for automated sample preparation and precise dilution. Importantly, it eliminates cross-contamination and delivers highly accurate dispensing, thereby allowing for continuous processing of complex workflows. The instrument allows for a quick and easy switch between application setups and automatic recognition of an RFID tag. LabX can also control the instrument secure data and support regulatory needs of the customer. Turning to Industrial. The trends of our automation and digitalization are also very relevant for our customers in manufacturing. Labor shortages and targets for increased output continued to accelerate the demand for industrial automation. Customers need easy-to-use, strongly guided solutions that drive tangible productivity improvements. At the same time, increased demand for higher speed, more data, life device status and real-time control drive digitalization needs, particularly around Ethernet-based plant floor connectivity. In the second half of the year, we introduced a new compact automation weighing indicator that exactly fulfills these customer demands. Our instrument seamlessly feeds weight data and system status for any of our scales and sensors into an end user automation system. Thereby helping customers automate very precise processes like pharmaceutical filling. It is easy to use with a quick system start-up, increased system running speed simplified programming and instantaneous and very reliable data transfer to more precise control. Customer response has been very positive, given the strong value proposition this new instrument provides. Software is important to our industrial customers as well as our lab customers. Our statistical control and process control software freeway reduces cost overfilling and support of our customers' demands for data integrity in regulated environments. Deviations during manufacturing, can be immediately corrected to achieve optimum field quality while meeting all regulatory compliance requirements. For food and chemical customers, our new Forms + Recipe management software helps customers replace paper-based recipe workflows, guiding operators to precisely weigh ingredients for perfect batches and of course, full traceability for regulatory compliance. These are just a couple of examples how our technology development is supporting the trends our customers are facing. Understanding these trends, in combination with our in-depth knowledge of customer processes underpins our new technology developments. New product launches, combined with our highly effective Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives are key drivers for our organic sales growth and market share gains. That concludes our prepared remarks. While challenges exist in the world today, - we are convinced that with our well-ingrained growth initiatives and our agility and focus on execution, we can continue to gain market share. I would now like to ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator :  Your first question comes from the line of Derek De Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Nisarg Shah : Great. Thank you. This is Nisarg on for Derek. So I wanted to start on the margins. What was the pricing contribution? How much did pricing add to margins in the quarter? And kind of just looking at the rest of the year, has anything changed in regards to your confidence on the gross margin expansion for the full year? Shawn Vadala : This is Shawn. I'll take that one. So in terms of price realization, pricing came in pretty much as expected, maybe slightly better, just north of 3% for the quarter, which resulted in an impact on the gross margin of about 140 basis points. Of course, we also benefited from sales volume as well, but both of those factors were offset by higher material costs as well as higher transportation costs. Overall, if you remember, like last quarter, we were - in Q4, the margin was down 110 basis points. And at that time, we're saying we thought that the gross margin in Q1 would be down at maybe a similar level. So overall, it's actually a little bit better than what we expected. As we kind of like look for towards the rest of the year, we kind of see our price realization continuing to improve, given increases in inflation that we've kind of continued to see here during the first quarter. We will continue to do things throughout the year as we deem appropriate. At the moment, we're kind of thinking that our overall gross margin will still be slightly down in Q2, maybe like in the 20 basis point kind of range. But then by the end of the year, we're expecting our gross margin to be positive probably in the 20 basis point range, maybe even 30 basis points for the full year. And kind of behind that, we would be assuming about a 4% price realization for the full year, which is a little bit better than what we were looking at last quarter when we spoke, which we were saying about 3.5%. And then I think it's also worth looking also at the operating margin. I mean if you look at - we're talking margins, it's also important to look at our full year operating margin, which we think currency neutral will be up about 100 basis points, which we're pretty happy with because that's pretty much the top end of our typical guidance. And the way currencies work in this environment, the actual number will actually be a little bit higher, but adjusted for currency will probably be 100 basis points. Nisarg Shah : Great. Yes. That was really helpful. One more. So with the core sales guide raise that's two consecutive quarters, what kind of gives you the confidence with the macro uncertainty looking towards the last three quarters of the year? Shawn Vadala : I mean, hey, I think we feel really good about our business. I mean, we came off of a very strong Q1, much better than what we expected. We - as we kind of observed our markets and we also observed the execution around the organization, we have a really great momentum on our initiatives, whether it's our sales and marketing initiatives, our service program is doing really well and then - and all the things that we do from an innovation perspective with product development, et cetera. I mean, we just feel like we have a lot of great things coming out. So the things that we control, we feel actually really good about. Of course, there is a lot more uncertainty in the world. and we'll see how things play out. But I think if you look at our multiyear CAGRs, we feel good about where we are in Q1, and we feel good about our guidance for the rest of the year. But we acknowledge there's uncertainty in the world, but we feel like we feel very good about our guidance. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Jordan Adler : This is Jordan Adler on for Vijay Kumar. I was just wondering EPS wasn't raised despite the sales growth raise. I was wondering if this was an incremental FX impact or if anything changed on the margin or pricing assumptions for the year? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Shawn, I'll let you take this question again. Shawn Vadala : Yes, sure. Yes, no problem. Yes, I think you kind of answered it for us. I mean we had the Q1 beat, but then as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, foreign currency actually more than offset that. I mean if you - if we kind of go back three months ago, we were expecting about or estimating a 1% headwind to EPS in regard to currency, we're now estimating about a 3.5% headwind and a lot of that has to do with - well, there's a few things. One is the strengthening of the Swiss franc versus the euro, the second is the weakening of the Chinese renminbi versus the U.S. dollar. And then there's probably just this general factor of the strengthening of the dollar generally versus most countries in the world. Jordan Adler : And just one more. I was curious if you could go into detail on some of the supply chain pressures that you felt this quarter, if anything, trending better or worse from previous quarters? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. I can take that. Look, on the supply chain, of course, we're still facing headwinds like many other companies as well. The majority of the headwinds are still coming from electronic components. There's a shortage in the market on several fronts. So we have to go into broker buys trying to mitigate it. Sometimes we have to redesign some of our boards to other alternative electronic components, et cetera. But overall, the manufacturing team and our supply chain team is handling the situation extremely well. Those headwinds, we think will remain for the remainder of the year. There's not a lot of hope that the, let's say, the parts issue and components issue will resolve throughout the year. So we are taking care of that again by our flexibility in terms of being able to really sign boards or to ultimately increase inventory for some of the critical components that we need for our boards. Otherwise, on transform and logistics, I mean, you see the same news that we are seeing. There's definitely in China, in Shanghai, we see a lot of vessels enterprise waiting in front of the poll to be unloaded. There will be some stress there as well. And be able to anticipate that the overall logistic challenges will not cool off in Q2, maybe towards the later part of the year, but it remains to be seen. But again, we are very confident in our ability for Q2 with what we have so far on the way, we think we will be able to feed on a few numbers. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Josh Waldman from Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Josh Waldman : Thanks for the time and thanks for taking my questions. Maybe one for Patrick and one for Shawn. Patrick, 18% growth in lab was well ahead of the low double digits, I think you guided to for the first quarter, guided that level kind of in early February. I mean any more context you can provide on what drove the upside here in the quarter? I mean was it burning down backlog? Was it stronger than expected pricing gains? And then I guess, a follow-up, what is the guide now assumed for the second quarter and full year for lab? Patrick Kaltenbach : Okay. Good. Let me take the first part of the question, and then Shawn will cover the second one. Look, we are extremely pleased with our growth in the first quarter. And again, that's coming on 18% growth in Q1 last year. So it's not an easy compare. Same, by the way, is true for Q2. When you look at last year, we had 27% growth. And this year, we also forecast a very solid growth for Q2. We think that it's clearly driven by our strong product portfolio and our strong go-to-market strategies and the Spinnaker sales and marketing tools, which are really, really strong and helping us to guide our sales force to the most attractive targets, being very agile in identifying where the growth is, and this is going across all end markets. We see strong growth in the lab area. We see excellent growth still in the industrial area where we see a lot of demand for automation. And our portfolio is perfectly positioned to address the demand. So I would say it clearly reflects some of our market share gains that we are seeing right now. We have a strong portfolio. We have excellent strategies, bringing this innovation to market. And it's also why we are confident on the rest of the year. Shawn? Shawn Vadala : Yes. In terms of the guidance, we're guiding lab to high single digit for the second quarter. As a reminder, we grew, I think, 45% in Q2 of last year in lab. And then for the full year, we're guiding approximately 10% for the full year in lab. Josh Waldman : Got it. And then, Shawn, a follow-up on the guide. Could you give us a bridge to the new earnings guide? I think you beat your Q1 guide by something like $0.52, but FX, I think, is something like an incremental dollar of a headwind for the full year. I guess, is that right? And what are the other moving pieces in the - to the reiterated guidance? Shawn Vadala : Yes, it would be less than $1, Josh. But you're right, there's a little bit of a gap between those two numbers. And hey, I just think there's a lot of things that we're working on in the company where we can mitigate these things, whether it's productivity or other things we do with our margin program. So we feel like it's early enough in the year for us to make up that small gap. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Rachel Vatnsdal : Thanks for taking the questions. So first off, it was great to hear that you guys grew 16% in China, just given the dynamics there. So could you just walk us through what's assumed for growth in China for the guidance in 2Q. And then you also mentioned that you expect China can still grow this year. So can you just talk about your confidence in that outlook? And when you think that China will fully return to growth this year? Thanks. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. I'll start and then Shawn, feel free to chime in. So let me start with, again repeating the same as we get off to a great start. As I said, 16% growth in local currency. And that's an excellent growth of more than 40% in the prior year. And despite the challenges, that did you hear in the country via outlook for Q2, and for the full year is very good. And I think there are many factors that contribute to this. But it's diversity of our business in China, and that should not be overlooked. And we have very broad footprint in industry, very broad footprint in lab. And with that tremendous diversity in customers end markets and product lines. That's actually a great advantage, particularly when market conditions are more challenging like they are at the moment. So, the lock downs, as I mentioned in my remarks before this although it didn't affect us too much in Q1, given that a lot of major manufacturing centers are outside of Shanghai. And then, also our logistics hub in China has not -- was not materially impacted either in this quarter. So again, that gives us a lot of confidence for Q2 and Q3. We see strong interest in our products. We have a broad base portfolio that has in China still have a lot of demand for automation. On the lab side, a lot of demand for new products, especially about smaller labs and the bio labs. And data integrity, as I mentioned, is driving a lot of demand for our products. So, overall confident in China moving forward, because you also have a very strong team that applies our go-to-market strategy seamlessly. Our the Spinnaker sales to marketing opportunities, really looking for the hot segments in the market, like the battery segment and other stuff that we can clearly identify very early. We have AI bias mark-to-market search tools in place where we identify the customers that are going to invest using different data sources and the intelligence behind that we identify that. And then we have very dedicated sales force guidance tools in place to drive our sales force to these new investment targets. And then agility, I think, speaks little bit that that drives a lot of our growth that we see in China. Patrick Kaltenbach : In terms of the guidance, Rachel, we're looking at high single-digit growth for Q2, that compares to 35% growth last year in Q2, and for the full year, we're still maintaining our full year guidance of approximately 10%. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. That's helpful. And then on PendoTECH, that contributed about 1% during the quarter, you said. So, I was wondering, can you just walk us through how that assets performing versus your internal expectations? And just any general update on integration process so far? Thanks. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. PendoTECH is performing extremely well. We are very, very happy with PendoTECH acquisition. It's clearly exceeding our expectation. If at all, I would say, we running sometimes hard in terms of our capacity, because there's such strong demand. But our team does an outstanding job and really trying to address all the customer demands that they're seeing. And we do not really see a slowdown in demand moving forward. So, really happy with the acquisition, integration is going really well. We could really leverage the synergies between Mettler-Toledo's go-to-market strength, the stronger manufacturing footprint, the buying power we have and bringing this smaller company and that was as an inflection point to reach out to a broader global market, that all came to fruition. So, extremely happy with the acquisition and how the integration is going. The same, by the way is to for the software company that we acquired last year Scale-up Systems, that also helps to drive a lot of sales in the AutoChem business and just choose that when you bring these smaller companies in, and you're the right partner for them with the right portfolio that again makes accelerated growth. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Your line is open. Patrick Donnelly : For Patrick, I'm just wondering, you talked a little bit about the chip shortage impacting food a little bit. Could share some more color around that? And I guess what your outlook is for the years assuming that you see a sustained or not? Thank you. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Thanks and I'm happy to take that question. So, regarding chip shortage, yes, I mean, I would say, the product line or the division that was most affected by it actually was our retail business, and I think we had no remark as well. And that has to do with the fact that we're using some specific chips that also used in the consumer industry for some of the displays, for example. There have been some significant shortage, which introduced delays for us. In other product areas, we could mitigate, mostly by broker buys, which drives up, of course, cost of goods, but we also try to compensate it on pricing, et cetera. So, to your question whether we see this easing up for the rest of the year? Not really. I think the market will remain to be hot on semiconductor and microprocessors. Again, that our agility to redesign boards and part of your R&D team is, of course, always busy in making sure that we have design alternatives in place to go to alternative microprocessors far more boards, wherever possible to make sure that we can fulfill customer demand, which is still very, very healthy. Patrick Donnelly : Great. Thank you. And then just one more in terms of the second quarter. I just wondering, I know, you said that you expect that lab to grow high single digits. Do you mind sharing for the other two segments as well, what you're seeing there? And I guess, across geographies as well, I know, you've talked about China already? Thank you. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. So, I'll just run down the divisions in the geographies for the quarter and full year just so that everybody ask that. So I'll start from the top and repeat lab. So lab, we said, high single digit for Q2, approximately 10% for the full year. For core industrial, our guidance is mid-to-high single digit growth for both Q2 and for the full year. For product inspection, our guidance is continues to be high single digit growth for both Q2 and for the full year. And for food retailing, our guidance is to be down low single digit in Q2, and to be down slightly for the full year. If we look at the geographies for Europe for Q2, is we're guiding low single digit, and for the full year, we're guiding low to mid single digit. Keep in mind that will be impacted a little bit by Russia. And then Americas will be up high single digit for Q2, and also for the full year. And then, for China, as I already mentioned, we're guiding high single digit for Q2, and approximately 10% for the full year. Patrick Donnelly : Thank you. That's really helpful. Operator : Your final question comes from Matt Skykes with Goldman Sachs. your line is open. Matt Skykes : My question, maybe just on the industrial side, we just love to hear some of the feedback you're hearing from customers in terms of some of the capital equipment decisions. Assume you're more insulated, just given a lot of decisions are OpEx rather than CapEx based. But just given the growth concerns over the back half of the year, just would love to hear any kind of feedback you're hearing from those industrial customers as you're working with them? Shawn Vadala : Yes, I mean, hey, Matt, this is Shawn. We're feeling -- I mean, it's interesting, despite what you read in the headlines. We're not hearing anything particular from our industrial customers. I mean, we had a really good first quarter and good momentum going into Q2. And we saw really good momentum, I would say, globally, particularly, including in China. Now, I don't want to pretend like we're immune to the economy, we're not. But I think if you just look at our business, we're just very well-positioned from a couple of perspectives. One is there's this trend in automation and digitalization that we talked a lot about and I mentioned in the prepared remarks. And I feel like that trend is really very well-positioned for that trend. And we just continue to see very strong momentum globally in that area. And so, I think that's a good one for us. And then I think, what we talked about in the past is in terms of Spinnaker, the ability to guide our sales force to the most attractive opportunities. And if you think about like the diversity in the market, as well as in our business, having that focus really makes a big difference. And I feel like our teams have done an excellent job over the last few years of really targeting these more attractive market segments. And if you look at the mix of the business, it's a better mix of business that it was five years ago, let alone 10 years ago. So a little bit less cyclical. But again, not immune to the economy, but probably less cyclical than it used to be. And then I think the teams have also done a really great job in terms of the product portfolio. If you just look at a lot of the things that we've been coming out with over the last few years, it really is been well received in the marketplace. Matt Skykes : Great. And then just maybe my last one. Just a broader question on pricing. Just given -- realize, you're very thoughtful in terms of geography segment, et cetera. But as you look over the course of the last couple quarters when pricing is really picked up, has there been a certain segment or geography where you've leaned in more on pricing? Or is it pretty well balanced over the course of your segments and also geographies? Shawn Vadala : We're always differentiating, like you say. But we are generally seeing, getting price in all the different product categories and markets. If I had to differentiate a little bit, I'd say, we get a little bit more on the laboratory side of the business. But I would say there's pockets of industrial where we've done exceptionally well also, so I really wouldn't want to try to differentiate that one too much. And then geographically, I'm really pleased with how we've performed globally in terms of price realization as well I wouldn't necessarily call anything else. Matt Skykes : Great. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I will now turn the call back over to Mary Finnegan, who will make a few closing remarks. Mary Finnegan : Hey, thanks for joining us tonight. We appreciate you being on the call. If you have any questions or any follow-up, please don't hesitate to reach out. Take care. Bye-bye. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Let me now turn the call over to Patrick. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks, Adam, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call this morning, which we are doing from Switzerland. We reported strong second quarter results as our team executed very well on our growth strategies. Our culture of agility and focused execution have allowed us to capitalize on favorable market demand and navigate challenging supply chain and inflationary conditions. The highlights of our second quarter performance are detailed on Page 3 of the presentation. Local currency sales in the quarter increased 10% as compared to the prior year. We had very strong growth in our laboratory and Core Industrial business, and we are particularly pleased with the very good growth in China. Excellent sales growth combined with good margin improvement drove very strong growth in adjusted EPS despite adverse foreign currency. We feel positive about our outlook for Q3 and for the full year, and we recognize our agility and resilience will be pivotal to navigate market conditions. Later, I will have some additional comments on our business, but let me now turn it to Shawn to cover the financials and guidance. Shawn? Shawn Vadala : Thanks, Patrick, and good morning, everyone. Sales in the quarter were $978.4 million, which represented a local currency increase of 10%. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased 6% as currency reduced sales growth by 4%. We estimate that the impact of reduced sales in Russia-Ukraine due to the war was a headwind of about 1% to sales growth. On Slide #4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales increased 12% in the Americas, 4% in Europe and 14% in Asia/Rest of World. Local currency sales increased 14% in China in the quarter. On Slide #5, we show sales growth by region for the first half of the year. Local currency sales grew 12% for the first 6 months, with 14% growth in the Americas, 7% in Europe and 15% in Asia/Rest of World. Local currency sales increased 15% in China on a year-to-date basis. On Slide #6, we summarize local currency sales growth by product area. For the quarter, Laboratory sales increased 13%, Industrial increased 9% with Core Industrial up 11% and product inspection up 5%. Food retail grew 3% in the quarter. The next slide shows local currency sales growth by product area for the first half. Laboratory sales increased 15%, Industrial increased 10%, including 12% growth in Core Industrial and product inspection up 7%. Food Retail declined 6%. Let me now move to the rest of the P&L which is summarized on Slide #8. Gross margin in the quarter was 58.4%, an increase of 30 basis points. We benefited from strong pricing and volume growth, which was offset in part by higher material costs. R&D amounted to $44 million in the quarter, which is an 8% increase in local currency over the prior period, reflecting increased project activity. SG&A amounted to $242.2 million, a 6% increase in local currency over the prior year, which includes increased investments in sales and marketing. Adjusted operating profit amounted to $285.4 million in the quarter, a 12% increase. The increase reflects strong sales growth combined with good execution. Currency was a 3% headwind to operating profit growth. Adjusted operating margin was 29.2%, which represents an increase of 160 basis points over the prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, adjusted operating margins increased 120 basis points. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $16.4 million in the quarter, interest expense was $12.8 million in the quarter. Other income in the quarter amounted to $2.2 million, primarily reflecting nonservice-related pension income. Our effective tax rate was 19% in the quarter. This rate is before discrete items and adjusting for the timing of stock option exercises in the quarter. Fully diluted shares amounted to 22.8 million in the quarter, which is a 3% decline from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $9.39, a 16% increase over the prior year or a 20% increase, excluding unfavorable foreign currency. We're very pleased with this adjusted EPS growth, especially given that adjusted EPS was up more than 50% in the second quarter of last year. On a reported basis in the quarter, EPS was $9.29 as compared to $7.85 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.22 of purchased intangible amortization, $0.06 of restructuring and an $0.18 benefit due to the difference between our quarterly and annual tax rate due to the timing of stock option exercises. The next slide illustrates our year-to-date results. Local currency sales grew 12% for the 6-month period. Adjusted operating income increased 13% or 16% excluding unfavorable foreign currency, and our operating margin expanded 110 basis points. Adjusted EPS grew 18% on a year-to-date basis or 21% excluding unfavorable currency. That covers the P&L and let me now comment on cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $208.2 million. We continue to make nice improvements on DSO, which declined 2 days to 34 days as compared to the prior year. ITO came in at 3.8x. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $283.7 million. Let me now turn to guidance. Forecasting continues to be challenging, given dynamic market conditions. Our forecast remains on -- our focus remains on factors we can control, namely successful execution of our growth and margin initiatives. Let me make some general comments on the full year before covering the specifics. While there is more macro noise in the environment today as compared to 3 months ago, we continue to feel good about our business. Customer demand is solid and we are executing on our growth initiatives very well. We remain cautious about challenges in the supply chain, but to date, have been able to navigate them well. Second, we are facing greater foreign exchange headwinds to our earnings growth as compared to 3 months ago. Specifically, we now estimate that foreign currency will be a headwind to adjusted EPS growth in the quarter of approximately 6% and would expect a similar headwind in the fourth quarter as well. At the time of our last earnings call, the headwind to earnings growth in the second half of the year was in the range of 3% to 4%. What this means for the full year is we now expect currency to be a headwind to adjusted EPS of approximately 4.5% as compared to 3.5% the last time we spoke. At the midpoint of our guidance, we now expect adjusted operating profit margin to increase approximately 140 basis points on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting higher volume growth and good execution on our margin initiatives. Including currency, reported operating margin -- profit margin will be slightly higher. Finally, as you think through our sales guidance, keep in mind, our sales growth will be reduced by approximately 1% for the remainder of the year due to sales in Russia. Now let me cover the specifics. For the full year 2022, we now expect local currency sales growth to be in the range of 9% to 10%. This compares to previous guidance of 8%. We are increasing our full year sales guidance for our strong year-to-date results and a better outlook for the second half. We expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $38.85 to $39.05, which is a growth rate of 14% to 15% and a growth rate of approximately 19%, excluding currency. For the third quarter, based on market conditions today, we expect local currency sales growth of approximately 8% and expect adjusted EPS to be in a range of $9.75 to $9.85, a growth rate of 12% to 13% and a growth of 18% to 19%, excluding currency. Some final details on guidance. With respect to the impact of currency on sales growth, we expect currency to decrease sales growth by approximately 4.5% for the full year and decreased sales about 6% in Q3. In terms of cash flow, we expect -- we continue to expect full year cash flow in the $855 million range and expect to repurchase approximately $1.1 billion in shares in 2022. We expect a net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of approximately 1.5x. That is it from my side and I'll now turn it back to Patrick. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks, Shawn. Let me start with some comments on our operating businesses, starting with Lab, which had strong sales growth in the quarter with very good growth across all major product categories. We expect our end markets to remain favorable. And with our excellent product portfolio and effective sales and marketing initiatives, we believe we can continue to gain market share in our Laboratory business. Turning to our Industrial business. We are very pleased with the continued strength in Core Industrial. Our outlook for the remainder of the year is favorable, and we believe this business is well positioned to capitalize on our customers' needs, automation, productivity improvement and efficiency gains as they work to overcome challenges in the labor market and supply chain. Product inspection sales came in a little lower than expected this quarter but our team is optimistic for the third quarter. We have strong momentum in Americas but have started to see some more conservative packaged food customers' behavior in Europe. Finally, Food Retail sales grew 3% as growth in the Americas and Europe offset a significant sales decline in China due to disruptions from pandemic lockdowns. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales in Europe increased 4% in the quarter, about as we had expected and against the 23% growth in the prior year. As a reminder, we stopped shipments to Russia after the invasion of Ukraine, which is impacting growth in Europe. Sales in the Americas was, again, excellent with double-digit growth across all of our major product categories. And finally, Asia/Rest of the World had another quarter of strong growth with robust growth in Laboratory and Core Industrial. China grew 40%, with particular strong growth in Lab and Core Industrial. The team continues to do a great job navigating challenges in the market. Assuming market conditions remain as they are today, we believe we will deliver strong growth in China in 2022. One final comment on the business. Service and consumables continue to show excellent momentum and grew 11% in the quarter. We are very pleased with the growth in this important and profitable part of the business. That concludes my comments on the business. Now I would like to share with you some insights on our sales and marketing initiatives. We have seen in the recent years the agility that Spinnaker provides is invaluable in helping us gain market share and adapting to various customer demand environments. The effectiveness of this was evident in the initial pandemic downturn and the subsequent recovery. Under both scenarios, Spinnaker provided agility to quickly identify growth opportunities and guide our sales force accordingly. As you are aware, we have an organic sales growth focus that benefits from our highly fragmented markets as well as a very large installed base of instruments, which provides fertile ground to discover growth opportunities but also requires a great deal of agility and execution focus. Our Spinnaker program helps us target the most attractive segments of growth and increase our sales force time with the most strategic accounts. We want to efficiently go after the best opportunities with our sales organization of approximately 3,000 sales colleagues around the world. Our field sales force is guided toward opportunities with the most strategic accounts, those with good growth and cross-selling potential, while other opportunities are more efficiently handled by our telesales and inside sales teams. Spinnaker utilizes unique data analytics to leverage external data sources and our substantial internal data, including that of our installed base, to identify the most attractive and profitable growth opportunities. Spinnaker also provides extensive tools to our sales force that improves their effectiveness. Continuous improvement is at the heart of Spinnaker. We continue to build, adapt and refine our initiatives, which reinforces our already strong foundation for sales and marketing and makes it difficult for competitors to copy. Our Spinnaker program also benefits from our proprietary Top K program. With Top K, we use data analytics to identify customer investment projects and cross-selling opportunities with potential actionable opportunities for our broad product offering. A summary of the opportunity with all relevant information, including customer site, contact info, potential for products, other activities with this customer is generated. These summaries are provided to the sales organization throughout the world who then qualify and prioritize these opportunities for our sales teams. The structure of our sales organization allows us to most efficiently follow up and guide the teams to these opportunities. Last year, we generated more than 150,000 of these Top K alerts and are continuing to penetrate these potential opportunities at customer sites. While we continue to follow up with last year's alerts, we are also launching additional wins this year. Target industries for this wave include, for example, pharma, food and beverage and chemicals. And we also identified opportunities in the fast-growing markets of lithium-ion battery and semiconductors. Other examples include vaccines, plant-based foods and advanced materials. We are convinced that our unique ability to quickly identify growth opportunities and related accounts helps us to adapt to shifts in customer demand, who we have all seen can happen quite rapidly. Our sales teams are also very happy to be able to visit customers on-site again. Face-to-face meetings allow us to best assess potential, promote our key value-add solutions and identify cross-selling opportunities. However, we also saw, during the last 2 years, how effective online interactions with customers can be. We have significantly enhanced our remote capabilities, including online sales meetings, webinars and virtual or e-demos. We recognize the importance of leveraging a smart mix of online and on-site meetings to convert opportunities to orders. Finally, selling service contracts at the point of sale continues to be a high-priority focus for us. We saw the value of our service throughout the last 2 years in terms of very favorable Net Promoter Scores. This has reinforced our sales organization the importance of articulating the value of a service contract when the product is sold. Internally, we have revamped our quoting process to ensure the right focus is on service at the critical point of the selling process. We have also introduced an updated version of our digital sales enablement tool library that allows our sales reps to be more effective in value selling. The update includes new front-end software tied directly into our CRM, providing our sales team dashboards to prepare for upcoming site visits and efficiently handle follow-up requests. Our sales enablement tool also provides our sales teams enhanced application information and selling guides, which also helps us enable cross-selling with new applications in targeted accounts we have not yet penetrated. This tool greatly improves the effectiveness of the selling process, thereby enhancing the customer experience and improve order conversion rates. These are just a few examples to illustrate our strength in marketing and sales. At the core of our growth strategies is the importance to reallocate resources to the best opportunities. And Spinnaker is a great example how we do this by helping to identify and guide our sales teams to the best growth opportunities in the most favorable end markets. Business conditions today remain solid. I am convinced that our strategic programs, such as Spinnaker, will provide us agility to adapt to potential changes in the market conditions as we have successfully demonstrated over the last several years. If you look at the mix of our business today, it is stronger than ever. Our Laboratory business has grown from 44% of our sales in 2008 to 56% of our sales today as we target secular growth opportunities like pharma and biopharma industries. At the same time, our Core Industrial business has changed from 31% of our sales to approximately 25% of our sales, and the mix within that has shifted to more favorable end markets. In fact, we estimate that more than 60% of our Core Industrial sales are now with pharmaceutical, biopharma, food manufacturing and chemical customers. And I would remind you that our service and consumable business is approximately 1/3 of our revenues and very profitable. Our end market breakdown also reinforces the strength of our business. Today, we estimate about 40% of our total sales are to life science customers, 20% to food and beverage and about 10% to chemical. And beyond that, we serve many other diverse markets. We are clearly more biased towards higher-growth markets and, at the same time, nicely diversified. Well, that concludes our prepared remarks, and we now want to open the call to questions. Operator :  We will take our first question now. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : And congrats on a really strong print here. Maybe one, you did mention on pricing and inflation. Can you talk about how pricing and inflation assumptions have changed versus the prior guide? Shawn Vadala : Vijay, this is Shawn. Yes, I'm happy to do that. So we were very pleased with our execution in the quarter, both on pricing but also in our supply chain. I think you hear us use the word agility a lot, but the the organizational agility and execution just continues to be really fantastic across the global organization. If you look at pricing in the second quarter, our estimated price realization was about 4.5%, which was better than what we were expecting kind of when we kind of came into the quarter. On the material side, I would say material costs remain elevated and they were pretty much as we kind of expected as we came into the quarter, which was a little bit better than Q1 but still remain at an elevated level. Maybe I kind of continue here and I just kind of like transition into the second half of the year, which I'm sure is also in your mind. So as we kind of think about the second half of the year, right now, we're thinking about price realization in the 5% range or so, which would kind of put us at about 4.5% on a full year basis, which is a little bit higher than our guidance. Last time we spoke for the full year of about 4%. And then if you kind of like want to translate that into margins, we're looking at about a 60 basis point improvement in our gross margin for Q3 and about 50 basis points for the full year. And then if you kind of drop it down to operating margins, our operating margin in Q3 right now were estimated on a currency-neutral basis, about 130 basis points. And actually, if you exclude currency -- I mean, if you include currency, the reported number is probably more than the 170 basis point on a reported basis. And then our full year operating margin assumption right now, excluding currency on a currency-neutral basis, is about 140 basis points and on a reported basis, that would be more in a 160 basis point kind of a range. Vijay Kumar : That's extremely helpful, Shawn. And then maybe one for Patrick on your comments towards the end on how the business mix has changed. Can you compare and contrast versus the last cycle, '08, '09, how that mix has changed? What was that mix back in '08 and '09? And what's the implication for the business if the economy were to slow down here? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Shawn, you go first and then I'll chime in. Shawn Vadala : Yes. Okay, Vijay, maybe I'll take that one. So if you look at our Lab business today, it's about 56% of our business. If you go back to 2009, it would have been about 45% of our business. And then if you look at our Core Industrial business back in '09, it would have been, I think, just over 30%, and right now, it's about 25%. But what's even more interesting to me is the mix within Industrial and our overall end market exposure. So right now, we would estimate that more than 60% of our Core Industrial business, which historically is more susceptible to the economy, more than 60% of that business today is sold into pharma, biopharma, chemical and food manufacturing. So I think we continue to do a good job of redirecting business towards more attractive end market segments. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Clearly, and of course, let me add also to that. We are seeing strong momentum in both businesses at the moment. We're seeing very healthy demand driven by operational efficiency and automation needs. And they go across both the Lab market as well as the Industrial end markets. So I think both markets are benefiting very well from the  of the right products to serve our customers. We are really happy with  for both of the segments. Our Lab business, of course, is much bigger as you know. And we have also launched a lot of exciting products this year and continue to have a lot of good products in the pipeline for both units. So this is why we're also so optimistic on the outlook for Q3 and Q4. Operator :  We will go ahead with our next question. Please state your name and company before you pose your question. Catherine Schulte : This is Catherine Schulte with Baird. I guess first, can you talk about the 14% local currency growth in China? I think you were expecting high single digits for the quarter so what drove the upside there? How do we view the growth for that region for the rest of the year? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Thanks, Catherine. I'll take the question first and then let Shawn chime in as well. So yes, we are exactly -- we are very pleased with the 14% growth in the quarter. And as a reminder, we grew 35% in the second quarter of last year, so really exceptionally strong growth. We saw the growth across our Lab business in China with almost 20% sales growth, which is remarkable also given about 40% sales growth we delivered in the second quarter of last year. And all of our Lab product lines really showed very strong growth. We had strong growth also in our Core Industrial. Shield team has done a particularly good job of increasing our business mix to more attractive segments, as also Shawn mentioned before. We have seen particularly strong demand for solutions in automation driving this efficiency that we talked about. So we are very confident on China if the underlying market conditions don't change. And in China, they can change quickly for lockdowns. But so far, we are really optimistic. As I said, we are expecting strong growth in the second half as well. Shawn Vadala : Yes. I don't think I'd add very much. I mean, I know there was a lot of concern about China lockdowns as we kind of entered the quarter, but from our perspective, we really had minimal impact during the quarter. I think our team did a wonderful job navigating that. We were one of the first companies to reopen in Shanghai, and we're able to really keep a lot of our product flows going throughout the quarter. And of course, I think many of you know that most of our production is actually outside of Shanghai as well. And then these themes that Patrick talks about too, I mean, they're automation, digitalization. Those are themes that are very prevalent in China that our team has been leaning into with our portfolio. And all these hot segments that we talk about, about lithium battery and semiconductor are also very prevalent also in China as well. And then, of course, the government's 5-year plan, they're leaning into that locally in terms of how they are stimulating their economy, which I think we're a beneficiary of as well. Catherine Schulte : Okay. And then you talked a bit about seeing some more conservatism from packaged food customers on the product inspection side in Europe. How do you view that unfolding for the rest of the year? And have you seen any other businesses start to see signs of slowing in Europe? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Let me first capture the product inspection piece. And yes, it's mainly in Europe where we see some -- a little bit more conservatism. Customers are just a little bit careful with their investments in packaged food. We don't see that in the U.S. The U.S. is actually still very, very strong for us in product inspection. We have a very good pipeline there. But Europe has become a bit more cautious and that, of course, has also to do with the overall environment -- economic environment in Europe that some customers get more conservative. On the rest of Europe and the other businesses, I mean, we are really pleased with our growth that we have seen in the second quarter. As you know, we have had expected to come in low single digit. It came in better, and this is also against 20% growth in the quarter of last year. We don't see any concerns for our European sales team or any other parts of the businesses right now in Europe. So no, I would say no signs of a real downturn at this time. But we fully acknowledge that we need to be very agile as market conditions, of course, can change and change quickly, given the situation with the energy supply, which we carefully monitor and have also put the right mitigation plans in place. Operator : We move on to our next question. Please go ahead. Matt Sykes : It's Matt Sykes, Goldman Sachs. Maybe first, Patrick, you mentioned that consumables and services are now 1/3 of total revenue. Just given your product mix, just wondering where you feel like you can take that potential recurring revenue over the long term. And what are the plans to do that, given your product mix? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Good. Absolutely. Let me start with that. So first and foremost, I think we still have ample of opportunity to also grow our service business, which is very, very strong. We have a huge installed base of instruments. And I would say a big part of the installed base is currently not under contract but it's calling more on what we would call break and fixed services. So we have opportunities every time we go there with customers to talk about the value of contracts and being under contract, which means they have faster access to services. They have a fast response time. They have a broader service portfolio if they are on a contract and then also drives some of the growth rate we have proved from our services. We have a strong focus, of course, also at services at point of sales, making sure we get right for we sell the instrument also better connect rate. The team has a very strong focus on that. And overall, we are increasing our portfolio of services to our customers, adding more high-value services continuously. So I'm very confident that the share of the service revenues continue to increase. I mean, we have to also see that, of course, for the last 2 years, we had very strong instrument growth. And the service usually trails that a little bit, but having 11% growth, again, this forward double-digit growth in Services and Consumer is a really strong reminder that we're making good progress on broadening our service footprint. If you were to look at it from a regional perspective, the U.S. history has been very strong as well as Europe. In China, we still have even more potential to grow services. Traditionally, the Chinese market has been not leaning that much into service. They are more self-maintainers and they're also seeing it as a part of the overall sales package being included with the instrument, that it takes time to change that mentality, and we are working on that. From that perspective, I'm optimistic and I'm putting a lot of focus also in my internal business meetings with every business I have, how we can increase the share of services and, of course, other consumables. The products we have, for example, our pet business, very strong in consumables. In other areas, for example, in the Lab business, the titrators, automation solutions, they all come with a very healthy and increasing share of consumers moving forward. So I'm optimistic that in the long term, we will move that 1/3 of the business piece further for service and consumables. Matt Sykes : Great. And then maybe more of a general question. Just given your position in automation and some of the strength you're seeing there, if we are going to a more challenging economic environment, do you see automation from your customer conversations you have as more of a discretionary purchase, meaning you might not have the capabilities and want to do it but might not want to spend money for that? Or is the trade-off in terms of the productivity enhancements they see from your automation capabilities more than offset that decision to just spend discretionary? Patrick Kaltenbach : That's an excellent question. I think your second part of the question is actually leaning in the right direction. What we are hearing is that customers are, for several reasons, really interested in driving more automation in their businesses. It's driving their productivity. It's -- with that, of course, driving their profit. And they are very willing to invest and making sure that they continue to drive productivity also. Getting manual labor out of the play as much as possible when you look at large automation in factories where we play big  in the Industrial business or even in the Lab. It's all about making sure that you can automate processes to make them more robust, more reliable and also, in the end, cheaper for them. This is why our customers are responding very well to automation right now. It's not the \"automation\" alone. It's that this productivity gain and although that long-term performance gains that they get from automation solutions. Operator : We move on to our next question. Please do state your name and company before your question. Patrick Donnelly : This is Patrick Donnelly from Citi. Patrick, maybe just 1 on -- another 1 on China, just given the amount of focus there. Can you just talk a little bit about the cadence of the recovery? How it trended throughout the quarter? Expectations there going forward, maybe just in terms of the guidance? And then similarly, just on the instruments versus consumables, what you saw going to come back versus what you saw maybe lag a little bit there? Patrick Kaltenbach : In China itself, look, we didn't have a really significant slowdown during the quarter. I mean, the quarter held up quite strongly for us. The team was reaching out to customers even in, let's say, some of the sales folks who have been in provinces or areas where they're also locked down, they continue to call customers from home. We also referred in our -- earlier in some of the other calls about our digital tools and how we can engage with customers. They leverage this fully in China as well. So on the order momentum, I would say we haven't seen a real dip throughout the quarter. And on the manufacturing side, we recovered very, very quickly. And there was no difference in terms of instruments versus consumables at all. I don't know, Shawn, if you have a different perspective, but I haven't heard anything else in China. Shawn Vadala : No. What was -- I mean, what was nice to see is just the breadth of growth throughout the product portfolio. I mean, we grew strong double digit, both on the Laboratory side of the business as well as on the Industrial side of the business. And maybe the one soft spot that we did see is in our food retailing business. I mean, food retail is it's less than 5% of our total Chinese business, but that market has been very hard hit by the lockdowns and the nature of the lockdowns, a lot of store closures going on inside the country. But absent that, there was just a lot of strength throughout the rest of the portfolio. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. No, definitely encouraging results there. And Shawn, maybe a quick one for you there. Just in terms of the guidance for 3Q, do you mind just breaking it out by segment and then geography as well if you have it just in terms of the growth rates? Shawn Vadala : Sure. I'll give you Q3 and then I'll give you the full year result as well, Patrick. So let me start with the divisions. So our guidance for the Lab division is high single-digit growth for Q3 and low double-digit growth for the full year. For product inspection, our guidance is mid- to high single digit for Q3 and mid- to high single digit for the full year. Core Industrial, our guidance is high single digit for Q3 and high single digit for the full year. And then for food retailing, our guidance is low to mid-single digit for Q3 and flattish for the full year. And then on a geographic basis, our guidance for Europe is low to mid-single digit for Q3 and low to mid-single digit for the full year. And I think it's important in Europe to remember that we're going to have a headwind in Russia in the second half of the year. And just given the seasonality of last year's sales, that headwind might be a little bit more in the second half of the year than the first half. It could be in the 4% range or so in terms of Russia headwind. In terms of Americas, we have -- our guidance is high single digit for Q3 and low double digit for the full year. And then for China, our guidance is approximately 10% for Q3 and low double digit for the full year. Operator : We move on to our next question. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Dan Arias : Dan Arias from Stifel. Maybe just going back to pricing and the ability to step up what you're able to push through overall. Shawn, as the market has evolved and in your own internal capabilities that evolved, are you finding that the pricing power that you have is showing up in areas where maybe you hadn't had it before? Or is it really just a function of pushing a bit harder in the areas where traditionally you've been successful? Shawn Vadala : Yes, that's a good way to ask the question, Dan. I mean -- hey, I think the whenever we do pricing, we try to tailor our approach to the business conditions and the circumstances, and we always talk about how we like to differentiate by product and geography. And if you just look at kind of the cards we're dealt from a pricing perspective at the moment, it really lends itself to higher pricing in most categories. And so what we try to do is we look at the cost pressures in this environment by category -- product category and geography. And then what we can do is we build it up and then we educate the organization about it. And I think that's really important is that with our direct sales force, they can really articulate that to the customer. And then they can also emphasize our value propositions. And as like Patrick was saying in the previous Q&A that our value proposition, in many regards, is higher in this environment because people are seeking productivity much more than they were and they're looking for solutions. And so that plays very well to our overall portfolio and our ability to position the price increases. So I think the market very much understands that. And then if you look at the execution of the organization, it certainly helps when we're able to support customers, too. And so what do I mean by that? Just in our supply chain. I mean, we -- I think every company has some level of challenge at the moment. But if you compare us relative to competition, I think we look pretty good in terms of our ability to support customers with lead times and things like that, and that also certainly increases the customers' willingness to pay. So it's actually the execution has been really good, and I just think the environment, obviously, lends itself to better price realization, which we saw in Q3. And with my previous comments, we expect it to even be a little bit better in the second half of the year. Dan Arias : Okay. Very helpful. Maybe just as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about Blue Ocean. If I remember correctly, I think that you guys are implemented across 80% or so -- 80%, 85% or so of the users at this point. A, is that right? And B, what is the time line that you would consider for sort of a full global rollout? And then if that number is right, is that last 15% to 20% meaningful at all when it comes to pricing, visibility, margins, et cetera? Or is -- at the end of the day, are those regions that don't really move the needle as much? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. I'll get this first and then I'll let Shawn chime in as well. Look, we are definitely around 85% of the rollout so far. And there are still a number of countries left to bring on to Blue Ocean or they are running on their current own ERP systems. Look, I mean, it will continue to help us drive productivity within the company. We can use -- shared a common template for many of the process that we use across the company. So a lot of it is also an internal gain in terms of efficiency and helping us to drive cost down and just use efficiency across the company. On the pricing side, I don't -- there is some impact, but I'll let Shawn take that. Shawn Vadala : Yes. On the pricing side, I mean, we'll always benefit from improved analytics, but we'll also -- to me, the business processes are a big part of it, too. Like when you think about price administration, we have a lot of tools around that and global centralized processes. And then there's also a lot of embedded pricing controls in terms of how we can manage discounting and things like that. So there's always some benefit when we go live. I mean, our largest market organization that we have left is in France, which we're expecting to go live next year. And like Patrick said, there's a handful of smaller organizations and primarily in Europe and the Rest of World. And then maybe just before I hand it back to Patrick, a general comment that we always see with Blue Ocean is just the overall visibility into the business. We very, very much have benefited over the last couple of years by having more transparency end-to-end in our business from Blue Ocean. And for those of you who are less familiar with Blue Ocean, I mean, it's about global harmonized processes, but we enable that with 1 single instance of an ERP and fully integrated CRM service, HR program. So then with 1 single instance, we really have a lot of very interesting transparency, which we've very much benefited from over the last couple of years. Operator : We move on to next question. Please go ahead. Derik De Bruin : It's Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. So a couple of questions. Shawn, first, a little housekeeping question. Full year guide for interest expense and income net, how are the higher rates impacting you and how are you done in fixed versus variable? Shawn Vadala : Yes. No, good question, Derik. So -- and thanks for -- I know it's early for you today so we apologize for the early morning. In terms of interest rates, we're about 75% fixed at the moment and we don't have any significant maturities in the short term, like this year or next year. I mean, with a couple of smaller things. And then when you look at like our variable exposure, actually, a lot of that is also in euro, which probably prices out about 1% or so. So I think we're positioned pretty well here. And if you kind of like look at what we've done over the last few years, just even at the end of last year, we've been locking in a lot of 15-year debt over the last few years. So for example, in December of last year, we priced 15-year debt that funded in 2 tranches. We just funded $150 million of 2.8% for 15 years in March, and then we're going to fund another $150 million tranche in September at 2.9%. And so we feel like, for the short and medium term, we're pretty well positioned. And then to be specific on interest expense, our guidance or estimate for this year is $53 million. Derik De Bruin : Great. And another pricing question but just more bigger picture. With -- given the pricing and also the currency moves, have you seen any impact on your customers' purchasing power, basically some people hesitating because they just didn't have the budgets for things? Shawn Vadala : No. I mean, I think it's just the opposite. I think it's very much kind of like how I was answering the question, like I think people just really appreciate the value in this environment and they appreciate the ability to support them. And of course, we're doing -- we're trying to do things in a balanced way in terms of like increasing prices where it's appropriate and there's very much a cost story, inflation story associated with it. And so I think between our approach and then the overall value proposition that we're providing, we're just really not hearing any noise. Patrick Kaltenbach : And maybe a little bit as we said, in product inspection  customers become a bit more cautious with investments. Otherwise, not really, no. Shawn Vadala : Yes. I mean -- and just to clarify on the PI, I wouldn't say it's a pricing topic. It's more of a -- and as Patrick said earlier, it's very much a European topic for product inspection. There has been some more conservatism where we -- projects -- we get the sense that maybe some projects are going to get delayed in packaged foods in Europe. Derik De Bruin : And then just 1 more. Is there any signs of inventory,  pipette tips, electrodes, anything that's sort of like has long shelf life that people maybe have hoarded or stockpiled? Just sort of like some of the commentary on sort of what you're seeing in your customers. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. That's a good question, but we don't hear a lot of the customers have stockpiled electrodes or pipette tips. I mean, we had, I would say, more at the beginning of the year, we, of course, during the pandemic, customers try to buy as many pipette tips as possible, and they filled up their stock levels, but is coming back to, I would say, more normal levels now. And you also have to realize that a lot of the pipette tip sales that we make a day are not going into testing in going into bio research, biopharma applications. And these labs usually do not have the same tendency as we have seen, or you probably have heard from other suppliers that supply, the broader testing industry that have tried to just get as many in their stocks as possibly even last year, we have not been that much exposed. Operator : Our next question, your line is open. Josh Waldman : It's Josh from Cleveland Research. Patrick, a follow-up on product inspection. Your growth was a bit lighter than in the quarter but it sounds like the commercial team remains optimistic. I guess, was the softer Q2 a result of like installs pushing out or more a reflection of slower order intake? And just kind of curious how recent trends were reflected in the guide, and whether or not H2 assumptions have come down versus prior plan? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Well, thanks, Josh. Very good question. But look, I mean, the Q2 results have been a bit softer than we had expected. It's not like off by a huge factor. Margins is not a little bit softer. I think we had projected high single digits. We came in a bit more to mid-single digits, so it's not off by far. A lot of that was actually triggered by 2 factors. We have seen -- on the customer side, we have seen some project pushouts not necessarily because they didn't have the money, but because usually, we also supply into a larger infrastructure. And then some of the upper suppliers were not ready to make the full installations of our final product inspection piece of the whole flow line, so to speak, but they were just not ready to take it this quarter. So there has been some pushouts. What we also suffered from in terms of not being able to deliver everything we could was, on the supply chain side, some of the electronic components just didn't come in time, so that led actually to delay in this quarter. As we said, we are quite optimistic for Q3. The team sees a good pharma especially in the United States. We have to continue to monitor the situation in Europe. But otherwise, I think we are okay with the guidance. Josh Waldman : Got it, okay. And then the Lab segment has outperformed expectations here in recent quarters. Would just love to hear any additional thoughts you have on what you think is driving consistent upside in the segment. I mean, how much of this is price coming in better than expected, maybe share gains or just kind of strong underlying demand? And I guess whether the lab benefited from COVID testing in China in the quarter? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Look, I mean, again, for COVID testing in China wasn't a big storm at all, but we see broad-based growth across our product portfolio. There is very strong demand from pharma and biopharma, especially biopharma. The Chemical segment, again, is showing very strong demand for automation solutions so we are very happy with that. Should we add also in our remarks, we have mentioned what we call hot segments like the battery segment, plant-based food, et cetera, where we have targeted our sales force very quickly to these accounts with the right application solutions. They show across the board, I mean, across the regions very strong growth. And I think if you factor all of that together with what we also mentioned being about this continuous need for automation solution, that just drove a lot of demand across our portfolio. Operator : We move on to next question, please go ahead. Rachel Vatnsdal : This is Rachel Vatnsdal from JPMorgan. So sticking with some of the earlier questions on recession resiliency, can you just walk us through how your customers are thinking about the replacement cycle, given the evolving macro dynamic? Do you see any inflation softening some of these capital budgets and softening demand for new products? Or what kind of levers can Mettler really pull the field that replacement cycle even in a recession and inflation? Shawn Vadala : Rachel, this is Shawn. I'll take it, and Patrick wants to jump in. So when we look at our business, other than this 1 topic that we talked about with packaged food in Europe, we're not seeing any indicators that people are -- have any cautiousness or any indicators that there's any concern about delaying replacement cycles. As we kind of enter into this next phase of the economy, one thing that we try to remind people about and we've talked about it in the past is that we typically need the economy to be good enough. We need it to be good enough that people will stick to replacement cycles. And we've seen in the past, PMIs go into the mid- to high 40s, like in Europe, but we still had growth, and it was because people were sticking with replacement cycles. At the same time, we've seen PMIs in the mid- to high 50s in Europe, and we didn't have double-digit growth. And so in a geography like Europe, which is arguably the most exposed at the moment, that is very much on our mind is that well the European business just kind of stick to replacement cycles here. And we just need the economy to be good enough. And then part of that is that we are selling -- our average selling price of our products are less than $10,000. And so we're not the first instrument that's going to get cut in a budget. And I'd say, I think we estimate that something like more than 70% of our products are actually below that level. And so -- and they're personal instruments and we sell them with the direct sales for us. We can articulate the value proposition, all that kind of stuff. So I feel like that's a favorable situation for us. And then the other thing is these comments on mix that we made a lot in the prepared remarks and talked about a little bit earlier. I just think that we should be more resilient going into this next phase of the economy compared to where we were in the past. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. And then one quick one for me. You flagged some conservatism on supply chain during your prepared remarks, which I think is prudent. Just given the macro backdrop, but can you walk us through what you're seeing on supply chain? Have things continued to deteriorate here or they improved since 1Q? And then do you have any line of sight on when things can really improve? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. I'll take that. So look, on supply chain challenges, I would say they have somewhat stabilized but we continue to see challenges in certain items. It's still mainly semiconductors. It seems to get a little bit of that. I would not give green light on everything to be honest here. What we have seen on transportation and logistics have improved quite a bit. We also see, for example, the port in Shanghai, less congested as it used to be, so that helps, of course, but an overall supply of material. Again, we see some of our businesses have seen slight improvement in semiconductor available. But we have still some others who have not. I mentioned the product aspect, for example, where we had some issues getting right components in time. And we still have constantly calls with the suppliers, making sure that we get enough of the electronic components. I can't tell you really whether it's -- this is a trend already, these line improvements. We are hoping all for it and we stay very agile and in very, very close conversation with our suppliers to make sure that we have enough safety stock holds in the areas that we see very critical. Adam Uhlman : Okay. Operator, I think with that, we'll go ahead and wrap up today's call. Thanks, everybody, for joining us on this early morning call. Looking forward to catching up with you later on in the day. Take care. Shawn Vadala : Bye. Adam Uhlman : Thank you. Patrick Kaltenbach : Bye. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, everyone.

Let me now turn the call over to Patrick. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks, Adam, and good evening, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call. I am pleased to report another quarter of strong results as our sophisticated sales and marketing programs, our innovative product portfolio and that supply chain agility continues to be strong competitive advantages. The highlights of our third-quarter performance are detailed on page three of the presentation. Local currency sales in the quarter increased 10% as compared to the prior year. We have particular strong results in the Americas and in China. Yet, it\u2019s very good growth in our Laboratory and Core Industrial businesses. Our robust sales growth and effective execution of our margin initiatives resulted in very good growth in adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings growth despite significant foreign exchange headwinds. As we look towards the remainder of the year and on to 2023, forecasting remains challenging and we acknowledge there is greater uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. These uncertainties will require us to remain agile and focused on factors we can control, namely, leveraging our strong strategic programs to identify and target profitable growth opportunities. We continue to strengthen our market position and benefit from the strong execution of our growth initiatives, as well as favorable market trends such as automation and digitalization. Based on market conditions today, we believe we will generate good sales growth for the remainder of the year and in 2023. Continued execution of our margin and productivity initiatives will support strong financial results. Later I will have some additional comments on our business. But let me now turn it to Shawn to cover the financials and guidance. Shawn? Shawn Vadala : Thanks, Patrick, and good evening, everyone. Sales in the quarter were $985.08 million, which represented a local currency increase of 10%. On a U.S. dollar basis sales increased 4% as currency reduced sales growth by 6%. We estimate that the impact of reduced sales in Russia due to the war was a headwind of about 1% to sales growth. On slide number four, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales increased 11% in the Americas, 1% in Europe and 15% in Asia/Rest of World. Local currency sales increased 15% in China in the quarter. Excluding Russia our sales in Europe grew 5%. On slide number five, we show sales growth by region on a year-to-date basis. Local currency sales grew 11% for the first nine months with 13% growth in the Americas, 5% growth in Europe and 15% growth in Asia/Rest of the World. Local currency sales increased 15% in China on a year-to-date basis. Excluding Russia, our sales in Europe grew 7% on a year-to-date basis. On slide number six, we summarized local currency sales growth by product area. For the quarter, Laboratory sales increased 10%, Industrial increased 10%, with Core Industrial up 13% and Product Inspection up 6%. Food Retail grew 7% in the quarter. The next slide shows local currency sales growth by product area on a year-to-date basis. Laboratory sales increased 13%, Industrial increased 10%, including 12% growth in Core Industrial and Product Inspection up 7%. Food Retail declined 2% on a year-to-date basis. Let me now move to the rest of the P&L which is summarized on slide number eight. For the third quarter, gross margin was better than expected at 59.3%, an increase of 90 basis points. We benefited from favorable pricing and volume growth, which was offset in part by higher material costs. R&D amounted to $44.1 million in the quarter, which is a 10% increase in local currency over the prior year\u2014prior period reflecting increased project activity. SG&A amounted to $233.4 million, a 3% increase in local currency over the prior year and includes increased sales and marketing investments. Adjusted operating profit amounted to $307.2 million in the quarter, a 13% increase. Currency reduced operating profit growth by approximately 6%. Adjusted operating margin was 31.2%, which represents an increase of 250 basis points over the prior year. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $16.7 million in the quarter, interest expense was $14.5 million in the quarter. Other income in the quarter amounted to $1.9 million, primarily reflecting non-service related pension income. Our effective tax-rate was 19% in the quarter. This rate is before discrete items and adjusting for the timing of stock option exercises in the quarter. We expect to maintain this rate in Q4 and in 2023. Fully diluted shares amounted to 22.6 million in the quarter, which is a 3% decline from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $10.18, a 17% increase over the prior year or a 24% increase excluding unfavorable foreign currency. On a reported basis in the quarter, EPS was $9.76, as compared to $8.71 in the prior year. Reported EPS includes $0.22 of purchased intangible amortization, $0.07 of restructuring and the $0.13 headwind due to the difference between our quarterly and annual tax rate due to the timing of stock option exercises. We are very happy with our year-to-date results, which are summarized on the next slide. Local currency sales grew 11% for the nine-month period, adjusted operating income increased 13% or 17% excluding unfavorable foreign currency and our operating margin expanded 150 basis points. Adjusted EPS grew 17% on a year-to-date basis or 22% excluding unfavorable currency. That covers the P&L. Now let me cover cash flow. In the quarter adjusted free cash flow amounted to $224.7 million. DSO was flat compared to prior year levels at 35 days, while ITO was 3.7 times. Let me now turn to guidance and begin with some overall considerations for our guidance for the remainder of this year and next year. First, forecasting remains very challenging. There is greater uncertainty in the macro environment, including the impacts of the global economy from higher interest rates, the war in Ukraine and China\u2019s zero COVID policies. We recognize the importance of being agile and able to react quickly if market conditions change. We are basing our guidance for Q4 in 2023 assuming market conditions remain as they are today. Second, we feel very good about our business. In particular, we believe we have strategies in place to identify and pursue growth opportunities and we have an innovative product portfolio that supports these growth initiatives. We also continue to benefit from a more favorable business mix, as well as global market trends in automation, digitalization and investments in on and nearshoring. We also believe we will continue to execute well on our margin initiatives. Third, supply chain challenges remain but are improving. Our team has done an outstanding job of overcoming the various dynamics of the supply chain over the last three years. We believe our ability to continue to meet customer demands is a competitive advantage, but acknowledge risks remain in the global supply chain. Finally, we have a significantly greater headwinds with respect to currency as compared to the last-time we spoke. In particular, as I know you are all aware currency has moved dramatically since early September creating significant headwind for Q4 and for 2023. To a lesser degree, higher interest rates are also a bit of a headwind. Fortunately, we have limited floating rate debt. However, the significant movement in rates has increased our expense. I thought it would be helpful to provide this guidance overview and now let me comment on -- cover the specifics. For the full year 2022, we now expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 10%. This compares to our previous guidance of 9% to 10%. We expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $38.95 to $39.05, which represents a growth rate of about 15%. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance is slightly higher than our previous guidance as stronger than expected Q3 performance has been largely offset by greater currency headwinds in the fourth quarter. Specifically, we expect currency to be a headwind to adjusted EPS growth in the fourth quarter of approximately 10% and 6% for the full year. At the time of our last earnings call, we had expected earnings -- we had expected currency to be a headwind to fourth quarter adjusted EPS growth of approximately 6% and 4.5% for the full year. With respect to the fourth quarter, we would expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 7% and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $11.55 to $11.65. This represents a growth rate of 10% to 11%, and as I just mentioned, includes a currency headwind of approximately 10%. For the full year 2023, based on our assessment of market conditions today, we would expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 5% and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $42 to $42.40, which represents a growth rate of 8% to 9%. This includes an estimated currency headwind of approximately 4.5%. Some further comments on our 2023 guidance. We expect interest expense to be approximately $73 million, total amortization, including purchased intangible amortization to be $71 million, purchased intangible amortization is excluded from adjusted EPS and is estimated at $24 million on a pre-tax basis or $0.83 per share. Other income, which is below operating profit and reflects non-service pension income is forecast to be approximately $12 million. We expect our tax rate before discrete items will be 19% for both 2022 and 2023. Now, let\u2019s turn to cash flow. For 2022, we now expect full year free cash flow in the range of $780 million which is below our previous guidance. While our supply chain team has done an exemplary job in overcoming challenges in meeting customer demand, it has required us to hold higher -- a higher a higher inventory level than we had expected. We believe it has been necessary given the challenges in the global supply chain and expect we will return to more normal levels in 2023. I also want to remind you that our free cash flow in both 2020 and 2021 was excellent, exceeding 25% growth on a per share basis in each year. For 2023, we expect free cash flow in the range of $900 million, which represents a growth rate of 19% on a per share basis and a conversion rate of 97% on -- of net income. We would expect to repurchase approximately $1 billion of shares in 2023, which would allow us to maintain a net-debt to EBITDA ratio of approximately 1.5 times. As we have done in the past, we will aim to repurchase our shares evenly throughout the year. We have also announced today that our Board has authorized an additional $2.5 billion to the share repurchase program to be utilized over the next few years, which is an addition to the $1.2 million -- $2 billion remaining on our previous year repurchase authorization. Lastly, with respect to the impact of currency on sales growth, we expect currency to reduce our sales growth by 5.5% in 2022, including an 8.5% sales growth headwind in Q4. At today\u2019s foreign exchange rates, currency would reduce our sales growth by an additional 4% for the full year 2023. That is it from my side and now I will turn it back to Patrick. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks, Shawn. Shawn and I recently completed our annual global budget tour, meeting with our colleagues around the world for in-depth reviews of strategic frameworks and key initiatives of our operating units. Those of you that have followed us closely know, this is an important element of our annual planning process as it allows us to spend considerable time with our colleagues to discuss and analyze the opportunities across our diverse business. Although, uncertainty exists in the outlook for the global economy over the next year, I feel very good about the underlying strategies we have in place and believe we are well-positioned to enhance our market position going forward. We are quite confident that we can continue to gain share and generate good earnings in 2022 and 2023. Let me share with you some comments on our operating results, as well as more details on our outlook for 2023. Starting with Lab business. I am very pleased with the strong sales growth we have delivered this quarter and year-to-date, and we saw good results across most of our portfolio. We expect good sales performance continuing in the fourth quarter and next year. As we think about our Lab business over the medium-term, we expect investments by pharma and biopharma into new drug modalities will provide great opportunities for us to support them with our solutions. The trend of digitalization in Labs has also accelerated and our solutions helps customers realized productivity gains and address growing compliance and data validation requirements. We also will look to talk the significant growth occurring in hot segments like lithium-ion batteries, semiconductors, green hydrogen and sustainable polymers to name a few. We leverage a highly agile approach to capture growth in these segments, applying a systematic voice of the customer approach on a segment and application level to identify attractive opportunities and ensure we have the correct strategies, product roadmaps and marketing efforts in place to take advantage of them. Switching now to the Industrial business. Core Industrial had very strong results in the third quarter and year-to-date. There is good demand particularly for our automation solutions as our customers look to improve productivity and increased yields. We have also seen good interest from pharma and biopharma customers as they utilize our solutions to efficiently bring new drugs to production. Like our Laboratory business, hot segments are important for our Core Industrial business as well and we have seen very strong activity from customers serving lithium-ion battery industry in China, Europe and the Americas. While we are seeing good demand to date in Core Industrial and our business has shifted over the years to more resilient industries, our business is not immune to changes in the economy. High energy cost and softer economic activity may weigh on our customers in Europe and particularly in the chemical customers. Nevertheless, we expect to deliver solid growth in our Core Industrial business in the fourth quarter and next year. Over the long-term, labor shortages and the trend of nearshoring and reshoring to establish more resilient supply chains is expected to benefit our Core Industrial business over the coming years. Additionally, new product development has been critical to our success in meeting customer needs for automation solutions and we provide equipment that is very easy to integrate into customer\u2019s control systems and also meets the most stringent data integrity and cyber security requirements. We are also optimistic about our product portfolio and exciting innovations we have brought to-market and new products to come. For example, in addition to a strong growth we have seen before contact automation offering, our new line of hygienic bench and floor scales positions us well to win the pharma and food customers in the coming years. Turning now to Product Inspection business, we had good growth with strong demand in the Americas, which was offset in part by more cautious investment activity in Europe. Some of our packaged fruit manufacturing customers face more challenging operating environment and are focused on mitigating margin pressures from inflation and supply chain disruptions. However, we would still expect overall growth in the fourth quarter and into 2023. While the pandemic, high input costs and the war in Ukraine have resulted in lower relative sales growth for Product Inspection in the recent years, we remain convinced that the long-term growth dynamics remain strong. We are not standing still and continue to seek out pockets of growth including check weighing in with industry, pharma and confectionery customers, and we have expanded our mid-range or our mid-market coverage with new product offerings in X-ray and metal detection. I\u2019d also want to remind you that service is very important to our Product Inspection customers and we have new initiatives underway to support our customer\u2019s uptime, while at the same time improving our service technician productivity. These include augmented reality for remote customers support and advanced remote diagnostics to identify and recommend quick repairs to keep our food manufacturing customers up and running. Lastly, our Food Retail business delivered strong results in the third quarter, with strength in the Americas offset by weakness in China due to the pandemic related lockdowns. Our team has built good momentum recently and has an attractive product pipeline for 2023 and we are optimistic that we can generate profitable growth over the next year. Let me make some comments by geography. We had very good performance in the Americas, again strong growth in last year\u2019s third quarter with strong growth across Product Inspection, Core Industrial and Retail. We have a favorable outlook for the remainder of the year and in 2023. Switching to Europe, our sales grew about 5% excluding the impact of Russia. The war in Ukraine has led to sharply higher energy costs across the region and as weighed on some of our customer\u2019s investments appetite, particularly packaged food manufacturers and some chemical customers. We still see good investment level from other customer segments, including biopharma and firms involved in the development and production of electric vehicles. We expect moderate growth in Q4 and next year. Finally, for Asia and the Rest of the World, they had very strong growth in the third quarter as our team successfully navigated challenging operating conditions with the pandemic and COVID 19 lockdowns and also executed very well on our strategic initiatives. Going forward, we look to continue to optimize our sales force guidance activities in China to pursue attractive opportunities and we will also increase our focus on leveraging digital approaches to generate customer leads. Our Lab and Industrial business have performed very well this year, which we expect to persist for the rest of the year and in 2023. We remain optimistic about several key long-term market drivers in China, including the continued development of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, electrical vehicles, micro electronics and new material industries. We are very well-positioned to take advantage of these growth opportunities and have continued to invest in our sales and marketing efforts to support our growth in China. While we remain optimistic about the long-term, we acknowledge days and uncertainty in the short-term, and we know from the past that economic conditions can change very quickly in China requiring us to remain agile. So that is a summary of our outlook for the fourth quarter and next year. As you think about our longer term -- as you think about the longer term years, we very strongly believe that favorable market dynamics, our growth initiatives and our improved business mix is supportive of our long-term growth algorithm of 6% plus local currency sales growth and mid-teens earnings growth. This will be accomplished by gaining additional market share through strong execution of Spinnaker, which includes optimizing our sales force guidance and cross-selling initiatives, increasing customer engagement with digital tools and selling services at the point-of-sale. Our team will continue to pursue the most attractive, fast growing and resilient market segments. We will also continue to invest in new product innovations and will be -- that will be the foundation of future growth and I would note that our portfolio and go-to-market approach is uniquely positioned to deliver on customer requirements for automation and digitalization. Our strategies and initiatives are well-developed and well ingrained throughout the organization, and we will continue to be critical in gaining market share and driving sales and operating margin growth. That concludes our prepared remarks and I now want to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Thank you. This is Peter [ph] on for Derik. Just real quick. Could you guys just maybe walk through your assumptions by segment for the fourth quarter and next year as well, and also by geography, too? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Hey, Peter. This is Shawn. I will take that one. So, let me start with our Lab business. So for the fourth quarter, we estimate high single-digit growth in Q4, which would be low double-digit growth for the full year and mid-to-high single-digit growth for 2023. For our Core Industrial business, we estimate mid single-digit growth for Q4, which would be approximately 10% growth for the full year and low-to-mid single-digit growth for 2023. For Product Inspection, we estimate low single-digit growth for Q4, which would approximate mid single-digit growth for the full year and low-to-mid single-digit growth for 2023. And for Food Retailing, we estimate approximately 10% growth in Q4, which would be about low single-digit growth for the full year and mid single-digit growth for 2023. And then, if I kind of go through that by region, in the Americas we estimate high single-digit growth in Q4, which would be low double-digit growth for the full year and mid single-digit growth for next year. For Europe, we are estimating low-to-mid single-digit growth in Q4, which would be mid single-digit growth for the full year and low single-digit growth for 2023 and then for China we are estimating approximately 10% growth in Q4, which would translate to double-digit growth for the full year and we estimate high single-digit growth in 2023. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. And could you guys give us an update on pricing? I guess, maybe comment on what you did on the third quarter and updated expectations for 2022 and what\u2019s embedded for 2023? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Yeah. So we were very pleased with our execution of the organization in the quarter and we also continue to see how our value proposition is really are valued in this environment, especially as customers seek more solutions towards automation and digitalization. At the beginning of the quarter we were estimating about 5% price realization for Q3 and we actually came in at in the 6% kind of a range. As we kind of look forward, so we did better than expected. As we kind of look at Q4 we are kind of expecting a similar price realization again in the 6% kind of a range. And then as we looked at 2023, we are estimating about something in the 4% kind of a range. But I would say it\u2019s important to think that we will do a little bit better in the first half of the year because we will get some benefits from some of our pricing actions that happened during 2022 then the second half of the year. Unidentified Analyst : Super helpful. Thank you so much. Shawn Vadala : Thank you. Patrick Kaltenbach : Welcome. Operator : We will take our next question from Josh Waldman at Cleveland Research. Josh Waldman : Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. Shawn, I appreciate your talking through the segment and geo assumptions. I guess though at a high level, I am assuming the 5% is more of a base, just given where we are to start the year, how much variance do you think there is to that 5% number. I mean, given you expect 4% price next year, I guess, only a point of volume, it seems like that\u2019s fairly conservative? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. I mean, hey, I feel like we are doing very well. We feel -- continue to feel good about the things we can control. The teams are executing well. We feel like we are gaining market share. We think that there\u2019s a lot of good trends in the world that we talk about like automation and digitalization and on nearshoring. But of course, yeah, there is uncertainty in the world as well. And I think, more importantly, we are coming off a period of really strong multiyear comparisons. I mean, if you look at like our three year CAGR over the last three years, I think, it\u2019s about 9% organically and so that\u2019s something I think we also need to kind of keep in mind as well, too. So, overall, we feel like this is a good guide at this point in time. Of course, we will see how things play-out as we kind of get into the year and update as we kind of go along. But otherwise there has been no change to our planning process and how we approach things from the past. Josh Waldman : Got it. And then, Patrick, for the first time in a while, I didn\u2019t hear you talk about LabX. I wonder if you could provide an update there. We hear it come up in the research quite often but, wondered if you could talk through maybe the opportunities you see forthcoming and maybe talk around metrics that you kind of gauge against internally? Patrick Kaltenbach : Very good. Thanks for the question Josh. Yeah. So, look, LabX, we are really happy how LabX is being rolled out to more customers around the world. It has a very strong reputation in the market for those who are not aware, not -- who don\u2019t know the background of LabX, it\u2019s our instrument control software for our Lab products, for most of our Lab products actually Baloney controls instrument. It also reflects the entire workflows. So it\u2019s a very strong software solution that helps our customers also on the compliance and data integrity side. And it\u2019s definitely one of the strong selling points for us for pharma customers and Lab customers who are on the even more strict compliance restrictions and as we increasingly connect more whole Lab instruments through LabX, it\u2019s becoming a strong differentiator for us as well positioning our products in the broader lab space. Again, we continue to roll out -- to roll this out, but only if key accounts who had several accounts, using our LabX software on a broader base, but we see very strong success around -- in this indoor Lab space, we expect that we continued to connect more instruments moving forward, our goal is to have for most of our instruments connected to LabX and helping our customers are said to reflect the entire workflow with our instruments and having the software backbone to not only stored data but also reflective workflows, et cetera. Really strong selling proposition for us and also against our competitors who don\u2019t have a similar solution. So I am really happy with where we are and we continue to add features and again connect more instruments moving forward. Josh Waldman : All right. Appreciate it guys. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah. Thanks. Operator : We will go next to Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. Jordan Adler : Hey. This is Jordan on for Vijay. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk about your margin assumptions for the remainder of the year and kind of what you are assuming as we go into fiscal year 2023. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Hey. I will take that, Jordan. So, like, I said before we -- we were very pleased with our performance with pricing, Q3 and I have already provided guidance for Q4 and for next year. I think that\u2019s certainly a key lever in our margin assumption. If you kind of look at Q3, we expanded our gross margin by 90 basis points. As we kind of look to Q4, we are looking at about 150 basis points of gross margin expansion. We are looking at a similar amount in 2023 of about 150 basis points and then if you kind of dropped down to operating margin, we expanded our margin by about 250 basis points in Q3, as we kind of look to Q4 we are going to be just under 300 basis points, probably, about 290 basis points. As we look at next year, we are looking at about 160 basis points. And a key ingredient will be our price realization as we go forward as we kind of look towards Q4, we still will see some elevated headwinds in terms of up inflation on material costs, but maybe to a slightly lesser degree than what we saw in Q3. Jordan Adler : Great. And time for one quick follow-up. I was wondering if you could talk about what you are seeing across geographies and I know you touched upon it in your opening remarks. But maybe can you talk about what you are seeing from an order perspective in Europe, kind of some factors that you have seen in the quarter and your expectations moving forward? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. So in terms of orders, as you are probably familiar, we don\u2019t -- we only typically have about a month and a half or so of backlog, so we typically don\u2019t comment on orders or backlog. But of course, we consider that in our guidance for the fourth quarter and for next year. In terms of Europe, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d add too much to what Patrick said in our opening remarks. I mean one area that we have seen some slowdown to a certain degree is in packaged foods, in particularly the impact on our Product Inspection businesses, companies are delaying investments in CapEx in that area and Product Inspection would fit into CapEx, which is not the typical part of our portfolio, a lot of our -- most of our sales are and below $10,000, but Product Inspection is above that. And then as we kind of look at the energy crisis, I mean, we still hear good things from our organization, but we are also mindful of the overall situation and the potential impact on industries like the chemical industry. Jordan Adler : Great. Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Tim Daley at Wells Fargo. Tim Daley : Great. Thanks. First question, I wanted to touch on China here. So, previously you were expecting about 10% in the quarter delivered 15%. And I think previously you were talking about low double-digit for the year and I think today you said double digits. So just curious is -- what\u2019s been going on there, what drove the upside in the quarter and how exactly has your outlook for the year changed, I guess? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah. Look, this as Patrick. We are very pleased with our results in China. As you said, we are 15% in the quarter and we also have forecast double-digit growth for the fourth-quarter. So we are really happy how China is supporting for us. We have a very strong organization there and it\u2019s really performing extremely well. We have not been affected big time by the corporate lock towns, our manufacturing sites continue to manufacture restrictions, but they have been operational. We see our sales team, as we said in the remarks, also really fully leveraging the Spinnaker tools to really reach out to customers and capture the fast growing segments in China, as well as a lot of momentum behind for some electrical vehicles, battery segment, the lithium-ion segment, but we are also seeing still very good growth in pharma and biopharma in China. So we are -- actually we have continued to be very pleasantly surprised by the performance, again, we have been optimistic for Q3. It totally came in as expected or even better and our outlook for China is still positive long-term, of course, so anyway positive. Short-term, there always risk in China, of course, as we all acknowledge that can be short-term lockdown impacts or others, but I think, you should look at China from a long-term growth perspective. It\u2019s very promising. I think we will continue to see growth. We have organization there that is very strong both on the sales and marketing side, but also don\u2019t forget we have manufacturing and R&D Day as well. And from that perspective, I think, we have a really good understanding about what drives market momentum in China and can also quickly adopt to fast growing segments and capture those. Tim Daley : All right. That\u2019s very helpful. And a bit of a two-parter here on margins. First, on kind of price cost and inflation, and then the second is going to be on the FX impact. So on the price cost just thank you for the outlook on that kind of four points of pricing next year, but should inflation come in higher or lower then we currently forecast that are currently embedded in the outlook. How should we be thinking about that impact to the margin? Is it pretty much expected to be consistent, if inflation comes in higher upside lower downside or general thoughts? And then on the FX side of things. FX impact the topline and the operating income line seem to be similar in the quarter and on the outlook, I think, that\u2019s consistent as well. So is that the best rule of thumb we can use kind of like-for-like impact on FX to the topline and to the bottomline? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Hey. Good questions, Tim. Hey. So the first one -- let me start with this -- I will kind of end with the second one -- I will start with the second one first. So, I think, the best way, I mean, I recognize what you are saying the relationship between sales and EPS. But I would say, probably, the best way to think about it is our -- to look at our major exposures, so our largest exposure would be the U.S. dollar to the renminbi. And so for about every 1% change in the renminbi to the U.S. dollar that would affect our operating profit of about $3.5 million to $4 million. And then if you -- the second largest exposure would be our Swiss franc to the euro. So, if you think about it we are long in euro, but we are short in franc and that kind of creates inherent natural hedge within the company and so we look at the cross rate. And so as the Swiss franc changes are the or the -- as that cross rate changes every 1% has an effect of about $2 million on our operating profit. And so I think that\u2019s how I would probably look at it and then I don\u2019t have a really good proxy for the dollar against the rest of the basket of currencies, but those are the two major impacts on our earnings. In terms of -- what was the first price costs, okay, yeah. Tim Daley : Yeah. Shawn Vadala : If the certainly in terms of price cost, I mean, I think, you saw that we were able to respond very well to inflationary headwinds in 2022. Of course, it can take a quarter or two for us to be able to actually get the actions into the market. But if we were confronted with a similar situation next year, I think, we would react exactly the same way and I think that the market understands inflation, our organization was able to do a great job articulating and explaining that to the market. And then, I think, most importantly, we are providing really strong value propositions to the market that they appreciate and the ability to support them and provide these value propositions is highly appreciated and also supports our price realization going-forward. Tim Daley : Great. Thank you so much. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Alonso Garcia at UBS. Alonso Garcia : Evening, guys. Thanks so much. So, I guess, to start-off with. I just wanted to actually dig into a little bit with kind of, you have obviously talked a little bit about kind of supply chain and kind of the challenges that you have been able to kind of manage and how to think about the cadence. But if you could kind of help us understand kind of you have talked about electrical components and -- previously and how that\u2019s improving the kind of how to think about through the balance of 2023 kind of how to think about kind of maybe the impact to margins and the improvement there and what you are kind of expecting into the guidance? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Hey, Alonso. So, you can imagine there\u2019s a lot of moving parts in terms of our gross margin assumption in our different material categories. There are going to be some benefits next year where we have seen things like electronic components, we have seen or expect to see some benefits next year, but of course, there\u2019s other categories like where we have had a do broker buys this year going out several months where we are going to have to carry additional cost into next year is two like simple examples. I think the best way to think about the impact on margin next year is that, overall we were expecting 150-basis-point improvement in our gross margin, about 170 basis points of that will come from our pricing assumptions and then it will be offset by a wide range of other categories in this inflation basket. And as you kind of think about material cost assumptions for next year, I think we are going to -- right now we are planning on something more modest probably in the low single-digit kind of arrange. Alonso Garcia : Okay. Great. And I know PendoTECH is at this point part of the organic number, but it would be great to kind of just trying to get a contextual update on performance in the quarter and how the company is maybe performing relative to kind of\u2026 Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah. Alonso Garcia : \u2026 your expectations? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah. Absolutely. I will take that, look, we are very happy with how PendoTECH is performing. It has been probably one of the best acquisitions in terms of overall growth, may not in total volume, but overall growth. It\u2019s really exceeding our expectations. We are very happy we are still seeing strong demand from our end customers. And we continue to build out the organization. We started, as you know, mainly as pressure sensors, in the future we look into additional single-use sensors as well. It\u2019s now in the meantime really well-connected and engrained in the overall product process business. So we are very optimistic on the outlook for the business moving forward. Alonso Garcia : Great. Thanks so much. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks. Operator : We will move next to Patrick Donnelly at Citi. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Lucy [ph] on for Patrick. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could delve a little bit into what you are seeing in Europe, you said that maybe there sort of weakness on Product Inspection. Was that a particular countries, is that the entire region just, any more color there would be helpful? Thank you and I have one more. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Thank you. I will take the question. Look, in Europe and Product Inspection, a lot of them are large international, multinational companies and what we are seeing is that, they are not canceling projects, but they are delaying projects. I think, overall, they have become a bit more cautious with the projects and how they are spending their money at least in this quarter, and probably, also in Q4, so they are postponing projects and they have, I would say, better line-of-sight of how things develop in Europe. It\u2019s not specific to any particular country in Europe. So, I would say, you can see just from most are from several customers but it\u2019s not linked to one country overall. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. And then, in terms of the Investor Day coming up, anything around the share what we can expect for that, I am not that gloomy? Thanks. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. I think you will see an update on our business and our different initiatives. We will walk you through that and then we will kind of also talk about some of our exciting opportunities to continue to expand our margins through supply chain and pricing. And then it\u2019s going to be -- the Investor Day is going to be based, actually we are here right now in Massachusetts at our Process Analytics business and so we are going to feature that business and so show you -- showcase that business in a lot more detail and then kind of also show you kind of how we serve the value stream of a typical biopharma customer. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Matt Sykes at Goldman Sachs. Matt Sykes : Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe the first question Patrick or Shawn, just as you look into 2023, there\u2019s obviously risks out there whether it\u2019s inflation or supply chain or Europe weakness and I am sure you have baked them into the guidance you have presented. If one of those were to improve, meaning not become a risk, is there a certain one of those three or others that could really change kind of the dynamic of, one, how you think about the progression of the year, but also the dynamics of the business and the growth in certain areas? Patrick Kaltenbach : Let\u2019s see. Shawn Vadala : I can take this. Look, I mean\u2026 Patrick Kaltenbach : We are flipping a coin. Okay. As it is -- as we did, of course, there are still ongoing multiple risks and it\u2019s not only Europe and in China, we are talking potentially about continued lockdowns related to COVID-19, but it is not yet clarity of how that will evolve further, talk maybe for -- I mean, it\u2019s about Europe, I mean, again the war in Europe, it related to energy crisis, et cetera, just shows quite some uncertainty in the outlook of 2023. Of course if that would be resolved we would see upside to our current projection. But who knows? I mean, it\u2019s -- there is no short-term resolution in sight and that\u2019s actually also not really clear about how big those impacts will be, right? How many of the chemical customers will be affected, will there be like program\u2026 Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Matt Sykes : Energy outages, what does this mean for the entire strategy, we -- it took of course that all into consideration and try to make it very reasonable forecast for 2023. But we can\u2019t know -- we cannot neglect these risks right and they are now in our forecast. If those would go away, and of course, there would be upside, right? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Exactly. And\u2026 Patrick Kaltenbach : But how much is really hard to quantify. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Patrick Kaltenbach : It also how -- again how customers will respond to these crisis. Shawn Vadala : And I think the key is like you kind of go back, Josh kind of asked about an upside-downside at the beginning and in the end it is going to be a lot to do with the macro. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah. Shawn Vadala : Like, there are a lot of big topics out there in the world and if they go away, any one of them would -- could be an up -- could be a good upside for us and if they worsen, I mean, it could be a downside and those are things out of our control and as an organization we just to stay agile and we continue to try to monitor\u2026 Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah. Shawn Vadala : \u2026 these situations very closely and make sure we can have and react quickly. Patrick Kaltenbach : I mean, what I want to say is, also looking back just the last crisis, we went into COVID-19 and in our organization really demonstrated incredible agility to adjust the market conditions and we will apply similar same measures as moving forward if any new crisis comes up. I think we are very well-trained and very agile and have demonstrated actually how we can react to changing market conditions and the flexibility of organizations and the tools we have in place, as I have said, also in my remarks at the beginning, we have the tools in place where we can very quickly identify pockets of growth in the market and send our sales team to those and capture those opportunities as they come up. Matt Sykes : Got it. Thanks for indulging me in that question, I appreciate the color. And just a second question a quick follow-up. As you look at Food Retail, it\u2019s obviously a smaller part of your business. It\u2019s been fairly volatile and I think comps are obviously impacting that. As you look that mid single-digit growth for next year, should we expect a decrease maybe in the volatility of revenue for that business, are there things that you have done there to better manage that or help to manage that or is that mid-single digits sort of an average of the volatility that we might see continue into 2023? Patrick Kaltenbach : Well, look as you rightfully said, it\u2019s a smaller part of our business, it\u2019s about 5% of the total business. We are -- we have seen really good projects over the last couple of months, where we have been really successful. We are also looking at rollout often upgrade portfolio of products and we are optimistic of the product we have. But in terms of the overall volatility in the market, we don\u2019t see any short-term changes. Again, I mentioned also in the markets that we have in China we are currently facing an issue with the lockdown, which affects a lot of the retail customers there and we don\u2019t know exactly how long that will continue. If that eases up there is probably some upside. But volatility I don\u2019t expect a total significant change in 2023. What we do, I want to say is, that we have, again, with the strong portfolio and also the number of projects we have won over the last couple of months, it also gives us confidence in the portfolio. Matt Sykes : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal at JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Neil [ph] on for Rachel and thanks for taking the question. First, could you give us some color and/or some additional color on inventory, last quarter you had updated us on customer inventory levels, knowing it had come down a bit on pipette tips after customers have stockpiled during the heights of the pandemic. You talk today a bit about how your inventory levels in relation to free cash flow had changed, so could you provide us some more color here on both customer inventories like how are they looking at it was the same by product and then kind of some of the key products there like and have you noticed any material change here in your inventory levels? Shawn Vadala : Hey. Maybe I will take it and if Patrick wants to add something from the customer perspective. Let me start with our internal. So, the first comment I would say is, we are extremely happy with our global supply chain organization. Really tremendous, just really great job in terms of supporting customers for the last few years during the pandemic and it\u2019s been a competitive advantage that really has. We -- Patrick and I were just traveling around the world, visiting our different businesses and we just heard several antedotes from around the world about how we are able -- our delivery times, they might be a little longer than they were in the past, but they are significantly better than competition. And that\u2019s allowed us to gain share in different cases and so we feel really good about that. Now, of course, the other side of that is, we have carried higher inventory levels, higher safety stocks in different categories to be able to make sure that we could do that. As we -- I mean, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to get into any particular detail with one category or another, there\u2019s different types of components and the different that are key to a wide range of our portfolio. We have about 130,000 SKUs. So you can imagine it\u2019s pretty complex and I think Blue Ocean has allowed us to have the visibility through the supply chain to manage that complexity and know where we had to increase safety stocks. But now as we kind of look to 2023 and with shipping times., especially coming from China into the U.S. dramatically shortening just recently. We feel like we are in a position also to reduce those levels in 2023, which was included of course in our outlook and our guidance for 2023. From a customer perspective, probably, the one area that we have heard some noise in the area of pipette tips. Difficult to quantify exactly how much that is to kind of in our business, I mean, our -- but overall we are very pleased with our overall pipette tips business. The instrument sales are actually continuing to grow very well with really good demand in biopharma research. But as you say on the consumable side we were down in the third quarter. And then it\u2019s hard to have visibility through our customers in that, but it\u2019s also not a significant impact to our overall business. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah. I would say, not significant also, because we didn\u2019t service or serve the majority after COVID testing labs, right now a majority -- Shawn as you said, have been biopharma research labs, et-cetera, which didn\u2019t overstock to the same extent as a lot of testing customers did. Unidentified Analyst : Awesome. That\u2019s super helpful. And then just one more on -- you noticed previously that there had been some rumblings of potential government stimulus in different regions, particularly in China and that could probably benefit the region. Have you noticed any sort of updates on that, have you heard any updates on that and that\u2019s it. Thank you so much. Shawn Vadala : Do you want to take. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah. I can take. No. We are -- actually good question, but no, we have not heard any significant impact or changes driven by any government initiatives at the moment. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Unidentified Analyst : Awesome. Thanks. Operator : That does conclude the question-and-answer session and concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks Adam and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining our call that we are doing from Switzerland. 2022 was another year where our company\u2019s unique strength and culture of execution led to strong performance and success in overcoming significant external challenges. Our teams\u2019 resilience and agility to quickly react and adapt to the changing environment allowed us to meet customer demand, gain market share, and deliver robust financial results. We also finished the year with excellent sales growth in the fourth quarter and benefited from very good broad-based growth across geographic regions and product categories. The highlights of the fourth quarter performance are detailed on Page 3 of the presentation. Local currency sales in the quarter increased 9% as compared to the prior year with broad-based growth across all regions and most of our product portfolio. Strong sales growth combined with benefits from our margin initiatives and good cost control contributed to excellent growth in adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS, offsetting very significant currency headwinds.  As we look ahead to this year, we expect continued uncertainty regarding the global economy and face challenging multi-year sales growth comparisons. I\u2019m confident that the diligent execution of our growth and productivity initiatives will again position us very well to gain market share and deliver solid financial results. Later, I will have some additional comments on our business, but let me now turn it to Shawn to cover financials and the guidance. Shawn Vadala : Thanks Patrick and good morning everyone. Sales in the quarter were $1.058 billion, which represented a local currency increase of 9%. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased 2% as currency reduced sales growth by 7%. We estimate that the impact of not shipping to Russia was a headwind of about 1% to sales growth. On Slide No. 4, we show sales growth by region. We had broad-based sales growth in Q4 as local currency sales increased 8% in the Americas, 9% in Europe, and 9% in Asia-rest of the world. Local currency sales increased 11% in China in the quarter. Excluding Russia, our sales in Europe grew 13%. On Slide No. 5, we show sales growth by region for the full year 2022. Local currency sales grew 11% for the year with 12% growth in the Americas, 6% in Europe, and 13% in Asia-rest of the world. Local currency sales increased 14% in China in 2022. Excluding Russia, our sales in Europe grew 9% for the full year. On Slide No. 6, we summarize local currency sales growth by product area. For the quarter, laboratory sales increased 10%, industrial increased 6%, with core industrial up 5% and product inspection up 9%. Food retail grew 12% in the quarter. The next slide shows local currency sales growth by product area for the full year. Laboratory sales increased 12%, industrial increased 9% including 10% growth in core industrial and 7% growth in product inspection. Food retail grew 1% in 2022.  Let me now move to the rest of the P&L, which is summarized on Slide No. 8. For the fourth quarter, gross margin was 59.8%, an increase of 130 basis points. We benefited from favorable pricing and volume growth, which was offset in part by higher costs. R&D amounted to $45.9 million in the quarter, which is a 7% increase in local currency over the prior period, reflecting increased project activity. SG&A amounted to $227.6 million, a 1% decrease in local currency over the prior year and included lower variable compensation related to our strong prior year results.  Adjusted operating profit amounted to $358.6 million in the quarter, a 12% increase. Currency reduced operating profit growth by approximately 9%. Adjusted operating margin was 33.9%, which represents an increase of 310 basis points over the prior year. A couple final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $16.5 million in the quarter. Interest expense was $16.8 million in the quarter. Other income in the quarter amounted to $1.5 million, primarily reflecting non-service related pension income. We reduced our effective tax rate from 19% to 18.5% in the quarter. This rate is before discrete items and adjusting for the timing of stock option exercises in the quarter. We are pleased with this reduction and expect to maintain an 18.5% rate in 2023. Fully diluted shares amounted to 22.4 million in the quarter, which is a 3.5% decline from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $12.10, a 15% increase over the prior year or a 24% increase excluding unfavorable foreign currency. On a reported basis in the quarter, EPS was $11.86 as compared to $9.94 in the prior year. Reported EPS in the quarter includes $0.21 of purchased intangible amortization and $0.07 of restructuring and other costs.  We also had two items impacting reported income taxes this quarter. We had a $0.20 headwind due to the difference between our quarterly and annual tax rate due to the timing of stock option exercises, and we also had a $0.16 benefit from adjusting our tax rate to 18.5% for the first three quarters of the year. The next slide summarizes our full year 2022 financial results, which we are very proud of considering the unexpected challenges our team faced over the last year. Local currency sales grew 11% for the year, adjusted operating income increased 13% or 18% excluding unfavorable foreign currency, and our operating margin expanded 190 basis points. Adjusted EPS grew 17% for the full year or 23% excluding unfavorable currency. That covers the P&L, and let me now comment on cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $272.9 million and DSO was 37 days, while ITO was 3.6 times. Let me now turn to guidance.  To start off, forecasting remains challenging and market conditions remain dynamic. We are basing our guidance for the first quarter and full year assuming market conditions remain as they are today. While some factors impacting our outlook have improved, like foreign exchange rates, we still face uncertainty, including the risk of recession in certain countries. We also face difficult multi-year sales growth comparisons. Regardless, we remain focused on the factors we can control and believe our unique sales and marketing strategies and innovative product portfolio will support market share gains and profitable growth this year. For the full year 2023, we have left our local currency sales growth guidance of approximately 5% unchanged. We expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $43.55 to $43.95, representing a growth rate of about 10% to 11% or approximately 11% to 12% excluding unfavorable foreign currency. This compares to our previous guidance of adjusted EPS in the range of $42 to $42.40 and reflects the impact of three items. First, foreign exchange based on today\u2019s rates is expected to be a 1% headwind to profit growth, down from our previous guidance of a 4.5% headwind due to the strengthening of the renminbi, among other currencies. Secondly, we now expect our effective tax rate for 2023 to be approximately 18.5%, down slightly from our prior estimate and a modest benefit to EPS.  Lastly, somewhat offsetting these benefits to adjusted EPS is an increase in interest rates and related interest expense, as well as a decrease in forecast pension income. Specifically, we now expect interest expense to be approximately $78 million. Other income, which is below operating profit and largely reflects non-service pension income is forecast to be approximately $1 million. Total amortization including purchased intangible amortization is forecast to be $73 million. Purchased intangible amortization is excluded from adjusted EPS and is estimated at $27 million on a pre-tax basis or $0.97 per share. Now let\u2019s turn to cash flow. For 2023, we continue to expect free cash flow in the range of $900 million and we still expect to repurchase approximately $1 billion of our shares this year. This would allow us to maintain a net debt to EBITDA ratio of approximately 1.5 times. That is it for my side, and I\u2019ll now turn it back to Patrick. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks Shawn. Let me start with some comments on our operating businesses, starting with lab, which had strong sales growth in the quarter with strong growth across most of our product portfolio, especially in analytical instruments and process analytics, while our pipette business was down due to a decline in pipette tips. Overall, we continue to see growth with pharma and biopharma customers as well as the faster growing segments, such as lithium batteries and others, and expect favorable results in 2023. Turning now to our industrial business, where core industrial had solid growth in each region and continues to benefit from market trends towards automation and digitalization. Our outlook for this year is positive, although I\u2019d note this business is not immune to potential changes in the economy and will require us to remain agile to identify and target growth opportunities. Product inspection sales were stronger than expected this quarter with very strong sales in the Americas. Europe had modest growth as we saw better customer activity compared to the last quarter. Overall, we expect to have a positive start in 2023 in product inspection with good growth in the Americas, however we remain cautious in Europe with softer conditions in packaged foods.  Finally, food retail delivered very strong with project activities in the Americas and Europe offset in part by a significant sales decline in China due to disruptions from the pandemic. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales in Europe increased 9% in the quarter, better than we had expected and inclusive of a 4% headwind from stopping our shipments to Russia. We saw good growth across most product categories in Europe, particularly in process analytics and retail. The potential energy crisis and related impact on customer demand has also been better than expected, but we of course still need to get through the rest of the winter. Sales in the Americas was again strong with especially good growth across product inspection and food retail. Finally, Asia and the rest of the world had another quarter of good growth, led by our lab business. China grew 11% with particularly strong growth in lab.  Switching now to our service business, we continue to see excellent momentum, and service sales grew 11% in the quarter and 12% for the year. Service remains an important contributor to our profits and a key advantage versus our competition. Also, customers that use our service are more likely to buy instruments from us again in the future. Given the importance of our service business, I\u2019d like to share with you more details on our strategy and initiatives. To start off, as a reminder, service represents 20% of our revenues and is a key part of our solution offering. Our service offering is comprehensive and includes installation, qualification, calibration, preventative maintenance, spare parts and repair services. Over 50% of our service represent service contracts that support our customers\u2019 ability to maintain uptime, improve productivity, and comply with regulatory requirements. An important piece of our business is calibration services, and our comprehensive and audit-proof electronic calibration certificates are fully traceable and available on demand from a secure database. This makes it very easy for our customers to comply with regulatory requirements. We have very strong competitive advantages with our service business and excellent opportunities to accelerate our growth. We believe we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world and the largest service network across our direct competitors with over 3,000 service technicians around the world. We have a stand-up global service offering with dedicated service sales experts. This global coverage is increasingly important as customers look for consistent service around the world. Our ability to serve customers during the pandemic has proven to be a strong competitive advantage and our service offering was especially important to customers in regulated environments. The introduction of new service levels, 24/7 support, and remote diagnostics have been helpful in supporting customers. We have seen continued improvement in our net promoter scores in recent years and throughout 2022, which measure customer satisfaction after a service event.  We are focused on accelerating our service growth given these competitive advantages and strong customer satisfaction, and over the medium term would expect our service sales to outpace our product sales. To achieve this, there are two important elements of our growth strategy besides continuously upgrading our offering : penetrating our large installed base of instruments, and selling service contracts at the point of product sale. Starting first with penetration our installed base, we have a large installed base of instruments we have sold over many years, the majority of which is not serviced by us today. To further penetrate this installed base, we use the same concepts and similar approaches with advanced big data analytics that we use when selling products but with more specific data about history, needs, current penetration, and potential of the customer. Our service telesales teams can leverage this data to run marketing campaigns based on the age, warranty, service history and projected service intervals of our instruments to generate a service lead when an instrument is most likely to require service. Additionally, we use sophisticated data analytics for sales force guidance to identify carefully selected high potential accounts for our field service sales team. Selling services contracts at the point of sales is another high priority focus for us. Over the past year, we re-vamped our sales trainings and product quoting process to automatically provide a quote for service contract at the point of sale. Productizing service has also been beneficial in providing and communicating the value of a service contract to a customer in an easy way. Providing service under a service contract is a win-win for us and the customer. It ensures high reliability and accuracy of measurement for our customers and also helps prevent costly failed experiments, poor production quality or unplanned downtime from devices that are not properly maintained or calibrated. Our technicians are able to build deeper relationships with customers and become trusted advisors. Service contracts are also a benefit for our service team as they are able to more efficiently schedule service calls weeks in advance, leveraging our territory and route planning analytics to optimize the productivity of the team. Additionally, customer satisfaction is higher for customers with service contracts, and as I said, those customers are more likely to purchase our instruments again. Overall, I feel very good with our service growth strategies that they will position us well to grow this very important and very profitable portion of our business over the coming years. As we look ahead through 2023, we expect to face continued uncertainty in the global economy and challenging multi-year sales growth comparisons. Our ability to demonstrate resilience and agility during difficult times is an important signature of our culture. I am confident we will be able to react quickly to the new challenges and opportunities that arise so we can continue to gain share and deliver solid results. That concludes our prepared remarks, and I now want to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Josh Waldman at Cleveland Research. Josh Waldman : Thanks for taking my questions. I have one for Patrick and one for Shawn, if I may. Patrick, Europe came in solidly above the low to mid single target for the fourth quarter. Just curious, any other color you can provide on what drove the upside and how durable do you think this is? Do you think it was something Mettler is doing different, or just a stronger market outlook? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes, look - we are very proud of our fourth quarter results, of course. The team performed extremely well across the regions and across the product portfolio. I would say what you have seen is again Mettler in action. We have demonstrated that we can go after the market opportunities as they arise. There has been, I would say, not much better market momentum than we predicted, but we have been really capable to act on the opportunities that are out there. Europe has performed stronger, as Shawn already indicated in his remarks. We have seen good opportunities despite the headwinds we have seen from not shipping products to Russia. Europe grew excluding Russia 13% on a best compare against the prior quarter, and again that is also driven by the fact that we really were capable to capture opportunities out there. There is not--I would say market conditions have not changed compared to what we had seen last year. We have seen some reluctance in Europe, for example, in the PI business - customers are more cautious spending dollars right now, they extend time of some of the projects, but we were able really to get everything that was out there and turning all the orders in sales. Our supply chain team executed very well getting over some of the remaining issues we had seen in the supply chain. We had really short shipment times and it all helped us to really perform extremely well in Q4. Josh Waldman : Got it, good to hear. Then Shawn, was wondering if you could walk us through the though process on the 6% local currency guide for the quarter, but reiterating the 5% for the full year. This set-up obviously implies a bit of a decel in the latter three quarters despite an easing comp. Just curious if it\u2019s something in the order book. Was there push-outs from the fourth quarter that hit in the first, or is it just Mettler being prudent? Shawn Vadala : No, I think if you look at it, of course there\u2019s an element of caution, just given that we have these difficult multi-year comparisons that we referred to, and there is uncertainty. But I think there\u2019s a couple dynamics that are important to reflect on, too. The first is that when we look at pricing in terms of the cadence of pricing, we\u2019re going to have better higher pricing in the first half of the year than the second half, but we\u2019ll probably have better volume growth in the second half of the year versus the first half, so that\u2019s one topic. Then another is we\u2019ll probably do a little bit better on the retail business in the first quarter.  Maybe this is a good time, I\u2019ll just kind of walk through the different pieces of the business and you\u2019d kind of see that retail will have a little bit of a benefit here in Q1. As we\u2019re thinking about the first quarter, we\u2019re thinking about mid-single digit growth in lab and we\u2019re thinking mid to high single digit growth for the full year. For core industrial, we\u2019re thinking mid single digit growth for Q1 and we\u2019re also thinking low to mid single digit growth for the full year. We\u2019re thinking product inspection mid single digit growth for Q1 and low to mid single digit growth for the full year, and then here we get to retail, we\u2019re looking at high teens, so we\u2019re going to benefit from strong project activity in Q1. Now keep in mind, retail is still only about 5% of our business, but you get a sense for it. But then for the full year, we\u2019re still thinking in the mid to high single digit range for retail. Then from a geographic perspective, we\u2019re looking at mid single digit for Q1 and for the full year for Americas. For Europe, we\u2019re looking at mid single digit for Q1 and low single digit for the full year, so that\u2019s us being maybe a little bit cautious on Europe and also acknowledging multi-year comparisons, especially if you exclude Russia - I think we grew 13% in the fourth quarter of this past year. Then for China, we\u2019re looking at mid single digit growth for Q1 and high single digit growth for the full year. Josh Waldman : Got it, really helpful. Appreciate all the detail. Shawn Vadala : Yes, thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Dan Arias at Stifel. Dan Arias : Morning guys, thanks for the questions. Shawn, maybe just on your last point there on China, can you just talk a little bit about the transition from first half of the year headwinds from COVID to something that looks like presumably a step-up in the back half of the year? I\u2019d be particularly interested in your thoughts around stimulus dollars in China. Some of our companies have just been more emphatic about the impact there that you might see than others, so would just love to get your two cents. Shawn Vadala : Yes, thanks Dan. Maybe a few comments. One, we\u2019re very pleased with the quarter we\u2019re coming off - you know, 11% growth in China, and then when we look at China for 2023, we feel very good but we\u2019re coming off two very strong years. We grew 14% in 2022 but we grew 25% in 2021, so that\u2019s always on our mind and I\u2019d like to remind everybody of that. But as we look at the cadence for this year, very pleased with how the team was able to manage through different dynamics with COVID. We\u2019ve always said that things can change quickly in China, and this is another example with the reopening. We had quite a bit of the organization infected with COVID around the holidays, but we\u2019ve been back up in terms of full capacity now for a few weeks, I\u2019d say, and things are back to normal. Of course, they just also came off the Chinese New Year as well, so we\u2019re actually looking at it quite favorably in terms of the reopening. There could be some short term uncertainty in terms of what it could mean to certain customer segments, but as we kind of look to the second half of the year, certainly there could be--you know, we\u2019re looking at higher growth in the second half of the year than we\u2019re looking at for the first half. Then in terms of stimulus, I think we\u2019re all looking forward to what comes out here over the next month in terms of the magnitude of stimulus, but our expectations certainly are that stimulus dollars will be most likely directed towards a lot of the programs under the five-year plan, and then I\u2019m sure some of these strategic industries within the country will also benefit as well too. We continue to see really good momentum in a lot of these hot segments, like lithium batteries, like semiconductors, and then just these overall arching trends towards automation and digitalization continue to play out well. We continue to feel like we\u2019re very well positioned for China for the medium to long term. Of course, in the short term, always a little bit more difficult to call, but I\u2019d say that\u2019s it. Patrick, any other comments from your side? Patrick Kaltenbach : No, I think you covered it really well. Again, we have a strong team in China, a long history in China. The team has executed very well using the same go-to-market strategies and tools that we used in the rest of the world very efficiently. As you said, I\u2019m very confident about the mid to long term performance in China, and who knows what\u2019s coming out of any stimulus. It might be a bit more biased towards the real estate market - we don\u2019t know yet, but I think it will also cover a good part of the five-year plan, which means investing into health, investing into important technologies where we all play well. Dan Arias : Yes, okay. Thank you for that. Then just maybe on pricing, Shawn, I don\u2019t know if I missed it, but did you give the refreshed price realization assumption that you\u2019re making for the year, and then as you\u2019re dialing in your pricing expectations for \u201923, I\u2019m just curious if there are business segments or geographies that maybe we should think of as being more or less than the company average when it comes to realization, or do you think that everyone kind of just moves up in sort of the same range? Shawn Vadala : Yes, I mean, our guidance for the full year is unchanged at 4%. I would say we actually finished the year a little bit better than what we were expecting. We had a very strong finish in Q4 with something in more the 7% kind of range, and so we\u2019ll probably get off to--I expect to get off to a good start here in Q1 with something more in maybe the 6% kind of range, but then we\u2019ll kind of moderate into the second half of the year as we start lapping a lot of these pricing actions that we did to combat inflation during the course of 2022. In terms of differentiation, I\u2019d say lab always does--nothing significant to point out, but I\u2019d say lab tends to do a little bit better than the rest of the portfolio, and then we tend to do maybe a little bit better in the developed countries than we do in the emerging countries. Dan Arias : Okay, very good. Thank you guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Jack Meehan at Nephron Research. Mr. Meehan, your line is open. You may be muted. Jack Meehan : Sorry, I was muted. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the product inspection business, so 9% core, nice beat versus the guide, and I think the CAGR accelerated in the year end too. The service piece is usually pretty steady. I was just curious if you could talk about the trends there, what you\u2019re seeing on service versus the product side - was there any acceleration? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes, I can cover this. Good morning Jack. Look, as you said, we are really, really happy with the performance of product inspection in the fourth quarter. We gained momentum. I think we were a bit more cautious getting into the quarter but we saw especially good momentum in the U.S. and a bit better performance than expected in Europe, but we are still cautious, as I said before, about Europe. Of course, increasing our installed based on products will continue to drive also more service business. Service is a really important part of that, and our service coverage, especially in the U.S., is exceptional compared to many of our competitors and gives us a clear advantage in product inspection. We continue to build out our service offering in terms of the level of services we can provide also for this product portfolio, and again as we also launch new products, including now also more mid-range products addressing more of the mid-market needs of products, we are also going after more market share with instrumentation which will afterwards continue to drive more services. The area, the region where we had probably still more happen was also in China. Given COVID-19, there was not a lot of momentum in PI in the fourth quarter. While we saw some good adoption of the new product that we launched for mid-range, overall the market there was still suffering from the pandemic. But also there, I would say moving forward, we see opportunity of course of building more market momentum in that domain as well, but the U.S. is by far the biggest and most important market and very well covered by our service business there, of course. Europe is the second biggest part and continuing to build out also China and Asia-Pacific. Shawn Vadala : In terms of trends, we saw improvement both in service and the product business, Jack, kind of going from Q3 to Q4, but service has been growing faster than product this year. Jack Meehan : Got it. Then just one probably minor point on the 2023 outlook by segment, in lab, I think previously you were talking about mid to high single digit growth, now mid single digit. Was there anything that softened a little bit, or just anything you would call out there? Shawn Vadala : For lab, we\u2019re talking--if I said it incorrectly, I apologize. We expect to grow mid to high single digits for the full year, which is consistent with what we said before. For Q1, we\u2019re at mid single digit, and Q1 is going to be a little bit impacted by some of the topics like pipette tips and customer stocking, so. Jack Meehan : Sorry, I may have mis-heard. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hey guys, congrats on the strong finish here, and thanks for taking my question. I guess my first question is on the Q1 guidance. Did I hear you correctly, Shawn, that pricing has six points in Q1 and the guidance is 6%? That implies zero volume. It seems a little conservative. Maybe talk about the Q1 assumptions. Shawn Vadala : Yes, I think we--if you look at it, we\u2019ve always been concerned a bit by multi-year comparisons and uncertainty in the macro, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really that different than what we\u2019ve been saying about the full year results. I think right now, it\u2019s a new year, we\u2019re very early in the year. I think we need to see how the next couple months play out and then we\u2019ll be able to have a lot more insight in terms of how not only the first quarter went but how the year starts to have--what kind of momentum we have going into Q2 and the rest of the year. Vijay Kumar : Understood. Then one on cash flows here, it looks like free cash flows came in below your guidance for fiscal \u201922. I\u2019m curious, was that just a timing element, and I\u2019m looking at your guidance here for fiscal \u201923 - $900 million, is that benefiting from some timing elements here, or any cadence on free cash flows? Shawn Vadala : Yes, good question. Our free cash flow, you might not remember but we updated our guidance for that last quarter, so we actually came in line with our revised guidance from last quarter and we revised down 2022 primarily because we were carrying more inventory in--or we carried more inventory in 2022, giving more safety stocks just to kind of mitigate some of the challenges in the global supply chain. As we look towards 2023, we expect to benefit and reduce a lot of those inventory levels, and so you\u2019ll see from a one-year growth perspective, you\u2019ll see pretty significant growth but a lot of it has to do with timing of working capital. Vijay Kumar : Understood, thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Daley at Wells Fargo. Tim Daley : Great, thanks. Appreciate the detail on the service side, but just want to dig a bit into consumables. What was the consumable growth in the quarter and the year, and then can you help quantify the size and the timing of the two major one-off headwinds Mettler is facing in \u201923 around the pipette tip business, particularly the roll-off of the DoD contract and then that inventory stock dynamic? Shawn Vadala : Yes, so our consumables business, in terms of total mix on the business, is about 10% in the quarter. For the full year, it was about 12% of our business. Consumables, as a reminder for everybody, about half of that is probably pipette tips and then the other half is a combination of process analytic sensors, as well as other consumables for other categories. As a total group, consumables were down about 5% in the quarter, and for the full year they were up 5%. But if you kind of dug into the details, of course, the one area where we saw a decline was pipette tips, which would have been down over 20% in the quarter, and that\u2019s topic related to customer stocking that you\u2019ve heard about from other companies. Fortunately for us, it\u2019s not a significant impact to our overall results, and we\u2019ll probably continue to see that trend play out here in the first quarter and maybe even in the Q2. Tim Daley : All right, appreciate that. Then my second one on margins, I think the guidance implies about 120-ish basis points from operating margin expansion. Can you help us understand how we should think about the pieces of growth versus SG&A, R&D? Just additional help here would be great. Shawn Vadala : Yes, sure. If we look at our--you know, rather than going through each line, maybe I\u2019ll give you a little bit of flavor in terms of gross profit and then, of course, there\u2019s a lot of other ingredients in terms of R&D and SG&A. But in terms of the first quarter, we\u2019re looking at gross margin expansion of about 140 basis points, and for the full year we\u2019re looking at about 100 basis points, so that number is a little bit lower than the last time we spoke and the reason is it purely--you know, almost entirely related to just currency translation. On a currency neutral basis, it\u2019s pretty consistent with our previous guidance. Then for the full year, our operating margin\u2019s up 190 basis points, and then for the full year we\u2019re estimating about 130 basis points. Tim Daley : Great, thank you. Shawn Vadala : Yes, you\u2019re welcome. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Matt Sykes at Goldman Sachs. Matt Sykes : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.  Patrick, maybe just on the services business that you talked about on the call, just reflecting back from the investor day, you talked about that services mix being about 50/50, contract versus value-added services. Could you just maybe talk about the importance of that mix shift as you move forward and where you see that mix over the medium term developing into? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes, thanks Matt. Really good question. Yes, as I pointed out at the investor day, it is important for us to continue to drive that mix more towards services on a contract, and the team is working hard on that, the telesales team and the sales team of course, working on continuously also bringing new--our new service story to our customers, including the new service offerings that we have, ensuring that our sales team and our customers understand the benefits of being under contract, what it means to them in terms of preventative maintenance, of uptime, response demand for service, 24/7 availability, etc. I see actually good momentum. I think we have made good progress over the last two years or three years in moving more of our services under contract, and it starts always at the point of sale, making sure that when we sell a product, we can have--our sales person can have an educated discussion with the customer of the benefits of being under contract. At the same time, we have increased the portfolio of services that we offer, as I mentioned before, from basic to comprehensive services, and that makes it also easier and more attractive to our customers to select a service contract. I see the shift ongoing and we are working on that, because in the end, it\u2019s again a big win-win for both the customers and ourselves. As I said, we have the data analytics behind it, we know that customers under service contract are more likely to buy from us again because they have seen the full benefit of our offering, and for us it also helps us, of course, to drive more efficiency in services. It helps us to be more effective in scheduling services, making sure we optimize the coverage of our service and the timing when we can do services, and make sure the service technicians that we have are working most efficiently. Expect a continued increase there in terms of service coverage. It\u2019s again beneficial both for us as a company but also a strong win for the customer. Matt Sykes : Got it, and then just maybe a follow-up, just staying on services, Patrick, you mentioned that the majority of instruments are not serviced by Mettler. Maybe if you could give us a little bit more color on what that percentage is and where you think that could go to. Then Shawn, just given that services--and you commented that it\u2019s going to be growing faster than group, and I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s higher margin. Could you talk about the medium term impact on margins from a larger services business over the next few years? Shawn Vadala : Yes, sure. Maybe I\u2019ll go first, then I\u2019ll let Patrick go second. I\u2019d say I don\u2019t have it quantified in terms of precision, but you\u2019re right - we expect our service business to grow faster than our product business over the medium to long term, and our service business has operating margins that are higher than our corporate average. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes, and back to your question regarding the service opportunity overall, of course we have millions of instruments in our database and that is a very competitive advantage for us to have that visibility. Our served market for services is over $3 billion, so we have significant opportunity to expand our market share in there as well. If you look at the total share of instruments of the installed base, of course you never know--we know to a good extent about which instruments are still under operation and then, based on the lifetime inspections and the database we have for instruments, we make some assumptions in terms of how many instruments otherwise would be still operational, but we think it\u2019s probably more than 60% of the instruments out there are not yet under full service coverage from us. Matt Sykes : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard at Jefferies. Brandon Couillard : Hey thanks, good morning. Just a couple for you, Shawn. Could you just split out lab versus industrial in China in the quarter, and then those two sub-segments, what you\u2019re anticipating for the year? Any bifurcation between those two markets? Shawn Vadala : Yes, sure Brandon. For Q4, lab was up over--I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m looking at the wrong year here, but still good results. Lab was up about 20% in the fourth quarter and industrial was up low single digits. As we look towards 2023, we\u2019re expecting double digit growth in lab for the first quarter and the full year, and we\u2019re expecting industrial to be more flattish, you can imagine more impacted by some of the disruptions over the last few months. Then for the full year, we\u2019re a little bit more conservative there with low to mid single digit growth, so obviously expecting more growth in the second half of the year. Brandon Couillard : Got it, and then on the lab business globally, are you able to quantify the impact of the pipette declines on that segment in the quarter? I imagine it must have been maybe at least a point. Then Patrick, you mentioned lithium batteries, just help us understand what areas of the portfolio are serving that market. Shawn Vadala : Yes, so for the quarter, Brandon, if you play out the math, the data points that I kind of mentioned earlier, that\u2019s probably in the 1% or so to the group, so it probably would have been in the 2% or more to the lab division and probably looking at similar type trends here in the first quarter. Then at some point, we expect it to stabilize during the second quarter. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes, let me add there, Shawn. On the pipette business itself, we have seen good growth on pipette instruments also in Q3 and throughout 2022, and also we see continued good growth in service pipette business, so it\u2019s really the pipette tip business that has been suffering, and that\u2019s of course also due to the ramp down of testing, etc. out there.  With the increased number of instruments that we sell, single use pipettes, etc., and the increased service business, I think we are quite confident that as we see the demand for pipettes, that also the demand for pipette tips will continue to go up. Brandon Couillard : Great, thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Catherine Schulte at Baird. Catherine Schulte : Hey guys, thanks for the question. I guess first, I wanted to go back to the services business. You talked on the penetration side in Matt\u2019s question, but on the other area of opportunity you mentioned of selling contracts at the point of sale, can you just elaborate on what your attach rate is today and where you\u2019d like to see that go over the next few years and longer term? Patrick Kaltenbach : What we are working on, Catherine, what we are working on is, again, continued increase of the attach rate. What we changed last year is the entire quoting process. Before, our sales people had to actively quote services and had to look up in a catalog what services we could offer, what dedicated products. Now, it\u2019s an automatic part of the quoting process, and if a sales person wouldn\u2019t be able to sell services, they also have to give us some justification why they couldn\u2019t, and that also helps us then to improve again the marketing collateral behind services and making sure that we make a better job of selling the value of services. We continue to really make sure that we pull all levers to make sure our customers understand the benefit of service contracts. The overall attach rate, I think is in the range of--it\u2019s actually hard to say, I\u2019ll have to look up that number and get back to you, probably on one of the next calls. But for me, the most important message, really, is that we continue to see an increase. Catherine Schulte : All right, great. Then on Europe, you mentioned there\u2019s maybe some conservatism in your low single digit guide for the year. What do you view as the swing factor there - is it mostly on the packaged food side, or are there other areas where you\u2019re trying to be a bit more prudent as you start that initial guide? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes, I think it\u2019s multiple factors. Packaged food is definitely one of them, clearly, again because this is high capex investment and it\u2019s one of the few product categories where it\u2019s really more in the high capex side. But we also have seen some of our customers being more reluctant, and we have seen this in Q4 and we see this continuing into Q1. They are all looking at the market situation right now and they all want to see how it plays out. Fortunately, as I said, the impact of a potential energy shortage in Europe has not yet played out, and hopefully we will get through the winter without some major issues and that will then hopefully also increase overall market confidence.  Otherwise in the European market, for us it\u2019s also--look, we have been very successful over the last couple of years. We also have been quite successful in Q4, so in the second half will also be a tougher compare for us. That\u2019s why we are thinking currently about for Europe more in the low single digits for 2023. Catherine Schulte : Great, thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Michael Ryskin at Bank of America. Michael Ryskin : Great, thanks for taking the question. This is Mike on for Derik de Bruin.  Sorry if I missed this earlier, but I want to drill a little bit into core industrial. I know you kind of anticipated a little bit of a step-down in the fourth quarter, but it still seems like a sequential decline from the first three quarters of the year where you had really strong 10% growth, and then looking at your guide for low to mid single for 2023, anything in particular you\u2019d want to call out, how that\u2019s trending? Is that mostly a reflection of macro or how much conservatism is built into that? Are you seeing any change in order patterns with those customers or is there anything by geo you could call out there? Thanks. Shawn Vadala : Yes, I\u2019d say we\u2019re coming off a period of a lot of growth in that business, Mike. We still feel really good, though - the business is well positioned, it\u2019s a better mix of business than it used to be. Like we\u2019ve talked a lot about over the past year, a lot more in what we would call the more attractive segments of the market, like more anchored towards pharma, food manufacturing and chemical, which is primarily speciality chemical for us. This business also benefits from some of these hot segments that we talk about, like lithium battery, and then just these trends in automation and digitalization, which we continue to see really holding up during a deteriorating macro environment over the last few months. Historically, it is the business that\u2019s most susceptible to the macro, so we still keep an eye on it. We were really pleased in the fourth quarter that we saw good growth in each region, which I think is good. It\u2019s important to see each region of the world growing, but we\u2019re certainly a little bit more cautious as we kind of look to 2023 - it\u2019s early in the year. China is a big part of this business, so I think it will be important for us to get through the first quarter, see how things look, and then we\u2019ll have maybe some better visibility into the rest of the year. Michael Ryskin : Okay, that\u2019s fair. Maybe just a follow-up, tying up a loose end on modeling - the 18.5 tax rate, is that a one-year dynamic for 2023 or is it safe for us to assume that going forward beyond? Shawn Vadala : Yes, so it\u2019s at least a two-year dynamic. We took it down for 2022. We feel comfortable we can hold it for 2023. As we look to 2024, I think there could be some upward pressure on the rate. It\u2019s still a little early for us to kind of communicate anything, but it could be something in the 1% to 2% kind of range. But we\u2019ll obviously know a lot more towards the end of this year and when we provide guidance for next year. Michael Ryskin : Great, thanks so much. Congrats on the quarter again. Shawn Vadala : Yes, thank you. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Liza Garcia at UBS. Liza Garcia : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Kind of an opex question on kind of how to think about [indiscernible], maybe diving in there a little bit. So R&D up 7% in local currency in the quarter, obviously you offset that with SG&A declines. As we think about broader--your investment strategy, how should we think about the R&D line and kind of modeling that out? Patrick Kaltenbach : I\u2019ll get started on this. Look, actually I\u2019m very proud that we really have a lot of opportunities in our business to drive more products to the market, and the success of our business really also relies on driving innovation to market. This year we brought a lot of great products to the market, helping our customers in the domain of automation, digitalization, compliance, etc., both on the hardware and software portfolio that we launched.  We actually launched internally a program that we call our accelerator program, where we look at our pipeline of R&D projects that we have across the company and selected a number of really high potential projects that we are accelerated with additional funding, and that\u2019s part of the increase that you also see there on the R&D line.  Again for us, on the leadership team, we\u2019ve made a very conscious decision, saying using the success that we have as a company to accelerate products and bringing even more horsepower to the street and making sure that we get stuff to our customers which we know will help them to drive more productivity, help them to drive better insights into the research they are doing, and I\u2019m actually really excited and really proud that we could do that. Liza Garcia : Great. I know obviously the Mettler story has been predominantly organic, but you\u2019ve definitely made some notable tuck-ins, like PendoTECH, Biotix. Can you just provide me the update on the M&A environment and what you\u2019re seeing in the market, maybe in terms of incremental opportunities to enhance the portfolio? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes, very good question, Liza. On M&A, we didn\u2019t change our strategy at all. We are still looking at tuck-in acquisitions, bolt-on acquisitions that complement us both--either on the technology side, technology that we do not own today but think is important for us to complement our portfolio, or giving us market access in areas where we don\u2019t play PendoTECH was an example of that, where we said we wanted to go more into downstream bioprocessing and have the right solutions for our customers. We also made last year a strategic acquisition in the area of software, complementing our autochem business with Scale-up Systems, which is a very important software capability for us to help customers scaling up from R&D to manufacturing. It gives us really also a unique value proposition there.  Then end of the year, we acquired also a smaller lab business called [indiscernible] in Germany, $10 million revenues, but also with products that we think really we should have in the portfolio, and that\u2019s the way I envision to continue this. We really look for the right opportunities. Given the strength we have as a business, we can be very selective in what companies we want to acquire. I think Mettler is a leader with an outstanding platform for these companies who look for either global access to market, which we have, or for the strength that we have in terms of supply chain to help them to really accelerate their go-to-market, but it needs to be really something that is missing in our portfolio.  We don\u2019t have to make M&A to grow. We have a strong organic engine, but I\u2019m very interested of course in opportunities to get us into the fast growing market segments, like we have in biopharma for example. It was one of the reasons why we acquired PendoTECH. Liza Garcia : Great, thanks so much. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Rachel Vatnsdal with JP Morgan. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great, thanks for taking my questions, guys, and congrats on the quarter. I wanted to follow up about some of the earlier questions around the consumables dynamic and some of the pipette inventory stocking as well. You flagged that consumables were down 5% during 4Q due to that pipette dynamic, so can you just walk us through your expectations for consumables growth in the first quarter and then for the full year?  Then kind of within that, what\u2019s embedded for that consumables growth between pricing versus volume? Shawn Vadala : Yes, hey Rachel. I don\u2019t have the specific breakout for the full year. I would say I\u2019d probably expect to see a similar result in Q1 as we saw here in Q4 overall for consumables, then I would certainly expect to see some growth in the second half of the year. But I don\u2019t have anything specific in mind in terms of exactly what that would be, but definitely would expect us to return to growth in the second half of the year. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes, absolutely Shawn, and think again, as I said before, some good indicators for us is the demand for our pipette itself, for the instruments. It should give us continued growth. We are playing very well in the biopharma research space with our product portfolio, so the COVID tailwinds, I think will hopefully not be any topic for us as we go into the second half of the year. The rest of the portfolio that we have in consumables, the sensors that go into biopharma, some of their probe sensors or even some of the lab products, have consumables. They are still doing quite well. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great, and then maybe a quick one here, just on on-shoring. You guys have talked about the on-shoring and near-shoring dynamic being a tailwind for Mettler. Can you just talk about your latest expectations on where you could see that impact the portfolio? Obviously there\u2019s some debate going on around the U.S. budget here locally, so how are you kind of embedding that into expectations in the near and medium term as well? Thank you. Shawn Vadala : We still see that as a really good opportunity for the company in the medium to long term, but in terms of 2023, we didn\u2019t really build anything specific into our guidance. Operator : We\u2019ll take our final question from Patrick Donnelly at Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Hey guys, thanks for fitting me in. Maybe just one, obviously a lot of ground covered here. Shawn, maybe on the supply chain in general, you talked about inventory, obviously you ran a little high in \u201922 because of some of the stocking impacts. Can you just talk about expectations to kind of wind that down? Are you seeing normalization in the supply chain? Some thoughts on how you\u2019re thinking about that piece. Shawn Vadala : Yes, thanks Patrick. I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll let Patrick maybe a few comments as well too here. But yes, we definitely have seen a lot of improvement in the supply chain, in particular on the transportation side, like just the time to go from one country to another is--the lead times are, I think, pretty close to back to normal at this point in time, so that\u2019s been great. Then in terms of availability of components, there\u2019s still a topic here or there, but I\u2019d say the noise level is significantly lower than what we were seeing six months ago. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes, absolutely. I only can confirm that semiconductor issues that we talked about last year are mostly behind us with very few exceptions. The team has been also very agile to change some of the designs of the instruments so we are not so dependent on some of the exotic components there. But clearly, our supply chain is--I would say it\u2019s almost back to normal in terms of transportation times, availability of materials, and that should not get in our way to make a successful business in 2023. Shawn Vadala : Maybe just one final comment on that one is we\u2019re really proud of our team. The supply chain, I think really has been a competitive advantage for us over the last few years, and just the collaboration around the global organization and the culture has just been really amazing to observe from the inside. I think it, frankly, helped us gain some share along the way and enhance our brand. Patrick Kaltenbach : Absolutely. Operator : That does conclude the question and answer session and today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Let me now turn the call over to Patrick. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks, Adam, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. Last night, we reported our first quarter earnings results and I'm happy to share that we have started the year off strong, with very good sales and profit growth. The details of our financials are outlined for you on page three of our presentation. Our sales growth was again broad-based this quarter, as our team effectively leveraged [indiscernible] to identify attractive growth opportunities across a wide variety of markets. I'm also pleased with the strong execution from our team on our margin initiatives and cost control, which resulted in solid earnings growth on top of excellent results in the prior year, despite a very significant currency headwind. Our outlook for the year is largely unchanged from what we have provided earlier this year, although there is increased uncertainty in the economy and our end markets. However, I'm convinced that our team will continue to capitalize on growth opportunities and manage our cost effectively to help us live with solid results for the year. Let me now turn the call over to Shawn to cover the financial results and our guidance. And then, I will come back with some additional commentary on the business and our outlook. Shawn? Shawn Vadala : Thanks, Patrick, and good morning everyone. Sales in the quarter were $928.7 million, which represented a local currency increase of 7%. On a US dollar basis, sales increased 3% as currency reduced sales growth by 4%. We estimate that the impact of not shipping to Russia was a headwind of almost 1% to sales growth. On slide number four, we show sales growth by region. We had broad-based sales growth in Q1 as local currency sales increased 6% in both the Americas and in Europe and 10% in Asia/Rest of the World. Excluding Russia, our sales growth in Europe grew 9%. Local currency sales increased 9% in China in the quarter. On slide number five, we summarize local currency sales growth by product area. For the quarter, lab sales increased 5%, industrial increased 7%, with core industrial and product inspection, both up 7%. Food Retail grew 36% in the quarter, as we benefited from significant project activity in prior year comparisons. Let me now move to the rest of the P&L, which is summarized on slide number six. Gross margin was 58.9%, an increase of a 100 basis points, as pricing was partially offset by higher cost, business mix and currency. R&D amounted to $45.5 million in the quarter, which is a 9% increase in local currency over the prior year, reflecting increased project activity. SG&A amounted to $234.6 million, a 2% increase in local currency over the prior year. Adjusted operating profit amounted to $266.5 million in the quarter, a 10% increase. Currency reduced operating profit growth by approximately 7%. Adjusted operating margin was 28.7% which represents an increase of 180 basis points over the prior year. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $17.8 million in the quarter, interest expense was $18.2 million and other income amounted to $0.4 million. Our effective tax rate was 18.5% in the quarter. This rate is before discrete items and adjusting for the timing of stock option exercises in the quarter and we expect to maintain this rate for the full year. Fully diluted shares amounted to $22.3 million which is approximately a 3.5% decline from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $8.69, a 10% increase over the prior year or an 18% increase excluding unfavorable currency. On a reported basis in the quarter, EPS was $8.47 as compared to $7.55 in the prior year. Reported EPS in the quarter includes $0.23 of purchased intangible amortization and $0.16 of restructuring costs. We also had a $0.17 headwind due to the difference between our quarterly and annual tax rate due to the timing of stock option exercises that normalizes in the fourth quarter of every year. That covers the P&L and let me now comment on cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $135.3 million, up $60 million helped by better inventory and accounts receivable trends as well as lower incentive payments. DSO was 38 days while ITO was 3.6x. Let me now turn to guidance. To start off forecasting remains challenging and market conditions remain dynamic. As previously mentioned, there is uncertainty in the economy and our end markets. We're basing our guidance for the second quarter and the full year assuming market conditions remain as they are today. For the second quarter, we expect approximately 3% local currency sales growth. This level of growth reflects the challenging multiyear sales growth comparisons we faced in the second quarter as well as a growth headwind of approximately 2% from reduced sales in our pipette business. We expect second quarter adjusted EPS to be in the range of $9.90 to $10 representing a growth rate of 5% to 7% or 10% to 11% excluding unfavorable foreign currency. For the full year 2023, we have left our local currency sales growth guidance of approximately 5% unchanged. We expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $43.65 to $43.95 representing a growth rate of approximate -- of about 10% to 11% or approximately 12% to 13% excluding unfavorable foreign currency. This compares to our previous guidance of adjusted EPS in the range of $43.55 to $43.95. Total amortization including purchased intangible amortization is forecast to be $72 million. Purchased intangible amortization is excluded from adjusted EPS and is estimated at $26 million on a pre-tax basis or $0.92 per share. Now let's turn to cash flow. For 2023 we continue to expect free cash flow in the range of $900 million and we still expect to repurchase approximately $1 billion of our shares this year. That's it from my side and I'll now turn it back to Patrick. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks, Shawn. Let me start with some comments on our operating businesses starting with Lab which had good growth in the quarter considering challenging prior year comparisons. We also had a larger-than-expected sales decline in our pipette business as customers continue to work down their inventories. We believe this headwind will continue in the second quarter and ease in the second half of the year. Outside of pipette, we had strong growth across most of our portfolio particularly as our team pursues growth opportunities in hot segments like lithium-ion batteries and sustainable polymers among others. Turning now to our Industrial business. We had very strong growth across our core industrial products this quarter as we continue to benefit from strong demand for our solutions that automate customer processes and enhance productivity. Product inspection also had a strong quarter as it capitalized on stronger demand from food manufacturers in the Americas, while we experienced only modest growth in Europe. While we are pleased with the good start to the year, our core industrial business is also not immune from the economy and we expect softer results in product inspection as these customers face increased headwinds and we expect lower growth for the remainder of the year. Finally, Food Retail delivered very strong growth this quarter due to robust project activity in the Americas and Europe. Comparisons were also favorable as sales declined 14% in the first quarter of last year. Our Food Retail sales can be lumpy depending on our customers' project activity and we would expect lower growth rates for the remainder of the year. One final comment on the business. Service sales continued to show excellent momentum and grew 15% in the quarter. We continue to be very pleased with the growth in this important and probable part of our business. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales in Europe increased 6% in the quarter or 9% excluding the impact of stopping shipments to Russia. Sales growth this quarter benefited from very strong growth from our food retail business as well as strong growth in our core industrial businesses offset in part by a significant decline in pipette. Sales in the Americas was solid with strong growth across most of our businesses, especially, Food Retail offset in part by a significant decline in pipette. And finally Asia and the Rest of the World had another quarter of good growth led by the Lab business. China grew 9% against very strong prior year growth rates with particular strong growth in Lab. Now speaking of China at the end of March I traveled to visit our operations in China and I couldn't be more excited about the strength of the team we have in place and the substantial opportunity ahead of us. I'd like to share a few some additional insights on our business in China and why we are quite optimistic about our long-term growth opportunity there. First as an overview we have a very long track record of operations in China using wholly owned subsidiaries there for more than 35 years. China represents 21% of our total global sales and we design manufacture and distribute products in China for the local market. We have three manufacturing locations in China representing approximately one-third of our global production again over half of which is sold into the local market. China and the other emerging markets have historically been an important source of growth for our company and we believe this will be a source of future growth. Our business in China overall has grown at a 13% CAGR over the last 20 years including 14% growth in 2022 as the mix of our business has shifted to faster growing and more resilient industries. Customers in China increasingly seek out our most advanced solutions where we have a very strong competitive advantage and leverage our unique go-to-market approaches. Our portfolio is extremely well-positioned to serve the demand for automated solutions -- automation solutions drive for productivity aims to help ensure compliance. We also benefit from the government's focus on developing a broader life sciences industry and other strategic market segments. Our colleagues in China are very agile to respond to local market needs with local application development and support of China-specific demand. We leveraged this unique approach with our Spinnaker sales and marketing programs to capture growth in hot segments like lithium-ion batteries and I visited a large battery customer and saw firsthand how massive these investments in e-mobility and stationary power solutions are but also how our solutions are excellently positioned to provide substantial value to this rapidly growing industry. Overall, our business in China remained strong during the first quarter and our outlook for Q2 is also positive despite challenging multiyear comparisons. We see continued investments in key segments like lithium-ion batteries, pharma-biopharma, but also healthy investments in industry as our customers look to reduce direct labor and improve productivity with automation investments. I would note that market sentiment is also optimistic in anticipation of potential further government investments to support growth segments like e-mobility, expanding R&D capabilities with new labs and long-term investments in pharma-biopharma to support better healthcare. Details of these are still limited, but I would note that the government has announced structural changes in its organization responsible for accelerating the pace of scientific development, highlighting the emphasis being placed on this important topic. As we think about these trends and how the impact of our business in China, we remain optimistic about our long-term growth opportunity in the region and would expect our business in China to grow at a faster pace than the overall business. However, as we always like to remind everyone, while we are optimistic for the long-term and for 2023, China has historically been a more volatile market and things can change quickly in the short-term. In China, like the rest of the world, we believe our unique growth strategies, tremendous diversity and culture of operational excellence and agility position us very well to gain market share and deliver solid financial results in 2023. Now that concludes our prepared remarks. And now we would like to open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Josh Waldman with Cleveland. Josh Waldman : Morning guys. Thanks for all the detail, and thanks for taking my questions. One for Shawn and then one for Patrick. Shawn, I wanted to start on the near-term organic growth guide and the implications for the quarterly cadence for the full year. Curious how the 3% local currency guide for Q2 compares to what you had previously penciled in for your full year assumptions? And then are there factors beyond destocking that have come into play since your last guide, they're leaving you more cautious on the second quarter? Shawn Vadala : Yeah, sure. Thanks Josh. So I think as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, destocking is a factor in Q2. So if you look at our 3% -- the decline that we expect in pipette specifically in the second quarter reduces our growth by about 2%. So excluding that headwind, our growth would be 5% and I think another important thing to comment on for the second quarter is that I think it's important to look at the multiyear comparison. So if we look back the last couple of years, our three-year CAGR with the 3% is about 13% growth. So that's a CAGR of 13% and that's actually very similar to what we did in Q1 of this year with the 7% growth. So again to put that in perspective that we grew on top of 10% last year, but that 10% growth was on top of 27% in the prior year. So that very much is weighing on us as we think about the business. And then maybe to just, kind of, like walk through our typical guidance by business area and region. I can go through that quickly. So when we look at the lab business, we're looking at low single-digit growth in the second quarter. Keep in mind, of course, lab is dealing with this headwind in the pipette business. So that headwind for Q2 is probably estimated in the 4% a range for the lab business, so it would be high single digit excluding that. And then for the full year, we're now looking at mid-single digit for the lab business and that's down a little bit from what we were thinking before because this headwind was a little bit more than expected when you look at the first quarter results of 7% that includes about a 2.5% headwind from the decline in the pipette business. Product inspection, we're looking at low single digit in the second quarter and then low to mid-single-digit for the full year. One of the things we're seeing in PI is we actually had a very good start to the year in PI in the Americas, but we are seeing maybe some more challenges and caution in investment activity in packaged foods. And as you can appreciate there's, a lot of headlines in that regard for that industry. For core industrial, low-single digit for the second quarter and then mid-single digit for the full year, that's on a full year basis a little bit better than what we were expecting. We're just very -- continue to be very impressed with the resilience of that business and how well we've been executing there. And then, food retailing, we're looking at mid-single digit for Q2 and then high-single digit for the full year obviously got off to a better-than-expected start with very strong project activity. And then, for the regions, we're looking at low-single digit for the Americas in Q2 and then low-to-mid-single digit for the full year. That business is a little bit more disproportionately hit with this headwind in the decline in pipette. Europe, we're looking at low-single-digit for Q2 and then low-to-mid-single-digit for the full year a little bit better than what we were looking for the full year last time we spoke given the very strong start to the year in Q1. And then, for China, we're looking at mid-single digit for Q2 and high-single digit for the full year which is consistent with what we were looking at the last time we spoke. Josh Waldman : Yeah. Got it. Appreciate all that, Shawn. And then, Patrick, I appreciate the comments on China. I wondered if you could provide a bit more context on the cadence through the quarter or maybe what you're seeing by end-market. And I guess whether or not you guys are seeing the stimulus benefits show up in the order book yet. Patrick Kaltenbach : Sure. Good morning Josh. Look, at the cadence in China, as you have seen we started off strong in Q1 with 9% growth in China, so very solid results. And that of course was a quarter where as you know we had the COVID rate at the beginning of the quarter and yet our organization really executed extremely well and delivered strong results. As Shawn mentioned, the plan of schedule right now for Q2 mid-single-digit growth for China and that is of course also based on the fact that we have very strong compares, for Q2 and then for the full year, we have China still at high single-digit growth. So that's kind of the outline in terms of growth. Now, what we are seeing there, again, we have seen very strong growth for the Lab business. Specifically for analytical instruments, the analytical business is performing really well for us and also benefits from the hot segments. Shawn made a commented on the industrial business the growth has moderated against really difficult comparisons. Again, a reminder, we grew almost 60% in industry in Q1 2021 and over 20% in Q1 2022. So those compares of course will also account for Q2 moving forward. When we break it down say where does the growth come from we still see a lot of interest in solid growth opportunities in the hot segments like, the battery manufacturing for example, it's really impressive how China is putting emphasis behind building out the industry beyond car. And I mentioned also the power grid and how they start producing large modules that it will place long power grids, next two solar power plants at to take up excess energy and keep it back at night et cetera. So I think there will be continued investment. And that goes along with the overall investment that we see in automation solutions across Lab industry. China continues to look for productivity gains. They are facing an aging workforce and the fact that they will not have enough workforces moving forward. So they're proactively really looking for automation and productivity solutions where our portfolio plays really well, that's where again our overall confidence in the China business comes from. We are extremely well positioned with the team we have. And we are confident that the long-term trends that the government wants to follow-up on them and drive growth and invest in a longer five-year China growth plan whether it's the health care, whether it's stronger research and development in China all plays very well into our portfolio. Josh Waldman : Yeah. Thanks for all the detail guys. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thank you. Operator : You next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. I was wondering if you could update us on how much pricing contributed in the quarter? And how is your full year expectation for that changed at all? Shawn Vadala : Thanks Jack. So, pricing came in pretty much as we expected in the 6% kind of a range. We expected to get off to a good start this year given all the different actions that we took last year when we were kind of mitigating inflation. And as we look to the full year we're still expecting about 4% growth for the full year. And as we look to Q2 specifically we're looking at 4% growth. And so the reason why Q2 would be lower than Q1 is because of the timing of some of the actions we put in place last year. Jack Meehan : Great. And either Shawn or Patrick can you just elaborate a little bit more on the pipette destocking that you're seeing? Just to be clear like how much of this do you think is specifically related to COVID and just how much visibility do you have into improvement in the second half of the year? Patrick Kaltenbach : I can take it. Look I mean the destocking effects not only the testing, COVID testing related markets to be honest. I mean when there was this huge demand in the market last year you should also appreciate that also the pharma biopharma customers and others really loaded up inventory because there was a shortage in the market and I think the whole industry when I talk to whole industry I say everybody who's using pipette actually is suffering from the fact now that they still have quite some inventory that they're working down. We do expect as we said this to be reduced in the second half. So, we will get more back to normal volumes in the second half but it will definitely be still a topic for Q2. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Stifel. Dan Arias : Morning guys. Thanks for the question. Shawn maybe just following on a question on pricing there. Can you kind of put a 1% volume year that's implied here with the guide in the context of prior years or prior periods where you had some macro or end market factors moving around. How often did you see flattish volume growth? And as we move through the year here what about this year makes you think that that's most likely to be true? Shawn Vadala : Well, I think what stands out this year Dan is we're just coming off of an unprecedented period of growth. I mean like the CAGRs that I mentioned before 13% CAGR for the last three years is much higher than our -- how we envision ourselves for the longer term in terms of our algorithm. So, we've always expected to see some level of moderation at some point during this year. It's hard to compare it to maybe a historical precedent but of course in 2020 we had a slower start to the year when it came to volumes during COVID and then that kind of like reversed in the second half of the year. So, I think we'll see how it plays out, but I think we have the comparisons we've been kind of in a weak macro environment for quite some time now with PMIs below 50. It's hard to -- while we're -- while we've been resilient and executing very well specific particularly in our core industrial business which has been historically more susceptible to the economy we're also not resilient, right? And so as headlines continue to come out in our end markets in particular with some of the challenges that our end markets are facing whether it be food manufacturing companies or chemical companies or other industries like biopharma, we do have a little bit of that on our mind as well. Dan Arias : Yes. Okay. And then maybe just as a follow-up small and emerging biotech is obviously getting a ton of attention these days. What would you call your exposure there? And can you kind of just describe your sensitivity to spending by that portion of the customer base? And then anything you would add to the conversation on how that's likely to evolve this year? Thanks much. Shawn Vadala : Yes, I think our overall exposure to small biotech is relatively small. Of course that affects a little bit of our rein in pipette business but it's is generally a very small part of that business. So, nothing in particular that I would call out. Adam Uhlman : Operator, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to follow-up on -- I think it was Jack's question there on the pipette side. Patrick, can you just talk about I guess the visibility into the normalization in the back half? Is it a comp dynamic? Is it customer conversations that give you some level of confidence on a normalization just given the chatter across the market about this sector? I just want to make sure we have a good feel as to what gives you guys the confidence in terms of that second half run. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Look, I think the true it's part of -- it's both, right? We, of course, look at historical data, the growth rates and the volumes we have come from. But we also, of course, are in conversations with customers and we have clear signals that Q2 will be another destocking quarter and then they should get back more to normal inventory levels, put it that way. And the overall volumes that we expect, again, will then get back to if you would normalize the growth rate over the last three, four years we would get back to that volume that we would expect for Q3 and Q4. It's a mix of calculation saying, okay, what was the underlying market growth and what is our anticipated market share gains that we have. We have a very strong pipette and pipette portfolio but even unique also to uranium business that has very strong market share, especially in the US. And if you take all these factors into account then we basically look at a picture we say, yes, we will see more headwind again in Q2 but then in Q3 in Q4 getting back to normal growth rates again. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. Understood. And Shawn maybe one following up on the pricing piece. On the margin side, can you talk about the expectations for 2Q? Obviously, the earnings came in a little light of where the Street was. And then just that similar to that ramp in the second half, just the moving pieces on the margins would be helpful. Shawn Vadala : Yes, sure. So, I think one of the things to kind of keep in mind is that, if we're looking at our gross margin, we grew about 130 basis points, excluding currency. Actually, I think it was 140 basis points excluding currency in the quarter. So that wasn't that much different on a currency-neutral basis to what we were guiding. So currency clearly had an impact. We also had a little bit of unfavorable mix in the quarter between the different businesses. Of course, pipette is a more profitable business and retail is kind of on the other side of that. As we kind of like look towards the rest of the year, we're looking at our guidance for gross margin would be about 60 basis point improvement in the second quarter, and if you exclude currency on a currency-neutral basis that would be about 100% improvement. And then for the full year, we're looking at a 70 basis point improvement and again on a currency-neutral basis, that's about 110 basis point improvement, which is just down slightly like about 10 basis points from the last time that we spoke. And then, on operating margins, we're looking at -- we got off to a very strong start to the year as we kind of expected. We're looking at about a 90 basis point improvement in the second quarter. And again, on a currency-neutral basis that would be about a 180 basis point improvement, so again, another very good number to start the year. And then for the full year, we're still looking at about 130 basis point improvement, which is similar to last time but what's a little bit different is that we on a currency-neutral basis were up about 200 basis points. So that's gotten a lot better. Patrick Donnelly : Understood. Thanks for the color. Shawn Vadala : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe my first one Patrick here. I think you've made some comments on the macro environment. It seems like a bit more cautious tone on this call, but I see your industrial outlook did not change. So when you say, macro taking a more cautious tone, can you give us a sense for -- is this specific regions or perhaps end markets, because industrial is where I would have expected perhaps some change but when you look at the guidance all of the change came from Labs, so how should we think about the macro commentary? Patrick Kaltenbach : Sure. Very good question, Vijay. So, if you look at the macro economy and the end markets, a couple of things I want to highlight to you. First, as you probably watch also the PMIs continue to really be very soft. And that's historically has been an indicator for us that the industry business might slow down. We are not yet fully hinting at fortunately, because we have a strong portfolio, but it's a concern for us that the PMIs stayed pretty low. We have seen also more, I would say, negative headlines, for example, in the packaged food market. We said in Q1 that Europe is already a problem. Now, we're hearing also in the US that some of the customers actually are slowing down their investments and also their results are not as good as they used to be. Those headlines are also not too promising. And then, the overall comment that already was made about biotech, why they're not broadly exposed in biotech, but as there's still, in terms of end market, who commented out there. There is concerns about biotech. And we, of course, factored it in our total macroeconomic pictures as well. When you look at the regions, I think, Shawn outlined it before, Europe in the first quarter performed better than expected from our prospect. It was really strong, but we're still cautious about the impact of the war in Ukraine and what it might mean for the economy moving forward. So, also there we -- again, we keep our forecast for you still quite moderate. And then, the US with potential recession ahead, I think, it's also you need to be a bit cautious about the outlook in the US overall. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, Patrick. And one follow-up here on -- I know, the customer base that you serve, it's pretty large. So when you look at your daily run rate items like pipettes in order rates, did you do a survey of your customer base on when this -- order rates might pick up. I'm curious on when you thought about 2Q and the back half assumptions what kind of customer feedback have you gotten that gives you confidence in the back half guide? Patrick Kaltenbach : I think if I mainly refer here to number one, the compares will of course be easier for us all in the second half in terms of growth rate. We certainly had very strong growth last year in the second quarter. That's why we see a stronger decline this year. And then, in terms of customers we talk to, a lot of them are, in pharma, biopharma research areas, their use of pipettes quite intensely. And from them actually -- from some of the customers that we can really get good indications that overstocking issues will be less of an issue in the second half. Vijay Kumar : Understood. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Daley with Wells Fargo. Tim Daley : Great. Thank you. Just quickly, I know a lot of talk on lab here, but can you guys just help us with the underlying regional forecasts that are rolling up to that growth guidance for the year within lab. Shawn Vadala : Yes, sure. Hey, I think, as we kind of like look at Q2, so we had low single-digit growth for lab as a division. And I think we're kind of like looking in that low single-digit range for the Americas and Europe. Again, Europe -- I mean, Americas is going to be the most impacted region by this decline in pipette. So we'll probably see the softer growth in that region versus the other ones. And then, China will probably be in the kind of mid to high-single digit kind of a range there. And I think a lot of the lab business too, it's also important that we -- if you look at like the first quarter as an example, we had actually double-digit growth in most of the other product categories. And we are still seeing good growth in a lot of these hot segments. It's just these multi-year comps and then this topic that we talked about with the headwind in pipette as we kind of enter the rest of the year. Tim Daley : All right. Great. And then, just wanted to dig into the service and consumables line. How did, I guess, service grow in the quarter. Can you help us understand how you're thinking about that contract versus value-add services growth for the year? And just, kind of, general commentary. I don't think we touched on that much in the earnings call today. Shawn Vadala : Yes. No, great question. I mean, service is kind of really good story. We featured it on our last call. We grew last year at 12% and we got off to a really good start this year with 15% growth. We continue to see great opportunity here when you kind of look at the overall installed base that we serve. And when you kind of put dollars to that in terms of what it could mean to our service business, it's a very significant opportunity. We have a very strong value proposition here with helping companies with uptime and compliance and accuracy of their results and reducing waste. And that -- those value propositions really are resonating very well in the marketplace. And we can also do a lot of very value-added activities like validating and certifying processes. And as we kind of go after these opportunities with our big data analytics program and how we penetrate that iBase [ph] or whether we have gotten better at selling service at the point of sale by embedding these into our quotation process. We've seen very good traction in terms of the ability to capture this opportunity. And then maybe one other final comment on services like our Net Promoter Scores have continue to be at like all-time highs and they were already high before. And so it just shows you how well our team executes around the world. And as we kind of look towards the rest of the year we continue to be positive here. I wouldn't be surprised if we're in the 10% range again for Q2. And then for the full year we'll see how it plays out. Tim Daley : Great. Thank you for the time. Appreciate it. Shawn Vadala : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Derik De Bruin : Hi. Good morning. Shawn Vadala : Hey, Derik. Derik De Bruin : Hey. Apologies if I missed this, but can you remind us what your FX assumptions are for the revenue impact in Q2 and for the full year now? Has that been updated? Shawn Vadala : Yes. Just a second. So -- okay. So FX on Q2 is just under 1%. And then for the full year so that would be a detriment. And then for the full year, it's about neutral maybe up modestly. I think Derik just to make sure you got this one the bigger one from my perspective is the FX impact on EPS. And so that's a 4% headwind we mentioned I think in the press release for Q2 and it's about a 2% headwind to EPS for the full year. In our previous guidance it was like that's like a 1.5% worse than prior guidance. Derik De Bruin : Yes. Got that. And can you remind us the split in PI versus core industrial and also just sort of like the margin differentials between Lab and Industrial. Just trying to once again sort of like think back about the margin activity -- the margin progression for the year? Shawn Vadala : Yes. So in terms of the -- yes, in terms of the split our core industrial business is about 60% of our industrial exposure and PI is about 40%. It might be a little bit more than 60% and a little bit less than 40%. I don't know the exact math, but it's probably in that kind of a range. And then as we kind of think about the margin differentials. Our Lab business does have higher margins than the rest of the business. And then within that of course pipettes is a higher-margin business. Derik De Bruin : Right. Great. And have you seen I guess any cancellations? I mean, I know your business is more short cycle and quarters are sort of build a buyback of backlog. But have you seen any sort of cancellations particularly in any of your instruments people not buying PH meters just hesitation at all in buying, or does the -- are things still looking relatively healthy? Shawn Vadala : Not seeing any cancellations. Q1 was actually quite good. Of course hard to talk about if there hesitant or not I think we'll see all those types of things play out but in terms of cancellations not seeing anything like that. Derik De Bruin : And then just one final one. What was the actual growth percentage in pipette and price of analytics in the first quarter? Shawn Vadala : So for pipettes our business was down high teens and pipettes is just over 10% of our business. And what was the other part of you question? Analytics process? Derik De Bruin : Process analytics. Yes. Shawn Vadala : Process Analytics actually had a very good quarter. I think they were up double-digit in Q1. And if you kind of like get into the \u2013 if you're trying to like look for insight on bioprocessing there, because a lot of that business is bioprocessing. A lot of the business is holding up actually quite well. Of course, there are some vaccine production comps that we have to deal with in that business. But the one area where we have seen weakness is in single-use sensors and \u2013 but that of course is a much smaller part of our business and portfolio. Derik De Bruin : Yes, that\u2019s exact \u2013 and that is exactly where I was going with that process analytics question. Shawn Vadala : Thanks, Derik Derik De Bruin : Sure. Absolutely. Thank you very much. See you next week. Shawn Vadala : All right. See you Derik. Take care. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. Catherine Schulte : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. You talked about services growing 15% in the quarter. How did consumables perform both overall and then excluding pipette tips? Shawn Vadala : Yes. So good question. So our \u2013 let me just make sure I get the right number here. So our consumable business was down about 12% and that was almost entirely due to the decline that we saw in pipette. I think we had growth in all of our other consumable categories. Catherine Schulte : Okay. And then it sounds like core industrial is trending better than you expected coming into the year. Can you just talk to what kind of trends you're seeing there? And any order book commentary that gives you confidence to raise that full year despite some of the macro weakness that we're seeing? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes, I'll take that Catherine. Good morning. Look, again an industry comes down to our portfolio and solutions to help customers automate processes. And we see still a very healthy investment and interest in our product portfolio and I think we compete extremely well. Especially, also with the new products that we released last year with the Industry 360, I think we talked about it at the Investor Day, a very successful product and also the overall OEM business for us is doing really well. We see strong demand. I think again around the world, there's still a lot of interest in building out automated solutions. And we play a significant part as a supplier in this segment. So that gives us quite some confidence moving forward that industry will besides a very negative PMI trend will not be affected as badly as the PMI looks but again, we are pointing to low single-digit growth in Q2 because it's also tough compares. Don't forget we are really looking at super tough compares on a three-year basis here for industry. We have massive growth in China over the last three years in the industry. We had very good investments in Europe in the US. And of course, this compares to put additional positive growth in it means quite something. Catherine Schulte : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Matt Sykes : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Patrick, maybe the first one for you. Just as we're going through this pretty significant normalization, particularly in the Lab business, and then looking at your comments on services and the growth that you've shown last year and then obviously, this quarter, could you maybe help us understand a little bit more the historical three-year CAGR or longer on services, just so we can understand essentially the algorithm post this normalization and the contribution that services could actually make to the overall group growth algorithm, meaning if it's services are sort of 20-ish percent, please correct me if I'm wrong on that but growing at a higher rate without the comp difficulty that the rest of the business has could that actually change the longer-term growth algorithm for Mettler, if services were to continue to grow at the rate it's growing at? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Actually I forward you to Shawn on this question because he has the growth numbers in front of him. Shawn Vadala : Yes. Thanks, Matt. So hey, I mean of course, we're very pleased with the growth we've been seeing in service. And as I mentioned before, we see that as a really good opportunity. If we kind of look at how we started the year, it's like a 10%, three-year CAGR. And \u2013 but we were kind of exited last year with maybe a 7% CAGR in Q4. So I don't have the full year number in front of me. But I certainly wouldn't want to characterize this as a double-digit business going forward although we're pleased with it and we're going to challenge the organization to do well this year. But I think kind of going forward, I would just characterize it as above corporate average and -- which would imply high single digit. And it certainly will have -- should have benefits and upside to our overall algorithm over time. But nothing that, I would highlight differently than how we've thought about historically other than we're just executing very well at the moment. Matt Sykes : Got it. Thanks for that. And then just on automation that space. You guys typically compete against within fragmented markets. Is automation any different from that? I'm just thinking of sort of the larger European players or Japanese players automation as you sell into China and other regions. Is that a different type of competitive landscape that you guys are facing in automation, or is it similar, or are you going to find other ways to compete. Shawn Vadala : Think it's different. And maybe I'll start and let Patrick jump in. But like a lot of our automation we're selling the system integrators. And so there's a whole business model that has to do with not only quality and all that kind of stuff but how easy are you to integrate into their solutions and so that's an area where we have a lot of competitive advantage as well. Patrick Kaltenbach : I agree, I mean, it's about how easy our sensors and our terminals plug in and both into the system but also the overall software environment that the end user has and I think we have a very strong portfolio there and very up-to-date portfolio that resonates very well with the system integrators. Matt Sykes : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Liza Garcia with UBS. Liza Garcia : Hey, guys. Thank you. Thanks a lot for taking question. So I guess just talking about customer types even if you -- just more broadly, on the pharma I think there's like a lot of questions on pharma more broadly. I know you spoke a little bit earlier on the sensors. But could you just talk about kind of what you're seeing in the pharma environment more broadly and the growth trends there even if qualitatively? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah. I can start with that, yes. And when you look at pharma and biopharma the first thing you should appreciate is our diverse exposure given the broad portfolio there so we serve customers in R&D with broad-based analytics portfolio was also with pipette. But when you go downstream with solutions to scale up manufacturing other Autocam business is pretty strong in pharma as well. And then the whole pro business bio-processing that we have plastic industry portfolio when it comes to downstream in industry. So I think we have a really broad-based exposure. What we are seeing I think is continued investment -- long-term investment anyway into pharma biopharma. Yes, there was a slowdown in of course [indiscernible] manufacturing and we see -- we saw some of that exposure in biopharma and I think Shawn related referred to this as well. But for example with PendoTECH we saw for single-use sensors with acupressure that are used in biopharma process we saw a slowdown there. But we see still really healthy demand on the R&D side healthy investment and also on the QA/QC side there's a huge installed base of instruments out there that we also serve. And there's a continuous replacement business that we also addressed on our portfolio that addresses pharma on a broader scale. Regionally, I would say, we see no big slowdown at the moment of pharma biopharma in the US in sales in Q1, but in China it looks similar. We had actually quite good sales in Q1 into the segment. Now, what it means moving forward, whether there will be a change in biopharma, which could be one of the segments in China that you could look at that on a more pressure. But again, given the broad portfolio we have, I think we are very well positioned to capture the growth opportunities. Shawn Vadala : Just to clarify his comment on US was excluding the pipette Patrick Kaltenbach : Excluding the pipette Shawn Vadala : We talked about. Liza Garcia : Okay. Helpful. And then just -- you talked about lithium-ions, and sustainable polymers in that business and I know it may be a bit of a smaller. But can you talk about kind of, how you think about a bit of a longer-term question like, how you think about the runway there? And how many -- how we should think about the growth outlook there? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes, absolutely. Look I mean, there's a lot of investment in that area and a lot of research going on in the area of sustainable polymers, and new materials that we serve with a broader portfolio. Again, a lot of it is on the lab business. If you look at our material characterization portfolio, we are very closely working with our customers to understand the demand, and the workflows that \u2013 there you see and what solutions they are looking for. Given where we are in terms of the overall market trend, I think it's still in the early innings. There's a lot of demand and opportunities to come up with solutions to I would say, standard plastic for example, and also more sustainable materials moving forward. So, we are confident that will be while, it's still a small segment for us. It's one of these hot segments similar to what we see -- what we have seen in and continue to see with lithium-ion batteries that if we are early enough there to customers and provide them with the right solutions, and the right workflows, we can be a leader participating in that growth as they build out research, later on manufacturing and of course also pipette [ph]. That's what we have done in for example, with the battery segment. We have been very early with all these customers to understand, what their needs are and now we are participating really nicely in the growth opportunities, both on the R&D but also now on the manufacturing side in terms of, two or three areas. Liza Garcia : Thanks so much, Pat. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Brandon Couillard : Hi, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just one for you Shawn. Do we split out the Lab versus industrial business in China in the first quarter? And any update on the forecast for those two subsegments for the year. And then Patrick, any change in local competition or dynamics on the ground there that you care to call out? Shawn Vadala : Okay. Good. Brandon, I'll take the first part of that question then. So for Q1, we actually had a really good start to the year in our Lab business. We were up mid-teens. We saw a lot of growth throughout the portfolio with the exception of they also have a pipette headwind, but it's a smaller part of their business. In the Lab business in China, we -- like a lot of our other businesses we also have been benefiting from a lot of these hot segments that we were just talking about like lithium-ion batteries, is a good example, in which really felt a very strong growth in our analytical instrument business. And then on our industrial side, we grew low single digit in the quarter and I think that's important to put that in context, with the comparison. So that's on top of about 24% growth in Q1 of last year, but on top of 63% growth in the year before that. So China is lapping some very, very challenging comparisons in the first half of the year for their industrial business. And as we kind of like look towards Q2 and the rest of the year we're kind of looking at low single-digit again in Industrial for Q2 given challenging comps also in the second quarter, but we're expecting better results in the second half as the comparisons improve. So probably still thinking of that business is low to mid for the full year which is kind of similar to how we were thinking before. And then Lab might have some moderation also because of some comp topics on a multiyear basis in Q2. Maybe it's more in the mid or mid to high single-digit kind of a growth range, but still optimistic for the full year, especially, given the strong start in Q1. So still thinking that double-digit for the full year on the Lab side. I think a topic there like a lot of other regions, but especially in China it's going to be how to -- with all the investment that they've had in COVID what is that looking like for the rest of the year. And given the fact that they just went through the reopening we'll kind of see how that plays out. Patrick Kaltenbach : Great. Thanks. Brandon maybe from my side you asked about the competitive situation in China with the market, but there's a significant change. I would say no. Look it's a very competitive market. We have local players there as well but you have to -- I want to remind you we have a really strong history in China. We have a strong R&D and manufacturing base there. We -- as I said in my remarks we manufacture a lot of the products locally in China and also tailor some of the applications to the local market needs. That helps us to really effectively compete with the product portfolio and our sales and marketing team uses the very same Spinnaker sales and marketing approach to really go after the growth opportunities identify those in the China market. I mentioned that example about the battery segment and they have been very successful to do those. So, yes, the market is competitive, but I would say it hasn't changed dramatically for us. Our team is well-positioned to continue to compete and we made from my perspective also a lot of good investments to make sure that we have the right portfolio to compete effectively in the market. Brandon Couillard : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : With no further questions, we will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Let me now turn the call over to Patrick. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks Adam, and good evening, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. Tonight, we reported our second quarter financial results, the details of which are outlined for you on page three of our presentation. Our sales growth in the second quarter included strong growth in our service business as well as solid performance across our industrial product categories, which was offset in part by softer market conditions in Laboratory and China. Focused execution of our margin expansion and cost control initiatives resulted in good growth in adjusted EPS despite currency being much greater-than-expected headwind this quarter. As we look to the remainder of 2023, there is increased uncertainty in the global economy and our end markets. In addition, market demand in China has deteriorated. While we have reduced our growth expectations for 2023 due to weaker market conditions, we remain confident in the factors we can control, including execution on our best-in-class sales and marketing programs and our margin expansion and cost-saving initiatives. Our team remains very agile in adapting to changing market conditions, and I'm confident that our efforts will deliver solid results this year. Let me now turn the call over to Shawn to cover the financial results and our guidance, and I will then come back with some additional commentary on the business and our outlook. Shawn? Shawn Vadala : Thanks Patrick, and good evening, everyone. Sales in the quarter were $982.1 million, which represented an increase in local currency of 2%. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales were flat as currency reduced sales growth by 2%. On slide number four, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales increased 4% in Asia, rest of the world; 1% in the Americas and were flat in Europe. Local currency sales increased 3% in China in the quarter. On slide number five, we show sales growth by region for the first half of the year. Local currency sales grew 4% for the first six months, with 3% growth in both the Americas and Europe, and 6% growth in Asia, rest of the world. Local currency sales increased 6% in China on a year-to-date basis. On slide number six, we summarize local currency sales growth by product area. For the quarter, Laboratory sales decreased 3% and Industrial increased 6% with core industrial up 6% and product inspection up 5%. Food Retail grew 17% in the quarter as we benefited from significant project activity. The next slide shows local currency sales growth by product area for the first half. Laboratory sales increased 1%; and Industrial increased 6%, including 6% growth across both core industrial and product inspection. Food Retail increased 25%. Let me now move to the rest of P&L, which is summarized on slide number eight. Gross margin was 59.4%, an increase of 100 basis points as pricing was partially offset by higher cost, business mix and currency. R&D amounted to $47.2 million in the quarter, which is a 6% increase in local currency over the prior period, reflecting increased project activity. SG&A amounted to $228.6 million, a 6% decrease in local currency over the prior year and includes lower variable compensation and benefits from our cost-savings initiatives. Adjusted operating profit amounted to $307.7 million in the quarter, an 8% increase. Currency reduced operating profit growth by approximately 4%. Adjusted operating margin was 31.3%, which represents an increase of 210 basis points over the prior year. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $18 million in the quarter; interest expense was $19.3 million; and other income amounted to $1 million. Our effective tax rate was 19% in the quarter, above our previously guided range of 18.5% for the full year. This rate is before discrete items and adjusting for the timing of stock option exercises in the quarter. We now expect our tax rate to be 19% for the full year. Fully diluted shares amounted to 22.1 million, which is approximately a 3% decline from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $10.19, a 9% increase over the prior year or a 13% increase excluding unfavorable foreign currency. On a reported basis in the quarter, EPS was $9.69 as compared to $9.29 in in the prior year. Reported EPS the quarter includes $0.23 of purchased intangible amortization and $0.29 of restructuring costs. We also had a $0.02 benefit from tax items. The next slide illustrates our year-to-date results. Local currency sales grew 4% for the six-month period. Adjusted operating income increased 9% or 14% excluding unfavorable foreign currency, and our operating margin expanded 190 basis points. Adjusted EPS grew 9% on a year-to-date basis or 15%, excluding unfavorable currency. That covers the P&L and let me comment on cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $260.5 million, up $52 million, helped by favorable working capital. Year-to-date cash flow per share grew 44%. DSO was 35 days, while ITO was 3.7 times. Let me now turn to guidance. As we look to the remainder of the year, there's increased caution across our customer base such as pharma and biopharma, chemical companies and food manufacturing. And there's also greater uncertainty regarding the global economic conditions. In particular, conditions in China have deteriorated sharply as there is growing uncertainty around the pace of economic growth and limited government stimulus. This is particularly true with our pharma and biopharma customers who are delaying investment decisions in China, but also in the Americas and Europe. In Europe, the outlook remains uncertain in light of the ongoing war in Ukraine and soft general economic growth. Global manufacturing PMIs have also continued to trend lower and have been below the 50 growth -- no growth index level for many months.  Now turning to our guidance. We expect local currency sales to be down 3% to 4% in the third quarter with a mid single digit decline in Laboratory. This reflects deteriorating conditions in China as mentioned earlier, with particularly soft demand from pharma and biopharma customers. We also expect modest sales declines across our industrial businesses in the third quarter. We are implementing actions to reduce our costs in response to the softer sales environment and manage productivity, while maintaining various growth investments that are important for the future. We estimate our operating margin will increase in the 70 to 100 basis point range for 2023 based upon our disciplined approach to margin expansion, productivity and cost savings initiatives. We expect third quarter adjusted EPS to be in the range of $9.55 to $9.85, representing a decline of 3% to 6%. This includes foreign exchange headwind to EPS of approximately 3%. Now turning to the full year 2023. Our local currency sales growth guide is now 0% to 1%, reflecting the factors mentioned earlier. This is down from our previous guidance of approximately 5% local currency sales growth. We now expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $40.30 to $41.20, representing a growth rate of about 2% to 4% or approximately 5% to 7%, excluding unfavorable foreign currency. This compares to our previous guidance of adjusted EPS in the range of $43.65 to $43.95. There are three factors to our revised adjusted earnings per share outlook. First, the reduced local currency sales growth forecast for the year compared to our previous guidance, partially offset by our cost reduction efforts. Our reduced outlook largely reflects a lower Laboratory sales forecast of a decline of low single digits, down from our previous mid single digit outlook. Additionally, we now see pronounced weakness in our business in China, where we now expect our total business to decline mid single digits for the year compared our prior forecast of high single digit growth. Secondly, foreign exchange, as mentioned earlier, is now expected to be a 3% to 4% headwind to EPS growth this year compared to 2% the last time we spoke, largely due to the weakening of Chinese renminbi and the strengthening of the Swiss franc versus the euro. Relative to the impact on sales, currency is expected to be a 1% headwind to sales growth for the full year and roughly neutral in the third quarter. And third, we would now expect a higher tax rate of 19% in 2023 compared to our prior guidance of 18.5%. Some final details on guidance as you update your models. Total amortization, including purchase intangible amortization is forecast to be $72 million. Purchased intangible amortization is excluded from adjusted EPS and is estimated at $26 million on a pretax basis or $0.93 per share. Interest expense is forecast at $78 million for the year. We now expect free cash flow of approximately $850 million compared to our previous estimate of approximately $900 million, and we'll also reduce our share repurchase program by a similar amount. That's it from my side, and I'll now turn it back to Patrick. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks Shawn. Let me start with some comments on our operating businesses, starting with Lab, where sales were softer than we had expected for the quarter. While we continue to see robust demand on hot segments like lithium-ion batteries, our pharma and biopharma customers have become increasingly cautious with their spending and have delayed investment decisions, particularly in China. As expected, our pipette sales were again weak in the second quarter as customers reduced inventories of chips and instrument sales declined. The impact of the lower pipette sales was in line with our previous expectations, and we continue to expect this headwind to ease in the second half of the year as comparisons become easier. As mentioned, we also see customers, especially in our key market segments such as pharma and biopharma delaying purchases. However, our pipeline and customer quoting activity has remained strong, and we were pleased to see continued strong service growth across our Lab business in the second quarter. We are hopeful conditions normalize soon, but we have not built this into our 2023 guidance. Turning now to our Industrial business. We again saw strong demand for our automation solutions from core industrial portfolio this quarter. While we expect to continue to benefit from customer investments in automation and localization of supply chains globally, we are not immune to the increased uncertainty around the global economic outlook. Regarding product inspection, it also had good performance this quarter, but our packaged food customers have also become more cautious about making investments in new equipment due to inflation and uncertain economic conditions, and we would expect softer results for the remainder of year. Finally, Food Retail delivered strong growth this quarter due to robust project activity in the Americas. Our Food Retail sales can be lumpy, and we would expect strong growth again in the third quarter. One final comment on the business. Service sales remained very strong overall and grew 13% in the quarter. We continue to be very pleased with the growth in this important and profitable part of our business. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales in Europe were flat in the quarter with growth in core industrial and product inspection, offset by declines in laboratory products. In the Americas, we saw good growth across our industrial and retail businesses offset by declines in our laboratory product offering, especially pipette. Finally, Asia and the rest of world had another quarter of good growth. China grew 3% with good growth in Industrial, but sentiment, particularly in Laboratory has become much more cautious as activity has slowed following the COVID reopening, and there has been limited economic stimulus as mentioned before. As of today, we expect a significant decline in sales in in China the second half of the year, but our team in China will remain agile to capitalize on growth opportunities however market conditions unfold. Now, I would like to share with you some updated thoughts about our strategic priorities and how we are investing to drive growth over the long-term. While market conditions have become increasingly challenged over the past year, we have remained at very high level of incremental investment to support the long-term growth of the organization and market share gains. The hallmark of or culture is the agility and focused execution, and our team continues to respond very well to unexpected changes in the environment to gain market share, expand profitability and make additional important growth investments for the future. Starting with our sales and marketing programs, we have developed increasingly sophisticated digital approaches with our Spinnaker program that more efficiently feeds our pipette -- our pipeline with new leads, [indiscernible] alerts with a special focus on customers that we do not do business today. Webinars have been an important areas of investment in sort of new customer leads as we look to increase potential customer interactions in a very efficient format. We can directly show how other solutions address common customer pain points in very specific end-use applications.  We have had strong participation in our webinars, which positions us as trusted subject matter subject experts in specific applications, but also provides a good sales pipeline as customers seek unique solutions to challenging or new applications. This is particularly true in hot segments like lithium-ion batteries, sustainable materials and the semiconductor industry. Our data-centric approach in nurturing and qualifying these leads allows field sales team to prioritize their efforts on hyper potential business opportunities and increase our win rates. We have also continued to invest very strongly in research and development over the past year to maintain and improve our technology leadership and support our growth potential. I am very excited about our pipeline of new and recently released products that enhance our customers' productivity, but also ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. This has been a topic of increasing importance for our customers as of late and our innovative solutions like LabX, enhanced productivity through workflow automation, while ensuring full data integrity and traceability across customer entire workload. Earlier this year, we launched a new thermal analysis instrument that allows customers to increase sample analysis throughput through new automation and software features. This is especially important in hot segments like advanced materials and the battery segment.  Additionally, our Process Analytics business recently released a new conductivity sensor that is unmatched in the industry for measuring ultra-pure water in the microelectronics industry, helping increasing yields for our semiconductor customers, while reducing the amount of very expensive ultra-pure water required for their operations. Lastly, our Industrial business had great success with our new line of hygienic scales that help customers clean their scales up to 40% faster, but also help eliminate contamination risk in regulated environments like food and pharma.  While individual new product launches are not material on their own, given the diversity of our portfolio, they provide a very important compounding element to our growth algorithm, expanding our technology leadership, enhancing our value propositions and helping drive market share gains. Going forward, we have a very exciting pipeline of innovative products that we plan to launch over the coming year that will further extend our leadership position. Turning now to our margin initiatives. Our pricing and SternDrive initiatives have been very effective in supporting our margin expansion this year. As a reminder, SternDrive is focused on improving productivity and driving operational excellence across our manufacturing and back-office operations, with our team executing several hundred projects to reduce material costs and improve productivity. We have excellent opportunities ahead of us with enhanced -- with advanced data-driven approaches around value engineering, smart manufacturing and common platform architectures that we expect to launch in the near future. I hope this provides some context to our updated guidance for the year, but also shows the confidence we have in our ability to continue to execute on our long-term growth initiatives, expand our margins and deliver solid earnings growth this year and beyond. Now that concludes -- that is the conclusion to our prepared remarks. Operator, I'd like to open the line now for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Dan Arias with Stifel. Your line is open. Daniel Arias : Afternoon, guys. Thanks for the questions. Patrick or Shawn, maybe just to start on China. Growth there was actually a couple of points above the U.S. and Europe in the quarter. Is the deterioration that you're pointing to for second half showing up in the order book here in early 3Q? Or is it more just sort of reading the writing on the wall when it comes to the big picture direction that things are headed in over there? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Hey, Dan. This is Shawn. Maybe I'll start, and I'll let Patrick add some color. But basically, as we were kind of exiting -- largely related to how we're exiting the quarter, but probably even more importantly, how we were starting the third quarter. And as you know, don't typically carry a lot of backlog in our business. But certainly, as we kind of started the third quarter, we started to really see a significant deterioration in conditions that we also started to see towards the end of Q2. And as kind of we mentioned before, it's largely in the area of Lab. Our Lab forecast for China is down very significantly in the third quarter. We're kind of like looking at literally something that could be in excess of a 20% decrease.  Now, of course, as you know, we've had some extremely strong growth over the last couple of years. If you kind of look at, we grew 20% last year in Lab in China and almost 40% in Q3 and the year before that. But we're also seeing a little bit of slowdown in Industrial as well. And so, overall, we're just kind of seeing a lot of hesitancy in terms of customers placing orders. Not sure how much of it's related to a lack of clarity in terms of like stimulus in the country. I mean, there's some very recent talk of additional stimulus. But that's something that we have not built into our guidance for Q3 or for the rest of the year. And kind of just sitting here looking at this very sudden decrease -- and as we've said many times in the past, things in China can change very quickly. We feel like we're observing something that's a very negative quick pivot going in the wrong direction and with the fact that it's kind of just starting to happen so significantly, we don't feel like we're in a position to necessarily try to build anything in necessarily for the fourth quarter at this time. So, we're kind of building in also a negative outlook for Q4. Daniel Arias : Okay. Okay. Just to finish that thought. Did you give a forecast for the year for China, if you did, I missed it. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. So, down mid single digits for the full year. And then for Q3, down mid-teens. And then, so if you kind of think -- step back and you look at that full year guidance of down mid single digit, I mean that's a very significant difference than what we're looking at last quarter when we provided guidance. We're looking at high single digit for the full year. And if you just kind of like do the quick math on that, that's kind of, I think, more than half of our decrease in our guidance is related specifically to China. Daniel Arias : Yeah. Okay. Okay. And then, just -- maybe just moving to Lab and the destocking activity that you have going on in the pipette business. How much of what you're looking at? Are you attributing to that? Does it feel like that's tracking relative to your expectations last quarter? I mean, do you still think you can kind of normalize in the second half of the year? Or is there a better way to think about it just that takes the remainder of the year to sort of wash that out of the system? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. That one is playing out pretty similar to what we expected. It was about a 2.5% headwind in Q1. I think we were saying that we expected something to be about a 2% headwind in the second quarter. That's exactly what it was. So, our 2% growth would have stayed. In other words, our 2% growth would have been 4% if it wasn't for the decrease in pipette. And then our Lab business would have been plus 1% growth instead of a minus 3% decline if it wasn't for the decrease in pipette. So that's playing out very similar to what we thought. For the second half of the year, we're not expecting much of a headwind, maybe very little in Q3. I mean, pipettes could still be down low to mid single digit, especially in China, it's going to be down significantly because of what they're lapping with testing. But I'd say, overall, it's playing out pretty similar to what we thought -- how thought it would. Daniel Arias : Got it. Okay. Thanks Shawn. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Thanks Dan. Operator : Your next question comes from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is open. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good afternoon. I had one more follow-up on China. I was just curious like what feedback you've heard from the region about what might have driven this kind of rapid deterioration? Is it your sense this is just demand related? Or is there any sense maybe there's been an uptick in local competition at all? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah. Jack, this is Patrick speaking. Let me take this. And since Shawn already commented the first part of the question about China. Look, the change is, I think, mainly driven really by the lack of stimulus when after COVID reopening, beginning of the year, there was really strong momentum in China, a lot of expectation on growth, and the government would drive it with additional stimulus. That really didn't happen. And I think it also now led to the fact that a lot of customers really become much more reluctant and waiting for the government to make a decision about the stimulus, so they are clear of how much they can spend and where they can spend the money. We have not seen any significant change in competition locally in China. That's one what we are hearing from the team. The team is really confident in our product portfolio. We have a very experienced sales team and a great product portfolio that helps us to compete efficiently in China. So, it's really about the missing momentum. And I would say the missing confidence in the economy that really leads to the fact that a lot of customers holding back investments and are waiting for the certainty about what's to come. And that's the major slowdown that we are facing now. And it's also the fast drop off that we have seen that. We also didn't expect and our sales team definitely didn't expect as we're going into Q2, but towards the end of the Q2, that really became a big momentum and now early in Q3. We don't see that changing, and that's why we're also careful with the outlook Shawn mentioned. We see China minus double-digit in the third quarter, and we don't really count on that improving in Q4 as well. Jack Meehan : Got it. And then just in terms of some of the actions that you're taking to mitigate this pressure. Is it possible to quantify just the magnitude of cost-savings that are going to hit in the second half of the year and just where that's going to show up kind of across the income statement. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Sure. So, maybe the best way to look at it, Jack, is that we're kind of looking at our overall cost structure to be flattish for the full year. So, if you kind of like think about that in terms of the second half of the year, probably down low single digit in the second half of the year. And if we -- if you try to think about that, how it looks on the P&L, SG&A will be lower than other lines. Of course, part of our costs are also above gross profit, which you don't necessarily have broken out separately. But I think as we look at the -- at our program, we are focused on productivity and other discretionary spending. But I think it's also important to emphasize too. We're still continuing very much to grow and invest in -- I mean, invest in the business for growth. I mean, if you look at our R&D, as an example, it's still up 7% year-to-date. We still expect to see growth in R&D for the second half of the year. But then kind of just stepping back from everything too. I think we feel pretty -- like it's the right balance where we can still provide really good operating margin expansion on a full year basis in the 70 to 100 basis point kind of a range. And that's despite some unfavorable currency. Jack Meehan : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So, a couple of ones. So, I was surprised to hear your pharma biotech comments on things being down so much. And the reason why I say that is, I mean, we certainly have heard that purchases over $100,000 are getting held up. So, your items are often well below that. What's going on there? I mean, is it just a complete freeze? Or are you just getting a lot of pushback on pricing? I'll ask the pricing question, what are your expectations now for the price in your guide? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah. I'll start with it, Derik, and then I let Shawn chime in as well. Look, we're not seeing a complete freeze. It's not like total pharma business is frozen for us. Of course, we see a decline. And as we said, we see delays in orders. It's not -- and you're right. I mean, our products are in lower CapEx or below CapEx spending. But that said, we see a slowdown in orders in pharma-biopharma, and it's pretty broad based, but it's not a complete going off the cliff, so to speak. But it's a significant decline that we're seeing and slowdown that we are seeing. And for us, of course, the question is as many others ask, how long will this take? And why is that happening? We want to hear from our sales team is, well, we have a lot of quoting activity, actually, what we're seeing, but I'm really happy to see is that we have a strong sales team engagement. We have a lot of sales teams out there with customers that are talking about their plans. They get good leads. Leads are actually up year-to-date. So, we see good momentum on the lease generation side, but they're not turning into orders as quickly they used to do. Now how long this will continue. It will definitely also depend on when more certainty is coming back to the economy. I mean that's what we're hearing from our sales team. I'm pleased with the quoting activity. I'm monitoring that on a daily basis. I see how our sales team is interacting with customers and now often they are out there with customers and discussing projects and investments. But the time to turn these opportunities into orders have definitely increased, and that's part of the slowdown we're seeing in orders. Shawn Vadala : In terms of the other part your question, Derik, pricing actually was very good in the quarter. For the total group, it was actually up 6%, which was a little bit better than what we had expected. And as we kind of like look at the second half of the year that's for the total company. And as we kind of look for the second half of the year, it's probably going to be a little bit better than what we were initially expecting as well to probably up by about 4%, which would kind of put us in the 5% kind of a range on a full year basis. And what we've kind of continue to observe is that we feel like our value proposition has really resonated and increased over the last few years. As the market like looks for opportunities in terms of productivity and digitalization, it really plays to the strength of our portfolio. And I think teams do an excellent job in terms of articulating that value proposition to the customer base.  And as you kind of mentioned or implied with your question, our price points also tend to be pretty low as you know too. And so that value proposition really resonates, and it's easy to justify from a customer perspective. So, we feel good about the pricing program and how we think about it for the second half of the year. Derik de Bruin : Got it. Just as a follow-up. You're taking guidance down by about 4.5%. It looks like about 2.5% of that is China. So, can you quantify what else is that? And just like what's pharma, what's industrial, you're just not having good feelings about that you just want to be conservative on. Shawn Vadala : When you say -- when you ask that question, are you asking to break down the China piece or the rest of it? Derik de Bruin : We know the China piece. It's the rest of the piece that I just want. What's what else is baked into that remainder that's not the China cut? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, hey, I think we do see moderation in the Americas as well as Europe. So, for the Americas, we're now looking at more flattish growth. For the full year, our prior guide was like more like low to mid single digit. What we're kind of seeing there is just it's more concern with our core end markets. One of the things that is happening at the moment we have our three largest core end markets are under pressure pharma, biopharma, food manufacturing and chemical. And in the U.S., food manufacturing and others. We talked a little bit about pharma, but food manufacturing is also an area, especially in our product inspection business, where we see -- we came off a good quarter, but we also see some pressure for the second half of the year as these customers are under a lot of pressure.  If you look at Europe, we're probably modestly a little bit lower than what we were before, at least at the lower end of what we were guiding. We're thinking more like low single digit for the full year. Previously, we were in the low to mid single digit. The one thing -- we've actually been very impressed at how well the European numbers have held up this year, but we also acknowledge that PMIs have been down very low there. They've decreased recently and it's been a prolonged period. And of course, there's a lot of uncertainty in the region, and of course, our end markets there are also under pressure. And if we think about Europe, like a good example is -- in addition, again, to give you an example other than pharma, biopharmas, the chemical industries under a lot of pressure. I mean, if you just look at the number chemical companies that have reduced their forecast for the year, just recently, double-digits, there's a lot of concern there in terms of that customer base, particularly when it comes to Europe. So that maybe gives you more of a geographic overview. If we kind of break it down by business area. Maybe I'll just kind of do the walk throughs so everybody kind of has that too. And of course, there's some overlap here because China is influencing some of these numbers, but I'm just going to kind of go through it. So, we have -- we're looking at Lab down mid single digit in the third quarter and down low single digit for the full year. We're looking at core industrial down, low single digit and up low single digit for the full year. And similarly, products inspection down low single digit for Q3, up low single digit for the full year. And then, our retail business is actually doing quite well, very good project activity. We continue to see that -- expect that in the second half. We expect that to be up high-teens in the quarter for Q3 and also for the full year. Derik de Bruin : Great. Thanks Shawn. That was really detailed. Appreciate it. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Yeah. Thanks Derik. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citigroup. Your line is open. Patrick Donnelly : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Patrick, I guess, when you kind of look at these various headwinds you've called out and you kind of assessed them, you talked a little bit, I think, in the prior question about trying to figure out what could linger into 2024. I guess, when you kind of step back, which do you see being more temporary or transitory versus issues where you look and you're kind of doing these cost controls that you look out and say, maybe this could linger into 2024. If you can just kind of bracket it up for us and try to help frame that view would be helpful. Patrick Kaltenbach : Sure. Absolutely. Look, I mean, of course, it's too early to make a forecast for 2024. Right now, we will do this in our next earnings call when we report our Q3 and look at Q4. But to say what is transitory right now. I mean, we have -- I would say the easier thing to capture for us is what we have seen on the pipette side. The destocking of pipette. We anticipate that it is normalizing. Again, the consumption of pipette probably to pre-COVID levels in the second half. We see that uptick happening slowly, but steadily. That is normalizing. When it comes to the rest of the industry, it's, of course, very hard to predict to say how is the economy continuing to evolve from here? How long will pharma and biopharma be under pressure and also will the rest of the economy, the Shawn also outlined, the chemical industry suffer from this economic downturn that we are seeing. The elongated time that PMIs are under pressure. It just leads us to -- right now, we look at the second half and say -- this is probably a good forecast for us, given the information we have. It's, of course, a significant downturn. But will it -- when it will turn, will it be early 2024, mid-2024, I think that's too early to call. You may call there, frankly. I mean, we have pockets where we see really still very good momentum as we count on that. They continue to grow. If we take what call the hot segments like the battery segment, for example, is performing extremely well, driving good growth almost across all of our businesses. We've emphasized on some of the Lab businesses like analytical is performing well. We still see pockets of good momentum in industrial automation. And we also see increasing interest -- as I highlighted in the beginning of the earnings call, also in the semiconductor business, we have been successful in some of our form [ph] business when it comes to ultra-pure water, et cetera, sensors. So, there are pockets of still good growth that we capture, and we're really going hard on for this. We have the right tools that we see these pockets of growth and drive our sales team towards the direction. But how long broader economy will under pressure, I think none of us here on the call can really tell you how long it will take. We're looking at the second the second half and forecast for half. And then once we get to Q4, we'll give you a guidance on 2024. But right now, it's too early to be honest. Patrick Donnelly : Yeah. No, understood. And then, Shawn, I guess, maybe a follow-up on that. Just around the margins, you touched on them a little bit. But I guess when you think about the pricing lever, that seems like it's still quite strong for you guys in terms of the boost for margins. Again, some of these cost reduction activities. Can you just talk about the moving pieces as we work our way through second half? And then, I guess, how nimble you want to be on the cost side going into next year and then pricing, I assume, is still going to be positive as we move forward. You guys always protect the margins pretty well. So, just curious how you think about it, the moving pieces there would be helpful. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Sure. So, I mean, hey, I think we still have a really great margin story. I mean, I think, as I kind of mentioned before, for the full year, we're still expecting to deliver an operating margin expansion in the 70 to 100 basis point range. And frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if we end up closer to the higher end of that range, and that's despite some unfavorable currency. And that probably puts us -- the operating margin by quarter might be down a little bit in Q3. It might be up a little bit in Q4. But overall, we feel very good about the ability to continue to expand for the full year. And then I think as we kind of go into next year, like Patrick said, it's a little bit early look at that. Of course, we'll probably have some savings from some of the actions that we did this year. There will be some stuff that goes away as well. And as we think about pricing, we still feel great about our value propositions. But it will also depend a little bit on the inflationary environment. And we'll -- as you know, we'll provide more thoughts and guidance and insights on all that on our next call in November. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you guys. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Your line is open. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, my first one on the third quarter guidance, low single digit declines. You just did 2% in Q2. That's a 500 basis point change. And I think about 300 basis points of the 500 is coming from China. Are you seeing China down mid-teens in July? And if the assumption, it's down mid-teens for the rest of the quarter? And where is the remaining 200 basis points softness coming from, perhaps, from an end market perspective? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Hey, maybe I'll take that one, Vijay. So, I mean, we don't typically -- as you know, we typically don't go into too much detail on individual months, but absolutely, we -- I kind of alluded to it before. We -- what we experienced and as we've seen July kind of start certainly heavily influenced how we're looking at the quarter and the rest of year for China. And so yeah, very much we're looking at down mid-teens and then, especially weighted in our Laboratory business. If you look at our Laboratory business, as I mentioned before, we're lapping some pretty big comparisons there, but we're expecting the Lab business to be down even more significantly there. If we kind of like look at the rest of the portfolio, it's kind of similar to how I answered Derik, I'd say, on the full year results. I mean, we're looking at low single digit growth in the Americas. There, it's very much the same topic about core end markets. It's this delay in pharma, biopharma that Patrick talked about. Of course, we also -- within that, we talked about pipettes, but of course, we also have a smaller exposure within single-use bioprocessing that we talked about last quarter, like with PendoTECH as well. And then similar to the prior answer, I mean, we're also looking at a decline in product inspection in the Americas in the third quarter as well with the pressure that we're seeing from food manufacturing companies. And then, Europe, we're still expecting Europe to be more low single digit in the third quarter, but acknowledging that we have different uncertainties that we talked about before. If we kind of like look at the business in terms of overall by business, for the third quarter, we're looking -- well, actually, I already mentioned it, so I don't need to mention it again. But in terms of the different areas, I mean, Lab being down more so than the other areas in terms of the guidance for Q3. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And then one maybe on the stimulus that you mentioned. If -- what specifically have you heard about from Lynx [ph] about a stimulus? And if there is a stimulus, how long does it take for it to flow through to customers placing orders in purchasing? And on the cost actions here, what is the pacing of cost actions? Is -- what kind benefits are you expecting? It looks like -- I mean, EPS is down more than revenue, maybe perhaps not much benefit in 3Q, but what's the magnitude of the cost actions -- the benefit from cost actions you've taken in Q4? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Hey, so a lot there. So, the first thing you were talking about was the stimulus. So, in terms of the stimulus, like we don't have any -- probably more insights than anybody else. I mean there were some comments coming out of the government, I think, in the last week with an intention to stimulate. I don't think any specific details have been provided. So, it's hard to kind of comment on that at this point in time. And so, I think we'll have to see how that plays out and how long that takes to really -- how directly that affects our end markets and how long it takes to get into the economy. But like I said, right now, we haven't built anything in for our forecast for the second half of the year. So, we'll kind of see how it plays out. In terms of EPS, I mean, we do have unfavorable EPS in -- I mean, I'm sorry -- foreign currency. We do have unfavorable foreign currency that's been hurting us throughout this year. And as we kind of mentioned in the opening remarks, it's also kind of impacted us much more significantly than our last time we provided guidance. So, I think we were initially looking at a 2% headwind last quarter. And now we're looking at something more in the 3% to 4% range. And I think if we go back to our original guidance for the year, I don't think we were expecting very much headwind at all from foreign currency. So that's certainly something that's affecting us. So, I think it's important to kind of also consider that as you kind of look at the EPS growth for the second half of the year. So, if you kind like look at Q3, if you exclude foreign currency, will be anywhere from at the high end of our guidance flattish and to the lower end of our guidance, minus 3%. And then for the full year, we would be growing 5% to 7% in a year where sales are much more modest than the 0% to 1%. So, we feel like we still feel good about that in terms of the ability to still expand margins during the course this year and then at the same time being able to continue to invest in the business, which we've talked about -- which is important to us to protect the medium and longer term as well, too. But otherwise, no other specific comments, I would say, in terms of details. Vijay Kumar : Understood. Thanks guys. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Matthew Sykes : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe for my first one, Patrick, you spent a lot of time and focus on the services portion of the business and you called out some pretty strong growth this quarter for that segment. Could you maybe talk about what your assumptions are for the full year for services growth? And just maybe help us understand a little bit better about the customer dynamic and caution as it relates to services, assuming it's a little more defensive. Just maybe talk about how you expect that business to perform in this type of environment. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah. Very good question. And hey, I couldn't be more pleased with the performance of our service business. As you probably recall, we grew 14% in the first quarter. It grew 13% now in the second quarter. So, outstanding performance of the service team. And actually, that's also a business just to -- reminder everybody on the call is where we still over hiring people. So, we're adding more service technicians to our team, because we see good business momentum there. We see good demand for our customers. We use the opportunity over the last year or two to also extend our service offering in our portfolio. We increased the emphasis on service sales at the point of sales, making sure that we sell more service contracts. We restructured the quoting process that services are obviously included in the quoting. We trained the service team more team more efficiently on selling, the sales on selling services. So, I think that all really now pays out in the growth we're seeing in services. And looking at the full year also more strong outlook here. I think for the full year, we're forecasting high single digits, at least in terms of service growth. Shawn, am I correct on this one? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Might even high single digit for Q3 and yeah, might even -- yeah, probably might even be high single digit, might even be low double-digit, maybe close to 10%, but yeah, high single to 10%, yeah. Patrick Kaltenbach : Good. And again, that's driven by the ongoing momentum. And we see -- at the moment, we see really stronger demand than in the product category, and we don't see a lot of pushback on pricing. And so, I would really see continue -- to see that momentum continuing. Of course, we're also having tougher comparisons as we move between the next couple of quarters as Q3 and Q4 last year also had been already quite strong on service growth. But the underlying momentum is strong. We have an extremely strong service team and we continue to invest in services that we can build, continue to build out that team and make sure that we can serve our customers in the best possible way and deliver an outstanding customer experience. That is really what is differentiating us as a [indiscernible] leader from many of our competitors that compete directly with us in the field is the strength of our service organization. Matthew Sykes : Great. And then just thinking of some other potential offsets just given some of the challenges in the Lab business. You talked about sustainable materials, batteries and semis. Can you maybe help us understand sort of the sizing of that business and what kind of you're seeing in terms of growth sort of globally, but maybe also by region. Just so we can kind of better understand what some of the offsets could be over the course of the year? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah. Let Shawn break it down in terms of the size. But I mean, this is what we call the hot segments, right? And it's really -- at the moment, strongly driven by lithium-ion battery segments. We see strong -- really good momentum building up in the semiconductor business with the reshoring and homeshoring of some of the semiconductor plants that is gaining momentum in sustainable materials that are gaining importance. And that is, again, we call these pockets of growth in in itself, they have, of course, not super significant in terms of size, but the growth momentum is important for us to compensate and offset some of the weaknesses that we see in other areas. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. In terms of the size, Matt, I don't have a specific number for you, but I mean these are still relatively smaller end markets for us in the kind of low single digit kind of a range. But from a growth perspective, they certainly help lot in terms of growth given the higher growth relative to the rest of the portfolio and the longer term opportunities here. And what's kind of neat about these hot segments is that they -- we can provide solutions very end to end. A lot of them -- it starts in R&D. It goes all the way through development and to manufacturing. And so, we benefit in some cases, more so in our analytical instrument business, but we also see benefits through a large portion of our portfolio. Matthew Sykes : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Catherine Schulte with Baird. Your line is open. Catherine Schulte : Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. I guess, first in China, is the weakness concentrated in any product categories within your Lab business? Or is it more broad-based? And are you seeing the consumables and services side of the business holding up better there? Patrick Kaltenbach : Look, Catherine. I take this, it's really broad-based in the market segment. I can't point to any specific product category. It's pretty broad-based and focused on pharma and biopharma. But for the single product category, I would point you that there is more effective. Catherine Schulte : Okay. And then, maybe\u2026 Shawn Vadala : And specific to consumables, Catherine, consumables are actually down more so because of all the testing that was still going on in China with COVID last year. Catherine Schulte : Yeah. Okay. Got it. And maybe on the packaged food side, you've been talking about caution in that category for several quarters now. At what point do you start lapping some easier comps there? And is there anything to point to in prior inflationary environment as to when you might start seeing improvements there? Patrick Kaltenbach : I think we will not face any easier comparison because we have performed pretty well last year in this business, and we are almost confident, but we are confident that we have taken market share as well. Yeah. In the Americas, especially, we have been quite strong. And this is also why we see probably in the second half this year comparison with a bit of a slowdown in growth. We had pointed more reluctance of investment in Europe in the beginning of the year or end of last year. And we continue to see that going on. And Europe is just not the same investment environment right now in the packaged food industry. A lot of the customers are actually under pressure when it comes to their margins, so they're trying to push out their investments as well.  That said, we had just recently had a big trade show in Europe, the Interpac and we have seen great interest in our product portfolio. We also launched a set of new products, also midrange products in the x-ray category and others. And that helps us, of course, to also really effectively compete in that segment and drive our future growth. We are actually quite sure that we're taking market share in the segment right now, although the growth is not outstanding. I think we are outcompeting our competitors. And it's a business that we, again, invested in over the last two years in expanding the portfolio, especially pushing more into the midrange to be there more effectively, but also now launching pretty soon some new higher end solutions. Catherine Schulte : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Josh Waldman with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Joshua Waldman : Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe, Patrick, just to follow-up on product inspection. I mean, it sounded like it held in the quarter, but seeing signs of softening from CPG, food and pharma seems like it's pulling back. Just curious what level of orders you've seen kind of entering the third quarter and maybe how the guide reflects those maybe softer end markets. It seems like the guide, I mean, only moved down modestly, if I'm correct. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. That's right. The guidance is down modestly. Again, it's mainly in the U.S. where we see also tougher compares, but also the environment for the customers that are becoming a bit more difficult. And it looks like they are slowing down their investments. Shawn, anything else if we could say in terms of the guidance for PI. Shawn Vadala : No. I mean, I think also, if we look at Q2, we actually did better than we expected. So, maybe Q2 was better, but the second half is a little bit worse. And it's kind of like what Patrick says. If you just kind of like look at -- if we kind of just look at how -- what we're hearing from customers and from the organization, especially in the U.S., but also in Europe going into the quarter, we're just seeing a more negative situation than what we experienced in the second quarter. Joshua Waldman : Got it. And then, I guess, a follow-up or a question on process analytics. I wonder what you saw in Q2 from a demand perspective or growth perspective and then your assumptions on the second half. I mean, we've seen some of the bio prod peers, CDMO peers and chemical accounts talk on incremental softness. Is this something you're seeing show up in the business? Or do you think that business will hold in more resiliently? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. I'll start and I'll let Patrick add some color -- additional color if he'd like. But in terms of process analytics, we had very, very modest growth in the quarter, but there were definitely different storylines kind of under the covers. On one hand, we did have a very significant headwind in terms of bioprocessing specific more so to the single-use technologies and downstream bioprocessing. We also see softness in pharma and biopharma or more biopharma, I should say, coming off some very strong comparisons in previous years. But then kind of offsetting some of that is also -- have been good growth in some of these hot segments like semiconductors is an important segment for the process analytics business. But nonetheless, we have a more modest expectation here for the second half as well too, just given more pressure that we talked about in general with pharma and biopharma. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah. Shawn, if I might add to yours. Of course, we're seeing some headwinds there in biopharma mainly. And you mentioned also the single-use sensor topic that we have with PendoTECH for the end market segment. But on the other hand, on Ingold reusable sensors, we are not having the same stocking dynamics that we have seen with PendoTECH, but that actually is still a good ongoing recurring [ph] business. And I also want to add here and I know we talk a lot about innovation, but we also launched last year a new unbreakable sensor that is now really a great success story for us in the dairy [ph] business, and we continue to launch it into new market segments. It really is differentiating us from our competitors. So, I am very positive about the product portfolio and how it will help us to also gain market share there even in difficult market environments. Joshua Waldman : Appreciate the detail, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. Thank you for taking the question. So, I want to follow-up on some of those comments around pharma and biopharma customers. Can you just walk us through, are you seeing any difference in buying trends between your large pharma customers and some of those smaller biotechs. And then can you detail us how are those conversations about decision-making on spending difference between the two? And then as a follow-up, just can you remind us how small is your emerging biotech exposure? Patrick Kaltenbach : So, overall, our small biotech exposure is really small. I mean, that's not the majority of our customer base. The major customer base for us in pharma and biopharma are larger customers.  And to your second part of the question about the decision slowdown, I guess there's not a specific particular reason we could point to. We're just saying what we're seeing is that delay in decision-making. What the real root causes of that might be different for different businesses. But I think overall, pharma just has become more cautious with spending. And that affects us across the board of our product portfolio. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. And then, maybe just a follow-up here on pricing. You said that you'll take roughly around 5% pricing this year. You also had above the average pricing contribution last year as well. So, how should we think about that pricing translating into 2024? Will you guys go back to your normalized range? Could it go below? What are really the expectations there? Thank you. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Hey, Rachel, I mean, of course, it's early still to provide too many insights in terms of how we're thinking about 2024. But maybe what I would say is that we still feel very good about our value propositions. We still feel very good about our program. We continue to invest heavily in R&D to continue enhance those value propositions. And depending on the inflationary environment, I would expect us to be probably more in a normalized situation kind of going into next year, but I think we'll kind of have to see how the inflationary environment plays out. Operator : Your next question comes from Liza Garcia with UBS. Your line is open. Elizabeth Garcia : Good evening, guys. Thanks so much for squeezing me in. So, I'll try to keep it brief. Just circling back since we're talking about China. I think you called out growth actually on the Industrial side of the China business. And I know the focus has been on the biopharma and pharma piece obviously, you detailed quite a bit there. Can we just talk about your expectations on the other businesses in China for the balance of the year and kind of what you're seeing there and how to think about that? And then, I'll have a follow-up really quickly. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Liza. Yeah. So, I'll take that one. The growth in the second quarter, I mean, was more mid single digit for Industrial. So, we're pleased on that. As you know, we've been kind of lapping some big comparisons in that part of the business as well. As we kind of like look to the second half of the year though, we're looking at the industrial business to be down probably mid single digit. We are seeing some decline in that part of the business as well. And I think it's important to remember, like some of these customers are also exposed to a lot of the same end market exposures that we're exposed to in Laboratory as well, too. So, when we say pharma and biopharma is down, it's also affecting our industrial business also. And so, maybe not down as much as what we're seeing pronounced in the Lab business, but still down in the second half of the year and probably more flattish on a full year basis. Elizabeth Garcia : Great. And yeah, I mean, you guys were talking about -- obviously, you mentioned SternDrive and that initiative. But I believe there's another wave of Spinnaker that's supposed to be underway or kind of coming under that should be launched, I believe, in right now. I guess, kind of how to think about that and kind of the levers that you have. I mean, Spinnaker has obviously obviously been great in terms of market share and how to think about what Mettler can deliver over the next couple of quarters with the next wave. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. So, in terms of Spinnaker, we continue to innovate in Spinnaker -- Patrick, can you hear? We can continue to work. Okay. You\u2019re live though. You\u2019re live. Yeah. So, in terms of -- Liza, can you still hear me? Elizabeth Garcia : I hear you great. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Hey -- so hey, I think Patrick just lost the ability to hear the question. So, I'll just kind of answer it. So, in terms of Spinnaker, we continue to innovate in terms of Spinnaker. And we are in the process of launching a new wave. We're going to share some of the details on that until we kind of roll it out a little bit further, but something that we're just at the very beginning of doing and kind of very excited about. And I think there's some really interesting opportunities for us kind of going forward to continue the journey that we have in Spinnaker. Elizabeth Garcia : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question is from Tim Daley with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Timothy Daley : Great. Thanks. So, Shawn or Patrick whoever can answer here. But it's pretty clear the guide discounts, any year-end budget flush in pharma biotech. But again, Patrick, given your experience, you brought up Mettler from your prior lives across the life science industry, or Shawn, yourself, given the historical experience you have at Mettler. Can you get a game theory for us, if you will, potential narratives or factors that would influence the outcome for a potential year-end budget flush if macro conditions stabilize or don't considerably fall off by the end of the year, and that's a potential outcome. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Hey, Tim, this is Shawn. I'll take that one. So hey, of course, we didn't -- it's always difficult to be able to judge exactly what his budget flush and quantify it from year-to-year, especially in our business. We did not build in anything specific for budget flush. And I think just like you said, just kind of implicitly, looking at our guidance, we have a much more cautious view in terms of pharma and biopharma as we kind of exit the year. And if you can just kind of like look at how we're thinking about Q4 in general. It's not quite the same, but it's pretty similar to how we're thinking about the third quarter. So, certainly, if pharma and biopharma had a more robust end of year spend, that certainly could be an upside to how we're looking at things. Timothy Daley : All right. Got it. And then just again, sorry to beat the dead horse here in China. But just now, given that is a pretty critical piece of the investment -- long-term thesis for growth within Lab, the standardization of Western facilities. Just curious, is there a pullback from Western companies because of geopolitical potential risk there? Has there been any change in impetus that whole standardization of one global facility format, which utilize the Mettler productions within it? Or is that still -- is just temporary stuff weighing on us? Patrick Kaltenbach : Thank you. I hope you can hear me. I mean, we just got to disconnect -- yeah. Okay. Well, I'll take that question. Okay. With regard to multinational pulling out of China and what we're seeing here, right, as for now, I think we don't see a significant impact yet. But the way I want you to think about it is if multinationals pull out of China and do some reshoring, homeshoring, whether they go from China to India, they go back to Europe or the U.S., we also see this, of course, moving forward as potential opportunity for us to capture these investments as the investments are happening. Then, we have definitely the right market sensing tools market sensing solutions in place to capture these opportunities earlier then guide our sales team and our -- to these companies as they are going -- if they are going to reinvest either in the U.S., in Europe or somewhere else if they're putting businesses out of China. But as of now, I would say that this is not the major driver for the slowdown in China. That's not what is driving it. For us, it's really the overall sentiment, the lack of confidence in the market and the wait mode for stimulus until the companies they really decide on how much budget they have and how much they can invest moving forward. Timothy Daley : Got it. Thank you. Appreciate it. End of Q&A: Operator : There are no further questions at this time. With that, we will end the conference call. Thank you for joining us today. You may now disconnect.",

Let me now turn the call over to Patrick. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks, Adam, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. Last night, we reported our third quarter financial results, the details of which are outlined for you on page three of our presentation. Market conditions were weaker than expected in the third quarter, especially in China, where market demand significantly deteriorated relative to our expectations. Our team has reacted quickly to address the market challenges and addressed our cost structure and delivered good margin and cash flow performance despite these headwinds. As we look to the remainder of 2023, we expect market conditions to remain weak, especially in China. And based on market conditions as of today, we would expect these headwinds to persist into next year. However, we remain confident in the factors we can control, including strong execution of our proven corporate programs like Spinnaker to drive growth and capture market share and SternDrive to manage our costs effectively. Our go-to-market strategy, innovative portfolio and unique culture has been important differentiators during challenging conditions. And I'm convinced our efforts have driven market share gains and will help us to emerge stronger in market recovery. Let me now turn the call over to Shawn to cover the financial results and our guidance. And then I will come back with some additional commentary on the business and our outlook. Shawn? Shawn Vadala : Thanks, Patrick; and good morning, everyone. Sales in the quarter were $942.5 million, which represented a decrease in local currency of 5%. On a US dollar basis, sales declined 4% as currency increased sales growth by 1%. On slide number four, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales grew 4% in Europe, declined 3% in the Americas and declined 14% in Asia, Rest of the World. Local currency sales in China were significantly lower than expected and declined 25% in the quarter. On slide number five, we show sales growth by region on a year-to-date basis. Local currency sales grew 1% for the first nine months, with 4% growth in Europe and 1% growth in the Americas and a 1% decline in Asia, Rest of the World. Local currency sales decreased 6% in China on a year-to-date basis. On slide number six, we summarized local currency sales growth by product area. For the quarter, Laboratory sales decreased 9% and Industrial decreased 6% with core industrial down 9% and Product Inspection, up 1%. Food Retail grew 49% in the quarter and benefited from significant project activity. Service sales grew 6% in the quarter. The next slide shows local currency sales growth by product area on a year-to-date basis. Laboratory sales decreased 3% and Industrial increased 2%, including 1% growth in core industrial and 4% growth in Product Inspection. Food Retail increased 33%. Service sales grew 11% on a year-to-date basis. Let me now move to the rest of the P&L, which is summarized on slide number eight. Gross margin was 59.4%, an increase of 10 basis points, as pricing was partially offset by our volume decline, higher cost, business mix and currency. R&D amounted to $46.1 million in the quarter, which is a 1% increase in local currency over the prior period, including increased project activity. SG&A amounted to $217.4 million, a 9% decrease in local currency compared to the prior year and includes lower variable compensation and benefits from our cost savings initiatives. Adjusted operating profit amounted to $296 million in the quarter, a 4% decrease. Currency reduced operating profit growth by approximately 3%. Adjusted operating margin was 31.4%, which represents an increase of 20 basis points over the prior year. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $18.3 million in the quarter. Interest expense was $20.3 million and other income amounted to $1.2 million. Our effective tax rate was 19% in the quarter. This rate is before discrete items and adjusting for the timing of stock option exercises in the quarter. We continue to expect our tax rate to be 19% for the full-year, and again, in the fourth quarter. Fully diluted shares amounted to 21.9 million, which is approximately a 3% decline from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $9.80, a 4% decrease over the prior year or a 1% decrease excluding unfavorable foreign currency. On a reported basis, in the quarter, EPS was $9.21 as compared to $9.76 in the prior year. Reported EPS in the quarter includes $0.24 of purchased intangible amortization, $0.27 of restructuring costs, and $0.08 from the difference between our quarterly and annual tax rate due to the timing of stock option exercises. The next slide illustrates our year-to-date results. Local currency sales grew 1% for the nine-month period. Adjusted operating income increased 4% or 8% excluding unfavorable foreign currency. And our operating margin expanded 140 basis points. Adjusted EPS grew 4% on a year-to-date basis or 9% excluding unfavorable foreign currency. That covers the P&L. And let me now comment on cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $251.7 million, up $27 million, helped by favorable working capital. Year-to-date, cash flow per share grew 32%. DSO was 37 days, while ITO was 3.8 times. Let me now turn to our guidance for the remainder of this year and our initial thoughts on next year. First, forecasting remains very challenging, particularly for our business in China. Our team in China has reacted to changing market conditions very quickly, and we feel very good about our market position in the country. However, economic conditions remain challenged and there's low visibility. Outside of China, there's also greater uncertainty today with weakness in our core end markets such as life sciences and continued soft economic conditions in Europe and the Americas. We expect lower-than-normal customer year-end spending. The recent Middle East conflict also creates additional uncertainty. Secondly, our organization is not standing still during this period of reduced market demand, a defining attribute of our culture. The team has executed exceptionally well to adjust our cost structure to current market conditions, while at the same time, reallocating resources to support important investments in our long-term growth. Now, turning to our guidance. For the full year 2023, we expect local currency sales to decline approximately 1%. This compares to our previous guidance of 0% to 1% growth. We expect full-year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $39.10 to $39.30. This includes an expected headwind to adjusted EPS growth of approximately 3% to 4%. Free cash flow for the year is now expected to be approximately $875 million above our prior guidance, as our reduced profit forecast is more than offset by the favorable timing of tax payments and working capital. Share repurchases will now be $900 million in 2023. With respect to the fourth quarter, we would expect local currency sales to decline 7% to 8%. We expect fourth quarter adjusted EPS to be in the range of $10.50 to $10.70. Currency is expected to increase sales by approximately 1%, but decrease EPS by approximately 1%. We have also provided our initial guidance for 2024. And based on our assessment of market conditions today, we would expect local currency sales to be approximately flattish and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $39.10 to $39.80, which represents a growth rate of 0% to 2% or 2% to 4% growth excluding adverse currency. Relative to sales, currency is expected to be a headwind to sales growth of approximately 1% in 2024. Underpinning our 2024 guidance are the following assumptions. First, we expect our customers to remain cautious with spending in the first half of the year, reflecting the increased uncertainty in the economy. Our sales in China are also expected to decline in the first half of the year as economic trends are expected to remain weak and we faced challenging multi-year growth comparisons. We expect our local currency sales to improve in the second half of the year as comparisons become easier and market conditions improve. Secondly, we expect our year-over-year margin performance to be dampened due to lower sales volume and a reset in our variable compensation programs, offset in part by our cost savings initiatives. Lastly, I'll share a few final comments on our 2024 guidance. We expect total amortization, including purchased intangible amortization to be approximately $73 million. Purchased intangible amortization is excluded from adjusted EPS and is estimated at $25.8 million on a pre-tax basis or $0.96 per share. Interest expense is forecasted at $86 million for the year and other income is estimated at approximately $5 million. We expect our tax rate before discrete items will remain at 19% in 2024. We expect free cash flow of approximately $850 million, representing a conversion of approximately 100% of adjusted net income. We also expect share repurchases will be approximately $850 million. That's it from my side. And I'll now turn it back to Patrick. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks, Shawn. Let me start with some comments on our operating businesses, starting with Lab, where our sales teams continue to see good engagement and activity levels with customers, but budget constraints and cautious spending patterns have led to declines in demand across our key market segments of life sciences, food and beverage and chemicals. This is especially true in China, where our pharma and biopharma customers have significantly reduced their investments and after significant spending during the pandemic. In the Americas, while customer destocking of pipettes has unfolded as we had expected, we still see weaker market demand. We also saw lower-than-expected demand from our automated chemistry business and analytical instruments and process analytics was again challenged by weak demand from our bio-processing customers. As we look out to 2024, the market fundamentals for our Lab businesses are good. While the pharma, biopharma market has slowed this year, we expect a normalization in activity in 2024 and the long-term outlook remains strong as innovation pipelines remain full of novel drugs and therapies to be brought to the market. We anticipate to benefit from trends in automation and digitalization, leveraging our LabX software. Additionally, our team remains focused on capturing the significant growth occurring in hot segments like lithium-ion batteries, semiconductors and sustainable materials. We will also gain from our investments in innovation and software and 2024 will feature many exciting product launches that I look forward to sharing with you over the coming year. Turning now to our Industrial business. Overall Industrial sales declined 6% in the quarter against very strong growth in the previous year. Our core industrial product sales were weaker than anticipated due to a sharp decline in sales in China. And we also had lower sales in the Americas due to very tough growth comparisons and weaker market demand. Product Inspection sales grew in Europe. However, this growth was largely offset by weaker sales in the Americas, as our food manufacturing customers have remained cautious with their investments in new equipment. As we look out to 2024, while our core industrial business likely faces headwinds from a slowing global economy, particularly in China, we should benefit from global trends in automation, digitalization and reshoring investments around the world. We also continue to upgrade our portfolio with new solutions to address our customers' challenges on the production floor. For example, there is increased customer focus, the devices used in hazardous areas to be certified explosion-proof and to be a simple-to-use as those in safe areas. Earlier this year, we released a new model of our flagship industry 500 weighing terminal for use in hazardous areas that provides powerful process control for our pharma and chemical customers. Our new terminals are intrinsically safe and also features seamless integration into customers' automation systems and deliver state-of-the-art cybersecurity features. Now, regarding our Product Inspection business, food manufacturing customers faced more difficult operating environment today, which we expect will lead to limited growth for our Product Inspection business in 2024. We will also continue to focus on innovation in this area as our customers increasingly seek solutions to protect the packaged foods from physical contaminants and increased productivity as they continue to be challenged by labor shortages. We have had great initial success with our new X2 line of x-ray products that have launched over the past year to address demand in both the mid and premium end of the market. This new line provides a wide range of package integrity checks in addition to the digital contamination detection and positions us very well to gain market share. Lastly, Food Retail had another quarter of very strong growth due to the robust project activity in the Americas. Our team has delivered remarkable growth this past year with successful penetration of major grocery and club stores. While we have cultivated an attractive portfolio opportunity pipeline, the strong growth we expect to deliver this year means we face very challenging growth comparisons in 2024, and therefore would expect modest revenue declines. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales in Europe grew 4% in the quarter, with growth across our product portfolio, and across most major end markets against very modest growth in the prior year. While we are pleased to have generated good growth in Europe so far this year, we are more cautious on the outlook for Europe due to soft PMI readings in the region, the continuing war in the Ukraine and potential for disruptions for the economy from the conflict in the Middle East. Turning now to the Americas. Our very strong growth in food retailing customers was offset by a decline in both laboratory products and industrial. Customer feedback in the Americas continues to point to optimism over the coming years from various government stimulus programs like the CHIPS Act and the Infrastructure Bill, as well as reshoring activities. Our pharma and biopharma customers are expected to gradually increase their spend in 2024 as to return to more normal replacement cycles and continue to advance their drug pipelines. Finally, Asia and the Rest of the World sales declined 14%. Our sales in China declined 25% driven by very soft laboratory and core industrial product sales. Pharma, biopharma demand in China has declined significantly after several years of very strong growth. And we have also seen very weak demand across other end markets in China as the economy has abruptly slowed. The economy in China was expected to rebound following the end of the COVID lockdowns almost a year ago, as the central government shifted their focus towards growing its economy. However, the lack of stimulus, headwinds from the real estate sector and declines in direct foreign investments are weighing on business and consumer confidence. While the outlook for China is uncertain in the near-term, the long-term growth opportunity remains significant due to the country's commitment to expanding R&D investment and supporting development of advanced pharma, biopharma, new energy and new material industries. We also continue to see the laboratory market shift towards more advanced automated solutions in China, supported by a desire for highly accurate and reproducible results. Our industrial solutions are increasingly in demand as customers in China look to increase quality, reduce cost and prepare for labor shortages in the years ahead. Our business is very well-positioned to capitalize from these growth opportunities and we expect solid growth over the long-term. Now as we look forward to the remainder of 2023 and 2024, we expect market conditions to remain challenging. Nevertheless, we remain focused on the things we can control through the diligent execution of our initiatives. Our competitive position has grown stronger as we continue to expand our technology leadership with new product innovation and our Spinnaker sales and marketing programs will be further enhanced over the coming years with more sophisticated digital tools to ensure our sales teams are guided efficiently to the best opportunities. We're also stepping up on various strategic pillars and enhancing the Mettler-Toledo experience with customers and employees, which will be enabled with the launches of new programs over the coming year. I couldn't be more excited about what the future holds and fully believe that the best is yet to come. So that is the conclusion of our prepared remarks. Operator, I'd now like to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Stifel. Please go ahead. Daniel Arias : Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the questions. Shawn, maybe just to start on China, what's the implied performance that you're baking in for '24? And I know it's hard to sort of predict cadence this far out, but can you just talk about what's assumed first-half versus second-half, just knowing that, obviously, the comps will be easier here in the second-half? It sounds like you think China can be -- will be down in the first-half, but maybe grow in the second-half. Are you able to sort of compare how those two pieces might look next year, and then just all-in what you're baking in? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Hey, thanks, Dan. Yeah, so for next year, we're kind of expecting China to be down high-single digit, but we're expecting more significant decline in the first half of the year. And frankly, also expecting a significant decline in the fourth quarter, probably down in the mid-20s in Q4, kind of similar to what we saw in Q3. But we do -- we are very optimistic about growth in the second half of the year next year. Like you said, we'll be facing some easier comparisons, but, I think a lot of different topics in the local market should also be flushed out. I think we also appreciate that there was an element of maybe some stocking at customers that were happening with supply chain constraints during COVID. And some of that inventory is also going to be flushed out by the time we get to the second half of next year. Daniel Arias : Okay. And then maybe just on op margins, how do things look there for you, just sort of in the context of the expansion that you're delivering this year on, more or less similar organic growth? I mean, obviously, FX is a headwind. I would imagine there's a pricing headwind too. Can you just talk about that? And then also the dry powder or the gas in the tank whatever term is appropriate there, just when it comes to efficiency and productivity that comes out of things like SternDrive, Blue Ocean, et cetera? Shawn Vadala : Yeah, sure. So, yeah, so when we look at our margin for this year, of course, we're very pleased with our margin expansion. On a year-to-date basis, I think, we're up like, what, 140 basis points. For the full-year, we'll probably be up, excluding currency, we'll probably be up over 100 basis points. But on a reported basis, probably in the 50 basis point kind of a range. As we look to next year, our operating margin will be more flattish. And if you exclude currency, it's probably up by about 20 basis points. Probably one of the -- as you -- I think you kind of like highlighted some of the things in terms of like puts and takes for next year. In terms of -- maybe I'll start with pricing, pricing continues to do very well this year. It came in about 4.5% or so for the third quarter, we'll probably be down a little bit from that level in the fourth quarter, probably in the 4% kind of a range. But then, when we kind of like think about next year, we're probably more in the 2% range, probably more -- in a more normalized environment for next year. So that has an impact what you kind of compare '23 versus '24. From a volume perspective, you know, you're right, it's probably kind of similar year-on-year in terms of the overall volume. But we also have initiated different cost savings measures. We're very pleased with the progress on that. A lot of that's targeted towards productivity in the organization. So we will have some benefits from that into next year, but we also -- one of the things we have going on next year is we also have -- so if you kind of like think about our overall cost structure, you know, excluding bonus and incentives, might be down slightly. But we do have to bring back bonus levels to a more normalized level next year. So that's going to be a little bit of a headwind as we kind of go into next year. And then, I think, maybe the final thing is like when you go through times like this, I think, on one hand, we're very proactive. On the other hand, we're also very mindful. We want to be very mindful of coming out of this situation stronger than when we entered it. I think, that's something we've always been good at in the past and we're very thoughtful about how we're trying to balance our costs and our investments in this environment, and we have a lot of things that we're still investing in that we're actually very excited about. We'll drive some innovation that we'll see next year, but also beyond next year too. And it's not just innovation, we're continuing to invest in our service organization as well. So, I think we have a good balance in the company. And I think when we kind of step back, I think, we have the right mix going into next year. And maybe I forgot -- almost forgot, there's one other thing is foreign currency. I think you mentioned in the question. You know, our currency will be about a 2% headwind to our EPS kind of next year. Patrick Kaltenbach : So, if I might add, because Dan also has asked about SternDrive, just to add data on SternDrive, we, this year -- then I'll talk about stepping up on our strategic pillars. We just launched SternDrive phase three with a strong focus on automation on the shop floor, smart automation and we expect that also to continue to significantly contribute to our performance next year and drive savings both on the automation side, but also back-office sufficiency et cetera. So the program is fully running and the team is very committed to drive additional savings next year. Daniel Arias : Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Waldman with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Joshua Waldman : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Maybe one for Shawn and then one for Patrick. Shawn, I wondered can you talk a bit more on the assumptions that went into the guide, particularly as it relates to the sequential progression from Q4 into '24. I mean, it seems like the guide implies a bit more of a step-up than normal on an absolute basis into '24. I mean, anything you're seeing like in the markets that you're trying to capture within the guide, suggesting that maybe like fourth quarter is trough and things start to get better as we roll into '24? Shawn Vadala : Yeah, I think, the one topic we have in Q4, Josh, is that kind of like -- if you look at how we think about market demand in the fourth quarter, I don't think we're going to get like -- I think the market demand is going to be less than it normally is towards the end of the year. Each year, there tends to be a pickup in market demand, especially in the Lab business. And right now, we're -- we're not anticipating much of that pickup, if any, in our fourth quarter guidance. So that's maybe one topic to think about this year versus next year. But then as we kind of like enter the year, we're very much thinking and not to get too specific this early, but we're definitely thinking the first half of the year is going to probably look more similar to the second half of this year. In other words, I think we fully expect to be down in the first half of the year. But we do see ourselves returning to growth in the second half of the year, especially as we face easier comps. I think there's Q4 dynamic, it should be better next year as well. And then, if you kind of like get into parts of the portfolio there's been different destocking issues at different points in time whether it's pipette tips or whether it was consumables and bioprocessing, especially on the single-use side. And then I kind of mentioned in the first question, some of the stuff that we're seeing in China as well. Joshua Waldman : Got it. Okay. And then, Patrick, can you comment on how the service business is holding in? I think it's been a bright spot here recently. But, I guess, any risk that that business starts to slow on the back of software, hardware, and maybe pressures growth and profitability as we move into '24? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Josh, for the question. I mean, I'm extremely proud of our service organization and that's definitely also an area where we continue to invest this year as well. We also had a headcount in services to make sure that we can deliver on the demand of our customers have in our services. As I mentioned in one -- in some of the earlier earnings calls, we increased our portfolio and improved our portfolio of service offerings. That helps us of course to also drive not only more -- to drive more services at the point of sales, getting a higher connect rate, but also good people after our installed base that we have out there and potential products that are currently not yet on the service contract we have established telemarketing campaigns et cetera. So really performing well. In Q3, I think, our growth rate, Shawn, correct me if I'm wrong, was 6%. And that's for the full-year still holds up in the high-single digits and low-double digits growth for the full-year on services. It has been very strong in the first-half. Now, of course, we're also facing tougher compares, because we also had strong growth in the second half of last year. Now, looking forward, again, we still have, I think ample of opportunity to go after our installed base, products that are currently not under contract, making sure that the customers, yes, understand the full benefits of being on a contract with us. We know the customers who are on the service contract are much more likely buy again from us, because they have seen the benefits of being on the service contract with Mettler-Toledo. We continue to look into the offerings we have, more sophisticated services for more complex solutions out there and that will also continue to drive momentum for us in service. I'm -- again, I'm very happy about the long-term opportunity in service and would expect it to continue to grow mid-single digit at least next year. Joshua Waldman : Got it. Appreciate all the detail, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Patrick, maybe one on, you know, when you look at the Q4 guidance sequentially stepping down from 3Q shouldn't be a surprise given your commentary. Like what is changing from a Mettler's perspective, right? Can you comment on end market, you know, pharma versus industrial, like what are you seeing in China versus non-China, trying to figure out if this is all China or ex-China you're seeing softening? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah. Good question, Vijay. I mean, the biggest part of it is, as Shawn also outlined, is absolutely China, because we had initially we had planned for double-digit to mid-double digit declines in China, I'll be facing probably again 25%, 50% decline in Q4. That's what we are planning for. That's certainly one important piece of it. The other piece is the overall budget flush that also affecting mainly the Lab business, which we basically don't account for this year. We see very limited action there from customers and we should see by now, to be honest. So we didn't factor that into the Q4 growth as well. So in that regard, it's kind of a bit unusual Q4 for the margin and I think some of our peers also mentioned that you're seeing similar lack of demand, budget flush demand at the end of the year this year. Customers are just more cautious with their spending, and they're not really using their budgets. I have contact with several key customers out there, and they said, look, we have to hold our budget together this year and we will continue to look into opportunities next year, but don't expect a big budget flush from us in Q4 this year. I think that's probably the biggest things with China together with the lack of a budget flush. In terms of the other industry, I would say no significant changes, whether it's US or Europe. Maybe a little bit in the chemical market in the US, where we saw a slowdown in Q3 and we also factored into Q4. But we have to see how that plays out long-term, unless there is a major disruption in the market, I would expect it to still be with, I would say, normal momentum going into 2024, the chemical market. Vijay Kumar : Understood. That's helpful. And Shawn, maybe one for you. Did I hear you right about pricing being normalized, you know, two points next year? Like just given Patrick's comments and end markets being little tougher, does the pricing -- like what gives you the visibility on pricing for next year? Should we assume gross margins being consistent flattish year-on-year? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. So, I mean, yeah, I think, I feel very confident with the 2% for next year. I think there's a lot of factors that go into it. Of course, we have a pretty robust process. I'm sure you're familiar with that we literally start in the summer and we go through the whole portfolio with the organization and we look at different metrics. But, I think when you step back from it all, our value proposition remains very strong. And I think that's always the key and that's why we're always of course investing in innovation to make sure we maintain that leadership in terms of the value proposition. But what we've seen is over the last couple of years is the market actually also move towards our portfolio in a way as customers seek more automated solutions, more digitalization. These are strengths of our portfolio relative to competition. And I think we're very well differentiated in many respects. And so, I think, that certainly helps us kind of maintain our pricing position versus competition. In terms of the operating margin, I mentioned flattish, but if you look at the gross margin, I think it will actually be up a little bit next year. Vijay Kumar : Fantastic. Thanks, guys. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Derik de Bruin : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So I guess the first one is, last November, when you had your Analyst Day, you raised the long-term guide to 6% to 5% for revenue growth. Look, I agree with you that China is not going to be down for a long time or not going to be down forever, and it will pick-up some point. But what do you think -- what do you think it looks like once the market sort of rebounds? I mean, we're in a different world today. Politics is different, things are different. How much of that 6% topline assumes that it was just going to be business-as-usual as it had been for those prior years and -- or what did you -- what do you embed in that guide for sort of like that China assumption with it? So I think the broad question -- I know you don't have the crystal ball, but I do think it's important. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah, it is important. Let me start and I'll let Shawn chime in, in here. So, look, we think our -- when we talk about a 6% growth long-term growth model for Mettler-Toledo, I think that number is still very relevant in the mid and long term. And there are several reasons for that. Number one, we have factory in China in that equation to be high-single digits to long-term. So it's not that the growth rates that we have seen over the last two years, but still I would say high-single digit is probably not unlikely that we will see this in the mid-term again in China. The other important piece for us, and remember, when -- that we also shifted our portfolio sequentially into faster-growing segments over time, and that continues into the Lab business and the life science market; in Industrial, automation, these are all markets that are still where we see -- will see strong demand, just given the underlying demand in different industries, whether it's related to aging working populations like a flavor out there driving automation, the whole story around digitalization, where we have a very, very strong portfolio both on the Lab side, but also on the Industrial side. And even if you look at Product Inspection, product software, products software, we have a very unique positioning out there as well. That is something that I think will continue to differentiate us and also give us the opportunity to capture market share in a few account for an underlying market growth over the mid and long term in the range of 4% to maybe 4.5%. We should get to the 6% by taking the market share that we are going after. I think we have the right portfolio, increasing our investments and we have increased our investments over the last two years significantly to also drive new solutions to the market. You will see a lot of exciting solutions coming also next year, because I'm a strong believer that differentiation will help us to drive growth, but also profitability. Shawn Vadala : And as a global company, of course, there is opportunities for us as there's changes in the landscape as well too. So we can pick up as companies start to reinvest more in maybe countries outside of China. We've already seen opportunities for our businesses in those kind of areas as well too. So I think the key for us is to always keep an eye on where the opportunities are and make sure we're there, leverage our programs to identify and pursue those opportunities. Derik de Bruin : Got it. And as a follow-up, your business is relatively short-cycle. You don't build tonnes of backlog. I'm just sort of curious on where you're getting your visibility from and particularly into that back-half ramp, which looks a little aggressive, frankly. And also in regards to the same questions, like you talked about pharma and biopharma, returning to normal -- relatively normal replacement cycle, it seems like do you -- I'm just surprised to hear you say that given what -- given what my understanding of how the business is and sort of like how your visibility is for the next couple of quarters. Can just a little bit more confidence on what sort of going into this other than sort of like tougher or easier comps in the back half of next year. Shawn Vadala : Maybe I'll start and let Patrick kind of add some color. I mean, I think, hey, I understand the point. We're typically only sitting on about a month-and-a-half worth of backlog, so I get that part. But I think if you take a step back too, like if you look at our multi-year CAGRs, kind of like four-year-type CAGRs, I mean, we are starting to see ourselves moderating here. And when you kind of look at the back half of next year versus even like 2019, you start to see more consistency from what we see here in the second half of this year. And so, I think at a high level, we think that that is reasonable. We also think that we are going to have easier comps. We know there -- our topics in China that will flush out with some excess inventory, maybe in the system from coming out of COVID. And then I think as we kind of particularly look at the fourth quarter, I think this year's fourth quarter is setting up to be a more unusual fourth quarter for the Group in terms of like lack of that end of the year uptick that we normally see in terms of market demand. And we can't predict what Q4 of next year is going to be like, but I wouldn't expect it to be the same environment that we're faced right now. You know and I'd say probably maybe one other comment is just talking to the sales organization throughout the world. And just what we hear from customers is that there is still a tremendous amount of interest out there. There's a lot of activity out there. It's just a question of when people will start to reinvest and have the funds available. Patrick Kaltenbach : Certainly. And if I may add here, the topic around destocking is something that we have seen in pipettes, that we have seen in, you know, with the sensors in our Pro business et cetera. We think in the year for more customers, most of that is behind us. I mean, you are back to normal order pattern on these consumables and sensors that are used, for example, in manufacturing. Customers don't build-up excess inventory anymore, it's also clearly what we're hearing from them, but we see in terms of the order cycles and their -- that they are back to a normal use model that with the sensors. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matthew Sykes : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just first on Europe, where there was some relative strength there, but just on the core industrial side and particularly on the chemical side, just the data points for getting things simply deteriorating, but there and you talked about the PMIs. Could you maybe talk about that as in sort of the context for '24, Europe and on the core industrial side? Patrick Kaltenbach : I'll start with it and -- on Europe, yes, we have seen actually good performance this year in the margin, but -- and Middle East they also had some easier comparisons versus China, US compared to last year, where they had -- where we had seen more growth last year in the market. That said, on the chemical market you referred to, one of our concerns going into the year was that the high-energy prices in Europe, which impacted market much more than we have seen actually it held up quite well also over Q3 for us. And I think it's two factors. Number one, it's our capability to continue to drive market share. Remember, we have a very strong sales team in Europe that goes mainly directed as -- and we leverage our -- also our Spinnaker sales capabilities to direct our sales team to opportunities very quickly and also address hot segments like lithium-ion batteries, et cetera, which help us to compensate some shortfalls in other areas. We are, of course, a bit more cautious on Q4 and expect also much more moderate 2024. You're right, the PMIs also point downwards, it's why we are more cautious next year. The investment sentiment across Europe, I would say, is, if you go to Southern Europe and Spain, for example, or Portugal, which are quite significant market for us, it's quite healthy. On the other hand, Europe -- within Europe, Germany has been slower this year than we thought it would be, but we also see a lot of excitement, for example, in France. France has put a France 2030 plan in place, where they plan to invest in some of these core technologies in pharma, biopharma, in semiconductors, but also into lithium-ion battery and energy market, which I think will continue to drive growth moving forward. So, again, overall for Europe next year, very moderate, but long-term, I think it has still holds our model that we expect low-to-mid single-digit growth from Europe. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. And just to maybe -- Matthew Sykes : And then just one -- Shawn Vadala : Go ahead. Yeah. Matthew Sykes : Go ahead, Shawn. Shawn Vadala : I was just going to say, just to answer your question specifically for next year, we're a little bit more cautious on Europe in core industrial specifically, probably expecting it to be more, more flattish next year. And this again after coming on top of some really solid numbers this year and clearly frankly exceeded our expectations for the year. And then for Europe in total for next year, since I'm hitting it, we're probably looking at growth up slightly for the year overall. Matthew Sykes : Got it. Thank you for that color. And then, maybe just following-up on Derik's question on the second-half next year assumptions. Shawn, if we were to kind of look at the comp impact and then inventory destocking, where there might be some level of visibility that going away. Could you kind of isolate what your assumptions are for just underlying demand growth in the back-half, in the context of the second-half recovery, if that's possible? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. I'm sorry, Matt. I don't have that level of triangularity in our model. And of course -- they, of course -- it's very early to start trying to give specific for any quarter for next year. I think we always try to share what we know at this time of the year, recognizing it's early, but we feel like it helps everybody to know at least what's on our mind and it helps you to think about how to organize your models. But of course as we get into the year, we'll refine the things as we learn more about trends as we enter the year. Matthew Sykes : Got it. I appreciate that. Thanks, Shawn and thanks, Patrick. Shawn Vadala : You're welcome. Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead. Patrick Donnelly : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Shawn, maybe one for you, just in terms of next year, do you mind just breaking out kind of the segment forecast? You know, it's usually pretty helpful just to hear kind of that sub-segment detail and maybe geographies too. I know you mentioned Europe and China. Shawn Vadala : Yeah, sure. So, hey, maybe I'll -- some of this might repeat what I've already said, but I'll just kind of go top-to-bottom just to make sure everybody gets it. So, I think, you know, the overall sales growth for the full-year next year is flattish. And so, if we start with Lab, we expect Lab to be up slightly. We expect, core industrial to be down slightly. We expect Product Inspection to be up slightly. And then we expect Food Retail to be down probably mid-single digit, might be a little bit more than that. From a geographical perspective, we expect, as I mentioned before, China to be down high-single digit with a bigger decrease in the second -- in the first half of the year and growth in the second half of the year. And then we expect the Americas and Europe to be up slightly. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. That's helpful. Shawn Vadala : You know, slightly low-single digit. Patrick Donnelly : Yes. Go ahead. Yeah, I got you. And then maybe one on the earnings side, Shawn. I mean, just looking at 4Q, you know, in typical years, it's about a-third of the year in terms of earnings. Yeah, you're a little bit below $11 here for 4Q. I mean, just take that as a run rate, right, it kind of suggests something like $33. You know, the guidance for next year is more $39. I guess, is there something holding 4Q down, it goes away next year? I'm just trying to think about that as a jumping-off point and just bridging the gap to get to that guidance for next year on the earning side relative to what 4Q seems to imply. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. I mean, I feel like you're trying to take a low quarter and try to extrapolate. And of course, the fourth quarter has this dynamic that we talked about with not having your typical year-end market demand, you know. And so -- so I'd be a little bit cautious to try to do any correlations off of that and of course, the way we're building it up is a lot more granular. Looking at the different levers and trying to pull it altogether and so we feel good about the guide that we've provided. And of course, there's a lot of moving parts. Things are dynamic, but I think we still stay very committed to operational excellence inside the Company. I mean, the culture is just amazing. The amount of agility and the amount of resilience is really impressive. And the organization is doing very well in that regard. And like I mentioned before, we do try to find the right balance for the medium and long term here too. And I think we were striking that with this guidance. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. No, so 4Q seems maybe like a little more of a depressed number than how you think about next year, I guess. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. I appreciate, guys. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. Shawn Vadala : Hi, Jack. Jack Meehan : So, one of your peers called out lab closures is impacting demand as they went through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. You obviously have really good visibility into this, probably amongst the best in the peer group. I was just curious what you're seeing in that regard, if that's kind of a factor that's playing into the outlook. Shawn Vadala : Yeah, maybe I'll start, Jack. So, I mean, hey, the only thing I've really heard about is like there's certainly a lot of small start-up biotech that have gone out of business. Some articles on that kind of recently. But, as you know, that's not a big part of our business. I mean, it has a smaller effect on maybe our pipetting business, but a lot of our portfolio really isn't geared towards early research. So less of an impact for us, but other than that we're not hearing anything. Patrick Kaltenbach : No, absolutely not. Jack Meehan : Okay. And then on Food Retail, so, I just look back over the last decade, this has been, you know, give or take a $200 million business, you're there. This year, you're obviously trending well above that. Do you view this as pull-forward from future years? Is there some risk that this could swing below the trendline before we can get to equilibrium? Shawn Vadala : It's always a lumpy business, you know, like we've had some years where it's been down recently. It's nice to see retail have a great year. But beyond just being lumpy, we've actually won some new accounts in the US and in Europe. So the teams, it's actually done a really great job with that. So you have like the cyclicality of investment cycles, but then, I think we have won a couple of nice -- you know, a couple of really nice projects here. And then we've also have come out with some new innovations in the last couple of years, some new things that have added onto our portfolio or refresh of the portfolio, I should say, that has been really well received in the marketplace as well too. But I would never extrapolate anything from retail, because it's always lumpy. Our visibility into next year is that we see that we should have another really good year of project activity. But given the comparison, it's still going to be down a little bit. And -- but going forward, I think, it's always better to have a long-term view on retail. We still view it as like a long-term a lower-single digit kind of growth business, but pleased to see how well it's doing this year. Jack Meehan : Okay. Thank you, Shawn. Shawn Vadala : Yeah, welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rachel Vatnsdal : Thanks. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. So, first up, I just wanted to see if you could spend a few minutes talking about your exit rates of how the segments performed in the month of September and then so far into October and early-November here. And then you mentioned during Derik's question four-year CAGR on the volume side is seeing some stabilization there that gives you confidence into the back-half ramp next year. So can you just talk about, are those CAGRs that you are applying referring to really about the overall 3Q CAGR or are you just looking at some of the exit rates here, given it sounds like July and August were likely a bit stronger? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Hey, Rachel. So maybe I'll start with the second part of your question. So from a CAGR perspective, we're kind of looking at what we saw in Q3 and how we're guiding Q4. And then just kind of taking a step back and applying our own judgment as to like that looks reasonable to us as kind of a moderation or normalization rate as we kind of think about next year. And then in terms of like exiting and entering, you know, we usually don't try to comment too much on individual months. But I would say that we certainly understood both of those numbers as we were providing guidance on the fourth quarter here. And if it helps at all, maybe, I haven't really touched upon guidance for the fourth quarter, but I can maybe just run through that by segment just to provide a little bit more color in terms of how we're thinking about the different parts of the business. So we were looking at for the fourth quarter Lab being down in the 10% kind of a range. We're looking at core industrial being down mid-single digit. Our Product Inspection being down high-single digit, but with Retail growing in the 20% kind of a range. And then from a geographic perspective, I've already mentioned, China being down like mid-20s. And then from a geographic perspective, the Americas being down mid-single digits, with Europe being down low-single digit. Rachel Vatnsdal : All right. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to press a little bit more on that first-half, second-half dynamic here. You talked about China being pretty pressured in the first-half and then starting to get optimistic about growth in the back half of the year. But I wanted to press on those types of assumptions around the Lab and Industrial businesses. How much of a meaningful step-up should we see in growth rates in both of those segments next year and then again how much of that is really driven off the easier comp dynamic versus underlying demand accelerating? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. I mean, like I said before, I mean, I think we expect Lab for the full-year to be up slightly. And then we expect on the Industrial side, overall, it's going to be flattish with core industrial down slightly and Product Inspection up slightly. I think, China, of course, is going to be a big part of like the seasonality next year. And so, I would expect things to be relatively down in the first half of the year and then up in the second half of the year. But, like I said earlier, we don't have specifics to share regarding some of the other granularity of how we would arrive at that. And as we -- like I said before, as we enter the year, we'll have more visibility and can provide -- help you refine models and provide more color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. Please go ahead. Catherine Schulte : Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. Maybe first, you mentioned manufacturing customers in Americas remained cautious with spend on new equipment. I know you talked about Product Inspection being up slightly next year. But maybe talk about the outlook for that customer group in '24, and what gets them to start being a little more constructive around spend. Shawn Vadala : Yeah, maybe I'll start, Catherine, and then I'll let Patrick pick it up. So, you know, so, hey, we've talked a lot about food manufacturing over the last couple of years. I'd say, overall, it's probably exceeded our expectations to a certain degree this year. But we do see a lot of pressure on that segment, kind of going into the fourth quarter and by this time we have enough visibility to say that. So, for the fourth quarter of this year, we're seeing, you know, negative results or declines, I should say, both in the Americas, but frankly, also in Europe. That market segment has been under a lot of pressure in terms of their own cost structure. Their own challenges with inflation and you've seen some of the food companies closing plans, executing restructuring plans, a lot of antidotes from our team say like, like a lot of other things like, hey, there's a lot of interest there, but they're just not getting approved, things are getting held off to a certain degree. But outside of the Americas and Europe, we're also seeing actually good growth at the moment. And as we kind of enter into 2024, this is a really good example, where we have a lot of nice innovation in the portfolio coming out. We have a lot of good products in different areas of Product Inspection, like in the x-ray business, I think we talked about it in our prepared remarks. We have good stuff also coming out in metal detection as well. And in the innovation and the new products are being very, very well-received by the marketplace. We just heard some updates yesterday about some antidotes from a trade show that the guys were recently at and really good market reception of some of the new products. So, we feel good about what we're doing what we can control and how we're positioning. It's just a much more -- it's a difficult market environment, but it's frankly been like that for a little while. It's been a little bit up and down, but the value proposition is still there, right, like the need to help these companies with productivity. We can really help them and I think they recognize that. So I think that's still there. And then just the focus on food safety and brand protection, you know, you see things in the news in that regard. And of course, that we certainly can help companies as they seek to address those needs as well too. Catherine Schulte : Okay. Great. And any update on how PendoTECH is performing and your thoughts on there going forward? Patrick Kaltenbach : I can take this. Yes. So PendoTECH again for us has been performing really well over the last years. I mean, integration went really well with PendoTECH. Of course, they are strongly dependent on the underlying biopharma market and we have seen a slowdown compared to the years before. That shouldn't be surprise, but what we have done with PendoTECH is we expanded also the offering there. We have new parts within their portfolio. So that's not only pressure sensors, they also have now UV monitorings -- monitors, et cetera in their portfolio. So while, of course, we see lower demand compared to last year, we think the portfolio is really, really strong, and of course, by expanding it also different application wages, we are quite optimistic on PendoTECH's future, although we are seeing negative growth here.

Last night, we reported our fourth quarter financial results, the details of which are outlined for you on Page 3 of our presentation. As previously announced, to transition to a new external European logistic service provider, significantly impacted our fourth quarter results, which we expect to largely recapture in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of these delayed shipments, our results were in line with our previous expectations. Market demand has remained weak in China and across our core end markets of pharma and biopharma, food manufacturing and chemicals, but also does not appear to have deteriorated further. Looking forward, we expect market conditions to remain soft in the first half of the year, and we would then expect our sales return to growth in the second half of the year as we begin to let easier comparisons. We are focused on the things we can control, including increasing our competitive advantages through innovation and continuous improvement of corporate programs and nurturing our unique global culture. I'm confident these actions will drive market share gains and help us emerge stronger in market recovery. Let me now turn the call over to Shawn to cover the financial results for the quarter and our guidance for the year, and then I will come back with some additional commentary on the business. Shawn? Shawn Vadala : Thanks, Patrick, and good morning, everyone. Sales in the quarter were $935 million, which represented a decrease in local currency of 13%. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales declined 12% as currency increased sales growth by 1%. On Slide number four, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales declined 7% in the Americas, 16% in Europe, and 18% in Asia, rest of the world. Local currency sales in China declined 23% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the previously disclosed shipping delays related to a new logistics provider in Europe, we estimate our sales in Q4 declined about 7%, with the Americas down approximately 3%, Europe down approximately 6% and Asia down approximately 14%. On Slide number five, we show sales growth by region for the full year 2023. Local currency sales declined 3% in 2023, with sales in the Americas down 1%, Europe down 2%, and Asia, rest of the world, down 5%. Local currency sales decreased 10% in China for 2023. Excluding the logistics headwind in Q4, we estimate our full year sales decline approximately 1%, with the Americas flat, Europe up 1%, and Asia down 5%. On Slide number six, we summarize local currency sales growth by product area. For the quarter, laboratory sales decreased 18% and industrial decreased 8% with core industrial down 6% and product inspection down 10%. Food retail grew 9%. Service sales grew 6% in the quarter. Excluding the logistics delays, we estimate laboratory product sales decline approximately 11%, industrial declined 5% with core industrial down 2% and product inspection down 10% and food retail grew 17%. The next slide shows local currency sales growth by product area for the full year 2023. Laboratory sales decreased 7% and industrial sales declined 1% with core industrial down 1% and product inspection flat. Food retail increased 27%. Service sales grew 10% in 2023. Excluding the logistic delays, we estimate laboratory product sales declined approximately 5%, industrial was flat across both core industrial and product inspection and food retail grew 29%. Let me now move to the rest of the P&L, which is summarized on Slide number eight. Gross margin was 59%, a decrease of 80 basis points due to our lower volume offset in part by positive pricing and our cost savings initiatives. R&D amounted to $46.4 million in the quarter, which is a 3% decrease in local currency over the prior year. SG&A amounted to $223.4 million, a 4% decrease in local currency compared to the prior year and benefits from our cost saving initiatives and lower variable compensation. Adjusted operating profit amounted to $281.8 million in the quarter, a 21% decrease. Adjusted operating margin was 30.1%, which represents a decrease of 380 basis points from the prior year due to our decreased volume. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $18.1 million in the quarter, interest expense was $19.7 million and other income amounted to $1.6 million. Our effective tax rate was 19% in the quarter. This rate is before discrete items and adjusting for the timing of stock option exercises. Fully diluted shares amounted to $21.7 million, which was approximately a 3% decline from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $9.40, a 22% decrease over the prior year. On a reported basis, EPS was $8.52 as compared to $11.86 in the prior year. Reported EPS in the quarter includes $0.23 of purchase and tangible immunization, $0.49 of restructuring costs and a $0.16 tax headwind from the timing of option exercises. The next slide illustrates our year-to-date results. Local currency sales declined 3% for the year. Adjusted operating income decreased 3% or flat, excluding unfavorable foreign currency and our adjusted operating margin was flat at 30.4% for the year. Adjusted EPS declined 4% in 2023, excluding the impact of unfavourable currency for the year. Adjusted EPS declined 1%. That covers the P&L. Let me now comment on cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $260.1 million, a conversion of approximately 130% of adjusted net income due to favourable working capital. In 2023, free cash flow was $908 million, up 20% over last year on a per-year basis due to the reduction in working capital with a conversion of approximately 109% of adjusted net income. Let me now turn to guidance for the first quarter and for the full year. First, while we are extremely disappointed by the shipping delays in the fourth quarter from our third-party logistics provider, we have seen good momentum so far this year in catching up on these delayed shipments and continue to expect to largely recover them in the first quarter. Secondly, given the soft trends across most of our core end markets in the global economy, we expect our customers to be cautious with their investments to start off the year. We're also closely watching events in the Middle East and other potential impacts the war could have on logistics and other costs for our suppliers and customers. Lastly, as a reminder, we have implemented many cost savings programs during the second half of last year to mitigate the impact of lower demand. We continue to expect to maintain and add to these savings in 2024, but also face headwinds from resetting variable compensation programs and inflation. Now turning to our guidance, for the first quarter of 2024, we expect local currency sales to decline approximately 4% to 6%. This forecast includes an approximate 5% benefit from the delayed shipments in the fourth quarter. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $7.35 to $7.75. Currency at recent spot rates for the quarter would be less than a 1% headwind to first quarter sales, but a headwind to adjusted EPS of approximately 4%. For the full year 2024, we expect local currency sales to grow approximately 1% to 2%, which is up from our previous guidance of approximately flattish to reflect the shift of our delayed shipments from our European logistics hub from Q4 into Q1 of this year. We expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $39.60 to $40.30, which compares to our prior guidance of $39.10 to $39.80. This includes an expected headwind to adjusted EPS growth of approximately 2% from unfavorable foreign exchange. Lastly, I'll share a few comments on our 2024 guidance. We expect total amortization, including purchased intangible amortization to be approximately $73 million. Purchased intangible amortization is excluded from adjusted EPS and is estimated at $26 million on a pre-tax basis or $0.99 per share. Interest expense forecast at $84 million for the year and other income is estimated at approximately $3 million. We expect our tax rate before discrete items will remain at 19% in 2024. We expect free cash flow of approximately $850 million, representing a conversion of approximately 100% of adjusted net income. We continue to expect share repurchases of approximately $850 million in 2024. That's it for my side, and I'll now turn it back to Patrick. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks Shawn. Let me start with some comments on our operating businesses, starting with Lab. As we had expected, demand trends across most of our Lab customers remained weak in the fourth quarter, especially pharma and biopharma. Sales declined across most product categories, and we continue to see soft demand across all geographies, especially in China. While market conditions have been weaker, we continue to focus on the things we can control, which includes bringing new innovations to market, enhancing our sales and marketing programs and expanding our service offering and capacity. This past year saw the launch of many exciting new and upgraded products. We are excited about our innovation pipeline, and we believe organizations that maintain their growth investments during market downturns will emerge even stronger during recovery periods. Our investments have had a particular emphasis on supporting our customers' needs for laboratory automation and data integrity requirements, which we are confident will be a significant driver of continued market share gains going forward, and we are excited to share with you additional developments over the coming months. Switching to our industrial business, sales for the quarter were in line with our previous guidance, despite the headwind from delays from our European logistics hub. Core industrial demand in the Americas and in Europe has been relatively resilient this past year, despite declines in purchasing manager indexes. We continue to see solid interest from customers looking for advanced automation solutions, and we expect to benefit from customer investments in on-shoring and near-shoring over the coming year. Regarding our product inspection business, we have seen weak food manufacturing customer demand in Europe and soft demand in the Americas. We continue to target faster-growing segments and have a focus on engaging new customers with a refreshed portfolio of innovative solutions. Lastly, food retail results were very strong, excluding the negative impact from our European logistics hub. We had solid performance for the year due to strong project activity, particularly in the Americas. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales in Europe, excluding the estimated impact from our European logistics hub delays, were softer than we had expected, following resilient performance for much of the year. As mentioned earlier, weak demand from European food manufacturing customers weighed on our product inspection business. Additionally, we also saw softer than expected demand from our Lab and core industrial customers in the quarter. We remain cautious on the outlook for Europe due to low PMI readings in the region, the continuing war in the Ukraine, and the potential for additional impacts for the economy from the conflict in the Middle East. Turning now to the Americas, our results for the quarter, excluding estimated logistic headwinds, were slightly better than we had expected due to static core industrial demand and robust food retail growth. Going forward, we are well positioned to capture increased demand from emerging growth industries and onshoring activities. Finally, Asia and the rest of the world results were slightly better than we had expected, as our core industrial sales declines in China were less than we had anticipated. Pharma and biopharma demand in China has remained very weak, and we continue to expect reduced demand for the first half of the year. Our team is doing an excellent job adjusting to the current market conditions. We are confident in the long term growth opportunity for our business in the region. That concludes my comments on the fourth quarter results. Now I'd like to share with you some deeper insights on the next wave of sales and marketing initiatives we have introduced to our Spinnaker program and a few examples of enhancements that are on the way. To start, and as a reminder, the significant diversity of our business and the fragmented customer base means we need to set a set of sophisticated tools, analytics and processes to identify, prioritize and pursue the most attractive and profitable growth opportunities for our sales teams, with a specific focus on new customer opportunities and cross-selling opportunities within our existing customers. Spinnaker is our global excellence program in sales, service and marketing that enables us to drive sales growth and gain market share. Continuous improvement is an important part of our strategy and culture, and it is very much at the heart of our Spinnaker program. We constantly enhance and refine our initiatives, releasing new waves of enhancements to the program periodically that build on previous waves of initiatives, reinforcing our strong foundation and increasing our competitive advantages. We are currently launching the sixth wave of Spinnaker, which is focused on leveraging new possibilities offered by digitalization of processes and further enhancing the customer experience. I'd like to share with you some tangible examples of the initiatives we have on the way, starting with our digitalization efforts. This year, we are making multiple improvements to our top K and [ph] salesforce guidance programs. As a reminder, in addition to generating sales leads for various marketing activities, our top K program provides our field teams with tailored and actionable investment alerts about specific sales opportunities that are generated by proprietary data analytics and deep learning software solutions, leveraging external data sources and our own internal databases. These sales opportunity alerts are created fully automatically, qualified and are fed into our CRM. In addition to expanding our top K program to more areas of our business, this next wave of Spinnaker features a significant expansion of data sources to feed our big data warehouse, enabling Spinnaker to provide intelligent prioritization of target sites for our field sales teams. This also enables real time smart profile reports to ensure timely follow up and the most accurate background of potential customers, including data on the digital engagements with us. Other improvements include expanded capabilities to Other improvements include expanded capabilities to optimize and prioritize our marketing activities, including campaigns for replacing aging equipment across our install base. This wave of Spinnaker also features additional big data capabilities to support our sales team cross-selling efforts. With each of our product categories having their own dedicated sales specialists, cross-selling is a very important growth opportunity for us because leads generated by colleagues in other product areas have high conversion rates. Today, our cross-selling penetration to existing customers is still rather low, but big data analytics across our CRM and various processes is helping us unlock sales leads across our businesses, including from our service teams, and Spinnaker is an excellent tool to help provide additional transparency on these sales opportunities. Now, from a customer perspective, we are also advancing several important enhancements to Spinnaker to improve our customer experience. We have previously focused on increasing our digital connectivity with our customers. However, we now see additional opportunities to provide advanced platforms that will create impactful experiences that further strengthen our customer relationship and overall value proposition. Examples include offering customers the ability to gain deep insights across the install base of Mettler-Toledo instruments, be it access to calibration certificates or known last service dates, or contract coverage or renewal agreements. We have also enhanced our integration to do customer systems to streamline the entire procure-to-pay process. By offering various levels and types of integration, from punch out to order and invoice integration, we aim to increase productivity and drive process efficiencies for our customers. We already receive about 40% of product orders, mainly consumables and less complex products, through digital interfaces today, providing a seamless and efficient buying experience for our customers. Our customer portal allows customers to browse personalized product catalogs, review real-time inventory levels, and manage orders all in one place. Our end-to-end order management systems include efficient tracking and management of both online and offline orders, and includes an intuitive product selection and configuration process. For less complex products that do not require support from our specialists, customers can easily find specific products and use our smart configuration tool to simplify their ordering. One element of the next wave of Spinnaker includes improving the order process by leveraging new technologies to facilitate assisted experience with a Mettler-Toledo expert. This includes enhanced chat functionality, click to book a meeting, the Toledo sales representative, or digital sales rooms that automatically guide customers through the product selection process, and provide them all the information they need at any time to make an informed decision. For more complex solutions, in addition to providing on-site demonstrations of our instruments, we also provide virtual demonstrations to customers that are very effective. As part of our continuous improvement, we have revamped the studio setups of our virtual demos, making it more efficient and focused, significantly reducing preparation time by curating a series of demonstration menus based on customers' most frequently asked questions. This helps to a comprehensive demo that addresses customers' questions in a very concise way. Customers have already reported an enhanced experience, gaining a deeper, more intuitive understanding of our instruments and our representatives find it easier to showcase our product features, and it makes technical details more accessible and adjustable with this new approach. Lastly, to ensure we are meeting and exceeding our customers' expectations through every step of their journey with our sales teams, we have also begun to implement customer feedback loops and net promoter scores for product sales, in addition to what we are already doing, or what we already do for our service teams. This has proven to be a very effective source of opportunities for process improvements, and we expect improved results with our expanded program. So, I hope these few examples give you a flavour for the much broader set of new initiatives that are underway with our new Spinnaker program. We believe they will continue to expand our sales and marketing lead over our competition and ensure our teams are spending their time with the most attractive opportunities and optimize our win rates, while further strengthening our customer relationship. So, that is the conclusion of our prepared remarks. Operator, I'd like now to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] We'll go first to Jack Meehan at Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. Shawn, just wanted to start. It would be great to get your forecast by segment for the first quarter and for the year. Shawn Vadala : Yeah, sure. So, let me start with the lab business. So, we expect lab in Q4, I'm sorry, in Q1 2024 to be down low to mid-single digit, and for the full year, we expect it to be up low single digit. For core industrial, we expect Q1 to be down mid-single digit, and for the full year to be flattish. Product inspection, we expect to be down mid-single digit for Q1, and for the full year, flattish and then retail, we expect to be down about 10% in Q1, and for the full year, down mid-to-high single digit. And then if we look at the geographies, we expect the Americas to be down low single digit in Q1, and then for the full year, up low single digit. We expect Europe to be up low single digit in Q1, but in up low to mid-single digit for the full year. We expect China to be down low to mid-20s in Q1, and down high single digit for the full year. Jack Meehan : Excellent. And then just as a follow-up, what does your first quarter guidance assume for EBIT margins, and can you just walk us through the pacing throughout the year, what kind of bridges to the full year forecast? Shawn Vadala : Yeah, sure. So in the first quarter, of course, the first quarter, we're going to have a significant volume decline in the first half of the year. So for the first quarter, we're going to be down over 200 basis points, probably in the 230, 240 kind of basis point range. Now, it's important to understand, too, like currency has a pretty big effect on the first quarter. So it's probably like 100% negative headwind to our margin in the first quarter, and I think we called out in the press release a 4% headwind to earnings per share. But that's going to change quite a bit as we get into the second half of the year, especially the fourth quarter and so for the full year, we're looking at the operating margin to be up in the kind of like 30 bps kind of a range, and if you exclude currency, it's probably in like the 70 bps, 70 bps plus kind of bps kind of a range. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Daniel Arias at Stifel. Daniel Arias : Hi, guys. Thanks for the questions. Shawn, maybe just going back to the guide, if you take out the $58 million and you add it to 2024, it does get you to that upper point or two that you're guiding to, but in order to have the dollars be the same, it seems like the outlook would need to be for three points or so of growth. So is there something else that's amounting to a partial offset? How do you see the outlook now versus last quarter when you exclude the logistics issue? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Hey, Dan, it's a fair point. Like as you mentioned, we built the -- we expect the shipping delays to largely benefit the first quarter of this year and so we acknowledge there's upside to the full year guidance because in addition to that benefit, there's also like a growth rate benefit as we get to the end of the year in the fourth quarter, given the base that we're kind of growing off of, but when we kind of step back from all that, we just kind of felt like it's still very early in the year and while we're not seeing anything new in the business, Patrick talked about in the prepared marks that yes, there's still challenges in the market, but just want to confirm we're not seeing anything new at this point, but it's still early in the year. We just prefer to be a little bit cautious given various uncertainties and the back waiting of the year, but when we look at the second half of the year, we still feel good. We feel like we're really well positioned for the second half. We talked about some of these new product launches in the prepared remarks. We have a lot of really exciting programs that we're launching. We spent a little bit of time talking about Spinnaker 6 in the prepared remarks, but there's other corporate programs that we're working on as well. So we feel like we are well positioned for the second half and just acknowledge I think there's a little bit of upside. Yeah, we're being a little bit cautious as we start the year, but we just want to see how things play out a little bit. Daniel Arias : Okay. So just to be clear here, you're not passing along the full amount of the logistics offset, but you also don't see anything in the end market makeup that has you feeling less confident than before or that has you looking for less growth than before. Is that a fair summation? Shawn Vadala : Yeah, I think that's fair. Daniel Arias : Okay. And then just as a follow up, maybe from an end market standpoint, it would be great if you could just give any color you could on the degree to which sentiment on China has changed in the quarter versus last quarter. Maybe it hasn't at all, but it would be good to get sort of an updated view on the word on the street when it comes to ground level conversations, thoughts on rebound, etcetera. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah, I'll take that. Look, Shawn and I have been in China in December and of course we're in continued conversations with the local team there, sales management team to see if there are any changes. I would say China at the moment is still quite weak, especially in pharma, biopharma, but from our perspective, the situation has not deteriorated from what we reported on at the JPMorgan conference. Clearly they have seen still facing many headwinds. There has been very significant spending and growth during the COVID period, but right now we are facing a situation where there's a lack of stimulus from the government. There's a lot of uncertainty still there. There is some reduced foreign investment as well. So all of the economy that is focused on stabilizing the real estate market and I think that in itself leads to just also softer demand at the moment, but overall it hasn't changed. As I said in my comments, core industrial has been actually a bit better than expected in Q4, but we remain a bit cautious on our outlook, still in the first half of '24 and the second half will be easier for us because we have much easier compares. As a reminder, we had been down 25% in Q3 last year, 23% in Q4. This year, we told you that the first half will be down. So the second half will be now for us in '24, there'll be an easier compare. I think we have a lot of good strategic drivers there. We have a very strong team and we are confident that we will be able to continue getting market share with our programs, our products that we have there and there's also long-term that the market in China has, as we told you before, has high single entry growth opportunities. Daniel Arias : Okay. Thank you guys. Operator : We'll go next to Derik de Bruin at Bank of America. Derik de Bruin : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So can you talk a little bit about more about what you had to do to sort of like fix the logistical issues and what your third party is, and I guess just are you confident that these are not going to be at Red debt? And you made some sort of allusion to or comment about the Middle East. Are you seeing, what do you think is really sort of the risk there? I don't think you ship much through the Red Sea, but can you just sort of talk about sort of like what you've done to sort of ameliorate and fix some of the issues around that? Thanks. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Hey, Derek, maybe I'll start off. So maybe I'll start off with the latter part of the question with the Red Sea and the Middle East. Of course we do have things coming from Asia that are on boats or ships going through the Red Sea. So we will have higher freight costs a little bit as we kind of go this year, but I think the bigger thing is really what does that mean to our customers? It's not really directly related to us, as you say. It's really about what does it mean to our customers? So I think there's still an unknown there. I know, especially in Europe, there's been a lot of sensitivity around various inflationary topics over the last couple of years, whether it's all the geopolitics that have put pressure on energy costs or whether it's just inflation in general. This is just another thing kind of in the mix. In terms of our business, just to be clear, you're right. We don't sell very much at all into that region. So it's not a direct impact at all. In terms of what are we doing to improve the logistical situation, Patrick, did you want to take that? Patrick Kaltenbach : Sure, I can take that. We are making actually quite pleased with the ongoing progress that we're making and we are also expecting really to work down the backlog during Q1. We have a lot of our own experts there on site as well to help the local management team of our service partner there to get all the processes in place and stabilized, which have been the issue during Q4 when we transferred the full 100% of the volume from our former logistics provider to this new logistics provider. There are a lot more comprehensive processes involved on site there, like mini finish processes, etcetera and that can be brought our experts there to help them understand these processes, build enough capacity and making sure that everything from product into the logistics center to product out of the logistics center, that process flow is stable and really matching the volumes that we are expecting. As I said, we're making good progress there. We expect the backlog to go down and having a more stable operation clearly at the end of Q1 and while it still might maintain some more oversight from us during the next couple of quarters, we are confident that this is a very good logistics provider moving forward and that they can deliver the performance that we expect from them. Derik de Bruin : Got it. And then just one follow-up. Where are we on the stocking issues and pipette tips and sensors and all that? Can you just sort of like give us an update? Is there still waiting for customers to burn down inventory? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah, I'll start with it and Shawn, feel free to chime in. When you mentioned pipette tips, I think we're done with the pipette tip stocking issue and the reason why I'm saying that is that we see now more normal order patterns, meaning customers are ordering more frequently, not at very high volumes, but the order pattern is back to normal. So while the volume is still a bit lower than during -- or still lower than during the pandemic, the frequency of orders has normalized and that for me is an indication that the overstocking of pipette tips is behind us. We still are working down or our customers are still working down some inventory more on the process analytics business with the sensors they have ordered, mainly also in the biopharma area and we expect that to remain through Q1 and Q2 and then by the end of Q2 or towards the second half of the year, that's at least what we're hearing right now from the channels. They should also have worked off that inventory as well. Operator : We'll go next to Joshua Waldman at Cleveland Research. Joshua Waldman : Patrick, I'm wondering if you could -- hey, guys. I'm wondering if you could give Patrick -- hey, Patrick. Hey, Patrick, I'll start with you. I'm wondering if you could give an update on just how you perceive visibility in the business. Has visibility improved or deteriorated over the last 90 days? I guess like you commented that market conditions seem to have stabilized or are not getting worse, but maybe also mentioned seeing a softer start to the year. Can you just kind of unpack what you're seeing there? Patrick Kaltenbach : Sure, absolutely. And again, I'll probably give you some insights into the different regions, but also the different end markets. So, what we're seeing is a lot of very good activity out there, meaning customers are really interested, especially in the new products that we have launched over the last year and that's why we are so excited also about the future. There is good customer engagement. We have a lot of discussions. Still, it takes longer than normal to close the opportunities to orders, and that's also a sign that our customers are still reluctant to really spend the budgets that they have now at hand, or maybe they have some reduced budgets, but there's really very good activity, and if I look into the leads and the funnel that we have, the opportunities, I think we are quite positive about the momentum we are seeing there and we don't see any further deterioration from what we had seen last year. So, that's why we positioned in saying, hey, the underlying market visions haven't deteriorated further, whether it's in the biopharma market, where it's still soft, whether it's in the industrial space, where we see actually a very good demand for industrial automation and digitalization efforts, and we have a great portfolio as well. We saw a bit softening, especially in Europe, on product inspection towards the -- or throughout Q4, and also now starting into Q1 and that's largely in Europe, and its big customers in the food area that are still holding back budgets. They have projects, but they are not ready to spend the money yet and I think that's also based on the fact that they are under pressure. If you read the news, you hear a lot of news about these packaged food customers that are also under pressure with reduced profits and bigger demand as well. But otherwise, I would say markets are stable. The regions have developed as we expected it, and China, I outlined already, the US, good demand, and Shawn has outlined the growth for the year for the different regions as well. The EU is a bit softer at the moment. It was very resilient last year. At the moment, it's a bit softer than we have seen it last year, especially in Germany. Joshua Waldman : Okay. Thanks for that. And then, Shawn, for the follow-up, I wondered if you could walk through the moving pieces on the '24 EPS raise. How much of the raise was from the shipping-related revenue push-out versus other inputs like FX and maybe margin? I guess the impetus of the question is you missed the Q4 guide by calling it $1.20. Shouldn't that have been added to the '24 guide, or were there other moving pieces that were missing? Shawn Vadala : Yeah, it's very much related to how we position sales. Like, and I think I go back to Dan's question towards the beginning, it's very much how we position our sales guidance. In terms of margins and costs, there's, of course, some moving pieces within there. There's a couple of nits and gnats, but I'd say in the end, I feel like the margin is actually, I feel good about our margin guidance for the year. I think we'd already mentioned it earlier, but for the operating margin, it should go up about 30 basis points on a full-year basis and if you exclude currency, it's probably about 70 basis points. So, Josh, I kind of go back. It's very much to how we were thinking of a reflection of how we guided on the top line. Joshua Waldman : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Next, we'll go to Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of guidance questions. Your Q1 minus 6% to minus 7% guidance, like, if I go back to Q4, pre-logistics, I think the guide was minus high single and if you assume the first half of '24 to be similar to last year, one would have assumed Q1 to be down high singles, but now given the timing of these logistic push-out, the revenues push-out, shouldn't Q1 have been a little bit better than the minus 6% to minus 7%? I'm just trying to think about the year-on-year versus the sequential cadence and how you're looking at Q1 guidance. Shawn Vadala : Yeah, sure, Vijay. I'm happy to answer that one. So, hey, just to clarify, our Q1 guidance and constant currencies is minus 4% to minus 6%. So, it's minus 4% to minus 6% and as we mentioned, there is about a 5% benefit here from the shipping delays, which I can understand asking a question about that. But I think there's also a few things that are very important to our first quarter. The first one is that comps really do matter. Yes, Q1 was our strongest quarter last year. We grew 7%, but I think it's important to kind of go back to the couple of years before that, like what we're growing on top of and we're really cycling a very difficult multi-year comparison. If you kind of go back, we grew 14% in Q1 of 2022, and that was on top of 18% growth in Q1 of 2021. So, I think it's hard for us to ignore that as we're looking at the first quarter here. China, of course, we were happy that it came in a little bit better than what we expected if you excluded the effect of the shipping delay, but nonetheless, it's still down over 20% and as we kind of look here at the first quarter, we have 20% of our business kind of down, low to mid-20s in the first quarter. So, that's another thing that's a bit on our mind and again, that's a bit of a comparison topic as well as kind of like this resetting that's going on in the country. But just to be clear, we're not seeing anything new in our end markets, but we do assume that customers here are going to likely start the year a bit more cautious with a more normalized budget flush at the end of the year, but of course, we acknowledge it's early. It's difficult for us to tell at this point in time. March is a very important month in the first quarter, but that's kind of how at least we were thinking about Q1 at this point in time. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And then one on what's being assumed for share count, share repurchases, and is free cash conversion expected to be similar to fiscal '23? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. So, our share buyback assumption is $850 million, which I think is the same or similar number as we're thinking free cash flow for this year and that's also assuming plus or minus right around 100% free cash flow conversion. So, we're really happy with the focus around the company on cash flow. It's something we always like to focus on and very pleased with the teams around the world, all the efforts on working capital and all the other things that go into efficient end-to-end processes that can drive an order to cash cycle. So, it's something we're going to continue to focus on this year. Vijay Kumar : Understood. Thanks, guys. Operator : We'll take our next question from Dan Leonard at UBS. Dan Leonard : Thank you. Two questions. First off, what was the pricing benefit in Q4 and what is your outlook for 2024? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. So, for Q4, we came in pretty much as we expected. It was about 4%. That put us on a full year basis in 2023 at about 5% and as we kind of mentioned in previous quarters, we were benefiting a bit in the first half of the year from some pricing actions that we did in the second half of 2022, but we're very pleased with how things came together this year. I think it really shows the value proposition that we have to customers. I feel I've said it many times, but I do feel like our value proposition has very much increased over the last few years, especially as the markets have moved towards topics like automation and digitalization. It really plays to a lot of the strengths of our portfolio that can provide tangible paybacks to customers. All the things that we're doing from an innovation perspective also will really help fuel that going forward, too. So, that's something that we feel good about and then in terms of 2024, we're consistent with how we were thinking about pricing with our earlier guidance for the year, and we're expecting price realization to be around 2%. Dan Leonard : Appreciate that. And my follow-up, I'm curious on your outlook for pipette tips and really any other part of your business that suffered from destocking. Does growth normalize back to trend, or is there an above-trend growth period since your comping and inventory burned down? Shawn Vadala : No, I'll start and let Patrick jump in if he wants to. I think the challenge with pipettes right now is that there is just weak market demand in general. We don't have at Mettler-Toledo a significant exposure to early research or to biotech R&D, but we certainly do in Pipette Tips, and so we're not immune to those trends right now at the moment. So, there are softer market conditions there, but I think we're more optimistic as we get into the second half of the year. As Patrick mentioned, ordering patterns are looking a little bit better as well and just similar to my comments on innovation, we have a couple things there as well, too, that we were actually out at our facility recently, last month, and it was really fun to spend some time with the team there and look at some of the things they're working on. Some of them are more medium-term, but some of them are things that we have in the market this year. Operator : We'll move next to Matt Sykes at Goldman Sachs. Matt Sykes : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just the first one, just going back to the logistics issue, you outlined the revenue impact, and that seems isolated to Q1. Could you maybe talk about any cost implications that could bleed into Q2? My understanding is there had to be some temporary changes in how things were being shipped out of Europe, and I'm just wondering if there's any lingering costs that could impact margins in Q2 or beyond. Shawn Vadala : Yeah, of course, there's some incremental costs associated with it. A lot of the costs are really opportunity costs because we're reallocating resources to support the transition. The incremental travel costs, those things are less of an issue. Yes, there's some higher transportation costs, but when you step back from it, I'd say it's not overall significant to our overall financial statements and certainly something we kind of considered as we provided guidance here for the first quarter. Matt Sykes : Got it. Thanks for that. And then just on Europe, you've talked pretty cautiously about it, but I still think, unless I misheard, that you're expecting positive growth this year. Could you maybe just talk about sort of your cautious comments versus sort of the growth you're expecting this year in Europe and what's driving that? Shawn Vadala : Yeah, hey, that's a good question. Europe, of course, is going to benefit the most from the shipping delays. So I think if you exclude that, you get to a different answer, and it's probably -- if you take the fact of the Q1 and if you also look at maybe the easier comp in Q4, Europe's probably more flattish on the year if you exclude those two things. So it's marginally a bit softer than what we were originally expecting. But we'll caution again. It's early in the year. It was softer in the fourth quarter than we expected. A lot of it had to do with product inspection, as Patrick mentioned, but we did see just generally weaker market conditions. We've been very pleased with how resilient Europe was in 2023. If you would have asked us a year ago out of the major regions of the world, we would have probably expected things to be a little bit softer there just given all the concerns with the energy crisis and what that impact might be to our customers. So we're very pleased with how the business performed in 2023, but just sitting here today, we're just a little bit more cautious on it. Operator : We'll go next to Catherine Schulte at Baird. Catherine Schulte : Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. Maybe first just on the revenue guide, I get that you want to leave a little bit of a cushion given where we are in the year, but if we looked at your outlook by segment excluding the shipping delays, I guess, which segments are you baking in some extra conservatism into? Shawn Vadala : Yeah, good question. I'd say PI, and I guess you can see that one because it doesn't have as much of an impact, if any, from the shipping delays. So I think we were saying that was up slightly the last time we guided for the full year, and this time we're saying it's about flattish. And then this comment on Europe, Europe is a little bit lighter than what we would have guided before, and then when you kind of break it into divisions, it kind of trinkles into Lab a little bit and so Lab might be excluding the shipping delays more. Instead of saying up slightly, it's probably more flattish. Catherine Schulte : Okay, got it. And then maybe on the margin guide, what should we be expecting for gross margins for the first quarter and the full year? Shawn Vadala : Yeah, for the first quarter, we should be down about 40 basis points, and there's a lot of currency in the margin in Q1. So if you excluded the currency, it would probably be up about 20 bps and then if you look at the full year for gross margin, we'll be up, our estimate is we'll be up around 50 basis points and again, currency has an impact on that. So if you excluded that, it would be up probably more like 90 bps. Operator : We'll go next to Rachel Vatnsdal at JPMorgan. Rachel Vatnsdal : Perfect. Thanks for taking the questions, and good morning. So you mentioned that you're expecting customers to be more cautious with investments starting off the year. We've heard that from some of your peers as well. So can you just dig into what you've specifically been hearing from customers in January and now into the first week of February here, and then which markets, geographies, have you been seeing more of that cautious spending to kick off the year as well? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah, thanks, Rachel. And I'll start, and then Shawn, if you have some additional comments, feel free to chime in. So I think the majority of cautiousness we have for it was in Europe, and also down in what we told you in the PI business, in the food segments, where we see customers not releasing purchases as fast as we had expected. Again, there's good engagement for sales teams. We have launched a great fleet of new products, also mid-range products that help us to get to access to new market segments. But the whole conversion from opportunity to final sale still takes longer than we expected and that's part of what we're hearing in the European market. Otherwise, I think that, as we said, it's not a big change. Do you want to do anything else? No? Okay. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. And then just my follow-up, given that you're expecting most of this logistics issue to really benefit 1Q, can you just walk us through the sequentials on how should we be thinking about 2Q and the step up there, and then kind of leading into the back half on top line as well? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Hey, I think it's a little early for us to provide too much color on Q2, but we kind of stick to what we said before, is that we expect the first half of the year to be down. I expect Q2 to still be down. A big part of that is going to be China. We still have to lap I think a full cycle in China for Q2. So that's something that's very much on our minds, but I think when we get to the second half, we do have, with a company that only typically sits on 1.5 months of backlog, it's hard to have too much confidence when you're starting to go out several months. But I do think we feel encouraged by lapping these comps as we get into the second half of the year, as we just field maybe the organization, looking at the initiatives, looking at how we're trying to position things. A lot of our focus has always been on coming out of this stronger and I think we try to focus on the things we can control and when we talk about all these product launches, all these launching of corporate programs, Spinnaker 6 [ph], things we're doing with the customer experience, there's a lot of good things that I think should help us out for the second half of the year. And we'll get through the first quarter, and then we'll provide a little bit more color as to how we're seeing things at that point in time. Operator : We'll go next to Brandon Couillard at Jefferies. Brandon Couillard : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Patrick, the service business remains pretty healthy. You grew 10% last year against the double-digit comp. Where are you having the most success, driving attach rates, and what's your outlook for that business in 2024? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah, very good question, Brandon, thanks for that. Service, again, I'm super excited about our service opportunity. And by the way, it's also an organization that we continue to invest in throughout 2023 while we had to make some adjustments in other areas. We continue to invest in service because we see a big opportunity out there. Broadening our service portfolio, there's good demand from our customers. We have a large install base. Last year, if you said it, we grew 10%, and we expected to grow in a mid-single-digit range this year again. So another year where you will see services growing ahead of products. We continue to work with our sales teams to make sure that they can sell services at a point of sales, train them about the value of services, that they make sure they have value proposition when they talk to customers, increasing the connect rates and of course, these are different from product category to better product category, but we continue to make improvements there and I still see a lot of opportunity for us moving forward to increase our share of services. Brandon Couillard : Thanks. And then just one more, Shawn on China, about Beijing, the first quarter being down, we caught low to mid-20s, does this imply that China is back to kind of double-digit growth in the second half of the year? How should we think about cadence, first half versus second half? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Again, I don't want to get too specific, but I think if you do the math, you probably kind of get into that neighborhood for the second half of this year, but we'll provide more guidance on our next call depending on how we're thinking about the pacing with Q2 and everything. Right now we do see, for the full year, Lab being down more than the industrial business. So, kind of looking at Lab being down more like low teens, while industrial would be down like more mid-single digits. So, the industrial business was a pleasant surprise in the fourth quarter. We're a little bit more cautious on it for Q1, but we'll see how things play out here. Yeah. And just to read correctly, Brandon, that doesn't mean that the algorithm going forward we're expecting double-digit growth in China. We just know that not only they have an easier comp. We know that they're lapping a lot of things in the market. I think, one of the topics, there's a few topics there, right? One of them was all the spending during COVID, potentially an acceleration of replacement cycles. But then the other thing is I think there's just a lot of inventory, throughout the customers and I think just given the nature of the lockdowns during COVID and all the logistical challenges, there's just more people purchasing a lot more inventory than in other regions and I think that's one of the things that is kind of on our mind as well for the second half of the year. So, as we kind of go forward, just to reiterate what we said in the past, we kind of view China as more of a high single-digit growth opportunity more longer term. Operator : Next, we'll move to Patrick Donnelly at Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Shawn, I wanted to pick up on that kind of the ramp question. I think Rachel and Brandon both hit on a little bit there. If we just back out the comps, because that's pretty formulaic, just in terms of the consequential dollar improvement as you work your way through the year into the second half, China being obviously one example. You mentioned the month, month and a half of backlog. Can you just talk about, I guess, the visibility into it? Is it just the confidence level that, there was a lot of inventory in the channel in areas like China, and that just you guys are confident it normalizes as you get to the second half and dollars come back? Maybe just talk about, again, the confidence, comps excluded on that dollar ramp as we work our way through the year, China and otherwise. Shawn Vadala : Yeah, of course, there's also a lot of noise and sequentials right now, right? Like, you have a lack of a budget flush in Q4 of 2023 and now we add more complexity with these shipping delays and then we probably throw another one at you saying, like, we just expect customers to potentially start a little bit slower in Q4, Q1 of this year with a more normalized seasonality in the back half. But I think if you kind of cut through all that and you look at maybe longer term sequentials for us, I think we're actually very consistent, and so that's one thing, I think when we look at, like, multi-year comps and multi-year CAGRs and just kind of like cut through the whole COVID period, and you look at that by quarter, I think that gives us a lot of more confidence as well, too and then you kind of layer in some of these things that we know, like the one-year comps and some of these de-stocking topics, the comments I just made on China and then the final thing is, I think we are, you know, we are doing a lot inside the company to drive growth, too. And so I think, nothing drives growth like new products, and we have some really cool things that we're launching right now. We're going to probably spend more time talking about that on our next call next quarter and I think those are types of things that will help and of course, Spinnaker 6, right, there's a reason why we're talking about it in the call. It's, kind of like, I think, a preface to, like, a lot of things we're doing to focus on growth in the company and the combination of all these digitalization things that are just continue to improve, plus all the things that we're doing to further enhance that relationship with a customer. It's a very powerful combination, and we think those things will gain momentum as we kind of get into the second half of the year as well. Patrick Donnelly : Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just on the cost structure, I think you mentioned a few times, you guys want to come out of this stronger. Can you just talk about, I guess, the level of investments you're making currently with the softer backdrop versus, trying to be mindful of protecting the margins? How nimble can you be on the cost side and how are you guys approaching that? Thank you. Shawn Vadala : Yeah, hey, this has been a very important balancing act for us, something that we've been spending a lot of time as an executive team, really thinking about and reviewing over the last year. I feel like we have a really good balance. On one hand, we're really looking at parts of the organization where we've lost productivity over the last year, and so we're working on those areas. On the other hand, there are growth opportunities that we're trying to make sure that we're continuing to invest for those. Patrick mentioned service as an example, on a full-year basis. So we continue to invest in service throughout the year and that's something that we'll continue to do in 2024, but it's not just service. There's different regions of the world, there's different -- and there's also things, like innovation that we talked about a few times already today, as well as other things that I think will help make us a stronger organization going forward. So, when you kind of step back from that, I feel very good. Of course, we do have a headwind next year, too, with variable coming back to more normalized levels. So, there's a lot of moving parts, but when you look through it all, I feel like good that we can still expand margins, even though it's maybe a little bit lower than what we normally do. We can still expand margins next year with a low-growth year, and then if you look at 2023, we were able to hold our margins flat for the full year, despite a lot of the challenges that we had as well, too. So, I feel like, in the end, we have a good balance. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference over to Adam Uhlman for closing remarks. Adam Uhlman : Hey, thanks, Audra, and thank you, everybody, for joining our call today. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in the 8-K and is available on our website. Let me now turn the call over to Patrick. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks, Adam, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. Last night, we reported our first quarter financial results, the details of which are outlined for you on Page 3 of our presentation. Overall, our results in the first quarter were much better than anticipated across most product categories and geographies. As discussed last quarter, we also had a benefit this quarter from recovering delayed product shipments from the fourth quarter. However, we recovered more than expected and shipped nearly all of our delayed orders and are glad to have this disruption behind us. While our team executed well this quarter, underlying market demand is still soft, especially in China, and there remains considerable uncertainty in the global economic and geopolitical environment. We continue to maintain a cautious outlook, and we will -- and we still expect to return to sales growth in the second half of the year, largely due to easier comparisons. Otherwise, we remain focused on executing on our growth and productivity initiatives, so we will emerge stronger as our markets improve. Let me now turn the call over to Shawn to cover the financial results for the quarter and our guidance for this year, and then I will come back with some additional commentary on the business. Shawn? Shawn Vadala : Thanks, Patrick, and good morning, everyone. Sales in the quarter were $926 million, largely unchanged from prior year levels, both on a U.S. dollar basis and in local currencies. Our sales in the quarter benefited by approximately 6% from recovering nearly all of our previously disclosed delayed product shipments from the fourth quarter of 2023 above our guidance of an approximate benefit of 5%. On Slide #4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales grew 6% in Europe and 3% in the Americas and declined 8% in Asia Rest of the World. Local currency sales in China declined 19% in the quarter. Excluding the benefit from recovering our fourth quarter shipping delays, we estimate our sales in Q1 declined about 6% with the Americas down approximately 1%, Europe down approximately 5%, and Asia, Rest of the World, down approximately 12%, including a 21% sales decline in China. On Slide #5, we summarize local currency sales growth by product area. For the quarter, laboratory sales increased 2% and Industrial sales were flat with both core Industrial and product inspection flattish. Food Retail declined 9%. Service sales grew 6% in the quarter. Excluding the Q4 shipping delay benefit, we estimate laboratory product sales declined approximately 6%, Industrial declined 3% with core Industrial down 4% and product inspection flattish, and Food Retail declined 15%. Let me now move to the rest of the P&L, which is summarized on Slide #6. Gross margin was 59.2%, an increase of 30 basis points due to improved productivity, positive pricing and favorable mix, partially offset by lower volume and currency headwinds. R&D amounted to $46.4 million in the quarter, unchanged in local currency over the prior period. SG&A amounted to $234.4 million, a 1% decrease in local currency compared to the prior year and includes benefits from our cost savings initiatives. Adjusted operating profit amounted to $267.3 million in the quarter, approximately flat with the prior year amount. Unfavorable foreign currency was a headwind to adjusted operating profit of approximately 4%. Adjusted operating margin was 28.9% which represents an increase of 20 basis points from the prior year. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $18.2 million in the quarter. Interest expense was $19.2 million and other income amounted to $0.3 million. Our effective tax rate was 19% in the quarter. This rate is before discrete items and adjusted for the timing of stock option exercises. Fully diluted shares amounted to $21.5 million, which is approximately a 3% decline from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $8.89, a 2% increase over the prior year or plus 7%, excluding unfavorable foreign currency. On a reported basis, EPS was $8.24 as compared to $8.47 in the prior year. Reported EPS in the quarter included $0.24 of purchased intangible amortization, $0.36 of restructuring costs and a $0.05 tax headwind from the timing of stock option exercises. That covers the P&L, and let me now comment on cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $182.3 million, a 39% increase on a per share basis from the prior year levels due to favorable working capital, including lower cash incentive payments related to last year's performance. Let me now turn to our guidance for the second quarter and the full year. As you review our guidance, please keep in mind the following factors. First, while we do not see any negative change in business conditions today, we continue to take a cautious approach with our forecast and expect our customers will be conservative with their investments in the second quarter. We also expect our sales in China to decline over 20% again in the second quarter before returning to growth in the second half, again, significantly easier year-ago comparisons. Additionally, there is uncertainty in the economy and geopolitical risks, which also has created volatility in foreign exchange rates. Lastly, as mentioned last year, we will face higher variable compensation this year relative to prior year levels. Now turning to our guidance. For the second quarter of 2024, we expect local currency sales to decline approximately 4%. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $8.90 to $9.05. Currency for the quarter at recent spot rates would be an approximate 2% headwind to second quarter sales and adjusted EPS. For the full year 2024, we expect local currency sales to grow approximately 2%, which is up from our previous guidance of approximately 1% to 2% growth. We expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $39.90 to $40.40 which compares to our prior guidance of $39.60 to $40.30. This includes an expected headwind to sales of 1% and adjusted EPS growth of approximately 2% from unfavorable foreign exchange. Lastly, I would like to share a few other details on our 2024 guidance to help you as you update your models. We expect total amortization, including purchased intangible amortization to be approximately $73 million. Purchase intangible amortization is excluded from adjusted EPS and is estimated at $26 million on a pretax basis or $0.95 per share. Interest expense is forecast at $82 million for the year and other income is estimated at approximately $2 million. We expect our tax rate before discrete items will remain at 19% in 2024. We expect adjusted free cash flow of approximately $850 million, representing a conversion of approximately 100% of adjusted net income. We continue to expect share repurchases of approximately $850 million in 2024. That's it from my side, and I'll now turn it back to Patrick. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks, Shawn. Let me start with some comments on our operating businesses, starting with Lab. As Shawn mentioned earlier, excluding the Q4 shipping delay benefits this quarter, local currency sales in our Laboratory business declined approximately 6% compared to last year. This was better than we anticipated, but we saw cautious spending patterns from our pharma and biopharma customers, especially in China. We have a very strong product portfolio and pipeline of new innovations that directly address our customer needs for solutions that enhance their productivity and ensure regulatory compliance. Combined with the enhancements we have made in our Spinnaker sales and marketing program, our go-to-market approach is a significant competitive differentiator during this period of reduced end market demand. Our Industrial sales for the quarter were also better than we had expected and declined about 3%, excluding the benefit of shipping delays. Our sales of core Industrial products have performed better than we would have expected in a soft economic environment, benefiting from our upgraded portfolio of products that enable automation and digitalization in our customers' production and logistics facilities. We also continue to be optimistic about growth opportunities related to home shoring and near shoring as customers aim to increase resiliency in their supply chains. Our product inspection business also had better-than-expected performance in a soft market environment with benefits from recent product introductions and strong service growth. Lastly, Food Retail sales declined in line with our expectations against significant project-driven sales growth in the first quarter of last year. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Starting in the Americas, our sales declined slightly in the quarter, excluding the benefit from recovering our shipping delays. We benefited from strong project-related growth in Industrial which was offset by a decline in Lab and Retail. As expected, our customers have been somewhat cautious starting the year, especially in pharma and biopharma which we expect to improve as we face easier comparisons in the second half of the year. Retail also faced very difficult comparisons related to very strong growth in the prior year. Sales in Europe, excluding the estimated benefit from recovering our European logistics hub delays declined about 5% and were largely in line with our expectations across each of our businesses. We continue to see soft economic indicators across most of Europe and acknowledge the potential risk to the European economy and energy prices from the conflict in the Middle East. However, we have a very strong team and go-to-market approach that positions us very well to capture growth opportunities. Lastly, Asia, Rest of the World results were also slightly better than expected, although demand in China remains very weak relative to very strong growth over the past few years. We continue to target pockets of growth opportunities, including semiconductor and new energy industries and our approach to the market has remained a significant competitive advantage against the competition. Those are all my comments on the businesses for the quarter, and I'd now like to share with you why we are so optimistic on the long-term growth opportunity for our company. First, I have been in the life science and analytical tools industry for a long time and believe the exciting advancements our customers are bringing to the market will continue to support healthy market growth in our industry over the long term. We also see many new opportunities in fast-growing segments such as sustainable materials, semiconductors and alternative energy. Our customers also continue to look to us to help them achieve their goals, including improving productivity and quality while supporting their efforts in automation and digitalization. Our very broad and diverse portfolio of solutions is an important differentiator, and we lead the industry with new innovations for our target markets. Innovation is at the heart of our culture and is essential to our continued success. We are constantly coming out to market with new products and have accelerated our rate of innovation over the past few years. New products help stimulate replacement cycles, support market share gains and enhance our value proposition that support our pricing. We are uniquely positioned to serve customers throughout the value chain from R&D through production and logistics. This also creates a tremendous opportunity for us to add automation and digitalization features to our products and drive productivity and provide insights throughout the value chain. Over the past 3 years, we have invested over $0.5 billion in research and development into 3 key areas. First, technology advancements to support new products and features that increase the value of our products. Second, application and software development to complement our products. And third, design enhancements to simplify manufacturing and serviceability of our products. The significant investments we are making have been an important contributor to expanding our innovation leadership and market share gains. I'd like to share with you a few examples of innovations we have recently brought to market and why we are so excited about our future. I'll start with our biggest launch of the year, our entirely new and redesigned portfolio of standard and advanced level laboratory balances, which you may have seen featured in our annual report. We are the global market leader in laboratory weighing, but also have ample room to gain further market share that includes expanding our access to growth segments. Our new range of balances address this opportunity with the best products for entry-level applications all the way up to advanced weighing requirements. [ Featuring ] increased robustness, seamless data management, a harmonized user interface and up to 30% better measurement in performance. Our design approach also improves sustainability and using improved packaging and reducing their power consumption. Weighing is a critical step in the sample preparation process and our LabX software connects our higher-end balances to our broad portfolio of analytical instruments to help automate workflows and ensure secure and compliant data capture. This is a very important competitive advantage, considering we provide about 40% of the instruments that are found in a typical quality control app, and we recently introduced several new analytical instruments with new automation and digitalization features. For example, we are the global number two player in titration. And last month, we launched 2 completely new Karl Fischer titrators models. Our new EVA titrators are ideal for efficiently determining the water content of challenging samples and our new control algorithm speeds up reaction rates and allows for faster analysis and cycle times. It also has an automated solvent exchange system that ensures safety by minimizing exposure to potentially hazardous chemicals. Importantly, our new titrators have full compatibility with our LabX software to enable automated seamless workflows with secure data management, all while complying with data integrity regulations. Hot segments have been an important driver of growth for analytical instruments and water determination to titration is an important part of lithium battery production. Our voice of customer program [ Jetstream ] uncovered a specific customer need in the market to be able to analyze multiple samples with only 1 titration instrument. To address this, our team developed a new automated sample prep solution the InMotion Karl Fischer Six that is used with our titrator. With our InMotion 6, customers can process up to 6 samples fully automatically and unattended with only 1 titrator addressing our customers' need for a cost-effective solution on a very small footprint. Automation has also been an important differentiator for our thermal analysis customers in fast-growing markets such as development of new materials, and we recently introduced a new thermal analysis instrument called the DSC 5+ with a fully automated sample changer. This instrument also increases the efficiency of the entire workflow from sample handling to result assessment, generating reproducible results with less resources. Our artificial intelligence Wizard software automatically detects and evaluates many types of thermal effects saving valuable time in providing consistent and reliable measurement results regardless of the user's level of experience. Our software also has different neural networks that are trained on dedicated data so customers can download the most appropriate package for their experiment. Our core Industrial business has been very successful in integrating advanced automation and connectivity features into its products and has focused its new product development on terminals and digital load cells that provide seamless integration into factory automation systems. A great example of this is our Industry 360 Terminal, which is an ultrafast weight indicator for automated filling, dosing and tank weighting applications across a variety of industries from biopharma to food manufacturing. The terminal connects our scales and weighing sensors and seamlessly integrates our preprogrammed, ready-to-use weighing applications into a customer's Programmable Logic Controllers for process control automation. It also seamlessly feeds data to customer IT system. And because of our unique ability to combine IT and operations technology communication on a single network, it saves customers' integration and programming cost and time and eliminates the need for an additional gateway to the server or cloud. This product line has been very successful and new derivatives like our Industry 700 and Industry 400 have been very recently launched to further expand our portfolio. We have also expanded our capabilities in pharma manufacturing IT systems, helping customers by having a simplified and standardized integration of our weighing solutions. These advanced terminals also connect to our new pHT low-profile hygienic floor scale family that offers unmatched hygiene and safety features. Our new scales are very well suited for industries like pharma where cleanliness is paramount. These scales offer a unique, fully seal design that reduces contamination risks and simplified cleaning procedures and also has a state-of-the-art digital load cell. We have had great success with the 2023 launch of this product, and we believe this and other new core Industrial products have been very important contributors to the relative resilience of this business over the past year. We have also recently launched several new products across our product inspection business over the past year that are highly differentiated and bring considerable value to the customers. We expect these innovations, including our new series of X-ray inspection technology to help drive market share gains, especially in the mid-market segment. We have an excellent pipeline of innovations of product inspection that will further build on our market leadership. Lastly, we are also pleased with our success of Food Retail business that has seen with the new product introductions like our FreshBase scales, which was an important contributor to the market share gains and strong sales growth last year. Additionally, our new FreshBase plus AI scale with advanced image recognition technology is an exciting innovation we are looking forward to bringing to additional markets outside of China. So that is a brief overview of a few new products we have launched over the past year, and we have many more to come this year as we have accelerated certain innovation investments to capture growth opportunities. These investments continue to provide a portfolio that is stronger than ever and continues to increase our value proposition and most importantly, help our customers gain new insights, increase their productivity and ensure regulatory compliance throughout their value chain. That is the conclusion of our prepared remarks. Operator, I'd like to open the line now to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Stifel. Daniel Arias : Shawn, the 50 bps-or-so that you're raising on the organic guide and then $0.20, I believe, on the bottom line, is that just feeling better about the logistics issue given that last quarter you sort of held back a bit given that it was early in the year or is that reflective of better results that you saw in 1Q and maybe the way that the year might unfold on demand? Shawn Vadala : Yes. Thanks, Dan. Thanks for the question. I think it's pretty much as you interpreted. It's largely related to doing a little bit better on the shipping delays that we had in Q4. Of course, we did a little bit better than that in terms of Q4 results in general. But even though we're not seeing any negative changes in the business. We also prefer to be a little bit cautious here until we get closer to the second half and have a little bit more visibility. Daniel Arias : And then maybe on the outlook for China. You pointed to continued challenges there in Q2. That's not exactly a surprise just given the way that things have unfolded this quarter. But it does sound like you expect some deceleration on what is an easier comp. I think the China comp gets 6 points easier next quarter. Is there something to that? And are you seeing any of the green shoots that have been discussed a little bit across the earnings cycle this quarter? Patrick Kaltenbach : I can take this, Dan. Look, we have been definitely pleased that we have seen a somewhat better result in Q1 than we had expected. That said, we still expect it to be quite weak. I mean, as Shawn said, we'll have more than 20% decline in China second quarter based on the very tough compares we see against Q2 last year and the years before where there has been quite heavy investment in China. There was significant spending during COVID and also some, of course, inventory buildup, et cetera. For the second half of the year, the comps will become much easier for us. So we expect positive growth. And regarding -- your questions regarding the stimulus that was announced. I think this is definitely a positive sign for the market. We have not yet seen any impact yet, and we have to see whether it will move the needle, but I think it helps to reestablish also the confidence in the market. So the stimulus will help. But I think most importantly, you need to understand that we think we are really well positioned with our product portfolio there with our local team that is executing really well with also developing local products for the Chinese market. I think we are in a great position to compete in this market and as the market recovers to gain even more momentum. Shawn Vadala : Yes. And just to maybe specifically address the comment about potential deceleration. I think it's important to also just look at maybe the multiyear comparisons here and if you just like look at the trends in terms of like dollar terms or renminbi terms, we're kind of hitting a high watermark a year ago in Q2 in terms of what we're lapping in terms of comps. So actually, the comp level that we have in Q2 is a more difficult comp than we had in the first quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : I was wondering if you could just reflect on the first quarter a little bit. You posted flat local currency growth, you were guiding to down 4% to 6%, about a point came from better capture of logistics. Where did the rest of the upside come from? Can you just walk us through that? Shawn Vadala : Yes. Thanks, Jack. Hey, the rest of it, we -- despite being down 6%, excluding the shipping benefit, we're pleased we did better than expected. We kind of expected customers to start a little more cautiously this year. I think they did start cautiously, but we're glad that they didn't -- they weren't as cautious as maybe we were thinking at the beginning of the quarter. If you look at kind of the where, like where did it come from, it was actually pretty broad-based, whether it be by region or by product area. And I think if we look internally, Patrick and I just came out of some executive meetings earlier this week, we just really walk away feeling very good about the things that we're controlling. The execution in the organization, I would say, is very high. We talked about a lot of different corporate programs that we're rolling out on our last call, whether it be Spinnaker 6 or other programs. Today, we talk a lot about innovation and all the things we're doing in terms of launching new products and so I have to also believe that the teams are just executing well, and we're seeing some benefit from all that good work. Jack Meehan : Great. And then do you mind just walking us through in terms of the guide for 2Q and the full year just by segment, what the expectations are? Shawn Vadala : Yes, sure. So let me start by business area. So our Q2 guide for Lab is to be down low single digit and for the full year to be up low- to mid-single digit. Product inspection, I don't know if I could also maybe add, if you exclude the shipping delay for the full year, that would be flattish. If we look at core Industrial, it would be up low single digit in Q2 -- I'm sorry, that was product inspection. Product inspection would be up low single digit in Q2 and up low single digit for the full year and that would be the same if you exclude the shipping delays for the full year. Core Industrial would be down high single digit for Q2 and flattish for the full year and would be down slightly, excluding the benefits of the shipping delays for the full year. And then Food Retail would be down about 10% for Q2 and down mid- to high-single digit for the full year and similarly, down mid- to high-single digit for the full year, excluding the shipping delay benefit. And then in terms of the Americas, we would be flat for Q2, we would be up low-single digit for the full year, and then we would be up slightly for -- excluding the shipping delay benefit. Europe would be up low-single digit for Q2, up mid-single digit for the full year, but flattish, excluding the shipping delay benefit. And then China would be down mid-20s in Q2, down high-single digit for the full year and similarly down high-single digit, excluding the shipping delay benefit. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Congrats on a good Q1 execution. Maybe Shawn, for you, you beat Q1 by 500 basis points, right, at the minimum relative to your expectations. So that's annualized 125 basis points which you've raised guidance by 50 basis points, so did anything changed around the back half assumptions that makes you perhaps want to be a little bit more cautious? Shawn Vadala : No. Vijay, thanks for the question. No, I mean, we're not seeing -- I want to be clear, we're not seeing anything negative or new negative changes in the business. We just feel like it's still a little bit early in the year. We only have 1.5 months' worth of backlog, and we're just a little bit cautious here kind of going into the second quarter. And we'd just like to have a little bit more visibility to the second half of the year. And I think after the end of the Q2, we'll be in a better position to reassess the second half. But I think we're still optimistic about growing in the second half and -- but we just like to have a little bit more visibility here before we kind of get out over our skis. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And maybe Patrick, for you as a follow-up. Shawn mentioned visibility for back half and backlog, right? What is typical backlog for Mettler? When you say visibility, is that sort of being driven by funnel activity, customer conversations or are you hoping -- or do you have any expectations for China stimulus to play out in the back half? Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks for the question, Vijay. Look, as Shawn just said, we have about 1.5 months of backlog. So we have a pretty fast turnover in most of our businesses. When we look at the second half, again, the comps will get much easier for us based on what we have seen last year. So that, of course, implies a positive growth for the second half. We see very good customer engagement out there also during Q1 and what our teams are in great discussions with customers. I think there's great interest in our new products that we just launched and we are confident that we are really well positioned. What we're seeing, however, is that the sales cycle times are still somewhat longer at the moment. But as Shawn also mentioned, given where we are with the portfolio, given what we see in terms of customer engagement, we don't see any negative trends or changes to what we have said in the first quarter. We think we are well positioned to achieve the goals we have for the second half, to be honest. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Michael Ryskin : I'm going to ask another one about market conditions as you go through the year because I think that's where there's the most interest. Just following up on your comments just there. Is there anything in particular you're looking for as you go through the year? I mean is it really just a matter of time of you don't want to call for an improvement until you're only about 3 or 6 months out? Or are there any specific indicators whether it's PMI, whether it's funding levels, whether it's just some budgets being unlocked, whether it's a recovery in China? Just walk us through sort of like what are the indicators you're looking for as you go through the year to gain a little bit more confidence in that reopening of the markets in that acceleration. Shawn Vadala : Yes. Mike, this is Shawn. Maybe not to entirely repeat what we just said, but probably we'll echo it to a large degree. I think it comes back to this sitting on pretty much 1.5 months' worth of backlog. We do see good activity in our pipeline. As Patrick, I think, mentioned before, we are seeing order cycles being elongated a little bit in the first quarter. Certainly, it would be nice to see those -- the conversions actually starting to happen here in the second quarter. But the activity is good. But I think it comes back to we only sit on about 1.5 months' worth of backlog. We have still some difficult comparisons on a multiyear basis here in the second quarter. It would be nice just to see -- to gain a few more months here and just kind of get a little bit closer to that second half. And then I think we've generally been -- our second half growth story has also largely been about easier comparisons and so it would be nice to see how the market kind of develops here in the second quarter in addition to those easier comparisons. And of course, there's plenty of uncertainty and risks in the world that are out there, nothing specific to our business, but whether it's economic risks or geopolitical risks, and we'll just kind of see how the world plays out here for a few more months. Michael Ryskin : Okay. And I want to ask one on the P&L. I mean, 1Q earnings beat pretty handily, obviously, shipping, recovery and the underlying business being better, probably played a decent role in that. But could you sort of parse that out? I mean you gave a lot of color on what revenues would have been if it wasn't for the shipping recovery. Any color you can give on the P&L in terms of how much benefit was the EPS? And what I'm getting at is your 2Q EPS guide of roughly $9 is essentially flat versus 1Q. You normally see a pretty nice sequential step-up. So again, I appreciate that the shipping recovery had some noise to that. But just trying to get a better sense of like the margin cadence 1Q to 2Q? Shawn Vadala : Yes. So in terms of the first quarter, as we kind of said, we benefited about 6% in terms of sales from the shipping delay benefit. Our expectation was that we were going to benefit about 5%. So we had a 1% benefit. So you can kind of maybe draw your own conclusions of what that would have meant or not. But maybe more importantly, if you just take that reported number of sales in Q1 and you look at our guidance for Q2, regardless of shipping delay benefit. With that benefit, the reported number is actually a very similar dollar number sequentially to what we see in the second quarter. And if you look at the EPS for Q2, it's actually our guidance is higher than Q1, which I think points a little bit to some of the good execution we're doing on our side in terms of cost savings and productivity measures. Now if you look at the second quarter versus prior year, of course, there's different moving parts. You have a 2% headwind when it comes to foreign currency. If we look at our gross margins, we expect the gross margin to be down probably about 20 basis points versus the prior year and a lot of that has to do with volume being down in the second quarter versus the prior year. There's a little bit of noise as well with maybe a little bit of higher transportation costs with some of the Red Sea topics, some investments we're making in our service business. And then our pricing, of course, offsets that a little bit. Our pricing came in about 2%, which was in line with our expectation for the first quarter, and we kind of expect that to continue here into the second quarter and for the full year. And then maybe one other comment on the P&L kind of going below the gross margin in addition to the volume and the things that I just said in terms of headwinds, we also will have higher variable comp Q2 this year relative to last year. But if you kind of then step back from all that, and you maybe pivot to the full year, we're actually pleased that our full year operating margin is now probably going to be up about 50 basis points. And if you exclude currency, it's probably up about 70 basis points. So in a year where there's a pretty modest top line growth, we feel good about our ability to continue to drive operating margin improvement. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Rachel Vatnsdal Olson : So I want to dig into the Industrial performance in the quarter. You mentioned some strength in Americas and 1Q on some project level activity, but then you also said that you expect core industrial to be down high singles in 2Q. So can you just kind of walk us through the drivers of that core Industrial business in the first half of the year? Were there any one-timers that we need to be aware of in 1Q, for example? Patrick Kaltenbach : Thank you, Rachel, and I'll start and maybe let Shawn chime in as well. Looking at it, we are very proud of the performance of our Industrial business. I think it comes down to really the outstanding portfolio enhancements we have made over the last year. I mentioned the Industry 360 terminal and other things we launched driving productivity for our customers, and they really pick it up nicely. When you look at Q2, I mean, the major driver for the decline that we outlined is a very tough compare against a very strong business we have seen in Q2 last year in Industrial. So we are not concerned about the, I would say, the attractiveness of our products or the engagement we see of our customers simply based a decline on a very tough compare versus last year. In the quarter, we definitely look forward to keeping the momentum or gaining even more momentum with the new products that I indicated like the Industry 400 and 700 and the new industry scales that we are launching. So overall, I would say, not a concern, the decline is purely because we had a very big quarter last year in the industry. Shawn Vadala : Yes. Maybe just to get to the other part of your question, Rachel. The first quarter in the U.S., certainly, that project activity is lumpy. And so we certainly will not see that in the second quarter. So there's an element of that. And then maybe the other point I make here is that in core Industrial, it has a larger mix of business weighted towards China versus our other businesses. And then if you kind of look at maybe the multiyear comparisons of that China business, we do have a very difficult comparison, as Patrick mentioned. So it will be a little bit -- and it will be a little bit bigger of a headwind there that we saw versus Q1. Rachel Vatnsdal Olson : And then just for my follow-up, I want to dig into some of the biopharma commentary that you gave. So you mentioned some of slower spending to start of the year, we've been hearing that across the sector this earnings season. But can you just unpack for us what does guidance assume in terms of those biopharma customer budget starting to open up? And then have you seen any activity level from biopharma customers pick up in April and then early May here from that group as well? Patrick Kaltenbach : Well, look, when we talk about biopharma, I think the business we really focus on here is our Process Analytics business. Biopharma definitely still has been soft in the first quarter, and we also expected given the year, biopharma customers to be soft in the second quarter as well. I mean, when we talk about growth in the second half for biopharma, same thing is true for many other businesses we just expect also easier compares. When you look at the underlying engagement and the momentum we are seeing right now, especially in China, we are still facing some inventory issues with our Pro sensors. They're still sitting on some inventory there that they're working down. On the single-use sensors that you use in biopharma, we're actually also encouraged by, in fact, more recent interest again into single-use sensors that come from our PendoTECH business for biopharma customers. Shawn Vadala : And the other part of biopharma, of course, pipettes and we certainly have seen improvement in pipettes relative to some of the destocking issues that we were dealing with last year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Sykes : Patrick, maybe -- and sorry if I've missed it, but maybe just some commentary around the services business. I think you mentioned it was strong in Q1, but just any expectations and progress that you've made on your services initiative over the course of this quarter and your expectations for the full year? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Very good. Thanks. Matt, I mean, again, we are very proud about the performance of our service business. We had 6% growth in the first quarter against a very strong growth in the first quarter last year. We see strong demand for our services. We continue to build out the service portfolio that we can deliver to our customers. We compete extremely well. We still have a lot of opportunity with the installed base that we have out there, connecting more of our services to the installed base, and we have dedicated marketing programs in place to connect more of the business. I think that will drive a lot of profitable growth for us moving forward. I'd like to remind you also that our operating profit on services is actually higher than the average of the -- of our portfolio. So that's such a big benefit. And broadening the portfolio and increasing the reach to our customers with dedicated campaigns and all the go-to-market strategies will help us to continue that momentum that we see behind services. Services is one of the areas that we continue to invest also through the down cycle last year. We have a very strong service team, and we see moving forward still more opportunity out there for services. Our services are very well recognized in the market by our customers. We have very unique solutions that many of our competitors cannot offer, like, for example, the RapidCal solutions when it comes to tank calibration, et cetera. So it is, again, a big opportunity for us, and we are seeing strong demand, and we'll continue to invest in this business. Matthew Sykes : And then just maybe a little more color on Europe. I know you're guiding to low-single digits for Q2 and mid-single digits for the full year, but you've been cautious on Europe for some time. You kind of reiterated that caution again. I'm sure comps are helping in the succeeding quarters. But just any additional color on what you're seeing from an end-market demand standpoint from Europe? And any reasons for continued caution over the course of the year? Shawn Vadala : Yes. Matt, this is Shawn, maybe I'll take that one. So we're very pleased with the execution from our team in Europe. We have our most direct sales organization there in terms of direct channel to the customer. And I tend to think we always feel the best benefit of our Spinnaker sales and marketing programs in Europe. So I think that's one of the things that we feel very good about. Now the other side of that is the economies have been soft. You look at some of the PIs, especially some of the larger countries like Germany, you see elevated cost of energy in the region affecting some of our end markets. So there's certainly uncertainty there. At the same time, as we look to the second quarter, I think there's going to be some benefit here from the timing of Easter. But otherwise, it's kind of like a yin and a yang. I think on one hand, we see a lot of market uncertainty, but on the other hand, I feel like we're fighting a great fight and the team is doing really well. And as we always kind of say the economy tends to just need to be good enough there for people to stick to replacement cycles, but at the same time, there are opportunities with reshoring and some of these hot segments like semiconductor or lithium battery in Europe, and I think our teams do a really great job of identifying those opportunities when they're available and capturing them. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. Catherine Ramsey : First, great to see the recapture of the shipping delays coming in above your expectations and recapturing pretty much all of that lost revenue. Just when it comes to the new logistics provider, would you say that situation is fully resolved? You got the protocols and processes in place to move smoothly going forward? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Thanks, Catherine. I'm really happy how the team performed in Q1 and how we could resolve that issue that we had in Q4. Actually, I'm looking at all the major KPIs that we have bought I would say, today, we are in a very, very good situation. We can, of course, keep a very close eye on it because a couple of months of great performance is not enough for us to say, everything is locked down. But happy with the performance right now. Our team, our own team has been really deeply engaged with fixing the situation. I have seen very strong collaboration between our own logistics teams and this external logistics provider to get these issues resolved. And again, we have all monitoring KPIs implies that if we see any deterioration, we will have these teams come back into action. By now, everything is running smooth, which I'm very happy with. But as everything we do at Mettler-Toledo, there is continued performance improvement plans in place. I mean even here, even though it's now today, we are not satisfied where we are today. We think we can still do better and make this -- really make sure that this is not an issue moving forward, but also continue to deliver outstanding customer experience when it comes to delivery times and quality of deliveries, et cetera, is definitely front and center, with this logistics partner. We made great progress, and I'm confident that we don't see any issues in the near term, but again, we keep it, we have monitoring KPIs in place to make sure that we don't miss any potential deviation. Catherine Ramsey : And then maybe on the second quarter guide, it's implying a slower sequential increase than what you've typically seen historically. So can you just talk through any areas of conservatism that you feel are in the second quarter guide? It looks like maybe on the Industrial side is where that's a slower uptick sequentially than historically, but curious if you could just give some more color there. Shawn Vadala : Yes, sure, Catherine, maybe I take that one. So of course, there was the shipping delay benefit in Q1, but I -- but if you exclude that, I think like the multiyear CAGRs still look pretty similar between Q2 and Q1. Sometimes we're looking at pre-COVID CAGRs when we say that, but if you do look at like the Industrial business, like one of the things that kind of stands out there is this kind of ties to the comments we're making about China earlier or Industrial before where I said China is a higher percentage of that business. And on a multiyear basis, we have just higher comps. So if you start looking at it on a multiyear basis instead of a 1-year basis, I think that's maybe affecting a little bit some of the sequentials on a more disaggregated basis. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Patrick Donnelly : I want to follow up on, I think, as Rachel asking about kind of the underlying improvement as we work our way through the year, I think that was biopharma, can you talk about China, just the assumptions there. Obviously, the comps get easier, it sounds like 2Q will be down 20%-plus. But can you talk about the underlying improvement you're assuming as we work away in -- not like maybe core Industrial is still a little bit soft, but would love to just talk through the expectations there. I get the comps are easier, but just the underlying expectation... Shawn Vadala : Yes. I mean I think if you like look at our -- like if you look at our full year guide for China, we're still expecting to be down high-single digit. I think if you try to break it out between the businesses, maybe on a full year basis, Industrial might be a little bit better than that, than Lab. But I think that's largely because of what we saw in Q1. I think as we kind of like look at Q2, they're probably down similarly, maybe a little bit more on the Industrial side because of some of these longer-term comp issues that we talked about. I think we have a good setup in terms of comparisons certainly going into the second half of the year. And if you look at -- if you think about last year, the Lab business was down disproportionately versus the Industrial business. So I think the Lab will benefit from that more than the Industrial in the second half of the year. In terms of the market, we always say things in China can change very quickly either way. So I think this is a good example of just wanting to get another quarter under our belt before we talk too much about the second half of the year. And I think right now, we don't have any particular new insights. I mean, I think everyone is seeing the same headlines, hearing about potentials for stimulus and these types of things, but nothing like that's necessarily influencing how we're thinking about guiding for the second half of the year. I think we're -- I think probably the bigger theme is the more that can happen from a governmental perspective to instill confidence in the economy in terms of people starting to reinvest, I think there's been a lot of outreach in the country to companies, including to multinationals to really reinstill that confidence level. And I think as that confidence builds, we'll start to see probably more  investment happening in the country. But mid- to long term, we're still really, really optimistic here. There's still a lot of growth opportunity in China for China. And I think we're just very well positioned for that growth. When you look at how well we align with the government's priorities and then even getting into some of the trends that we talk a lot about with automation and digitalization. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. And we see a very good engagement with customers in China as well. The sales team has really good engagement. We monitor very closely. So there's a lot of customer interest out there that I think will help us also to get back to that growth in the second half. Shawn Vadala : Yes. And then to kind of feed off that, our team there has just always been such an agile team to pivot to where the growth opportunities are. And certainly, that was a topic we were talking about throughout this week with our -- at the executive level as just some of the programs that they're doing locally to identify those pockets of growth and go after them. So we feel like we're well positioned as things improve. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. That's helpful. And then, Shawn, maybe just on the margin build. Can you just talk about the pricing piece in the quarter and as you work your way through the year? And then similarly, just how you're thinking about the cost base given, again, if you are still a little bit of a softer macro, how nimble you're being on the cost side would be helpful? Shawn Vadala : Yes. So I kind of mentioned earlier in one of the other questions. Pricing came in pretty much as expected in the quarter at 2%. We're still kind of holding our guide for the full year on pricing at 2%. Of course, we're going to try to do better than that. I think all the things we're doing on innovation certainly continues to enhance our value proposition. And so that always helps. I see good execution on this topic as well, too. So we'll see how it plays out for the rest of the year. In terms of margins on a quarterly basis, it can be kind of lumpy as we saw with the second quarter with volumes. But I think the team continues to do a good job in terms of material costs. I think there's some modest benefits we saw in Q1 there that we'll kind of continue to see through the rest of the year. And then in terms of like just our overall cost structure, we have -- it's like a balancing act, right? We've done a lot of, I think, very good things in terms of driving productivity in the organization and cost savings that were kind of necessary to adjust to our current volumes. But of course, that also creates the -- it creates the ability for us to continue to reinvest in the business to ensure long-term success, which is something that we've always been very focused on. And so I think we have a very good balance and mix in the business. Of course, Patrick and I are going to spend a lot of time with our teams here starting next month, we start to go into our normal planning cycles and that kind of continues until the fall where we really kind of look at the different growth opportunities, investment opportunities and then at the same time, driving productivity throughout the organization. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Waldman with Cleveland Research. Joshua Waldman : First, Patrick or Shawn, just to follow up on a previous theme. Any more color you can provide on what types of accounts started to open up in the latter part of Q1 or any customers that you'd point to that were sitting on the sidelines in '23 and maybe January that then started to improve? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Look, I mean I think we saw very good interest in our products and performance, as we said, better than expected throughout the end markets and product portfolio. If I would point to maybe one segment, it could be Food, actually, the food market, we saw really good interest for our product inspection business that also drove a little bit of the better performance there. That market definitely -- while there is still same topic about elongated sales cycles, we see that as well. There's strong engagement and a lot of that is driven by our new product portfolio. I mentioned the new X-ray products, new metal detector products, so that drives a lot of customer interest, to be honest. And also us getting more into what we call the midrange market. We have historically been more focused on the high end of that market. We have a broader portfolio now for mid-range customers, meaning more cost-conscious customers that don't need the highest amount of performance there. But -- and that probably is one of the market segments where I would say that opened up maybe a bit more than expected. But overall, we saw really good engagement across all end markets and geographies. Joshua Waldman : And then, Shawn, maybe a related question on price. I guess I forget if you commented whether or not price is tracking kind of in line or how it is tracking versus expectations. But just curious if you could comment on price-risk expectations? And then in the recent past, you talked about using tough times to support share gains, any recent success stories or examples you could point to that you think are driving share gain, maybe supporting upside versus the guide year-to-date? Yes, I think Patrick mentioned benefits from go-to-market strategy, I guess, any changes on the go-to-market strategy, for example, anything like that kind of driving upside versus maybe what you expected here year-to-date? Shawn Vadala : Joshua, maybe I'll take that one. So we'll start with price. So as I mentioned, price came in as expected in the quarter, it came in at 2%. So we were happy with that. We expect price to be 2% again in Q2 and for the full year, which is kind of consistent with our previous guidance. And as I kind of mentioned, we do feel very good about our value proposition, all the stuff we talked about earlier about innovation really strengthens that value proposition, so that helps to always support our pricing in the market. And so -- but at the same time, we will, of course, look to see if we can do better than that as we kind of go through the year. In terms of market share gains, I do think we're executing really well. It's always hard to tell how much share we're taking. But if I look at some of our results by region, Europe, I think, was a good example. I mean even the comments on food, right? Some of that is we're executing well. We have new products that are being very well received in the market. It's not like there's no softness in some of these end markets, particularly in the U.S., but the teams are doing quite well there. So in terms of go-to-market approach, I mean, I think we continue to just do very well within the umbrella of Spinnaker. That program really has allowed us to be -- use a lot of analytics to really identify growth opportunities and pursue those opportunities. We have a lot of great tools to help prepare the team, to help with conversion and value selling, cross-selling. And so I think a lot of the programs we have are very effective. If you go back to the beginning of the year, we talked about rolling out and introducing the next generation of Spinnaker to the organization, Spinnaker 6. I think it's still a little early to say that Spinnaker 6 is driving share gains, but certainly, it creates momentum in the organization and focus on the program in general because it's not like a different Spinnaker they all kind of build on all the other waves and generations.

Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks, Adam, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. Last night, we reported our second quarter financial results, the details of which are outlined for you on Page 3 of our presentation. Our team continued to execute well and deliver better-than-expected results in the second quarter, including good growth in Laboratory sales in Europe and Americas. As expected, market conditions in China remained weak in both our Laboratory and industrial businesses. We continue to benefit from our productivity and margin initiatives, which helped mitigate the impact of foreign exchange headwinds and protect our earnings. Looking to the remainder of 2024, market conditions are soft, particularly in China. However, we expect our local currency sales to return to growth in the second half of the year, primarily due to easier comparisons as well as execution of our Spinnaker sales and marketing program and leveraging our innovative product portfolio. We remain focused on continuing to strengthen our company for the future and believe we are in an excellent position to continue to gain market share and deliver future growth. Let me now turn the call over to Shawn to cover the financial results and our guidance, and then I will be back with some additional commentary on the business and our outlook. Shawn? Shawn Vadala : Thanks, Patrick, and good morning, everyone. Sales in the quarter were at $943.8 million, which represented a decrease in local currency of 2%. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales declined 4% as currency reduced sales growth by 2%. On Slide number 4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales grew 6% in Europe; 2% in the Americas; and declined 13% in Asia Rest of the World. Local currency sales decreased 23% in China in the quarter. On Slide number 5, we show sales growth by region for the first half of the year. Local currency sales declined 1% for the first six months with 6% growth in Europe; 2% growth in the Americas; and an 11% decline in Asia Rest of the World. Local currency sales decreased by 21% in China on a year-to-date basis. As a reminder, our first quarter sales benefited by 6% from recovering delayed product shipments, which is a 3% benefit to our year-to-date results. Excluding this, our local currency sales declined 4% on a year-to-date basis. On Slide number 6, we summarize local currency sales growth by product area. For the quarter, Laboratory sales increased 1% and Industrial decreased 5% with core industrial down 9% and Product Inspection up 3%. Food Retail declined 12% in the quarter against significant project activity last year. The next slide shows local currency sales growth by product area for the first half. Laboratory sales increased 1% and Industrial decreased 3% with Core Industrial down 5% and Product Inspection up 1%, Food Retail decreased 10%. Let me now move to the rest of the P&L, which is summarized on Slide number 8. Gross margin was 59.7%, an increase of 30 basis points on positive price realization as positive price realization was partially offset by lower volume. R&D amounted to $45.8 million in the quarter, which is a 2% decrease in local currency over the prior period. SG&A amounted to $235.8 million, a 4% increase in local currency over the prior year and includes higher variable compensation. Adjusted operating profit amounted to $284.1 million in the quarter, an 8% decrease. Unfavorable foreign currency was a headwind to adjusted operating profit of approximately 2%. Adjusted operating margin was 30%, which represents a decrease of 130 basis points over the prior year. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $18.2 million in the quarter. Interest expense was $19 million and other income amounted to $1.5 million. Our effective tax rate was 19% in the quarter. This rate is before discrete items and is adjusted for the timing of stock option exercises. This also excludes a $23 million one-time non-cash discrete tax benefit relating to the favorable settlement of a tax audit. Fully diluted shares amounted to 21.4 million, which is approximately a 3% decline from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $9.65, a 5% decrease over the prior year or a 3% decrease excluding unfavorable foreign currency. On a reported basis in the quarter, EPS was $10.37 as compared to $9.69 in the prior year. Reported EPS in the quarter included $0.24 of purchased intangible amortization; $0.20 of restructuring costs; a $0.09 tax benefit from the timing of option exercises that is trued up in Q4; and the one-time noncash discrete tax benefit of $1.07. The next slide illustrates our year-to-date results. Local currency sales declined 1% for the six-month period. Adjusted operating income decreased 4% or 1%, excluding unfavorable foreign currency, and our operating margin contracted 60 basis points. Adjusted EPS declined 2% on a year-to-date basis or grew 1%, excluding unfavorable currency. That covers the P&L, and let me now comment on cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow amounted to $433.4 million on a year-to-date basis, a 13% increase on a per share basis from prior year levels due to favorable working capital. DSO was 37 days, while ITO was 4x. Let me now turn to our guidance for the third quarter and the full year. As you review our guidance, please keep in mind the following factors. Market conditions are soft, especially in China. While we are not seeing a negative change in market conditions, we're also not seeing a significant improvement. We believe we are well-positioned to capture growth opportunities through our Spinnaker sales and marketing program as well as our innovation, which includes several product launches, which we discussed last quarter. We continue to execute very well on our margin expansion, productivity and cost savings initiatives. And as previously mentioned, we will start to benefit from easier prior-year comparisons during the second half of the year. Lastly, as you update your models, keep in mind, our 2025 results will face a sales headwind of approximately 1.5% as we recapture delayed shipments in 2024 from 2023. Now turning to our guidance. For the third quarter of 2024, we expect local currency sales to grow by approximately 1%. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $9.90 to $10.05. Currency for the quarter at recent spot rates would be an approximate 1% headwind to the third quarter sales and adjusted EPS. For the full year of 2024, we expect local currency sales to grow approximately 2%, unchanged from our previous guidance. We expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $40.20 to $40.50, which compares to our prior guidance of $39.90 to $40.40. This includes an expected headwind of sales of 1% and adjusted EPS growth of approximately 2% from unfavorable foreign exchange. Lastly, I'd like to share a few other details on our 2024 guidance to help you as you update your models. We expect total amortization, including purchase intangible amortization to be approximately $73 million. Purchase intangible amortization is excluded from adjusted EPS and is estimated at $26 million on a pretax basis or $0.95 per share. Interest expense is forecast at $78 million for the year and other income is estimated at approximately $4 million. We expect our tax rate before discrete items will remain at 19% in 2024. We expect adjusted free cash flow of approximately $850 million, representing a conversion of approximately 100% of adjusted net income. We continue to expect share repurchases of approximately $850 million in 2024. That's it from my side, and I'll now turn it back to Patrick. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks, Shawn. Let me start with some comments on our operating businesses, starting with Lab, which grew approximately 1% compared to last year. We had good growth across most of the portfolio, especially in Europe, and we also had good growth in the Americas. We continue to benefit from our refreshed portfolio of innovative solutions and our Spinnaker sales and marketing program as well as our diversity across end margins and applications. Our industrial sales for the quarter were in line with our expectations and were down 5% with sales growth in Europe, offset by a significant sales decline in China. Product Inspection sales were up 3% on good results in both Europe and the Americas, although market conditions with food manufacturing customers are still challenging. We have also seen very good demand for our X-ray inspection technologies, which has benefited from recent innovations. Lastly, Food Retail sales declined in line with our expectations against significant project-driven sales growth in the second quarter of last year. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Starting in the Americas. Our sales grew 2% in the quarter with good growth across Lab and Product Inspection, while retail declined against significant growth in the prior year. Our results were a bit better than expected and while we observed longer customer purchasing cycles, we see good customer engagement and feel that our team is competing very well. Sales in Europe were better than expected and grew about 6% in the quarter. Our results included very good growth from both Laboratory and Industrial. Our teams continue to compete extremely well considering challenging economic conditions and are doing an excellent job leveraging our updated portfolio of innovative products. Additionally, in Europe, we have the highest proportion of sales through our own direct sales force, and they have shown excellent execution in leveraging our Spinnaker sales and marketing program to achieve these results. Lastly, our Asia and Rest of the World results were in line with our expectations and included the significant sales decline in China as expected. We continue to see soft demand from most end markets in China, but we still expect to return to sales growth in the second half due to much easier year-ago comparisons. Our China team remains agile and has implemented advanced customer mapping and database enrichment to identify potential sales opportunities as they arise. As we have mentioned in the past, strength in China can change quickly and our team remains ready to take advantage of growth opportunities. One final comment on our quarterly results. We continue to see very good growth with service across most business areas and regions. Our service business grew 6% this quarter, which was on top of double-digit growth in the previous year. Those are all my comments on the business for the quarter and now I would like to share with you additional insights on how we are strengthening our business to continue to gain market share and emerge from the market downturn in an even stronger position. Earlier this year, we shared with you how we are rolling out the next wave of various corporate programs, such as our sales and marketing excellence programs, Spinnaker 6, and the sophisticated data analytics being implemented to support our enhanced program. An important enabler of this initiative is our Blue Ocean program, which is our global process harmonization initiative, all built on a single instance of SAP. We have invested in this initiative for over 15 years, harmonizing and centralizing processes that touch all elements of our business. From sales and marketing to service our supply chain, product development, and our finance, HR, and other administration functions. With Blue Ocean, we have been able to harness the significant diversity and complexity of our business and turn it into a very powerful competitive advantage that many smaller private companies in our industry cannot match. Blue Ocean also provides us with valuable real-time business intelligence insights, allowing us to react quickly to changes in the business and operating environment. We have implemented advanced dashboards to ensure real-time reporting of KPIs across our business and are leveraging advanced software solutions to make better decisions faster. Our digitalization efforts have been a source of productivity improvements with much more ahead of us that will allow us to automate many renewal activities creating seamless end-to-end processes with meaningful productivity benefits. Blue Ocean has also enabled global shared service centers that drive process excellence, quality and productivity. In recent years, we have improved our Blue Ocean template to add new features and functionality, including adding e-shops, advanced procurement solutions and sophisticated service pricing analytics. A great example of this enhanced functionality is service technician scheduling, which can be a very complicated manual task. There are several factors to be taken into consideration when scheduling the assignments such as customer location, number of devices, age of the devices durations. We have been able to automate or semi-automate this process and then also apply enhanced real-time traffic imaging to outline the best routes. Now that we have rolled out Blue Ocean to nearly all of our entire organization, we have a strong foundation to push for new capabilities out into the entire organization at a rapid pace. Blue Ocean is the backbone supporting the next wave of several corporate programs including our new Spinnaker 6 sales and marketing initiative. This includes the rollout of advanced version of our Top K program, which are targeted investment alerts we create by using sophisticated data analytics to scan our internal CRM and external databases to identify new growth opportunities. In the past, these alerts were manually qualified and static reports were generated by our sales team in one or two releases per year. Today, our team is integrating advanced software solutions to automatically qualify and feed these leads real time into our CRM for much quicker response by our sales teams. This also enables faster generation of cross lead opportunities across our business units. Additionally, customers utilizing our customer portal today offer standardized purchase recommendations based on items in their cart. In the near future, these recommendations will be tailored to an individual customer's current installed base and application requirements, enabling more personalized suggestions. We are also expanding our capability for self-service, which, today, includes the ability to access calibration certificates or request service or remote diagnostics and remote service. And in the future, our platform will support new business models around consumables reordering and preventative maintenance and supports the rollout of our advanced cloud-based software solutions. Overall, Blue Ocean has been a long journey, starting from a goal to consolidate roughly 70 different ERP systems into one standardized global business system. From there, we have expanded the project to support new features, business models, and advanced productivity initiatives around automation across the company. As we look to the future, Blue Ocean is at the core of enabling new sales growth and margin expansion opportunities we have today. It makes us more agile and supports fast digital innovation as our central implementation allows new ideas and digital business models to be scaled globally at a rapid pace. It provides real-time visibility across the entire value chain and our business units globally to support data-driven decision-making and reallocation of resources. Significant productivity gains are enabled with bots in the AI-supported automation, and it allows for optimization of our global IT footprint with scale cybersecurity, global applications, and life cycle management. Finally, it is a platform to provide value to our customers, which includes connecting to our digital products and service offering while enhancing their empty experience. And as I mentioned earlier, these capabilities are a powerful competitive advantage that many of our -- that many in our industry do not have the ability to or resources available to replicate. Now this concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, I'd now like to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you for the presentation [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Stifel. Please go ahead. Dan Arias : Shawn and Patrick, Europe seems to be doing pretty nicely right now, especially given some of the macro conditions that exist in some of those countries. What do you think is driving that and what do you think is making the biggest difference between that region and the Americas when it comes to revenue performance and growth? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes, we are very happy with our position in Europe and how well our team competes there. I mean a lot of the success is based -- as we also said in our earlier remarks that a lot of our sales team in Europe is through our direct sales channel, and we are competing very effectively with our Spinnaker sales and marketing tools and how we direct our sales force. On top of that, we have launched a lot of new products over the last two years and with these platforms, we compete very effectively in Europe. I would say the customers in Europe really appreciate the innovation. We see that also in comparison to many other players in the market, and we are really happy with where we are with these results. As you know, in the beginning of the year, we were more concerned about Europe given the impact of the Ukraine war et cetera but we are now seeing that we are competing well, especially with our Lab portfolio. And as we highlighted also in the last quarter before the release of our new LabX portfolio that is really resonating extremely well with our customers. Dan Arias : Okay. Helpful. And then maybe on China, the message here sounds pretty similar to last quarter. Demand still weak, hope for growth in the back half, but mostly just because of the year-over-year compares and how those change. Can you just expand on the extent to which business conditions have changed at all? And if they have, what you think that might mean for the year? I assume the outlook is still for a high singles decline, but curious if the, is the potential for something slightly different one way or another has increased? And then it would just be great to get your updated thoughts on stimulus from here, just given how topical that is. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah, correct. And yes, I mean, China, as you said, unfolded as we expected in Q2. That said, you also had -- I want to remind you that we still have positive growth in the second quarter last year. When you look at the end markets, it has been soft across all of our end markets. So there's not a single market I would point out here at this point in time. And given the softness, we also think we want to maintain our guidance for the rest of the year. As you rightfully said, we expect high single-digit decline for the full year. That said, it means also that we will see positive growth in the second half and that's based on easier compares. I would say, when you asked about the stimulus program, you have not yet seen the impact of the stimulus. I mean what we see is that the stimulus this time is different from the stimulus that have been launched probably last year or the years before. This one seems to be much more focused. I think the Chinese government calls it focused on high-quality segments aiming at segments of AI, new energy, biopharma and new materials and our teams are working very closely with our customers to also help them prepare for the applications. We have prepared bundles that they can basically can also apply to these applications. We have not built in any effect of the stimulus in our guidance for Q3 and Q4. We think that will be mainly the 2025 topic. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal from JPMorgan. Rachel Vatnsdal : I just want to dig first in core industrial that was down 9% in the quarter. I think you guys had pointed us towards high single-digit declines. So can you just unpack that for us a little bit? How did that trend as it reached into June and July and better than kind of what you started off in the quarter? And then also, can you just walk us through segment expectations for Core Industrial for the rest of the year? How should we think about 3Q and then the full year as well? Shawn Vadala : Hey, Rachel, this is Shawn. I'll take that one. So like you said, I think the division kind of came in pretty much similar to how we expect to being down 9%. I think a key thing to remember in industrial is that it's very disproportionately weighted by China versus our other product categories. So we did see Industrial business down very significantly in the quarter, kind of similar to the lab business. As Patrick mentioned, we saw the downturn in China in the quarter, pretty similar across both product categories. When we kind of look outside of China, we did see, of course, better activity. We see sometimes differentiated performance depending on, like you said, the segments of the market. Certainly, where we see companies that focus on automation and digitalization and process control, we clearly are seeing better opportunities in those segments. There are other aspects of the economy that I think are a little softer at the moment but I think our teams have been very resilient here. I think our portfolio is very strong and robust and I think our go-to-market strategy with our Spinnaker program continues to be really a differentiator in the industrial areas. We've been able to target specific opportunities in the market. And as we kind of like step back from the business. One of the things I think is most exciting is I think a lot of the discussions around reshoring and near-shoring opportunities are still yet to come. And so I think as we kind of look to the future, we're a little bit more optimistic here. Rachel Vatnsdal : Perfect. And then just my follow-up. Can you just walk us through segment level and geography expectations for 3Q and the full year as well? Shawn Vadala : Yes, sure. So, hey, maybe I'll kind of run it down from the top here with the products. So our Laboratory business, our guidance for Q3 is up low single digit and for the full year, it would be up low single digits to up mid-single digit. Our Product Inspection business would be up mid-single digit for the third quarter and for the full year, up low single digit. Our Core Industrial business would be up low single digit for Q3 and flat for the full year and our retail business would be down in the mid-20s for Q3, and down double-digit, which is a little bit of a decline from how we were thinking last quarter for the full year. By geography, we expect the Americas to be flat in Q3 and up low single digit for the full year. We expect Europe to be down slightly in Q3 and up mid-single digit for the full year, and we expect China to be up low single digit in Q3, and as we said before, down high single digit for the full year. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys, congrats on this execution here. I had two guidance-related questions. One on the third quarter, maybe, Shawn, for you. Your comps get 700 basis points easier, right, the 1% seems a little light. Curious on the thought process for 3Q. Shawn Vadala : Yes. Vijay. Hey, we felt very good about our performance in the second quarter. We did do better than expected and we're not seeing any negative changes in the business, but I acknowledge we continue to be a little cautious here. There still are a lot of uncertainties in the macro. We also saw the PMI numbers the other day. In our end markets, we still see longer cycle -- sales cycles. But the other side of that is we do feel like we're competing really well and I think we are continuing to take a little bit of market share each quarter. These new products have been very well received in the market from what we can see from some initial results but nonetheless, there's still some uncertainty. And we -- as you know, we typically only have about 1.5 months of backlog. So we'd like to just kind of get through another quarter here and then have a little bit more visibility as we kind of get into the end of the year. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And Patrick, maybe one for you on -- if you look at the second quarter performance, pretty impressive on the operational side, EPS by $0.60. I think guide raise was at the midpoint maybe $0.20. So, was the guide in the back half assumptions, did it temper down a little bit? I know Shawn mentioned PMI but your business mix has changed quite a bit. Your exposure to PMI is far lesser. So maybe just comment on your back half, how you're looking at it, any change versus three months ago? Patrick Kaltenbach : Look, a very good question and I think we've been trying to say also in the prepared remarks. We don't see a change from what we have told you in Q2, to be honest. I mean, the markets -- the performance of the end markets have foremost drove rolled out as we expected it and we also seeded for the remainder of the year. Yes, we are very proud of the fact that we beat Q2 both top and even more on bottom line. You're right. I mean, our exposure on the PMI end markets is probably a little less, but we also need to see getting more momentum in pharma and biopharma moving forward to really benefit even stronger from our strong portfolio. We are taking -- as Shawn said, we're taking, of course, a bit of cautious stance here to make sure that we also can that will live up to what we told you for the full year. We've maintained the outlook for the full year. We are pretty confident in 2% growth for the full year, but we need a little bit more visibility moving forward, to be honest. Our sales team and the engagement we are seeing of our sales team with customers is excellent. We have a lot of good leads, but sales cycles still take longer and customers are still also living through the uncertain market environment, especially in China, the customers are really cautiously spending until we have better guidance also from the government on the path forward. But also in the Rest of the World, in some of the areas where we see with, for example, larger pharma accounts, big better momentum. We see that smaller pharmaceutical accounts and biotech accounts are still under pressure given the high interest rates. So if you sum all of that up, I think we are still where we have been a quarter ago in terms of market dynamics. So, if you think it didn't get worse, but we also we still are looking forward to see better momentum, to be honest, and to change our guidance. And at the moment, I think we are really well positioned with the 2% guidance for the full year. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jack Meehan from Nephron. Jack Meehan : I wanted to start ask about China again. I was wondering if you could provide color about what you're seeing across customer classes like pharma biotech, academic versus industrial and whether any of the regional dynamics are different across those. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. I mean especially on Q2, again, we have seen not a huge difference between the different market segments or end customers. They're all being pretty much down the same level with a few percent up and down. I want to remind you that again, our end markets or our end customers in China are about 60% or more than 60% are local companies, about 15% are multinationals and about 25% is government state-owned companies. But within that, we want in that segment and also the underlying end markets, whether it's industrial or pharma. Not a big difference. As I said in my earlier remark here is, there is, again, a lot of cautiousness in the end market. The customers really want to see how the government stimulus plays out and they need to have more confidence before they invest more. I think we are competing very effectively with a portfolio in China. Our local China team is very well connected to our customers. As I said, they are preparing or helping our customers to pay for the application for the stimulus, et cetera. We set up specific bundles. We have a lot of localized solutions for China. So we are not concerned about the local competition when you look at the end market is really the, I would say, the overall mood in the market and the readiness to increase investment. Jack Meehan : Great. And two follow-ups on China. On stimulus, I just want to understand the dynamic in the quarter. Is it possible that the discussion around stimulus actually led to some pause from some customers to kind of to wait for when the funding shows up? And then second is on the pharma and biotech side, have you seen any impact from the BIOSECURE Act? Shawn Vadala : Yes, Jack, maybe I'll take that one. So hey, in terms of like this air pocket topic, we're not hearing that from our teams. Not to say that maybe there's some psychology out there, but we're not hearing that at the moment. And then in terms of BIOSECURE we're not necessarily hearing any impacts of that, maybe a little small but of course, when you look at the bigger topic, ultimately, we would expect to see opportunities in other parts of the world with other customers as well, too. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Sykes from Goldman Sachs. Matt Sykes : Patrick, I just want to touch on something you mentioned when you're discussing the strength you've seen in Europe, which is a higher exposure from your direct sales force in that region. I'm not entirely clear about direct sales force exposure across regions outside of Europe. But I'm just wondering, given the success that team has had in executing Spinnaker and in the quarter, does that make you want to reinvest in a direct sales force where you might have gaps versus indirect or are you -- do you feel pretty good about where you are in terms of direct sales force exposure globally? Patrick Kaltenbach : Very good question. Thank you for that. Look, I mean, we're constantly evaluating of where we stand in terms of go-to-market strategies and channels that we have in the end markets and what are the best fit for the end markets and that's true, by the way, for both players -- that's true, of course, for our sales. And as I said, in Europe, we have a lot of direct sales force to our end customers. They are using the Spinnaker sales toolsets very well. We also have a strong direct sales team in the U.S. In other parts of the world, we're using sometimes indirect sales channel, but we are constantly evaluating that. When it comes to investment in sales channel. We are looking at it from a coverage perspective. Do we really cover all the important end markets around the world? Do we also cover the -- what we call the hot segments well enough either direct or indirect? So it's a very differentiated approach we take worldwide of how we look at this. And if we are thinking about investment, it's, first and foremost, dependent is the underlying market momentum there to increase our sales force. We also look at the same way, for example, services. In services, we see very healthy growth. I would say, in the last quarters, we have continued to invest in services, building out our service capabilities and also strengthening our services team. And that's also a good opportunity for us to move -- moving forward. Matt Sykes : And if I could just follow up on that services growth. You mentioned, I think, up 6% in the quarter. You've consistently driven sort of mid-to-high single-digit growth in services sometimes higher. Could you just give the mark-to-market? I remember at the Investor Day, you had a few years ago, that was a key initiative of yours. Could you maybe just talk about how that exposure to services has grown and where you think there still is room to continue to drive that services growth higher as a proportion of overall sales? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes, absolutely. Look, I mean, services, again, is a really strong hold of Mettler-Toledo. It's also one of the key different changes we have against many other companies out there. We have probably the strongest services organization their compared to other competitors of our size. We continue to invest not only in the size of the service team, but also in the portfolio of the services we are offering to make sure that we have unique and differentiated offerings for our customers. It has a large installed base of instrument there and a good part of that is still in touch with our services. So what we're also investing in at the moment to go after the installed base with a stronger inside sales and telesales force to make sure that we get in touch with these customers, tell them about our updated service opportunities and then moving forward, hopefully, also increase the amount of products that we have on the service contracts. So I think it's an excellent opportunity. Again, it's definitely something we keep a strong eye on and also invest in even through the downturn that we have seen last year, we continue to invest in service and I think it's paying back now. As I said, we had double-digit growth last year and even this year, based on the tough compares, we're still seeing very good growth with 6% we see. And as a final reminder, you know that services is the most popular part of our business. Operator : Next question is from Dan Leonard of UBS. Dan Leonard : My first question, Patrick, you zoomed in on share gain in your prepared remarks. Is it your view that share gain for Mettler is accelerating or are you highlighting these efforts as supportive of that historical one point of share gain? Patrick Kaltenbach : That's very -- it's a good question, but it's really hard to say about how much share you gain per quarter. I wouldn't look at as a quarter-over-quarter topic and, of course, we compare our results to what we are hearing from our competitors, and we are very pleased of how we perform even in this difficult environment. But as we also made clear, for example, on the Investor Day, on average, we own probably about 25% market share. So there's ample of room for us to gain additional share and that's why we're also investing into innovation and driving our innovation to market because this is what customers are looking for and they are looking for products that help them to become more productive, to help them with data integrity, to help them on the automation side and that will be a path for us to continue the market share gains. And we don't make big market share gains per year, but we do make small chunks every year whether it's currently accelerating or not, hard to tell, I would say, given the performance of the products compared to many competitors, we are happy with the performance, and we're seeing market share gains. Dan Leonard : Appreciate that. And then as a follow-up, this earnings season, a few of your diversified peers have announced upsized share repurchase programs and specifically flagging that the M&A target environment is still incredibly, richly valued. I'm curious your thoughts on that environment. Shawn Vadala : Hey Dan, this is Shawn. Maybe I'll take that one. I mean, as you know, we're very -- we think we're a great platform for acquisitions. When something is strategic and makes sense, we usually can move pretty quickly, but we're also very selective. And -- but absent share repurchases, we use our free cash flow to buy back shares. We feel good about how that program has worked over the years and I think part of the success is our consistency in how we execute it. And so we continue to look at it the same as we looked at it in the past and I think you'll see us be consistent with our share repurchase program. As a reminder, this year, I think our estimate is about $850 million, which approximates our free cash flow estimate for the year and absent if we did identify an acquisition opportunity. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin from Bank of America. Michael Ryskin : Shawn, maybe one for you. Just looking at the EPS guide through the rest of the year and the quarterly progression, it seems like you're a little bit of a step-up in margins in the third quarter and a bigger jump in 4Q. That's pretty consistent with what you've done historically. There's a lot of volume leverage in the fourth quarter. Just wondering if you could dive into the nuances of that margin expansion now. How much are we seeing on the gross margin line versus SG&A? Just any additional color you can give us on a quarterly basis, just confirming that. Shawn Vadala : No, I think you got it spot on. It's going to be very much about the leverage on volume. If we look at our gross margin estimates for the second half of the year. I'd say that probably on a full-year basis, we're probably up a little bit from what we were thinking last quarter. As you could see, we did pretty well in the third quarter versus our expectations. And, of course, a part of that was also doing a little bit better on the volume. For Q3, we're kind of estimating gross margin expansion in like the 60 bps kind of a range and for the full year, and that would be maybe 50 bps, excluding currency. So currencies are a little bit inverse of what we would have seen in terms of how they affect the margins, at least the moving pieces versus Q2. And then for the full year, our gross margin estimate is about 70 basis points, which, again, is up a little bit from what we were thinking last quarter. And then in terms of the operating margin. The operating margin for the third quarter estimate is down about 50 bps and then for the full year, it would be up about 40 basis points. And again, these numbers are also at the midpoint of our guidance, too. So things could be a little bit better or worse depending on how we do. But otherwise, I'd say the teams are executing really well. The pricing program continues to do -- be very effective. Pricing came in at 2% in the quarter, which is in line with our expectations. We continue to expect 2% for the full year and then our teams are doing a really fantastic job working on our various productivity in cost savings initiatives. And then maybe also to comment on our SternDrive program is driving some nice efficiencies and cost savings in the margin line. Michael Ryskin : Okay. That's all really helpful. Thanks, Shawn. And then one more to the guide. A number of other tools, peers talked about, expecting a return to more traditional seasonality as the year goes on and I mean, referring both to a little bit in 3Q in Europe and then maybe a little bit of an end of year bounce. That's implied in your guide as well. But you've also got the weird comps last year from the shipping delay. So if you could just walk us through like what are you expecting from the seasonality perspective? Is there any view on budget flush at this point? I know it's not a huge driver for you, but still just what are you thinking about there? Shawn Vadala : Yes, we are expecting things to start looking a little bit more like seasonal -- typical seasonality if you adjust for the shipping delay topic. Probably the best way -- but maybe not 100% back. But if you kind of -- I think the best way to look at that is to kind of take our sales guidance and look at the sequential and then you can see the sequentials are, I think, pretty reasonable versus historical results depending on how far back you go, adjusting for the shipping delay topic. So that gives us some confidence for the back half of the year. In terms of budget flush, as you say, we're typically not a budget flush story. But nonetheless, I think we all did feel Q4 last year. I'd say it's still a bit early to judge. As Patrick mentioned, we still see longer sales cycles with the customers but at the same time, we're only typically sitting on 1.5 months' worth of backlog. And -- but otherwise, I think we feel like there probably should be something this year versus relative to last year. But the magnitude is obviously difficult to judge, but we do feel good about how we're positioned here for the second half of the year from a sequential basis. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Josh Waldman from Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Josh Waldman : Two for Patrick, I think. First, Patrick, I wondered if you could talk a bit more about how Product Inspection performed versus your expectations. I'm curious what you're seeing in the business across kind of the major geographies and end markets and how orders have tracked over the last couple of months. Patrick Kaltenbach : Product Inspection actually we are quite pleased with the result. I mean we know that the end markets are still under pressure, customers are cautious with their investments. We know that deal cycles are longer still, but we have launched a lot of new products over last year, mainly in the X-ray business demand and we also broadened our product offering from the high end into the midrange portfolio that opens also a lot of stores for us now. So, I think we have a really good healthy engagement of our sales teams around the globe with our portfolio. So we have a healthy funnel there but I would say the caveat is still that sales cycles are longer and customers in some areas are cautious with investments until they also see the underlying market picking up. The upside for us is the new portfolio. We're competing very effectively. And again, with the broader portfolio also seeing probably more customers than we have seen before. Joshua Waldman : And then maybe a question and a half or so on Lab. Any sense on if the upside in the quarter was from better funnel conversion or did you also see new opportunities coming into the book a higher rate than you anticipated? And then maybe a follow-up question, I think. Do you get the sense that there's a change in customer buying such that accounts are more willing to work with you directly as opposed to exclusively through the distribution channels? Patrick Kaltenbach : Well, let's say, I mean, this is a very broad question. Let's focus on the Lab products right now. I mean, we see them that with our portfolio, we are competing very well. We have launched a new platform there as well. We saw also some bigger projects and especially in Europe, converting in the first half and the second quarter of the year. So that is, again, I think we are in a good position when it comes to our portfolio competing effectively in the market. But on a -- I would say in the grand scale of things, it's not like there is a significant change in customer buying behavior right now. The end markets, as we lay it out and the behavior has been laid out, it's still rather soft, especially in China but in Europe, we have seen good momentum. We also have seen in the last quarter, the Lab business in the U.S. picking up. So I think we're in a good position and the parts of the market recovers, I mean the more momentum we can capture with this portfolio, to be honest. Operator : The next question is from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Citi. Please go ahead. Patrick Donnelly : Shawn, this is one for you. You sounded a little more, I guess, optimistic on the Core Industrial outside of China, so maybe we can focus on that piece just for a second. The industrial complex is a little softer in terms of commentary of this earnings season. Just curious what you're hearing in the developed world here, how you're thinking about that core industrial piece, what you're hearing from customers and there's a little bit of optimism, the right way to lead it? Shawn Vadala : Yeah, no, thanks, Patrick and good question. I mean I think it depends a lot on what segment of the market we're talking about and probably what you picked up on in my voice was just that we have -- this is the business historically, right, when people would say, hey, can you talk about your cyclicality, we would say this is historically the part that's been exposed to the economy more than our other businesses. And then if I look at Europe, I mean, yes, Lab did a lot better than Industrial in the quarter, but we still had growth in Industrial and that's against a backdrop of a relatively weak economy there. And so that's something that we do feel good about is the resiliency there. Part of our industrial business, of course, is supporting the same end markets as Lab like pharmaceutical, but I think it really gets into what we started to see in the quarter and some of the discussions I've had with colleagues, you hear comments around, hey, if we're talking about customers that are in the business of like automation and end-to-end process control and digitalization, those customers are actually doing pretty well. If you're talking about customers that are in the business of discrete manufacturing, and those types of segments, much more challenging conditions and I understand what you're saying because I had a similar question to our team as well, too, because we certainly see a lot of the headlines from a lot of the industrial companies this past quarter having more challenging results. So I guess it's a little bit of both. I think we're really well-positioned on some of these more favorable trends, but it doesn't mean that we're necessarily immune to the economy. But in the meantime, I think we always try to focus on what we can control, and I think the teams are executing very well both on the sales and marketing side but also on the product development side and we feel very good about some of the R&D investments that we've accelerated over the last few years in that business to lean into some of these market trends and certainly, we have a great pipeline of opportunities going forward as well. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. That\u2019s really helpful run through. And then just on the 2H guide, obviously, I\u2019ve gotten a few questions here. I think someone mentioned kind of the implied raise is a little bit less than B. I mean has anything changed in your view in terms of 2H view? Obviously, you guys have the standard network conservatism a lot of times, I think people are used to it, but just how you think about 2H relative to a few months ago, again, just given that the guide change, and Shawn, even one of your answers, because we're not quite back to 100% seasonality just yet. So just how you're thinking about the market relative to a few months ago would be helpful. Shawn Vadala : Yeah, I mean, I think we're, I mean, I think we're, you know, we always sit on one and a half months of backlog. So I think that always makes it a little challenging for us when we start going out beyond the current quarter. I think we tried to acknowledge like we're executing well, we better than expected in the second quarter, but we're not just assuming that we should add that to the second half. We do see soft market conditions out there but we do benefit also from easier comparisons. We feel good about the sequentials. There is an element of us being a little bit cautious going in the second half, but I think it's prudent to be cautious too. Like I think there really are a lot of different aspects to this uncertainty in the environment. I think we're all looking forward to seeing more robust signs of things turning, but no one really can say exactly when that's going to happen. And, of course, we're a pretty diverse business by product, by end market and by region of the world. And so -- but I think when we kind of step back and look at how we're guiding, we actually feel -- we feel good about our guidance to everybody. And of course, we're always going to look to do better but right now, we feel like this is an appropriate way to position the forecast. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Catherine Schulte from Baird. Catherine Schulte : Maybe first for Shawn. Just going back to your margin commentary. I think you said gross margin up 70 basis points for the full year versus the 40% you were talking about last year but then Op margins at 40% versus the 50%, you talked about last quarter. So, I guess what's being absorbed on the OpEx side where you aren't passing through that gross margin benefit and Op margins are actually down a little bit versus your prior guide? Shawn Vadala : Yes, no, good question, Catherine. I mean I think some of this is also noise with how some of the currencies have changed over the last quarter but certainly, we are doing a little bit better on the gross margin side that I talked about earlier. And then in terms of like the OpEx side, we're still investing in the business, too and we have such a great pipeline of investment opportunities, and we're just trying to find the right balance and the right mix between realizing productivity gains, but also reinvesting in the business at the same time. Catherine Schulte : Maybe on the Lab business, adjusted for the shipping delays recaptured in the first quarter, it looks like revenue increased high single digits sequentially, which seems very encouraging. Can you just talk through any differences you're seeing between pharma and academia and pharma, are you seeing easing in terms of the customer spend caution that we've been seeing? Shawn Vadala : We're still -- yes, hey, we're still seeing caution in pharma, but maybe the one pocket that was stood out a little bit more it was in Europe. Patrick mentioned it in his -- one of his previous responses. When we talk to the team, you do hear that there has been some projects on the sidelines for a bit and we started to hear some of those projects converting, so that was a positive sign. But I would say that, hey, we're not out of the woods. We do hear comments about big pharma performing better than smaller companies or even getting into small biotech, where I think there's still some challenges there. But when you look at it from a a product perspective, what was maybe encouraging to us as we saw a pretty good growth throughout the portfolio with the only exception being Product Inspection, which was still kind of down a little bit from some -- I mean, not Product Inspection, process analytics with process analytics being down a little bit because of our exposure to bioprocessing. But when we look at the second half of the year, we feel a little bit better about that one. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of Jefferies. Q \u2013 Tycho Peterson : Actually, Shawn, I\u2019m going to pick up right where you left off on bioprocess. I know it's a smaller part of the mix, but can you maybe just give us a little sense on kind of upstream versus downstream what you\u2019re seeing there. Your equipment's obviously kind of lower price points than maybe some of your peers. But just curious, as we've kind of gone through a long period of destock and thinking about restock, where are we in kind of that cycle for you guys? Shawn Vadala : I think we feel pretty good. Maybe I'll start and Patrick wants to chime in. But like I'd say we're, I don't know if you'd say 8th inning, Patrick or so, but we're getting pretty close there. I mean, we definitely feel very encouraged as we kind of go in the second half of the year. If you think upstream and downstream we were seeing a lot of particular headwinds in our downstream business. For us also, that was where we're more exposed on the single-use side. So that could have been part of it as well, too. But when we kind of look to the second half of the year, all the data and even just the qualitative discussions we're having with the team and more importantly, customers points to a much more favorable situation for the second half. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes, absolutely. I can confirm that. I mean, again, if you want to differentiate a little bit about the regions in the U.S. and Europe. You asked about destocking issues, I would say in Europe and the U.S., we have the destocking issue behind us. There's some residual stocking issue that we're still facing in China but what we are hearing from customer, that also should be over a quarter or so. Q \u2013 Tycho Peterson : Great. And then, Shawn, question about pricing. First, I mean, I assume the assumption for this year is still about 200 basis points, but -- then more importantly, going forward, as inflation starts to pull back, should we think about you guys getting to pre-COVID levels around 250 bps per year? Shawn Vadala : Yes, Tycho. I understand the question, but I think it's probably a little bit earlier for us to kind of think about how we would guide for next year on pricing. And hey, just to also maybe remind of like how we historically guided, we typically were -- I don't think we've ever necessarily -- expect for the last few years during this inflationary environment, we're never typically guiding more than 200 basis points even in the more historical inflationary environment. So, hey, if we can do better than that, of course, we will. But I kind of look at 200 basis points as a mid-to-long-term guide is probably a reasonable assumption. Operator : And this concludes our Q&A session for today. I would like to hand the call back over to Adam for closing remarks. Adam Uhlman : Thanks, Paul, and thanks, everybody, for joining our call this morning. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any further questions. And I hope you all have a great weekend. Take care. Bye. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Enjoy your weekend. You may now disconnect.",

Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks, Adam and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. Last night, we reported our third quarter financial results, the details of which are outlined for you on Page 3 of our presentation. We experienced good growth during the third quarter in our Laboratory business and had particularly strong growth in Service. While China grew modestly this quarter, market conditions remain challenging, particularly in the industrial sector. We are very pleased with our team's strong execution of our growth and margin expansion initiatives which supported good earnings growth in the quarter. We continue to execute very well and will benefit from the prior-year shipping delays in the fourth quarter. However, global market conditions remain soft. We have introduced many exciting innovations as well as next generations of our Spinnaker sales and marketing and SternDrive productivity programs over the past year. We also continue to leverage our business diversity and ability to provide value throughout our customers' value chain to identify and capture growth opportunities and believe we are very well positioned to gain market share and deliver good earnings growth in the future. Let me now turn the call over to Shawn to cover the financial results and our guidance and then I will come back with some additional commentary on the business and our outlook. Shawn? Shawn Vadala : Thanks, Patrick and good morning, everyone. Sales in the quarter were $954.5 million which represented an increase in local currency and in U.S. dollars of 1%. On Slide number 4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales grew 1% in Europe, declined 1% in the Americas and grew 4% in Asia/Rest of the World. Local currency sales increased 1% in China in the quarter. On Slide number 5, we show sales growth by region for the first 9 months of the year. Local currency sales were flat for the first 9 months with 4% growth in Europe, 1% growth in the Americas and a 6% decline in Asia/Rest of the World. Local currency sales decreased 15% in China on a year-to-date basis. As a reminder, our first quarter sales benefited by 6% from recovering delayed product shipments which is a 2% benefit to our year-to-date results. Excluding this, our local currency sales declined 2% on a year-to-date basis. On Slide number 6, we summarize local currency sales growth by product area. For the quarter, Laboratory sales increased 5% and Industrial was flat with core Industrial down 1% and product inspection up 1%. Food Retail declined 20% in the quarter against significant project activity last year. The next slide shows local currency sales growth by product area for the first 9 months. Laboratory sales increased 2% and Industrial decreased 2%, with core Industrial down 4% and product inspection up 1%. Food Retail decreased 14% on a year-to-date basis. Let me now move to the rest of the P&L which is summarized on Slide number 8. Gross margin was 60%, an increase of 60 basis points as positive price realization and benefits from our SternDrive program were partially offset by lower volume. R&D amounted to $47.1 million in the quarter which is a 1% increase in local currency over the prior period. SG&A amounted to $228.8 million, a 5% increase in local currency over the prior year and includes higher variable compensation. Adjusted operating profit amounted to $296.6 million in the quarter, unchanged from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 31.1% which represents a decrease of 30 basis points over the prior year. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $18.2 million in the quarter. Interest expense was $18.6 million and other income amounted to $1.9 million. Our effective tax rate was 19% in the quarter. This rate is before discrete items and is adjusted for the timing of stock option exercises. Fully diluted shares amounted to $21.2 million which is approximately a 3% decline from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $10.21, a 4% increase over the prior year. On a reported basis in the quarter, EPS was $9.96 as compared to $9.21 in the prior year. Reported EPS in the quarter included $0.23 of purchased intangible amortization, $0.10 of restructuring costs and an $0.08 tax benefit from the timing of option exercises. The next slide illustrates our year-to-date results. Local currency sales were flat for the 9-month period. Adjusted operating income decreased 3% or declined 1%, excluding unfavorable foreign currency and our adjusted operating margin contracted 50 basis points. Adjusted EPS was flat on a year-to-date basis and grew 2%, excluding unfavorable currency. That covers the P&L and let me now comment on adjusted free cash flow which amounted to $671 million for the first 9 months, a 7% increase on a per share basis from the prior-year levels due to favorable working capital. DSO was 36 days, while ITO was 4x. Let me now turn to our guidance for the remainder of this year and our initial thoughts on next year. As you review our guidance, please keep in mind the following factors. Market conditions remain soft, especially in China. While we are not seeing a negative change in market conditions, we are also not seeing a significant improvement. Secondly, while there is uncertainty in our core markets, the global economy and geopolitics, we expect market conditions to gradually improve throughout 2025. We also expect to continue to benefit from customer trends in automation, digitalization and on and near shoring. Third, we assume foreign currency at current rates. And finally, please keep in mind that our third-party logistics provider delays negatively impacted our Q4 results last year by $58 million, nearly all of which was recovered in our first quarter sales results this year. This will benefit our Q4 2024 sales growth by approximately 6% and will reduce our sales growth in 2025 by 1.5%. This also negatively impacts our margin expansion in 2025. Now turning to our guidance. For the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect local currency sales to grow by approximately 8%. This includes an expected benefit of approximately 6% from the prior-year shipping delays. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $11.63 to $11.78. Currency for the quarter at recent spot rates would be neutral to fourth quarter sales and adjusted EPS. For the full year 2024, our local currency sales growth forecast is unchanged at approximately 2% or down 1%, excluding the previously mentioned shipping delays. We expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $40.35 to $40.50, up $0.15 on the low end of our prior guidance range. Free cash flow and share repurchases for 2024 are expected to be approximately $850 million. We have also provided our initial guidance for 2025. And based on our assessment of market conditions today, we would expect local currency sales to increase approximately 3% which includes the previously mentioned headwind to full year sales growth of 1.5% from the shipping delays that benefited 2024. Adjusted EPS is forecast to be in the range of $41.85 to $42.50 which represents a growth rate of 4% to 5%. At recent spot rates, foreign exchange is estimated to be a slight headwind to adjusted EPS growth. Lastly, I would like to share a few other details on our 2025 guidance to help you as you update your models. We expect total amortization, including purchased intangible amortization to be approximately $75 million. Purchased intangible amortization is excluded from adjusted EPS and is estimated at $24.8 million on a pre-tax basis or $0.92 per share. Interest expense is forecast at $82 million for the year and other income is estimated at approximately $2 million. We expect our tax rate before discrete items will remain at 19% in 2025. Free cash flow is forecast at approximately $860 million in 2025 and share repurchases are expected to be approximately $875 million. That's it from my side and I'll now turn it back to Patrick. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks, Shawn. Let me start with some comments on our operating businesses, starting with Lab which grew approximately 5% compared to last year. We had good growth across most of the portfolio and regions and continue to benefit from our robust offering and recent innovations as well as our initiatives to accelerate growth in Service and Consumables. Pharma customer activity has been mixed but improving at a low pace. Our Process Analytics business returned to solid growth this quarter as our bioproduction customers have finished destocking excess inventories. To expand our already broad portfolio of instruments we offer to our laboratory customers, we recently launched a new stain-free automated cell counter and a new microplate reader to help our customers in R&D and QA/QC labs. These new products add further to the long list of innovations we have brought to the market in recent years and expand our technology leadership. Shifting now to our Industrial business. Sales for the quarter were flat and slightly lower than expected, primarily due to market headwinds in China. Product inspection sales growth of 1% benefited from our growth initiatives targeting the mid-market but the food manufacturing industry remains challenged overall. Our core Industrial sales declined 1%, reflecting sluggish market conditions across most industries. Our team remains active in leveraging Spinnaker to identify and capture the most attractive market opportunities in core Industrial which has reduced our sensitivity to the economy, although we are not immune. Additionally, we have further enhanced our portfolio and have expanded our line of weighing terminals that feature integrated software solutions, leveraging advanced algorithms. These new terminals provide process automation control for many different filling and dosing workflows, seamlessly integrating into customer systems. Lastly, shifting to our Food Retail business. As I mentioned earlier, our Food Retail sales declined against a very significant project-related growth in the prior year. Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Starting in the Americas, our sales declined 1% in the quarter. We had good growth across our Lab portfolio with pharma customers, while Food Retail declined against very significant growth in the prior year. Core Industrial sales declined slightly as demand for our automation-related solutions was offset by lower demand in other areas. Sales in Europe grew 1% in the quarter and included growth both from Laboratory and core Industrial, benefiting from modest growth from pharma customers, while food manufacturing remained soft. Our teams in Europe continue to execute well despite challenging economic conditions across the region. And finally, our Asia/Rest of the World results this quarter were in line with our expectations. Our China operations returned to sales growth in the quarter due to easier comparisons and strong execution of our sales team but underlying demand remained soft due to weak economic growth and excess capacity in certain industries. Our teams across Asia continue to execute very well on driving sales and market share growth. Targeting growth in emerging markets such as Southeast Asia and India remain an important element of our long-term growth strategy. In summary, market conditions overall have remained challenged but our team is executing very well. We have continued to fund important growth investments in areas like innovation and field sales and service, while we have reinforced our unique go-to-market strategies with the launch of the next wave of Spinnaker. In 2025, we will make additional targeted investment in these areas to further extend our market leadership and strengthen our competitive advantages. An important element of our growth algorithm is gaining market share in our highly fragmented markets and pursuing growth opportunities in faster-growing market segments. Spinnaker helps us identify these new growth opportunities and guides our sales force to ensure we maximize our potential. We continue to see significant market trends and opportunities related to the localization of strategically important technologies, investments to develop new energy solutions for the future and efforts to increase resilience in supply chains around the world. At the same time, customers continue to seek productivity and insights through automation and digitalization. Spinnaker encompasses our lead generation programs with existing customers and it houses our Top K program to identify growth opportunities with potential new customers. Top K uses proprietary data analytics on our internal big data warehouse and external data sources to identify and pursue opportunities. Our teams are expanding our capabilities in this area to automate more of the qualification processes and accelerating the rate that we can generate tailored and actionable investment alerts for our field sales force. This program has been very important in driving lead growth with new customers this year and our team remains focused on expanding our data sets and adding sophisticated analytics and automation to enhance this program in 2025. Another important driver for our long-term growth is to accelerate the growth of our Service business. As a reminder, Service represents approximately 25% of our sales and has grown 7% on a year-to-date basis in local currencies which includes very strong growth of 9% in the third quarter. Service will continue to be an important growth driver in the future. Service is a key part of our solutions offering and is a very important competitive advantage as we support our customers' ability to maintain uptime, improve productivity and comply with regulatory requirements. We believe we have the largest service network amongst our direct competitors with over 3,000 technicians, delivering a very professional and consistent service experience to customers throughout the world. Our customer satisfaction ratings for our Service business and our Net Promoter Scores are excellent and are at record high levels. We aim to grow our Service business faster than the company average over the medium term and are making dedicated investments in field technicians, in telesales and data analytics resources to support our growth aspirations. Additionally, we continue to benefit from our actions to improve the productivity of our service organization and increase its capacity to serve customers, including leveraging new software capabilities to estimate service durations, semi-automated scheduling of service visits and utilizing expanded core triage capabilities to resolve service requests remotely and reduce trips to our customer locations. We are also expanding the use of sophisticated data analytics and automation technologies to increase the effectiveness of our dedicated Service sales team. Our largest opportunity is servicing a greater proportion of our installed base which approximates $3 billion of potential Service revenue. Today, we have penetrated about 1/3 of this opportunity. And given the vast amount of data we possess about it, like when an instrument was sold, who's using it, in what application it's being used, we can create targeted sales campaigns to service them specifically tailored to their needs based on our data. This will help further expand our coverage. Service contracts help ensure that the measurements from our precision instruments are reliable and also helps prevent costly downtime. We have maintained our focus on selling more service packages at the point of new product sale. Over the years, we have made important enhancements and differentiation to service levels of prepaid contracts to meet the varying needs of our customers. We have also enhanced our portfolio of services over the years with solutions like our RapidCal Tank Scale Calibration service. Regular calibration of tank scales is required across industries such as pharma and chemical to ensure measurements are accurate and reliable. Our RapidCal service can calibrate these scales 3x faster than traditional methods and also does not require the tank to be emptied, cleaned and filled with expensive ultra-pure water that would need to be discharged afterwards. So it is not only faster but also much more efficient and environmentally friendly. We have also enhanced our offering of certified calibration certificates to ensure compliance with regulations and avoid cost of inaccurate measurements. Our calibration services are highly differentiated from the competition and include our comprehensive and audit-proof electronic documentation that adheres to the highest standards -- to the highest industry standards. So that is a brief overview of the efforts we have underway to accelerate our growth by reinforcing our unique go-to-market approaches with Spinnaker, identifying and capturing growth opportunities with new customers and growth industries and accelerating the growth rate of our Service business. We expect our focused execution on these initiatives will continue to deliver very tangible benefits over the next year and beyond. Now, this concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, I'd now like to open the line to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Patrick, maybe my first one for you on the fiscal '25 assumptions here. I think ex the 150 basis points headwind, the underlying mid-singles, it's in line with the peers. What are you assuming for Labs versus Industrials? And I think your comments on Services was helpful. Is Services still expected to grow in the mid-singles plus high singles in fiscal '25? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. So let me start with the last part of the question and I'll let Shawn walk you through the details on the growth expectations of the different segments. So Services, yes, we expect to continue to grow above company average. So we expect it to continue to mid- to high single digits next year. As I said in my prepared remarks here, we're investing quite heavily in our Service business, not only in expanding our service portfolio but also strengthening our telesales team, leveraging more data to reach the installed base and tapping into that installed base that we don't cover yet today is a significant growth opportunity for us in the future. So Shawn, will you walk Vijay through the details of the segments assumptions? Shawn Vadala : Vijay, maybe I'll just walk you through the different assumptions for 2025. And I'll do it on a reported basis but I'll also do it adjusting for the headwinds on the shipping delays, just so that's clear. So our Lab business, we're assuming will grow low to mid-single digit on a reported basis but will grow mid- to high single digit, excluding the headwind of the shipping delays. Our core Industrial business and our Product Inspection businesses are both estimated to grow low single digit on both the reported and an adjusted basis and that would be the same for our -- obviously, our total Industrial business. And then our Retail business is expected to be flat next year or up low single digit adjusted for the shipping delays. And then, I'll give you the regions too, since we're doing it. Americas on a reported basis is expected to grow low to mid-single digit. And on an adjusted basis for the shipping delays, it would grow mid-single digit. Our European business is expected to grow low single digit on a reported basis and adjusted for the shipping delays, it would grow mid-single digit. And then China is expected to grow low single digit on both a reported and adjusted basis. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, Shawn. And maybe one on margins here. EPS guidance. I know you guys start typically conservative. What are you assuming for operating margin expansion for fiscal '25? And are Service margins above corporate? Shawn Vadala : Yes. So our operating margin for next year is expected to be flattish to this year, maybe up slightly. Our Service business, yes, it does have a margin above the corporate average. But hey, maybe I use this as an opportunity to talk about maybe some of the optics about the shipping delays on earnings because I can imagine that's a challenge to try to understand the guidance. So we talked about the first optic which is on sales. And then from a sales perspective, it's a 1.5% headwind. I think that's pretty well understood. So our organic sales growth for 2025 is expected to be 4.5% adjusted for the timing of the shipping delays. But there's also a very meaningful impact on our EPS growth as well and our margin expansion. And since -- especially since most of our products are -- that were affected are in our Lab business which are at above average margins. And you can kind of see this like if you think about the operating profit margin compression in Q4 of last year and the operating margin expansion in our Q4 guidance of this year. If you look at our Q4 guidance of this year, it implies an operating margin expansion over last year of about 320 basis points or so. And directionally, we're going to see something -- we're not going to give out details at this time for Q1 but directionally, you're going to see something similar in terms of margin compression in Q1 of 2025. And then after that, we should get back to a more normal cadence. And if you think about it, it kind of makes sense if you think about our overall gross margin percentage and the related incrementals associated with timing shifts because they're going to be a little bit higher because of the nature of our fixed cost structure. But we also wanted to communicate if we didn't have this effect of these shipping delays, our EPS growth guidance would be more in line with our typical relationship between sales growth and EPS growth. And we'd estimate it'd probably be about 4% higher to our EPS guidance. And then we also have a couple of other additional items. The first is our variable compensation in 2024 is not back to target levels. So we'll have a little bit of a headwind for that in 2025. And then currencies are slightly unfavorable to EPS at the moment, too and we mentioned that in the script. But when we step back from all that, the other message we wanted to make sure we could communicate today, too, is that we still have a lot of very exciting opportunities to invest in the business and we're not going to slow down these investments just because of the optics of the shipping delay to our sales growth. And I think that's important because I think we have a lot of good things in the pipeline that we're investing in. And also just to remain -- the other thing we want to communicate is that we do remain very confident about our ability to grow earnings and expand margins going forward in accordance with our medium- to long-term guidance. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Matt Sykes : Patrick, maybe just first on Services. You guys gave a lot of great color in your prepared comments. One thing I'm just curious about and understanding that the margins are already above corporate average. But just curious about the level of operating leverage you can extract from Services, understanding the 3,000 technicians you already have, it sounds like you're willing to make more investments in that. I'm just wondering on the technology and automation side, how much of that can offset maybe increased hiring to create operating leverage in the Services business margin? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Thanks, Matt. It's a great question. And of course, we continuously also going to improve the effectiveness of our service team. I mentioned a little bit in the call that we're using special software capabilities, including deep learning algorithms to understand how we can most effectively schedule services and also with that drive up efficiency of our technicians in the field. And we make continuous improvements along this. We -- on our platform, we just recently also launched a new service template that takes care of that to make sure that we most effectively use our service technicians. We are, of course, also changing more and more of our future product portfolio with more remote service capabilities and with that driving more efficiency of the service team as well. But that said, I mean, we still will expand probably headcount in Service as well, not only on the technician side but also making sure that we have enough support to drive marketing campaigns and lead generation for Service out there. I talked a little bit about this untapped opportunity of instruments that we have in the field that we don't service today. We have information, again, as I said, when they have been bought, where they are, what application they are used for. And we are now getting back to these customers, reaching out to them and offering new and broader service portfolio. And to service these instruments and these solutions will require also more technicians in the future. I think it's a great growth opportunity. I think it's something also that leads to strong customer satisfaction. Our Net Promoter Scores in Services are outstanding. Customers love our service, not only because of the proficiency but also again helping them with compliance, etcetera. So it's -- again, it's a strong growth driver for us moving forward and also helping us on the margin expansion. But it will require also investments in headcount. Besides all the efforts we do and we continue to do this in driving efficiency with smarter software solutions, again, deep learning algorithms and we have data scientists in the group as well using in the future also more knowledge management tools to understand really how we can more efficiently drive the information to service engineers that we can reduce dual visits to customers, etcetera, making sure that they have all the right information when they get to customers, etcetera, to make sure they can increase and maximize first-time fix, etcetera. So there's a lot of opportunities. And that's why we are continuing to invest in this and we'll see in the next years to come also nice growth from this business. Matt Sykes : Great, Patrick. And then just on China, understanding your guidance for next year for low single-digit growth. Just curious how much stimulus impact are you kind of assuming in that growth rate? And then just more longer term, have you changed your assumptions on longer-term China growth as it faces your business? Just curious to see if that's been adjusted. I know there's a lot of different potential headwinds that could come in but just curious about how your framing of that growth has changed? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes, excellent. Yes. Look, for next year and your question regarding the stimulus, we have not factored anything regarding the stimulus in our forecast of low single digit for next year. As you probably also have heard from some of our competitors, it's pretty unclear yet when the stimulus will really gain traction. So we take a more cautious approach here when we forecast the growth for next year. With the last stimulus that came out, our team is still actively working with our customers, making sure that they can bundle solutions in the right way, so they basically can apply for the stimulus that is out there. But I don't think it will have a meaningful impact this year and we also have not factored anything yet in for next year. And that basically brings us then to the low single-digit growth model for next year. Long -- mid and long-term, we think there's still a very good potential for us in China. We have not changed our long-term outlook of high single-digit growth in China. Yes, it will have to come back into growth in many areas. But I think the fundamentals in China, investing into health care, into safer, clean environment and safer food, investing in important technologies like semiconductors, etcetera, are all areas where we serve our customers with dedicated solutions. We have a great team in China that works very closely in China with our customers to develop solutions for the Chinese market. And that also makes us compete very effectively against local players. So, I think we have a great opportunity to continue also there to drive market share and participate in the underlying growth but on top of that, gain market share. That's why we have not changed the long-term model for China. Operator : The next question comes from Dan Arias with Stifel. Dan Arias : Shawn or Patrick, maybe just another one on the outlook for '25. Obviously, a lot of moving parts out there. Whereas you sit today, do you see the biggest sources of variability when it comes to what could have you better or worse than the initial outlook? Obviously, China is a big one. So, I get that. But if there's more to add there, then by all means. But beyond China, I'm just kind of interested in where you see the error bars as being the widest when it comes to just the businesses or the key regions that you have? Shawn Vadala : Yes. Dan, this is Shawn. I'll take that. I mean I think you said it. I mean, China, we've always said in the past, things can move relatively fast and quickly in either direction. And I'm sure we'll continue to have zigs and zags along the way. So we certainly see upside to the guidance in China. But who knows how things develop here over the next year. Other swing factors, I mean, of course, our end markets are a big part of that. When do companies really get back to moving forward with a lot of projects that have been on the sidelines recently. I think you guys all know what our core secular exposures are. But you kind of quickly just get into things outside of our control, whether it's market conditions, macro, geopolitics, those types of things. But in terms of what we can control, we feel very good about that. The teams just continue to execute really well. Patrick and I were just on our world trip recently and it's always really engaging and energizing for the 2 of us to be with all of our teams around the world. Dan Arias : Yes. Okay. And then maybe on margins, a good portion of the Lab portfolio has been refreshed, I believe, at this point. And I think the idea for you is to replace products with those that have better margins. So is that something that you think can be meaningful when it comes to overall profitability next year? Shawn Vadala : I think -- I mean, no individual product launch moves the needle for us but we have had a very good cadence recently. It definitely helps. I think you see it in our margin expansion this year. And -- but I just kind of view that as part of the overall one of the ingredients of any that drives our overall margin expansion but definitely something we're mindful of for sure. And I think even more importantly, the new products are very well received in the marketplace and that drives our value proposition and ultimately, a customer's willingness to pay. So it certainly helps us with our pricing in the market as well, too. Operator : The next question comes from Dan Leonard with UBS. Dan Leonard : I have a question about a potential change in the tariff environment. How are you preparing for any change? And is there anything different about your business today versus the 2018, 2019 time frame when tariffs were a topic? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Good question. And yes, as you also point back to 2018, '19, we definitely had really successfully navigated tariffs in the past as well. I mean what has changed since then for us, number one is we, of course, have also continued to really expand our production footprint worldwide and expand, for example, our Mexico production to supply to the U.S. and providing us also with more manufacturing flexibility. So we have also started already over the last 2 years, building some redundant manufacturing lines that we had initially only in China, now also in Mexico. But we going to have more flexibility as we have really global manufacturing footprint. China, Mexico are not the only footprints we have. If there is more headwinds or changes out there which we continuously monitor, we will, of course, tap into that opportunity to, as needed, then adjust our manufacturing footprint if that is needed. I think we have a unique advantage of our global supply chain and we definitely continue to fully leverage that. I think we have definitely made the right steps to start early on derisking the setup that we had with the bigger footprint in China and making sure we have enough redundancies that we will continue to do so. And I think it will -- actually, in that regard, I think we are still, of course, exposed to tariffs but we are pretty -- I think we're pretty good prepared to react on those. Dan Leonard : Appreciate that. And then a quick follow-up, Patrick. You mentioned that in speaking to your Process Analytics business that destocking is fully behind you at this point. What does the growth rate of that business then look like in the absence of destocking? Is it back to traditional long-term growth rates? Or is it something different? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Actually, we are extremely happy to see that the momentum in our product and mix business really has picked up. It's a clear sign that destocking is behind us. It's not only the size of the orders we receive, it's also the frequency of the orders we received that really tells us that customers are back to normal operation. I think also with the launches of new products that we had over the last years, we are well positioned to maintain our strong market position there. And in terms of the growth rate, Shawn, do we have the growth rate for the last quarter for Product Inspection -- for product year-over-year [ph]? Basically, within our Lab number and... Shawn Vadala : Yes. We don't give out specific numbers but I would say within our Lab portfolio, we had good growth throughout the portfolio but we had very strong growth. I think it was double digit in product - Process Analytics. And by the way, we also had really good growth in Analytical Instruments. Operator : The next question comes from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : I wanted to ask a little bit about the assumptions on the fourth quarter guide. I was just doing some simple math. I think the revenue forecast implies something like 6% growth sequentially. I was just benchmarking looking back, I think it was more -- something more like a little over 10%. So I was just curious, like if you look sequentially, like why you were building in a little bit more conservatism than we've seen previously? Shawn Vadala : I'm sorry, Jack, can you repeat it? I didn't pick it up. Yes. Jack Meehan : Just looking at the ramp from the third quarter to the fourth quarter on total sales, I think it's about 6% sequential growth is what your guide implies? In the past, it's been a little bit over 10%. Just why you're embedding a little bit more conservatism? Shawn Vadala : Yes, sorry, thanks, yes. So yes, I think, I understand the question. Yes, I think it might be even closer to 7% sequential but I understand it. Yes, we're a little bit more cautious right now. I think China is a big part of it on market conditions in general but particularly China. I think if you kind of dig into the sequentials, you'll see China is the one that is more affirm to standout there. And yes, I was a little distracted because I was just looking at the notes on this Process Analytics thing. We grew double digit in Europe and in the U.S. but we grew high single digit globally. Jack Meehan : And then maybe just a follow-up on, again, like kind of this third quarter to fourth quarter dynamic. Can you just remind us like what you've historically seen as it pertains to a budget flush? Like I know some companies have more -- it's a little bit more dynamic. But if you could just talk about what you're expecting in that regard and just [indiscernible]. Shawn Vadala : I think there's going to be some. We're not counting on a full flush. I mean -- and I think you can see it with your first question, right? I think a typical like 5- or 10-year average of sequentials from Q3 to Q4 is more in the 10% kind of a range. So you can tell we're not counting on a full flush. But I think part of that is also related to China. I mean we hear mixed things when talking to our teams. I mean there's definitely a lot of activity. We definitely see some positive things out there but there's also things that are still delayed. And so it's a little bit on which customer you're talking to sometimes. Operator : The next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Rachel Vatnsdal : I wanted to follow-up on some of the China comments but really more focused on the near-term trends. So you mentioned that China returned to growth this quarter. You also highlighted that there's some excess capacity in some of the markets and pressures in Industrial as well. So can you just unpack that for us a little bit more? And then, Shawn, you just mentioned on Jack's question that in terms of that 3Q to 4Q sequential ramp, some of that is pressured by China. So can you just walk us through what are your China assumptions into 4Q as well? Shawn Vadala : Yes, sure. Maybe I'll start and I'll let Patrick kind of pick it up. So a couple of positives. One, overall, we did return to growth. I mean we've been going through a period in China now of very significant decreases. There's been kind of this resetting, if you will, over the last 4 quarters. So it was nice to see modest growth in the quarter. We did have low single-digit growth in the Lab business and then we had a low single-digit decline on the Industrial business. In fairness to the Industrial business, the Lab had an easier comparison. I mean our Lab business kind of started to downturn a lot more than on the Industrial side. And you could argue the Industrial has been held up pretty resiliently in spite of a very challenging market situation overall. So low single digit is relative to market conditions, I think, shows how well the team still continues to execute there. And Patrick and I were just there recently and the Industrial team was sharing with us a lot of the innovations that they've come out with also on the Laboratory side. And it's just -- it's really kind of neat to see the breadth of the things that they're doing locally and bringing to the market. In terms of in terms of how we're thinking about China for the fourth quarter, because of some of these comps, we're going to start seeing a little bit more divergent in terms of Lab and Industrial. We mentioned that the comp overall -- well, I don't know do we give guidance for Q4 or not yet, I can't remember. I think -- so just to be clear, our guidance for Q4 for China is mid-single-digit growth. And if you exclude the impact of this shipping delay benefit, it's going to be more like low single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. And on a reported basis, that will kind of translate into more like low double-digit growth on the Laboratory side, acknowledging they're lapping still an easy comparison there. And then on the Industrial side, it would -- we're expecting it to be down high single digit, maybe on the higher end of high single digit might even round to a 10%. We'll see how it plays out. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Excellent. Thanks, Shawn. If I may add, in terms of the question regarding unpacking the growth areas in China, I think where we're seeing better recoveries in pharma and in Process Analytics, also in some of the special chemical spaces in China that's recovering well. Again, also there, we have destocking behind us. The area where we still are not yet in the same recovery mode is in industrial automation. Part of that is also linked to areas that have seen exceptional growth over the last 2 years, like, for example, the Battery segment in China. And that's -- truly, that's a capacity issue. I mean they are sitting on a lot of overcapacity. So they are not, at the moment, not investing in additional capacity expansion and automation solution and that's pulling some of our growth rates in China down on industrial automation. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. That's all helpful. And then just as my follow-up, could you walk us through those 4Q assumptions by segment and geography in terms of what you're assuming, including and excluding the comp? Shawn Vadala : Yes, absolutely. I'm going to start with the top with Lab. So on a -- like I did before for 2025, I'll give you the reported number and then I'll give you the adjusted number for the shipping delay from last year. So on a reported basis, we expect lab to be up low double digit and on an adjusted basis for the shipping delay up mid-single digit. The core Industrial business, we expect to be up low single digit on a reported basis and down slightly low single digit on an adjusted basis for the shipping delay. For Product Inspection, we expect both to be up high single digit. So that would translate into a total Industrial growth of mid-single digit on a reported basis and up low single digit on an adjusted basis. And then Retail would be down about 10% on a reported basis and down high teens on an adjusted basis. And then as we look at the geographies, we estimate Americas will be up low to mid-single digit on a reported basis and flattish on an adjusted basis. Europe would be up low double digit on a reported basis and up low single digit on an adjusted basis. And then China, we already mentioned, would be up mid-single digit on a reported basis and then up low single digit on an adjusted basis for the shipping delay. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Waldman with Cleveland Research. Josh Waldman : Patrick, it seems like you've made more of a point to talk on share gains over the last couple of quarters. Do you think you're seeing improvement in momentum here? And if so, is it more a function of a change in the competitive landscape or maybe the environment from, say, a customer preference or anything like that? Or is it more just building momentum on some of the internal service and sales efforts? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. I think it's a bit of both, Josh. Thanks for the question. I mean what we're seeing is that the products that we have launched in the different categories compete extremely well. Of course, we are also looking also at growth numbers of our competitors in the same -- in the last couple of quarters and see that we are doing really well. Despite the low growth environment, we are still outgrowing these competitors in many areas. We see also that our win-loss ratios in the markets that we serve are very stable, that our products are being well received by our customers that our teams -- our sales teams are really able to compete with this portfolio very effectively. And that's also part of the feedback Shawn and I got when we did our budget to and talk to the market organizations worldwide. Actually, they are very happy with the products, the latest releases that we have in the different categories, whether it's Lab, whether it's, for example, also Product Inspection. They can compete effectively with these new products that we have launched. And in some areas, we even went into market segments that we didn't serve before. If you think about the Product Inspection business, where we have launched a number of midrange products we call them. So at a more mid-range product level. We historically have been always the market leader and still are the market leader in high-end segment but with this new portfolio, we can really also tap deeper into the mid-range product portfolio and that's going very nicely for us. We have launched several X-ray products that is helping us winning in the mid-range but also opening more doors and helping us to upsell some of this product portfolio. So it's -- again, it's a blend together with the strong go-to-market strategies that we have. Whenever we see new market segments, new hot segments using our Top K and Spinnaker portfolio to identify these customers to prepare the right materials for our sales team and get them in touch with these accounts and qualify the accounts and bring our portfolio top of mind of these new customers. I think that's a differentiation. And that's really the combination of a strong innovative product portfolio with the right sales tools to also get it in front of the customers, also new customers that we don't serve today is the winning recipe also moving forward. Josh Waldman : Got it. And then, Patrick, can you talk a bit more on the trends you're seeing within the pharma end market? I think you commented strength -- on strength in the U.S. and Europe. Was that more a benefit to Process Analytics and Pipettes or are you seeing improvement in Instruments? And then based on what you're seeing from these accounts kind of real time and where do you expect to end the year, do you think we're on a path back to kind of normalized longer-term growth in '25 from these accounts? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes, good question. I mean I talked a bit about Process Analytics in the pharma space and also the biopharma space that is definitely back to good growth for us. And again, both in terms of order frequency and order volumes, we are very happy with that. On the Analytical Instrument side, across the Pharma business, I would also say we're seeing better sales engagement, better momentum and some accounts still prolonged sales cycles, to be honest. I mean there are customers out there who want to upgrade their portfolio, we see the benefit of our new products but it still takes them longer to get them through the internal approval cycles. But I'm quite optimistic that also that will in the, let's say, quarters to come, we will get back to more normal levels. Look, I mean, 70% to 80% of our business is replacement business and that had been tuned down for almost 2 years now. That also means moving forward, there is at one point in time when the budgets will be released, there is a catch-up that we can capture. And that's why we are also really focusing so much on innovation and getting -- having the best updated portfolio out there to capture this wave when these budgets are released. Operator : The next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Shawn, I wanted to drill a little more into the margins. Certainly get the moving pieces on '25. It sounds like flat for '25, mainly due to the kind of the logistics catch-up. But I guess when you look at '24, that was boosted by the logistics catch-up. I mean, would '24 have been down on margins without that logistics catch-up? Again, just trying to feel out the margin algorithm here, just given if we look at over a 2-, 3-year period, you just haven't seen much expansion. I guess what are the key levers going forward off of this? Are the China headwinds maybe weighing on things a little bit? Can you talk about the China margins? Just trying to dive into the margin piece ex some of that logistics, if you can. Shawn Vadala : Yes, sure. I understand the question, Patrick. I mean -- so if you look at '24, our operating profit margin is expected to expand in the 50 basis point kind of range. You're right. If you exclude the shipping delay, that probably would have been down a little bit. It's kind of the same as you kind of like look at the sales growth, right? The sales would have been -- I mean, we need to acknowledge volumes are still down if you adjust for the shipping delay. So our -- what's our guidance, 2%. And if you exclude the 3% we're minus 1%. And then if you exclude pricing, volumes down 3%. So there's a reality there. But I think if you kind of look back, if you're just like looking at the last couple of years, I think you're looking at a period where there hasn't been volume growth. And -- but that's after a period where there was exceptional volume growth. And so I think you need to go back, if you really want to do a look back, I'd go back to like 2019 pre-COVID and our margins have expanded at that time, they were under 26%. So we've had tremendous margin expansion still over this time. It just wasn't quite a straight line. Now as we kind of look forward, we still remain very confident, as I mentioned earlier in the Q&A and why do we remain confident? Like all the things that we have at our disposal to increase margins are still very -- have a lot of runway to them. It starts with growing the business. We have a lot of opportunities there. We still serve very highly fragmented markets. We've been investing a lot on innovation. We just launched a new generation of Spinnaker 6. So we have plenty of opportunities to expand sales going forward and then we talked about Service today. Second is pricing. Pricing has been and will continue to be a key lever. We have a lot of very innovative things within the program. We have very sophisticated analytics. We have very sophisticated tools. We have teams all around the world working together with our market organizations and as well as our product organizations to optimize price. We have some pretty sophisticated things also in terms of our ability to provide pricing recommendations. And all this has been also supported well by our R&D pipeline which is continuing to increase the value propositions of our products. And then SternDrive, we talked about it earlier this year about launching the latest generation and wave of SternDrive which is about how do we improve efficiencies in the organization, primarily targeting our supply chain as well as reducing costs. Lots of very interesting things in that program, still have many innings to go in terms of the runway there. Also a lot of new technologies that we're able to take advantage of in our manufacturing setup to be more productive. And then on the last call, we talked about Blue Ocean and that was also a little intentional to remind people of the power of Blue Ocean. And there's a lot of things that Blue Ocean gives us in terms of a foundation and an enabler for a lot of the programs we do but it also helps us drive productivity, whether it's through the ability to automate processes and leverage shared service centers and -- but also providing better insights to make better decisions in the business through more advanced analytics. Patrick Donnelly : That's really helpful. Anything on the China margins quickly, if you don't mind? Shawn Vadala : China, I think China is at above corporate average margin. So it's been a bit of a headwind to our overall margin over the last year. But it's nice to see that we're starting to turn the corner there on growth and going forward. So -- but nothing particular. Within China, we've addressed productivity issues there with the volume decrease. The team has been very focused on acknowledging that. And -- but we also feel like we have a very strong organization that executes well and is prepared for the future. And I'd say our Chinese team is certainly one of the leaders in our company when it comes to areas like SternDrive and driving productivity and they're a very innovative organization. Patrick Donnelly : That's really helpful. And then, Patrick, just quickly on the Industrial side. It sounds like China, obviously weighing on things. Can you just talk Industrial broadly? Is it mainly China that's the issue? And what the -- kind of what you're seeing on that front from customers would be helpful. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Good question. Look, I mean, China is definitely a factor, as I said but it's also in the U.S. and Europe where we have seen a slower market in the last quarter. Some of the areas, I would say it wouldn't take a pause but also there, the decision cycle is taking a bit longer. If you compare -- if you also look at the earnings reports of some of our competitors in the industrial space, you can see that some of the automation growth has been slowing down quite a bit. I think we're still competing very effectively but we are not totally immune to these changes out there. I mean, PMIs, while I don't want to always link it to PMIs but has been down now for many quarters. And with that, there has been a subdued, I would say, investment in some of the industrial automation. That I'm sure that will come back because there is a need for productivity gains. There is also a shrinking workforce if you look into Europe and U.S. And that will require also investment in automation and digitalization. And our solutions are front and center here. They are empowering our customers to drive the needed productivity gains and also compliance when it comes to data handling, etcetera. So midterm, I'm not concerned about that, to be honest. So again, we have a strong product portfolio. I think the trend for automation and digitalization will stay intact. But yes, we had a slower quarter this last quarter and it was not only China. China was probably more prominent but also the U.S. and Europe are somewhat smaller. Shawn Vadala : Yes. And as a reminder, too, our Industrial business, while it has more exposure to the general economy than our other businesses, about 60% of it still is anchored in our core segments of a combination of pharma, biopharma, food manufacturing and chemical. And -- but we also see a lot of these delays and things taking a little bit longer in our core segments as well, too. It's not just the general economy. Operator : The next question comes from Tycho Peterson with Jefferies. Tycho Peterson : Actually, I just want to follow up on some of the Industrial stuff. So Product Inspection, you're guiding to high single digit in the fourth quarter. I assume that's easy comp because you're talking about low single digit next year. But can you maybe just touch on Food Manufacturing? That's been a challenging business for a while. And any risks, I guess, with the new administration on deregulation for either that or broader parts of the portfolio? I know it's early days. Patrick Kaltenbach : Shawn? Shawn Vadala : Yes, you want to... Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes, I can start and you can chime in, Shawn. Look, I mean, as I said in the beginning, the good news here is we are competing really well with Product Inspection with our upgraded portfolio also with the new mid-range products. Yes, the market is still slow. Customers are under pressure. If you look at the big packaged food customers out there, they all, of course, are also under pressure when it comes to their margins. That's why what we're seeing is good engagement but prolonged sales cycles. Still, Q4, I think, is a bit an easier comp compared to last year. That's right. But midterm, I think we will stay in that low to mid-single-digit range that we have forecasted for next year for PI. There's not a fundamental change, I would expect from the current administration. when it comes to the impact of packaged food companies which is a large part of our customer base. Shawn Vadala : Yes. I mean I think we need to see what they come out with. But I think what we find is every time there's a concern about are people still going to buy whatever. There's new brands, there's new sizes. There's new shapes. There's like -- and so people are still going to eat. And so there tends to be always opportunities even if there's risks with change. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. And there's -- again, there's different modalities we serve from check weighing, making sure that it's the right amount and customers are as concerned that they package enough into the packaged food but also not too much. So they want to have check weighing at the end of the line. And then the other controller when it comes to physical contamination, it's a brand protection for these companies. And it's -- we make food safe. and our customers, they're definitely are the big part of their brand protection. Nobody wants to find physical contamination in their food. Shawn Vadala : Exactly. Tycho Peterson : And then, Patrick, I'm trying to reconcile your comments in the opening about just more onshoring but then automation was soft in the Americas. I mean just when do you think automation actually turns here? Do you think you could actually overshoot next year given some of the onshoring initiatives? Patrick Kaltenbach : We'd love to overshoot, of course. But, again, I can tell you, I mean, that onshoring reshoring process is something that we monitor very closely. But I mean, this takes also time, right? It's not like you shut down somewhere or you slow down your business in China and then move it within 6 months to the U.S. or to Europe, it takes time. I think you have not seen, I would say, the material part of the reshoring activities worldwide. There's still to come. When it really will gain momentum, probably more of that next year in the years to come but the exact timing is difficult to forecast, to be honest. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And the last one, Shawn, just pricing assumptions in the fourth quarter and then thinking about next year, obviously, with inflation coming down, what's your pricing power? Has the algorithm changed at all? Shawn Vadala : No. Thanks, Tycho. We're still thinking 2% for Q4 and we're also thinking 2% for next year. Operator : And your final question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Michael Ryskin : I'll be quick. First, Shawn, I want to confirm some comments you made earlier. I thought I heard you say that margins flat in 2025? I just want to make sure I heard that correctly and that's not sort of an adjusted number. Just a little bit hard to reconcile the EPS with guide with that. Is that kind of like flattish, maybe down a little bit? Or is that a hard flat? Shawn Vadala : So operating margin is flattish. Yes, maybe... Michael Ryskin : Flattish? Shawn Vadala : Yes and then -- but the gross profit margin would be up like 30 to 40 bps. Michael Ryskin : Okay. Yes. All right. Exactly. That makes sense. And then sort of a follow-up on that. On the shipping component, I just want to make sure we back it out correctly, the way you kind of described it for 2024. Is it fair to say that ex shipping margins would be up something like 50, 75 bps range, 50, 70 bps next year and that's the swing. I'm just trying to [indiscernible]. Shawn Vadala : Yes. I mean I -- yes, I don't know the exact math but that sounds like a reasonable range to me. Michael Ryskin : Okay. And then last one for me. I think Tycho was just asking about Product Inspection. I want to ask a little bit about Food Retail. I know it's not a critical part of your business, not something you talk about a lot but that's just sort of been declining pretty consistently for a while. I mean you often have tough comps, onetime customer issues, things like that. It's just gone from like 15% of revenues back in the day down to, I think, 5% and continues to face some challenges. Just taking a step back, what are your thoughts on that? I mean is that something you continue to think can be a core part of the business or could there be some strategic solutions there? Patrick Kaltenbach : Well, good question. I mean, look, Food Retail, as you said, is a very lumpy business. We do a lot of key account management there. So a lot of the major customers or retail chains that they're buying from us but they come in project ways. And the decline you see this year is really on back of a very strong year last year. Last year, we had a lot of good projects out there. It's -- overall, it's still about 5% of our total revenues. We don't expect that to significantly increase. It's really a strong technology platform leverage that we have. It's a weighing solution. And with that regard, we think it's still a valid part of our portfolio. We have invested actually a bit in the last couple of years updating the products. We came out with very new really interesting solutions for customers, also using AI-based features to automatically detect what you put on the scale, simplifying the workflow, not only for the customer but also for the checkout service. And that's been received very well. So we see also, again, good number of projects in the pipeline. But strategically, again, we don't think about any immediate change there other than having this part of the platform leverage and technology leveraging of our portfolio.

Shawn Vadala : Thanks, Patrick, and good morning, everyone. Sales in the quarter were $1.045 billion, which represented an increase in local currency and in US dollars of 12%. On Slide number 4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales grew 7% in the Americas, 19% in Europe, and grew 14% in Asia/Rest of World. Local currency sales increased 4% in China in the quarter. Excluding the impact of shipping delays in the fourth quarter of 2023, local currency sales grew 6%, including 3% in the Americas, 8% growth in Europe, and 10% in Asia/ Rest of World, including 2% growth in China. On Slide number 5, we show sales growth by region for the full year 2024. Local currency sales increased 3%, with 3% growth in the Americas, 8% growth in Europe, and a 1% decline in Asia/ Rest of World. Local currency sales decreased 11% in China for the full year. Excluding the impact of shipping delays, local currency sales in 2024 were flat, including 1% growth in the Americas, 2% in Europe, and a 3% decline in Asia/ Rest of World, including a 12% decline in China. On Slide number 6, we summarize local currency sales growth by product area. For the quarter, Laboratory sales increased 18%, and Industrial grew 8%, with core industrial up 5%, and product inspection up 12%. Food Retail declined 14% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the shipping delays, we estimate our Laboratory sales grew 10%, Industrial grew 5%, with core industrial up 1%, and product inspection up 12%, and Food Retail declined 21%. Service sales increased 8% in local currency in the fourth quarter. The next slide shows local currency sales growth by product area for the full year 2024. Laboratory sales increased 6% and Industrial increased 1%, with core industrial down 1% and product inspection up 4%. Food Retail decreased 14%. Excluding the impact of the shipping delays last year, we estimate our Laboratory sales grew 2%. Industrial was flat with core industrial down 3% and product inspection up 4% and Food Retail declined 17%. Service sales increased 7% in local currency for the full year. Let me now move to the rest of the P&L, which is summarized on Slide number 8. Gross margin was 61.2% in the quarter, an increase of 220 basis points due to higher volume, positive price realization, and benefits from our productivity initiatives. R&D amounted to $50.1 million in the quarter, which is a 7% increase in local currency over the prior period. SG&A amounted to $237.3 million, a 6% increase in local currency over the prior year and includes higher variable compensation. Adjusted operating profit amounted to $351.9 million in the quarter, up 25% from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 33.7%, which represents an increase of 360 basis points over the prior year. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $18.2 million in the quarter. Interest expense was $17.9 million and adjusted other income amounted to $1.1 million. Our effective tax rate was 19% in the quarter. This rate is before discrete items and is adjusted for the timing of stock option exercises. Fully diluted shares amounted to 21.1 million, which is approximately a 3% decline from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $12.41, a 32% increase over the prior year. On a reported basis in the quarter, EPS was $11.96, as compared to $8.52 in the prior year. Reported EPS in the quarter included $0.24 of purchased intangible amortization, $0.09 of restructuring and other costs and a $0.12 headwind from the timing of stock option exercises. The next slide illustrates our full year 2024 results. Local currency sales grew 3%. Adjusted operating income increased 4%, or 6% excluding unfavorable foreign currency, and our adjusted operating margin grew 60 basis points. Adjusted EPS grew 8% for the full year and grew 10% excluding unfavorable currency. That covers the P&L, and let me now comment on adjusted free cash flow, which amounted to $900.6 million in 2024, a 2% increase on a per-share basis from 2023 and just over 100% of adjusted net income. DSO was 36 days, while ITO was 4.2 times. Let me now turn to our guidance for the first quarter and for the full year 2025. As you review our guidance, please keep in mind the following factors. First, uncertainty remains across many of our core markets in the global economy. Geopolitical tensions remain elevated and include the potential for new tariffs that we have not factored into our guidance. Secondly, we expect market conditions to gradually improve throughout 2025. We also expect to continue to benefit from customer trends in automation, digitalization and on- and near-shoring. Third, we assume foreign currency at current rates, which is a headwind to sales and adjusted EPS growth of approximately 2% and for the quarter and year. Finally, please keep in mind that our third-party logistics provider delays negatively impacted our Q4 2023 results by approximately $58 million, nearly all of which was recovered in our Q1 2024 results. This will be a headwind to our Q1 2025 sales growth of approximately 6% and will negatively impact our year-over-year operating margin change by approximately 260 basis points and adjusted EPS growth by approximately 18%. For the full year, this will reduce our sales growth by 1.5% and is a headwind to operating margin expansion of approximately 60 basis points and a headwind to adjusted EPS growth of approximately 4%. Now turning to our guidance. For the first quarter of 2025, we expect local currency sales to decline by approximately 3% to 4%, representing growth of 2% to 3% excluding the prior year shipping delays. Operating margin is expected to decline 220 basis points at the midpoint of our range, or growth of 30 basis points excluding the shipping delays. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $7.75 to $7.95, down 11% to 13%, or a growth rate of 7% to 9%, excluding the shipping delays and unfavorable foreign currency. For the full year 2025, our local currency sales growth forecast is unchanged at approximately 3% or up 4.5%, excluding the shipping delays. Operating margin is forecast to be flattish at the midpoint of our range, or up approximately 60 basis points, excluding the shipping delay. We expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $42.35 to $43, up $0.50 from our prior range, which reflects EPS growth of 3% to 5%, or 9% to 10% excluding the shipping delays and unfavorable currency. Lastly, I would like to share a few other details on our 2025 guidance to help you as you update your models. We expect total amortization, including purchased intangible amortization, to be approximately $73 million. Purchased intangible amortization is excluded from adjusted EPS and is estimated at $25 million on a pretax basis or $0.93 per share. Interest expense is forecast at $74 million for the year, down from our prior forecast due to lower interest rates on our revolver and our strong free cash flow in 2024. Other income is estimated at approximately $7 million. We expect our tax rate before discrete items will remain at 19% in 2025. Free cash flow is still expected to be approximately $860 million in 2025 and share repurchases are expected to be approximately $875 million. That's it from my side, and I'll now turn it back to Patrick. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks, Shawn. Let me start with some comments on our operating businesses, which will exclude the impact from last year's shipping delays. I will start with Lab, which had a very strong performance in the quarter. We had excellent growth across most of the portfolio, including very strong growth across process analytics and analytical instruments, especially with pharma and biopharma customers. We continue to receive very positive feedback from the market on our innovative portfolio and on our service solutions, which we believe is contributing to market share gains. Shifting now to our Industrial business. Our underlying sales growth was led by our product inspection business, which has gained momentum as the year unfolded. Our growth initiatives and new products targeting the mid-markets are delivering market share gains, and we have also benefited from growing adoption of X-ray inspection technology as customers look to increase product safety by detecting a wider range of physical contaminants. Our X2 X-ray platform has allowed us to offer differentiated solutions at attractive price points across a wide range of applications. It also provides valuable features that simplify maintenance and cleaning. The strong wins we have had with our X-ray platform are helping mitigate weak underlying demand from the food manufacturing industry which continues to face challenges and longer investment cycles. Switching over to our core Industrial business. Our underlying sales growth this quarter was modest as market headwinds persisted, especially in China. While customer demand in some market segments like pharma and biopharma have improved recently, general industry and chemical sector have remained soft. Lastly, Food Retail declined against very significant project-related growth in the prior year. Now, let me make some additional comments by geography, which will also exclude the impact of last year's shipping delay. Starting in the Americas, our underlying sales growth was led by our process analytics business that continues to benefit from the recovery in bioprocessing, and we also had good growth in other laboratory products and our product inspection business. This growth was offset by a significant decline in Food Retail following very large projects related to growth in the prior year. Now shifting to Europe. We had excellent underlying sales growth this quarter that included very strong growth across both Laboratory and core Industrial. Our pharma and biopharma customers has led our growth over the past year as we have benefited from our innovative portfolio and our unique direct sales and marketing strategies. And finally, our Asia/Rest of the World results were also better than expected with strong results throughout the region outside of China. We have significant growth opportunities across the Asia Pacific region and have accelerated growth plans in various countries such as Japan and India to expand our market share. Our results in China were in line with our expectations with modest underlying growth as improved lab demand was partially offset by weaker industrial sales. Market conditions in China remain subdued and we expect low single-digit growth in 2025. As we have mentioned in the past, trends in China can change quickly, and our team remains focused on taking advantage of growth opportunities. In summary, again, we are very pleased with the successful close to 2024, and we are optimistic that market conditions will gradually improve as we move throughout 2025. The many important growth investments we have made in the recent years have further enhanced our market leadership and will support above-market growth and margin expansion well into the future. As we enter 2025, we will remain focused on implementing our new strategies and techniques with Spinnaker 6, which include an expanded big data and analytics efforts for our lead generation and sales force guidance programs and new digital solutions that enhance our customer experience. We will also make further progress with our Blue Ocean program, which is a critical backbone for many of our corporate programs such as Spinnaker and SternDrive. Blue Ocean is our global process harmonization initiative built on a single instance of SAP, and it provides us valuable real-time business intelligence insights that allow us to react quickly to changes in the business and operating environment. We are also very pleased with the growth in service sales over the past year and our team is focused on continuing to drive strong growth over the coming years. We are making important investments to support our service growth initiatives, which includes additional resources to help us address a larger proportion of our installed base that we do not service today. We also have dedicated initiatives underway to help increase our sales of service contracts at the point of new instrument sales. We will also continue to sustain important investments in innovation over the coming year. Innovation empowers our customers to generate new insights, improve and digitalize their workflows and make their results more precise and reliable. Innovation is also important as it helps stimulate replacement cycles, support our market share gains and enhance our value proposition that reinforces our pricing. Over the past several years, we have launched many important enhancements to our portfolio, and we will have many exciting innovations to be introduced over the coming years as well. Now lastly, in 2025, we will look to capture additional benefits from new tools in our SternDrive program, which aims to drive operational excellence in our manufacturing facilities and our global supply chain. As a reminder, we are on the third wave of SternDrive, which is focused on smart automation and digitalization technologies to drive productivity and capture material cost savings. The Mettler-Toledo franchise is stronger than ever and we remain focused on the things that we can control through the different execution of our initiatives -- sorry, through a diligent execution of our initiatives. We are well positioned and continue to implement strategies with a good balance of initiatives focused on growth, innovation and operational excellence. Now, this concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, I'd now like to open the line to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore. Your line is open. Vijay Kumar : Hi, guys. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Congrats on a nice [print] (ph) here. Patrick, maybe my first one on -- if you look at the Q4 performance here, headline 12%, excluding the shipping comp, the underlying is 6%, Wouldn't that imply like if that's your exit rate, shouldn't your underlying be in the mid-single-digit rate for Q1? Were there any one-offs in Q4 in the sense the customers prebuy ahead of potential tariff and geopolitical risk? Patrick Kaltenbach : Hey, thanks, Vijay, and good morning. That's a very good question. Of course, we are extremely proud of our strong finish to 2024 and the strong Q4. As you said, 6% underlying growth, if you exclude shipping delays, has been a very strong result. It has been especially strong in Lab as we said and in Europe. But also across the entire portfolio, we have been really, really pleased with the results. Now looking at what drives the growth, I think a lot of that is driven by, of course, a lot of innovation that we pushed in the market last year. I mean customers see the strength of our portfolio. We probably have seen a little bit of a budget flush in Europe. It's always hard to quantify that. But if we have indications of what contributed to a higher growth that we potentially would have expected, it was probably a bit of a budget flush in Europe. Regarding your point whether there had been pull-ins because of the tariffs, we have actually no real indications that that triggered this strong result. I think it's more really our really exceptional portfolio that we have out there, our strong go-to-market strategies being close to customers when they have been ready to spend money. As I said, in Europe, specifically, we had, I would say, some releases of budget flush that we have not seen a year before. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. I think too, Vijay, if you kind of look at the sequentials, we feel like it makes sense. If you look at kind of like a longer-term CAGR for Q1, we also think it makes sense. And we still kind of stand by the comments we made last quarter where we do expect the beginning of the year in '25 to start off a little bit slower and then things gradually improve throughout the year. With all the different uncertainties in the world, we wouldn't be surprised if our end-markets start off a little bit more cautiously this year. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And that sort of segues into my follow-up on the macro geopolitical situation. I know the guide isn't contemplating any risk in China for low singles growth. Maybe if you can talk about what is your competitive landscape in China? Do you have local competition? And then how should we think about potential risk related to China? I know one of your peers was put on a list. Is there any risk for that spreading broader to life science companies? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah, Vijay, look, we have been in China for over 30 years, and there always has been local competition, right? And we have a very strong team in China, R&D team, manufacturing team, a very strong sales team. I think we are competing very effectively in China. We also have a very broad portfolio that you couldn't point to one single competitor that we are competing against. It's really a very fragmented space across Lab and Industrial and product inspection. Again, none of the competitors, not one of the competitors would have the same portfolio we have. And again, since we are manufacturing in China and sourcing in Chinese products, and our R&D teams actually are developing also solutions in China for China, I mean I would say that -- I would never say there's no risk, I would say there's probably a more limited risk for a company like ours who has been in China and is serving the local market with local solutions. Shawn Vadala : Yeah, as Patrick says, we clearly benefit from our diversity there as well too. Vijay Kumar : Understood. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Stifel. Your line is open. Dan Arias : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for the questions. Shawn, on the Industrial business there and following up on those comments, is there any change in the way that you're feeling about industrial this year? I mean, to Patrick's point, it does seem like there's some good overall momentum in product inspection. I think you have been picking low singles for both core Industrial and PI, if I remember correctly. So is it fair to assume that that's still the view? Or are you may be tracking a little bit differently at this point? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. I mean we're -- in terms of guidance, we're still a little more cautious on the core Industrial side, if we look at the different businesses, we were very pleased with the quarter overall. But clearly, in terms of core Industrial, there's still some more challenges in that marketplace, especially when you peel it back and look at our Chinese business as an example. But for product inspection, we were extremely pleased with the quarter, certainly better than what we expected with 12% growth in the quarter. And then as we kind of like look towards the full year here, we're still thinking like mid-single-digit, but we -- for product inspection, but we expect to get off to a better start in that business. I think some of the momentum in product inspection will carry forward into the first quarter and we'd expect to be more like high single-digit in that business in Q1. And when you kind of like look at that business, it's kind of interesting because the end-markets are challenged, but we are also competing really well. The new products that we've talked a lot about even in the prepared remarks are being really well received by the marketplace and our teams are executing really well. Dan Arias : Yeah. Okay. And then maybe just sort of a similar idea on Lab. I just want to understand the assumptions on biopharma, which looks like it's gradually recovering here. So, on the low to mid-singles growth that you had penciled in for that business, is the simple way to think about it just that low singles is modest improvement and mid-singles is better improvement? Or was there not a lot that was baked in? I mean, Patrick, last quarter, you had expressed some optimism there. But it was early, so I wasn't sure whether that was translating to the outlook. I'd just love to sort of get your view there at this point as we're a couple of months into the year, at least 1.5 months in the year. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. I mean for Labs -- so for Labs, for the year for '25, I mean, of course, we had a very strong quarter. I can let Patrick comment when I finish. But I mean it was very broad throughout the portfolio. But when you kind of look at certain categories like analytical instruments did exceptionally well, process analytics did extremely well. So, it was just really nice to see some of the trends that we saw in Q3 kind of carrying into Q4 with, I'd say, even somewhat better results. And Patrick kind of talked about it already, like a bit of a budget flush in Europe, which was certainly more than what we were expecting. As we kind of look at the full year for 2025, our guidance is, I think, similar to last time on a reported basis, up low to mid-single-digit for Lab. But for excluding this shipping delay effect, we would be up mid- to high single-digit. But similar to my comment before about the sequencing of the year, we do expect things to start off a little bit more moderate in the first quarter. On a reported basis, we would expect our Lab business to be down low single-digit, but then excluding the shipping delay, we'd expect to be up mid-single-digit. Dan Arias : Okay. And Shawn, just to maybe drive home the point, so there is some level of improvement that you have assumed in the biopharma environment, so to speak, that kind of underpins that growth rate that you're talking about there? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. I mean the guidance hasn't changed, but for biopharma, like particularly bioprocessing, we certainly saw market conditions improving in the fourth quarter. But keep in mind, we -- our guidance for '25 was always that things would gradually improve throughout the year in 2025. But certainly, yeah, we saw some affirmation in the fourth quarter. Maybe the one thing that still hasn't come back yet is maybe the other part of biopharma, which is the biotech side. We're still seeing mixed conditions when it comes to liquid handling pipettes and small biotech. Dan Arias : Okay. Very good. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Your line is open. Jack Meehan : Thank you, and good morning. First question is on the core Industrial piece of the business. We're just curious what your latest take is on some of the macro factors. You saw the PMI go over 50 for the first time in a while on Monday for the US. Was curious if you feel like there's a little bit more wind in the sails entering the year, potential for that business to improve. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah. Good morning, Jack, really good question. Look, with core Industrial, I mean, as we also said in the past, we are not directly linking that to PMIs. I mean a lot of our products go into automation and digitalization efforts across many industries. When you look at our projected growth for industry, and Shawn can give you the breakdown afterwards, I mean a lot of that is depending also on the fact that a big part of the business, and compares also to the growth we have seen in China in the past years, which is now still slow. The investment on the industrial side in China particularly is still subdued. We don't see the momentum that had been -- we had strong growth in, for example, the battery segment before, which is now -- definitely does not -- not the same demand, so these customers will not invest in the same area. So I would say, don't link it directly to the PMIs. Of course, I mean, we are counting on the fact that our customers, and there is strong interest in our digitalization/automation solutions, that will continue, but it's not forecast to grow at the same rate as Lab or product inspection in 2025. Shawn, you want to break it down in terms of the growth rate? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. I mean in terms of how we're thinking for the full year for -- I think we might have mentioned it already, but the core Industrial, we're expecting low single-digit growth for the full year in 2025 on a reported and adjusted basis. As Patrick says, that business, about -- we've kind of estimated and talked in the past, about 60% of that business is a combination of pharma, food and chemical, which for us is largely specialty chem. And then you have like these hooks into automation and digitalization. But certainly, the economy, we're not immune to it and, when it's up, it certainly doesn't hurt. And so -- but at the same time, I think there is an element of how do customers respond to some of the uncertainty in the world right now and that kind of maybe fits into the pacing of the year a little bit. But nonetheless, it was nice to see about 50 PMIs for the first time in a while. Jack Meehan : Yeah, agreed. And then just one housekeeping one. The raise to the 2025 EPS forecast, is that just a function of 4Q coming in a little bit better? Or were there any other changes to the assumptions that drove that? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. So, I mean a lot of it was the beat in Q4, but then we had kind of like two things kind of, not offsetting, but kind of going in opposite directions. On one hand, we had a lot of negative foreign currency since the last time we reported. I think everybody has certainly seen the strengthening of the dollar. But with our exposure, we're also sensitive to the strengthening of the Swiss franc versus the euro. And as a reminder, every 1% change there is like about a $2.5 million hit to -- or increase to operating profit or change in operating profit. And then we have a similar sized exposure with the renminbi -- Chinese renminbi, versus the dollar. So every 1% change there has like about a 2.5% -- $2.5 million or so impact to operating profit. But then kind of going the other way is we had a couple of benefits kind of below operating profit. We had our -- when you kind of have a chance to update your model, you'll see that interest expense came down a little bit, benefiting from a little bit lower interest rates and the strong cash flow we had in the fourth quarter. And then other income benefited a little bit just from updating, like, actuarial assumptions with pensions and things like that. Jack Meehan : Sounds good. Thanks, Shawn. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Sykes of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Matt Sykes : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to go back to the strength that you cited in Europe, particularly in Lab. I know you mentioned there was some element of a budget flush there. But can we extrapolate sort of that improving demand among that customer segment in Europe into other developed market regions like the US? I mean does this encourage kind of your view as to what Lab globally could do, maybe ex China, could do? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah. Look, for me, it's, first and foremost, an encouragement of how well our portfolio is received by the market. And we have spent a lot of focus on driving innovation to the markets. We spent a lot of growth initiative money over the last three years. We launched a lot of new platforms. And those resonate really well. And I think probably in Europe, we have, maybe in some areas, maybe a quarter launch advantage on that. But I'm definitely positive that what we have seen in Europe, people will hopefully also see in US, that strong uptick of the market. And then remember, there's -- a lot of our business is replacement business. And these newly launched products can -- will also help trigger replacement cycles. So yeah, I'm actually positive seeing that we compete so well in a very difficult environment like Europe. This is a -- you know how the economy in Europe is doing at the moment, but our growth rates are really speaking to the strength of both of our platform but also go-to-market strategies. We really go very quickly to the growth initiatives that we're seeing out there. Our sales force guidance works extremely well. And I'm confident that, if the market uncertainty maintains reasonable in the US, then we will also see hopefully better momentum as the year evolves. Shawn Vadala : Yeah too, and when you look at the fourth quarter, I mean Europe did better than the US, but the US still did very well also. Even if you exclude the shipping delay effect, I think we're up high single-digit. And by the way, China did very well in Lab as well too, they were up high teens. And so kind of as expected, Lab was going to have a much better quarter and then Industrial in China. So Lab globally was good, but Europe was clearly the leader. Matt Sykes : Got it. Thank you. And just going back to tariffs for a second, just specifically on Mexico. I know there's been a delay in that, but you do have a manufacturing footprint there. Could you maybe remind us what your exposure is in terms of revenue shipped out of Mexico? And then you've often been very flexible in your manufacturing footprint. If these tariffs were to go through, like what would be the duration? And what would be the decision behind maybe flexing that manufacturing to another region? And what is your capability of doing that? Shawn Vadala : Maybe I'll start, if Patrick wants to comment. So, maybe I'll back up a little bit, Matt, too. So like just to be clear, we've built in the recent tariff on -- the incremental 10% in China into our guidance. We've mentioned in the past in China, we have less than $100 million of imports into the US, or exports to the US. So the new tariff is less than $10 million. And we're confident we'll be able to mitigate that with our various programs. And we built that into the guidance. We've also mentioned in the past that our Mexico exports to the US is less than China. And so we'll kind of see how things play out there, but we also feel like we've looked at different scenarios, we're monitoring closely, and we're prepared to react if we need to. And it will be a combination of maybe there's some supply chain topics, but there's also things we can look at on the pricing side as well. In terms of like a market itself, Mexico is probably about 2% of our sales. And by the way, so is Canada. But we don't export a lot from the US to those markets in terms of like direct product sourcing in the US. So we've looked at that scenario and we also feel like we should be able to manage that if we got into like this retaliatory topic in North America. Matt Sykes : Thank you very much. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Rachel Vatnsdal : Perfect. Hi, good morning. Thank you so much for taking the question. First, just housekeeping, I wanted to ask on the first quarter guide. Can you walk us through what are you assuming by segment for the first quarter including and excluding that shipping comp across segments and then geographies as well? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Sure, Rachel. So, I'm just going to go top to bottom. And I'll cover things even if I already mentioned them just for -- make sure we're complete. So for Lab, for Q1 for '25, our guidance is down low single-digit on a reported basis and up mid-single-digit on an adjusted basis, adjusting for this shipping delay topic from last year in Q1. Total Industrial would be down low single-digit, our guidance is in Q1. And adjusting for the shipping delay, it would be flat. And then within that, you have core Industrial down high single-digits on a reported basis and down mid-single-digit on an adjusted basis. And then you have product inspection up high single-digit on both a reported and adjusted basis. And then in terms of the geographies, the Americas, our guidance for Q1 is to be down low single-digit, and for -- on an adjusted basis for the shipping delay, it would be up low single-digit. Europe would be down high single-digit on a reported basis and it would be up low single-digit on an adjusted basis. And then China would be up low single-digit on a reported basis and adjusted basis. And do you want the full year too? Or do you -- is Q1 good? Rachel Vatnsdal : Sure. Yeah, if anything changed on full year, that would be helpful as well. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Okay. So apologies if this is repeating. So, Lab on a reported up low to mid-single-digit on an adjusted basis, up mid- to high single-digit. Total Industrial up low single-digit on both a reported and adjusted basis. Core Industrial up low single-digit on both a reported and adjusted basis. Product inspection up mid-single-digit on both a reported and adjusted basis. Retail flattish on a reported basis and up low single-digit on an adjusted basis. And then if we look at the regions, Americas up low to mid-single-digit on a reported basis and up mid-single-digit on an adjusted basis. Europe up low single-digit on a reported basis and up mid-single-digit on an adjusted basis. And then China up low single-digit on both a reported and adjusted basis. And that was all for the full year. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. That\u2019s super helpful. If I could just squeeze in my follow-up then, just on -- sticking on that topic of China, you guys pointed towards low single-digit growth for the year, which was also your prior assumption. So, have you seen any impact regarding some of this equipment stimulus to date yet? And is anything embedded for stimulus within that full number? And also just break down for us, obviously, we have some of this equipment specific stimulus that some of your peers have called out. What about the broader economic and monetary policy that we're seeing out of China on a stimulus impact? Should that be more of the driver for you guys and the equipment stuff? Just unpack that for us. Thank you. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Very good. Thanks, Rachel. I'll take that and let Shawn chime in as well. So, we have actually not participated a lot with our product portfolio in the current or last stimulus package. Those were more targeted towards high-end research products. We, of course, had some deals where we bundled instruments together to qualify for the stimulus amount and the thresholds, but it was -- it didn't really move the needle for us in Q4. We also have not included any projection of the stimulus in our 2025 guidance. If there is a broader-based stimulus, that would definitely help us to probably be ahead of what we are forecasting now for 2025 in China. But it remains to be seen. Again, we took a cautious stand here and said we'll go with the current market conditions as they are. If there -- again, if it's a broad market stimulus, it goes across the industries, we will benefit definitely more. If it's another very targeted high-end research instrument, front-end research stimulus, maybe not so much, and it can -- the outlook will remain unchanged. Shawn Vadala : Right. And I think for -- we talked about a little bit in the past, for us, one of the topics is broader stimulus, obviously, is bigger. It's just -- we're implying a broader fiscal stimulus more similar to what they've done in the past where they're really doing stuff to support economic development. But of course, when they do that, it also increases confidence in the country. And I just think like the more that they can send strong signals to increase confidence in the business community so that people will start pulling the trigger on capital expenditures, et cetera, or just spending and investing in general, that's a -- that would be a very positive. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Waldman of Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Josh Waldman : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Patrick, I mean it sounds like the strength in Europe, maybe even the US, was focused within biopharma. I guess, is that right? And I mean, do you -- or did you see an uptick in other markets? And then I guess how do you interpret the strength in the fourth quarter as it relates to confidence of customers to return to normal growth and spending going forward? And curious what you're hearing from customers as it relates to their desire to spend on more replacement-type purchases in '25. Any change there? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah. Thanks, Josh. Look, I'll maybe talk about the growth and what triggered growth in terms of end-market segments, you have pharma, biopharma was a contributor, but so was the food industry, and you have also heard about the numbers that we have, for example, in product inspection. So I would say it was, in Q4 specifically, was across a broader part of the markets, and not just for pharma/biopharma. But we clearly see the strongest demand coming out of pharma/biopharma. And that is also affecting probably more the Lab business and the process analytics business, especially when you think about biopharma process, which is exactly driving the growth that we've seen in process analytics. Now looking forward, is the Q4 for us a good indicator that the market will fully recover to normal levels? We are still cautious there and we are looking at 2025 as also a transitory year still. As we said, we guide first half lower than the second half. I mean the 3% growth and extra shipping delays to 4.5% growth is still not back to what we would consider a normal year, so to speak. But we're hoping that the market growth will continue to pick up. Again, our portfolio competes really well. And in terms of the replacement cycles, yes, the last two years have been probably a bit subdued in terms of product replacement. And once the budgets become available, we have an opportunity to capture also more growth coming from replacements. Josh Waldman : Got it. Okay. And then, Shawn, a question on tariffs, maybe asked another way. I mean it sounds like the updated guide contemplates potential impacts on tariffs. Any way to frame up how you're thinking about offsetting the cost impact? I mean do you think more of the offset will come from price? Or is it more weighted towards supply chain levers? Shawn Vadala : I mean I think it will be similar to the time we dealt with the topic. I mean, clearly, it will be a combination of both. I mean we're clearly looking at the different scenarios. We're clearly looking at pricing opportunities in the portfolio. We do it in a very differentiated way. And so we're -- we've done that analysis. And then we also look at some of the processes within supply chain and whether we can make tweaks here or there. But of course, pricing is a more agile topic than supply chain. Sometimes supply chain can take a little bit more time. Josh Waldman : Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Your line is open. Patrick Donnelly : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Shawn, maybe just to pick up right where you left off there on the margin front. Can you just talk about the margin build this year? It's always helpful to hear about the price contribution, the moving pieces, both 1Q and for the year, would be helpful just to think about the margin side. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. So of course, we were really happy with our margin expansion in the fourth quarter, just really strong. I mean if you put it into perspective, our gross margin expanded 220 basis points. And if you exclude all this noise from the shipping delay, it was still up by 160 basis points. And what we saw in the quarter was getting back to volume growth. Volume growth was clearly -- stood out for us in our numbers, and it was really great to see. Pricing kind of came in as we expected, kind of in this 2% range. And so we're very pleased with the execution, actually had a very strong finish to the year in our global pricing program. And then we continue to benefit from some of the other things we're working on, whether it's like programs within the SternDrive umbrella, about productivity and cost reduction in certain categories. And then we were able to still invest in the business like in our service organization. So really great finish to the quarter on a full year basis. It drove also very good results on a full year basis. And if we kind of then skip to more of your question with the first quarter, the first quarter is -- we're expecting pricing to kind of start out at 2%. We're expecting that also for -- on a full year basis as well too. Hey, I acknowledge there could be some upside to that number depending on how the tariff situation evolves. We'll see how that goes and we'll update accordingly next quarter as we kind of learn more about how the tariffs unfold. But right now, we're assuming 2%. And then I think it will be a similar thing. I think in the first half of the year we'll have less volume than the second half of the year. If we kind of like look at the actual quarters themselves, you'd see that the first quarter would be, from an operating margin perspective, would be down by about 220 bps. And I think in the prepared remarks, I said, excluding the shipping delay, it was up by 30, but it's probably more like up like 40. And then on a full year basis, our operating margin would be flattish, maybe up slightly. But the shipping delay had an impact of about 60 bps on an operating margin. And then if we kind of jump up to the gross margin, on a reported basis, our gross margin would be down probably in the 40 bps kind of a range because of the shipping delay volume topic. But on a reported basis, and that's kind of like apples to -- comparing apples-to-apples. But then on a reported basis, it would be up by about 20 bps. So the shipping delay had the effect of reducing our gross margin by about 60 basis points. And then for the full year, it would be flattish, maybe up slightly, on a reported basis. But again, if you exclude the shipping delay from last year and do apples-to-apples, it would be up probably about 20 bps. Patrick Donnelly : That's really helpful -- helpful details. Thanks, Shawn. And then Patrick, maybe one for you. I think on one of the earlier questions on the exit rates, you kind of said you wouldn't be surprised if end markets started a little more cautious this year. Just listening to the call, I mean it sounds like product inspection momentum is picking up, pharma seems better. Just curious if that was more conservatism or something you're seeing to start the year in specific markets. I mean it sounds like most of these markets are picking up, but I just wanted to clean that up, if you could. Thank you so much. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah, sure. I mean, let me -- when you look at product inspection, for example, of course there\u2019s also, of course, a project business with longer cycle times. And when we look at the sales projection for Q1, these have also -- unlike a lot of our other portfolio where we have very fast turnaround times in terms of inventory, here we have longer cycles and then also have a longer view in terms of the sales volume on the incoming orders. But yeah, pharma/biopharma is having good momentum at the moment. The food industry, as we said, specifically [indiscernible] in the product inspection area, we see that our product portfolio resonates extremely well, that we're getting into new market segments that we didn't serve before in the mid-market. It opens a lot of new doors, a lot of new deals we have are actually with new customers that we didn't serve before. But we remain -- we have a little bit of cautious stand here on the outlook because we also want to see how these uncertainties around tariffs, et cetera, in the different markets really play out. I mean it's still pretty volatile there. For us, it's really important that we follow the leads very quickly, we have a strong lead generation engine, that we turn them around into orders. We have been -- we have demonstrated in the past that we can be very -- that we are very effective on this, and I'm counting on the team on the continued execution excellence to drive every potential order home also in Q1. But there is some uncertainty out there, and we cannot neglect that, still on China, also in some of the mature markets with, again, with these potential tariffs, we need to see how that plays out. So I think it's -- we are well-advised to take a bit of a conservative stand at the moment. Patrick Donnelly : Yeah. Makes a lot of sense. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Catherine Schulte of Baird. Your line is open. Catherine Schulte : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Maybe first on your services business. I think this was the second consecutive quarter of high single-digit growth there. And I believe your guide assumes mid to high single-digits for '25. Do the results this quarter make you confident in hitting the high end of that range? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Actually, it does. And we had in service, we had a very strong 2024 overall with 7% growth. The first half was, I think, about 6%. Q3 was 9%. Q4 was 8%. And we're really looking forward to continued growth in service. We have launched a growth acceleration program also last year for services where we invest more into service capacity. We've also developed a broader set in our service portfolio and making sure that we address a bigger part of the installed base that we had. I found that it currently is not on the service with Mettler-Toledo. So I think we have a good opportunity to reach that growth rate that we projected for service. Catherine Schulte : Great. And maybe just on the new administration. I know you don't have much NIH exposure. But are there any other policies more broadly that you think could either disrupt or benefit you other than the tariff piece that you've already talked about? Patrick Kaltenbach : I don't think so. I mean I think that's the biggest impact probably on the business, there could be tariffs. Again, it creates uncertainty in the market. But in these, I would say, rather turbulent times, we also have demonstrated in the past that Mettler-Toledo is really a company that is very agile and captures opportunity. Of course, uncertainty is never good for the market, but it's also, for companies like Mettler, we have a global footprint who can react quickly in terms of how we can serve our customers. And we have demonstrated also during COVID, it's an opportunity to gain market share. So, I look at it also as an opportunity. It's also the story I tell to my team here, we have to see this as an opportunity to continue to serve our customers in the best possible way. We have tremendous customer trust as a supplier and that should benefit us as well. Catherine Schulte : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of Jefferies. Your line is open. Tycho Peterson : Hey, thanks. You guys noted accelerating growth in India. I mean, it feels like it's been a while since you've called that out. Just curious what secular trends you're seeing there that warrant increased investments? Patrick Kaltenbach : I think we have not really, I think, spoken in detail about accelerated growth in India. We said we have growth acceleration plans in countries also outside of China, and one of the areas -- one of the countries was Japan, the other one was India that we highlighted. But we have also other regions that we -- where we have developed over the last, let's say, two years, dedicated growth acceleration plans. India actually was going well for us throughout 2024. Shawn, do you have the final number? Shawn Vadala : Yeah, I do. I mean, we did have actually a very strong quarter. Now, I don't know how much of it -- the shipping delay topic would have played into it, but it was a very, very strong double-digit number. And for the full year, we were up high single-digits there. So we did well in India. And we see it as a market that should outgrow other markets going forward. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then two quick follow-ups. Shawn, I appreciate your commentary on pricing, 2% for the quarter and first quarter and for the year. How high could you take that if you needed to an inflationary environment? Is there kind of a natural ceiling on where you think you could take it? And then maybe totally separately, you talked about process analytics strength. Is that more greenfield? Or are you taking kind of share there in bioproduction? Thanks. Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Hey. So in terms of pricing, Tycho, it all depends really on the environment, like we kind of saw that when inflation really increased a few years ago, I think we were able to do more -- like that ceiling was higher because inflation was higher, right? And I think that the environment of tariffs could lead to a higher inflationary environment or it could lead to an environment where our market is just going to raise prices higher, but it will very much be dependent on what the tariffs are, what countries are hit or not hit, how broad it is or not. So we'll play it out. I mean, I think for us, we -- I think we are well positioned because we feel like we have invested a lot in our value proposition. We feel like that very much resonates with our customers. I think our sales organization around the world does a really great job of articulating that. And fortunately, because we sell most of the time directly and we're often selling at to the direct end-user, they also appreciate that value proposition. And then as you know, our average price of our products is less than $10,000. So when we start talking about a percent dollar-wise, it's not like a significant dollar increase. So I wouldn't want to put a ceiling on it, but we do feel like we're pretty well positioned going into it. In terms of process analytics, Patrick, did you want to comment on that? Patrick Kaltenbach : Sure, I can. So I think we are well positioned with our portfolio as we also have, there, have launched a lot of new products over the last two years. And that's resonating well with customers both in pharma/biopharma, but also, for example, in the semiconductor industry for ultra-pure water applications where we have a strong portfolio. So we see also in that portfolio, good growth. Do we -- I mean it's always hard to be taking market share. I'm proud of our portfolio. I'm proud of our team of how they execute and on the go-to-market strategy. So yeah, I would say, potentially, yes. But they don't have any absolute numbers. Again, the portfolio is strong. The customers love our portfolio, love our service. And that's where we need to be to also continue that growth. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin of Bank of America. Your line is open. Michael Ryskin : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in guys. I'm sort of scratching the bottom of the barrel for questions, almost everything has been asked by a lot of the other analysts. But maybe just a couple of miscellaneous cleanups. You alluded to this earlier, Shawn, on the EPS bridge for '25, the $0.50 increase. You talked about [Technical Difficulty] and FX in terms of the Swiss franc have an impact. Any chance you could just give us the numbers. I'm sure we could do the math, but in terms of being more precise in terms of how much each contributed? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. Hey, Mike, I mean, I think the math is probably pretty clear. I mean, I think you can see the beat, and then we updated the interest in the other numbers. And then the FX and the other probably squeezes out together in the high 50s or something. Michael Ryskin : Okay. All right. Fair enough. And then just on the margins, to an earlier question, you talked through the margin -- gross margin versus op margins for the year. But in my notes, I had you guys having gross margin up a little bit previously. I think you said you expect gross margins up 30 to 40 bps. Now it seems like it's a little bit less than that. Is that FX having an issue? Or is there anything else in terms of moving pieces there? Shawn Vadala : Yeah. No, I think -- I mean, I think we ended a little bit -- I think the absolute number that we ended this year is going to be -- like I think the number that we have for next year is the same. It's just that we've landed a lot higher than what we expected this year. So yeah. So I think it's up slightly on a reported basis. And then if you exclude the shipping delay topic, it's probably up, probably, what did I say, 30 basis points? Michael Ryskin : Got it. Okay. That works. All right, thanks so much. Shawn Vadala : Yeah, thanks. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thank you. Operator : That concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Adam for closing remarks. Adam Uhlman : Okay. Great. Hey, thanks, everybody, for joining us on the call this morning. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to me. I hope you all have a great weekend, and we'll talk to you soon. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
