Patti Waldmeir - The Financial Times Ltd. Jon Ostrower - CNN Gillian Rich - Investor's Business Daily Operator : Good day everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analyst and media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcast live over the internet. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Troy Lahr, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing company. Mr. Lahr, please go ahead. Troy Jeffrey Lahr - The Boeing Co.: Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's first quarter 2017 earnings call. I'm Troy Lahr, and with me today is Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer. After management comments, we'll take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. We have provided detailed financial information in today's press release and you can follow the broadcast and presentation through our website at boeing.com. Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals in our discussion today are likely to involve risk, which is detailed in our news release, various SEC filings and the forward-looking statement disclaimer in the presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook. Now I'll turn the call over to Dennis Muilenburg. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Thank you, Troy, and good morning. My comments today will focus on our first quarter results, the ongoing health of our business environment and our growth plans going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook. Now let's move to slide 2. Boeing delivered first quarter 2017 financial results that included higher core earnings per share and strong operating cash flow. We also continued to execute a balanced cash deployment strategy of investing in innovation, growth and our people and returning cash to our shareholders. In the first quarter, we generated $2.1 billion of operating cash, repurchased $2.5 billion of Boeing stock, and increased our dividend per share 30% for a payout of $868 million. Revenue in the first quarter was $21 billion on timing of commercial and defense deliveries and services. Core earnings per share of $2.01 were driven by a continued strong operating performance on production programs and services and a lower than expected tax rate. Now let's look at the first quarter operating performance for both of our businesses. At Boeing Commercial Airplanes, we delivered 169 new jet liners and added 198 net new orders worth $15 billion. BCA generated solid results in the first quarter with revenue of $14.3 billion and operating margins of 8.5%. Key milestones in the quarter included the FAA certifying the 737 MAX 8 for commercial service and achieving first flight on the 787-10 one month earlier than the development schedule we established three years ago. And furthermore in April, we also achieved first flight on the 737 MAX 9. Boeing Defense, Space & Security reported first quarter revenue of $6.5 billion. Operating margins were a healthy 11.3%, reflecting continued strong operating performance. Our defense and space business booked orders totaling $12 billion including a $3.4 billion contract from the U.S. Army for 268 AH-64 Apache helicopters. Also during the quarter, we booked a $2.2 billion contract for 17 P-8 Poseidon aircraft, and a $2.1 billion order for 15 additional KC-46 Tanker aircraft from the U.S. Air Force. With approximately 1,600 flight hours completed, we continue to make steady progress towards completing Tanker development. The program did see additional cost growth to incorporate changes into the initial production aircraft and solidify production configuration stability. That said, we continue to close out technical risks and progress towards final certification as we remain focused on delivering the first 18 Tankers to the U.S. Air Force by early 2018. In summary, thanks to a concerted team effort throughout the company, we delivered another quarter of solid operating performance, captured noteworthy additions to our large and diverse backlog, and returned significant cash to our shareholders. With that, let's turn to the business environment on slide 3. Global demand for our market-leading products and services remains generally healthy across our key business segments. Specifically for the commercial airplane market, we still see solid airline profitability and strong passenger traffic that continues to outpace global GDP. According to the International Air Transport Association, the 8.8% year to date passenger traffic growth adjusted for the leap year is well above the long-term average of 5.5%. And with the recovery in global trade, we are now seeing modest improvements in cargo traffic. These favorable industry trends, combined with our robust backlog of more than 5,700 aircraft, underpin our planned production rate increases over the remainder of this decade. In the narrowbody market, we are seeing strong demand as illustrated by the 167 net orders we captured in the first quarter. Our high confidence in increasing 737 production to 57 per month by 2019 is based on our existing backlog of more than 4,500 aircraft and a production skyline that is oversold through the end of the decade. Furthermore, the strength of this market segment has given us increased assurance for sustaining that production rate with market pressure to go even higher than 57 per month. It is also important to note that within our top 20 narrowbody customers, we continued to see a large capacity for additional orders when we compare existing order totals to their overall fleet size In the widebody market, as we've noted before, we're seeing varying levels of near-term demand across aircraft models. However, over the next 20 years, we forecast the need for more than 9,000 widebody aircraft, underpinned by a meaningful upturn in replacement demand early in the next decade. Indicative of this overall long-term demand is the first quarter's announcement that Singapore Airlines intends to purchase 20 777-9s and an additional 19 787-10s. 777 production for 2017 is now sold out and for the current generation 777, our backlog at quarter end was 124 airplanes. Production continues at the seven per month rate before we lower it to the production rate in August to five per month as previously announced. That will result in 777 deliveries of approximately 3.5 per month in 2018 and 2019, as we transition production to the 777X. At that rate, we are about 90% sold out for both years including airplanes covered in the agreement with Iran Air, and we continue to have numerous campaigns underway. While we clearly have more work to do to fill the remaining 777 production slots, based on the current sales environment, we believe the rate plan we've put in place establishes a production floor for the program. And we have a strong foundation of 340 777X orders and commitments that support our plan for ramping up production and delivery of the new 777X. Our 787 Dreamliner program also stands on a strong foundation for long-term production with approximately 700 firm orders and commitments in our backlog. As you know, we have a concerted effort in place to secure additional 787 orders to support the 14 per month production rate plan for the end of the decade. We will remain disciplined, as our team is, in the process of assessing our 787 production rate options and timing with a focus, as always, on ensuring supply and demand are kept in balance as we continue to grow profitability of the program. Importantly, our 2017 financial guidance bounds the range of outcomes from these scenarios, and we continue to see cash flows growing annually over the remainder of the decade, largely driven by higher 737 deliveries and improving 787 profitability. Now turning to Defense, Space & Security, we continued to see solid demand for our major platforms and programs. The President's FY 2018 defense budget request calls for healthy growth in military spending. Additionally, we are seeing the potential for FY 2017 funding increases on numerous Boeing programs, including the Apache, the F-18 Super Hornet, P-8 Poseidon and the V-22 Osprey. International demand for our offerings remains high as well, in particular for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters, satellites, and services. We have now cleared congressional notification regarding the foreign military sales of 48 Chinooks to Saudi Arabia, 37 Apaches to the UAE, and the government of Norway recently signed a foreign military sale agreement with the U.S. government for five P-8 Poseidon aircraft. International interest in our fighters also continues to be strong, with the Government of Canada releasing a letter of request for the sale of 18 F-18 Super Hornets. In addition, Kuwait and Qatar fighter sales are progressing. We continue to invest in areas that are priorities for our customers, such as commercial derivatives, rotorcrafts, satellites, services, human space exploration, and autonomous systems. Much of that investment supports the priority we have placed on capturing future franchise programs, where we are leveraging capabilities and technologies across the enterprise for JSTARS recapitalization, Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, advanced weapons programs and other important opportunities, like the unmanned carrier-based MQ-25A and the T-X trainer. Moving to services, we remain on track to begin operating our fully integrated Boeing Global Services business in the third quarter. We believe the 10 year $2.5 trillion services market is a major growth opportunity for us, and standing up Boeing Global Services will sharpen our focus on it and accelerate our capabilities expansion across all services and support areas, from our traditional parts, modification, and upgrade businesses to bolstering our suite of data analytics and information-based services. Digital aviation services are a compelling and growing segment of offerings for us. For example, during the first quarter, we signed a contract with Etihad Airways for our Wind Update solution, which will increase airplane efficiencies and reduce fuel consumption. We now have 13 commercial customers subscribing to this service, covering a fleet of more than 1,000 airplanes. On the defense services side, we were awarded a 10-year engineering services contract by the U.S. Air Force Materiel Command, and we captured a five-year F-15 performance-based logistics services contract with the Republic of Korea. In summary, we continue to execute on our efforts to meet or exceed our commitments to our stakeholders while accelerating productivity improvements and making investments in innovation. With that, I'll now turn it over to Greg for our financial results. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Thanks, Dennis. Good morning everybody. Let's turn to slide 4, and we'll discuss our first quarter results. As expected, first quarter revenue decreased to $21 billion, reflecting the timing of deliveries, while core earnings per share increased 16% to $2.01, driven by solid operating performance and lower than expected tax rate, which more than offset the impact of lower volume and cost growth on our Tanker program. Let's move to slide 5 and we'll discuss Commercial Airplanes. For the first quarter, our Commercial Airplane business reported revenue of $14.3 billion, reflecting timing of deliveries and 737 MAX production, where entry into service is expected to begin in May. Operating margins in the quarter were 8.5% due to improved performance on production programs, offset by the impact of lower volume, delivery mix, and again, additional Tanker program costs. As Dennis indicated earlier, BCA captured $15 billion in net orders during the first quarter and backlog remained very strong, $417 billion, more than 5,700 aircraft, again equating to more than seven years of production. On the 787 program, the deferred production balance continues its downward trend, with a decrease of $316 million in the quarter. And again, over the long term, we continue to focus on improving 787 cash generation, driven by favorable delivery mix, internal productivity improvements, and additional supplier step-down pricing. Let's now move to Defense, Space & Security results on slide 6. First quarter revenue at our Defense business was $6.5 billion and operating margins were a solid 11.3%, largely driven by strong performance at Boeing Military Aircraft and Global Services & Support business. Boeing Military Aircraft first quarter revenue declined to $2.6 billion, reflecting a planned wind-down of the C-17 program and timing and mix on in-production aircraft deliveries. Operating margins of 12.2% reflect solid overall performance. Network & Space Systems reported revenue of $1.6 billion. Operating margins were 6.3%, driven by lower satellite service volume and investments in development efforts. Global Service & Support revenue was $2.3 billion, reflecting timing on contracts. And operating margins of 13.6% reflects solid execution across the portfolio. Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog of $63 billion, with 34% of that business from customers outside the United States. Let's turn now to cash flow on slide 7. Operating cash flow of $2.1 billion for the first quarter was driven by solid operating performance and favorable timing of receipts and expenditures. With regards to capital deployment, as Dennis mentioned, we paid $868 million in dividends and repurchased 14.9 million shares for $2.5 billion in the first quarter. Our continued cash deployment efforts reflect our ongoing confidence in the long-term outlook for our business. We continue to anticipate completing the remaining $11.5 billion repurchase authorization over approximately the next two years. And since 2012, we've increased our dividend per share by 190% and have repurchased 189 million shares. Again, returning cash to shareholders along with continued investment to support future growth, remains top priority for us. Let's move now to cash and debt balances on slide 8. We ended the quarter with $9.2 billion of cash and marketable securities. This cash position continues to provide us flexibility to invest in our growth efforts and our people, while also returning cash to our shareholders. Let's turn now to slide 9, and we'll discuss our outlook for 2017. We're increasing our 2017 core earnings per share guidance by $0.10 to now be between $9.20 and $9.40 per share, driven by lower than expected tax rate, partially offset by higher deferred compensation expense on the higher stock price. We are reaffirming our 2017 guidance for revenue, segment margins, deliveries, and cash flow. And again, the core operating engine continues to deliver strong operating results, and we remain focused on increasing production, driving productivity improvements, maximizing cash generation, and continued efficient deployment. With that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: All right. Thanks, Greg. With a strong first quarter on which to build continued momentum for the year, our team remains focused on further driving both growth and productivity. Our priorities going forward are to leverage our unique One Boeing advantages, continue building strength on strength to deliver and improve on our commitments, and to stretch beyond those plans and sharpen, accelerate our pace of progress on key enterprise growth and productivity efforts. Achieving these objectives will require a continuing clear and consistent focus on the profitable ramp-up in commercial airplane production, continuing to strengthen our defense and space business, delivering on our development programs, launching our integrated services business, driving world-class levels of productivity and performance throughout the enterprise to fund our investments in innovation and growth, and to develop and maintain the best team and talent in the industry, all of which position Boeing for continued market leadership, sustained top and bottom line growth, and to create increasing value for our customers, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. Now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator : Our first question is from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Good morning. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Hey, Myles. Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I was wondering if we could start on cash flow. Obviously a pretty strong cash flow, certainly relative to your breakeven expectations. And I know, Greg, you alluded to the timing of receipts, but if you could delve a little bit more. And it does look like you were both over-performing on operating cash flow and then also under-running on CapEx. And it looks like on the operating line it maybe was advances. So if you could just dig a little bit deeper on those points, that would be terrific. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Yes, I would certainly point to execution, Myles, and just core performance as being the primary driver. We certainly had some timing in there. But I think a lot of the productivity improvements we've talked about and the initiatives, starting to see that hit some of the cash flow, as well as the disciplined efforts around working capital. And then of course, within that 787 improvements which you saw in the deferred, but even as you look at 787 cash flow as an individual item, it's positive and becoming more positive as we would expect with the improvements again in the step-down as well as the productivity in the factory and then the mix. And playing into that mix is the early introduction of the Dash 10, which as you have seen, and that is going into the production system as planned and frankly on some cases a little bit better on the unit cost. So all of that really kind of playing in. But again, a little bit of timing. I'd certainly equate it to look, it's early, but there's certainly, we're off to a good start and we're seeing positive momentum, and we got some things to work through obviously through the balance of the year, but there's definitely some upward bias as we see it today. But again, we'll keep you posted and work through the elements. We got to balance through each of the quarters here around finishing up on Tanker, getting MAX deliveries ramped up, and of course, selling some of the 47 white tails. Be we know what we need to focus on in order to do that, but we're off to a good start. Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And the CapEx. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah Miles, just building on Greg's comments there, what you see here is a, as he said, a good start to the year and I think consistent with our longer-term expectation for year over year cash growth. All of the elements that Greg talked about are foundational things that will drive year over year cash growth through the end of the decade, and we continue to see that as a strong focus, and the performance is bearing out. Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: All right. Thanks, guys. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Okay. Operator : Our next question is from Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead. Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah, good morning everyone. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Good morning, Jason. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Good morning, Jason. Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Dennis, this one is for you. Good morning. I was wondering if you could spend a few minutes talking about the business cases that you're building around the 737-10 and the middle of the market aircraft. Perhaps just update us on customer feedback you're getting thus far and whether you're willing to go out on a limb there and maybe tell us which way you're leaning at this point on either one of those. Thanks. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yes, Jason, let me just give you a quick update on that. We're continuing to have very productive conversations with our customers. Of course, the most near-term thing we're looking at is a extended version or a stretch version of the 737 MAX 9 which we're referring to as the MAX 10. We continue to work on closing that business case and working diligently with our customers. We see encouraging momentum there, but we still have work to do to finish up on the business case. And we have time to complete that work and then make the right decision. So we're not yet to the decision point, but we are making progress and I'd say seeing encouraging feedback from our customer base. All of this, we're very confident, can be completed within the R&D profile that we've talked to you about before, so we don't see this as a big needle mover to our R&D profile over the rest of the decade. And we do see the MAX 10 as an airplane that we could have into the market in that 2020 timeframe. Longer-term, the middle of the market airplane, we continue to have discussions with our customers on opportunities in that space as well, working on the business case and technology solutions. And again, we haven't arrived at a decision point yet. If we decide to move down that path, that's an airplane that would be entering into service in the 2024, 2025 timeframe. Again, we don't see that as a big needle mover on our R&D profile for the rest of this decade, and we have the time in place to again make the right deliberate decision on that. All of these potential next products feather in very nicely on our overall development plan cycle on the backside of 777X, and we have the capacity and strength to do one or the other or both of these if we so choose. Operator : Our next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes. Good morning. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Good morning. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Hi, Doug. Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I'd like to understand two things related to the top line, and they're two things that seem to be kind of a flat outlook. One is the 787, and the other is defense. And on the 787, there's the things you said earlier made it sound as though when you look out further, you see more of a chance you would go up to 14 a month than any risk of falling from 12 a month. And I'd like to understand what could take you to 14 a month. And then on defense, you've also said in the past that you're looking at a pretty flat outlook over the next years, maybe low single digit growth. But you've had a lot of orders here recently. Has your view changed at all on that? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yes, Doug, let me take a cut at both of those. And then, Greg, feel free to add in. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Sure. Yes. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: First of all, if you look at 787, Doug, as you've alluded to, our plan is still to go to 14 a month by the end of the decade, and we're actively working a number of campaigns to fill out that skyline. Most of the skyline work we're doing is out in the 2020 kind of timeframe. So just in our current backlog, as you know, we have nearly 700 aircraft, 787, in our firm backlog. At 12 per month rate we are in very, very solid position. So what we're really looking at is the step up to 14 a month, the timing associated with that, and then selling into that skyline. We're looking at a range of scenarios between the current 12 a month and 14 a month and the specific timing around that. Our guidance for the year balance all of the possible scenarios we see. But to your underlying point there, we're not looking at scenarios that would drop us down from 12 a month. We're very strong at that foundational level, and this is all about the timing and sequencing of stepping up to 14 a month and selling into that skyline. And we're going to continue to work that hard regardless. We see 787 as a strong cash growth part of our portfolio, just the fundamental productivity work at the current 12 a month rate is a significant source of cash generation over the next couple of years. So that's how we see the 787 portfolio. On the defense side, you're right, we're seeing some progress. We're seeing some, I'll say, re-energization around the defense budget. We're encouraged by some of the signs on building the defense portfolio and strengthening the defense budget in the U.S. for the future. We've seen heightened interest in a number of our product lines spanning rotorcraft, fighters, our services product lines, satellites, and that spans over into the international arena as well. And so while we haven't modified our forecast or our guidance going forward in terms of growth rate, we still see defense as a low to moderate top line growth opportunity. I would say generally there's an upward bias on how we see the strength of the defense business going forward. And that's backed up by what we see in a strengthening U.S. defense budget. Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Next we'll go to Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Good morning, Sam. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Hey, Sam. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I was wondering if you could address the BCA margin a little bit more. Just looking at the 8.5% margin in the first quarter, it looks like it's going to be relatively steep to move up to the 9.5% to 10% for the rest of the year. And one of the things you called out was some Tanker pressure. And it's still early in the process in terms of building Tanker, so I'm wondering is that going to continue without a further charge? Just address the Tanker specifically but then BCA margin in total. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Yes. No, within the quarter at BCA, it was roughly about $120 million of pressure, and I think Dennis described kind of what we're working through on the Tanker which is really those in-production airplanes and getting those to the point of final certification and then getting ready for delivery. That's where we had the additional cost pressure within the quarter. And then we had about $20 million on the BDS side. But that's the real, I'll say, unusual item in the quarter for BCA. So if you strip that out, I think you'll see through the balance of the year continued improvement on the program margin side and then obviously we've got some work to do, which we know again what we need to do around the period expense and elements within whether it's fleet support or R&D through the balance of the year. So lots of moving pieces, but that's really the standout for the quarter. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Right. But do you think of that as specific one-time item, or does that continue as you build more Tankers? Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: No, that is readjusting the cost to complete the Tankers within the contract. That's our estimate to complete that, and that was impacted in the quarter. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: You're welcome. Operator : Our next question is from Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please go ahead. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Good morning. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Hey, Carter. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Greg, just to keep on that topic, I wondered if you could tell us if there were any program margin revisions of significance. I think you said improved performance on production programs, so I wondered if you'd just clarify that. And with respect to the guidance for the BCA margin, given that $120 million, and you've called out the 787 block extension should that slip, does that present a risk to the low end of that guidance? Thanks. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: No. No. It's bounded in the guidance as Dennis described. So as we're running through those scenarios, we've taken that into consideration. So to your point, we've absorbed the Tanker, additional Tanker costs in the full year and on the low end provision for whatever, if we make a different decision than what we're working towards right now. On the overall program margins for the quarter, we had slight improvement across the board, and on 737 had one block extension in there. So again, I think very good performance across all the production programs. And then again, I think raising, not only raising the bar as Dennis has talked about on our standards of performance, comparing ourselves externally in this whole global industrial champion. Again, we've got targets functionally by program, by element of cost and we're challenging ourselves on all aspects of that and certainly not all that is going to come home near term. But an added kind of element to that is changing the compensation, and you probably saw that in the proxy where we're trying to provide even more clarity right down to all levels of management and all employees who are 50% of our comp now will be free cash, 25% on core EPS, 25% on revenue, and then of course the long-term reflecting the same plus the TSR element. And I would kind of put that all under the umbrella of this kind of standard of performance, clarity and understanding of what we need to do as a team year in and year out to drive value for our shareholders and at the same time reinvest back in the business. And so that's just another added element we brought in this year. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's great. So just to clarify, you had a positive revision across each of the single production programs in the quarter? Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Yes. Yes. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: You're welcome. Operator : Next we'll go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah, hey. Good morning, guys. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Hey, Ron. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Morning, Ron. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, I was wondering if you could talk to us a little bit more about the aftermarket strategy. You know, the long-term goal that you guys put out there was $50 billion. It's a big number, right, to get there from here. How do you think about getting there? Is it purely organic? Is there an inorganic piece to it? If you could just shed more light on that. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: You bet. Hey, Ron. First of all, I think it's important to look at the fundamental marketplace that we're pursuing. We see the services market as a $2.5 trillion marketplace over the next 10 years. So there's plenty of market growth space for us today. Depending on sector, we have a roughly a 7% to 9% market share of that growing expanding market. So we have plenty of market headroom to play into and leverage our OEM depth and knowledge. And while $50 billion is a high-bar target, it is an aspirational target we set for our team but one that we're serious about pursuing. We see that as primarily an organic growth strategy, but it will be complemented with inorganic growth consistent with our broader strategy and approach. We still see organic investment as our number one growth engine. Going forward, that includes additional work on our proprietary parts business and selectively rebuilding some vertical capabilities. As you've noted, we've selectively brought in some capability, things like building the all-composite wing for the 777X, the propulsion center that we stood up in Charleston where we're building new cells, the actuation capability that we have in both Portland and with the new stand-up in Sheffield, as examples of building targeted verticals that will further enhance our parts lifecycle business. We also see opportunities to grow modifications and upgrades. Again, leveraging our OEM depth of knowledge and doing that across Boeing. We see that combined integrated services business as one way for us to leverage infrastructure, talent and people so that we can compete in that marketplace. And then thirdly, I see significant organic growth opportunity in the digital aviation services arena, information-based services, performance-based logistics. In my opening comments, I gave you an example on our wind solutions profile that now has more than a dozen commercial customers covering more than 1,000 aircraft on that subscription service. We have other services that we're offering, things like our Advanced Health Management service which now covers more than 2,200 aircraft across some 90 customers. Gold Care maintenance and engineering services as another example. We see tremendous and compelling growth opportunities for us in that digital arena. And that is significant organic investment that we're making that's building on what is already a market-leading competitive position. Now all of that will be augmented with inorganic growth and selective acquisitions in those same spaces. And we've been deliberate about that, and we'll continue to selectively make acquisitions that complement our core organic strategy. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: That's a big focus for us, and one of the reasons we stood up the new services business, Ron, and we go fully operational with that here in the third quarter, and we will have a team, under Stan Deal's leadership, that is focused exclusively on growing the services business and supporting our customers. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got you. And on a potential middle of the market airplane, right, if something like that were to happen, is it reasonable to expect that you'd probably be more vertically integrated on that around some of the important subsystems, to get that aftermarket then on previous models of airplanes? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Ron, certainly the lifecycle value stream of that airplane, if we choose to launch it, will be an important parameter of the overall business case. So we're thinking hard about that. And again, you see that strategy already reflected in our next generation products. The 777X, for example, is more vertically integrated than its predecessors and that's a deliberate strategy going forward that allows us to provide more value to our customers and capture more of the lifecycle value. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That's great. Thanks a lot, Dennis. Operator : Our next question is from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for the time. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Good morning. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Hi, Rajeev. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Dennis, you had a great quarter in terms of book-to-bill, even before considering seasonality, at nearly 1.2 times or so. Do you think we're starting to see a turn here, or is it just timing? And then, what would a hypothetical MAX 10 do to that book-to-bill if it came out his year? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: I think what you see here, Rajeev, is it's still fundamentally a very strong market, and especially when you take a look at the narrowbody marketplace. As I mentioned earlier, we are more than sold out against our production ramp-up to 57 a month through the end of the decade. And on top of that, we continue to see healthy order demand, 198 net orders in the first quarter, and a little more than 160 of those were in the narrowbody arena. So we see heavy demand. We think the MAX is well placed. And if we choose to proceed with the MAX 10, I think it only adds to the strength of our portfolio in the narrowbody marketplace. The widebody marketplace, as you know, remains a bit more mixed, but still some fundamental strength there. Our focus there is on filling out the 777 bridge over the next couple of years, and as we talked earlier, filling out the skyline to 14 a month for the 787, and thinking through the timing of that. We still see the widebody market as fundamentally strong as well, and a big replacement cycle coming at the start of the next decade. And with the 787 and 777 families in particular, we are well positioned for that next wave of orders in widebodies. And don't forget, over the next 20 years, we still see a total need for more than 39,000 new airplanes around the globe. And we're continuing to see strong passenger traffic growth in particular. It's only one quarter, but 8.8% passenger growth in the first quarter this year, again just speaks to the fundamental strength of the marketplace. And we're going to be very mindful about our rate ramp-up. We're going to do it profitably. We're going to keep supply and demand in balance. But with 5,700 aircraft in backlog, we have the opportunity to continue to grow cash delivery and earnings delivery over the long term. We're going to do that year over year while we continue to invest in the future and play this as a long term, sustained growth business, not a cyclical business. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you, sir. Operator : Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Yes. Thank you very much. So in the first quarter, the 787 deferred amortization increased by about $100 million sequentially. And I believe at one point you'd said on the fourth quarter that you expected it to be relatively flat in the first part of the year. And it did it on really a weaker mix, I guess, with the Dash 10 being introduced in the mix. Maybe give us some color on what should happen to the trend in that deferred if you do not increase the block size. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Yes. I mean, Cai, we're expecting it to continue to improve. And again, it's really around those three fundamentals, and certainly productivity but mix. And bringing the Dash 10 in smoothly, as we have talked a lot about bringing the Dash 9 and how important that was, Dash 10 is very similar. And, just as an early indicator, we're on Unit 3 in the factory, or at least the data I have off Unit 3, and that's unit cost is in line with the Dash 9 already. So I mean that kind of level of performance, and really going back into the overall strategy on commonality in that design and really leveraging that technology on derivative platforms is really, we're seeing that hitting the factory floor. So those are good early indicators of, again, a smooth transition which will ultimately help with the flow and the unit cost. So obviously, that's a key element, getting the mix improved. And then of course the supplier step-down. So as we move into these next blocks, we've got supplier step-down, as well as that favorable mix and then the productivity. So all of that as we move through these blocks will continue to improve. So therefore, you'll see that in the overall deferred. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thank you. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: You're welcome. Operator : And we'll go to Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC : Thank you very much. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Hi, Howard. Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC : Dennis, your risk tolerance and mine are sometimes different. And as I look at sort of the variability we've seen in Tanker and at Network & Space Systems, I'd like for you for a moment to talk about how you're managing that risk. And there's two contexts. One is that if we back out the R&D and the cost related to the Tanker, and we look at Commercial margins, they're flattish or down a little bit. And yet you've got a lot of productivity in the factory, so where's that going? And then second, as you think about these, as you think about ongoing and new programs, T-X as one case and new opportunities in Space, how are you going to take some of the bumps out of the road? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yes. Hey, Howard. First of all, on Tanker, while we did see cost growth in the quarter, as we noted, that cost growth is well bounded and it's clearly in the initial production aircraft as we get to product configuration stability. And while we're doing everything we can to drive that to closure, just getting to concurrent designs and consistency in the configuration across all the airplanes has taken us a little more time than we expected. I will say, it's very clear to us that the flight testing, with more than 1,600 hours, is going very well. The airplane is performing as expected. We have not discovered any new technical issues, and are clearly converging on technical risk closure and getting to the finish line. And so while none of us are happy with the cost growth, we're clearly converging on the program and expect to deliver those first 18 Tankers. We're also making the investments for the future with the expectation that that will be a long-term profitable line for us. We know how to build that airplane. And the investments we're making now to get configuration stability in the production line will produce profitability for the long run. So I remain very confident in the Tanker program in terms of its long-term value. We still see a marketplace there that's 400 plus aircraft, and we have the right airplane for the customers. Now, more broadly, we've taken some of those lessons from our Tanker program and other development programs and have rolled those into our development program excellence initiative that we've deployed on subsequent programs. And we are seeing good signs of progress there. I think you see it in the MAX program, for example, as that airplane is delivering a little ahead of schedule and a little under budget on a good, steady development program. We're seeing similar great results coming out of the 787-10 and that airplane getting to flight test a month ahead of schedule. We're seeing similar progress on 777X and we're applying those same best practices to future programs like T-X as you mentioned and using some of our advanced prototyping to leverage that. So we're deploying those lessons learned, and we are committed to being able to deliver development programs consistently on schedule and on cost. It's one of my key focus areas at the corporate level. Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse : Good morning. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Good morning, Rob. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Hey, Rob. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse : Guys, I wanted to go back to this really the tail end to Ron's question about the supply chain and the lifecycle opportunity. And given your margin push to the mid teens and competitive aircraft pricing market and recent in-sourcing of certain components like wings at the composite wing center, which I guess is enabled by important increases in automation capability. I wanted to ask about the long-term prognosis for the Tier 1 suppliers. And maybe I'd ask it this way, if you look at your overall business, both commercial and defense combined, what's your current make versus buy ratio and how would we think about a target for that 10 years from now? Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Well, roughly at the total level, it's about 60% to 70% outsourced to inside. Maybe I'll give you my perspective, and then certainly Dennis will have one. But I mean, as far as the Tier 1s go, I think it just goes back to the market. As we look at the 39,000 airplanes that are out there and if we can continue to compete to win as a team, then I think everybody benefits as a result of that. So I think there's plenty of work out there, but we just got to stay focused on improving the overall performance and cost elements across the board and put ourselves in a position to win every time. And if we win every time, then Tier 1, 2, 3, everybody wins as a result of that. But just staying aligned and understanding where we have inefficiencies and how do we work as a team to really overcome those is going to be the continued focus. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse : Greg. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: And, Rob, those are the fundamentals behind our Partnering for Success program and how we're working with the supply chain more broadly. So we are thinking through future supply chain architecture. We're engaging at the Boeing enterprise level, not at the single program level. I think that makes us more efficient as a company, better for our supply chain as well. And that's going to allow us to drive productivity and cost effectiveness both inside our four walls as well as inside our supply chain. Where we need to, we will build selective vertical capability so that we can further drive cost down and value up for our customers. And in some cases, we may decide to create additional new sources of competition if we need to. So we are very focused about winning in the marketplace, and we'd like to do that in partnership with our supply chain and that's the whole design behind our Partnering for Success initiative. As Greg said, there is plenty of market growth opportunity for us to all be successful and as long as we stay aligned on objective we can do that. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse : So, Dennis, understanding that, it's clear that not everybody on the supply side buys into or is able to agree to a Partnering for Success construct. So is it still fair to say that over time the make percentage will rise even though the overall \u2013 I understand Greg's point. The pie is going to get bigger so everybody can benefit, but it sounds like the portion that Boeing will do in-house will rise. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: That will be determined over the longer run, Rob. We certainly have the capacity to do that and we'll make selective decisions around that equation. Our decision on the 777X to build the wing in-house is a focused strategic decision. I announced earlier some of the other vertical capabilities that we're investing in. We think those are places where we can add new value. So there will be some places where that work will shift to an internal make. There may be some other places where we might decide to go outside and buy. So there will be puts and takes all aligned with the strategy of being a global industrial champion and having a supply chain for the future. So that outcome is not predetermined, but it is an outcome that's based on partnership with our supply chain and both Boeing and our supply chain making the right investments for the future and committing to being cost competitive for the future. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse : Okay. Thank you, both. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: You're welcome. Operator : And our next question is from George Shapiro with Shapiro research. Please go ahead. George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : Yes. A couple of questions. Greg, how did period expenses and fleet support costs in the quarter compare to last year? And also could you explain why the unit profit was so much lower than the program this quarter despite having a $300 million benefit to deferred? Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Yes, yes. No problem, George. Yes, the difference there, and we delivered two of the early builds on the 87, and so that certainly impacted the program versus unit. And then the other element in there is we've got some end of line NGs that are also impacting the quarter. Going back to the early builds just for a second, we've got three left. They're sold, and we got three left to deliver and we'll be done with those by the end of the year. So we're getting to the end game on those. But that's really what was the moving pieces primarily in the quarter. As far as, there is some puts and takes, frankly, George, around the period expense. I mean, we had a little bit better performance around the R&D, and it really was performance in that. And then we had some movement around in particular in fleet support. But other than that, I'd say, team is again, they're not leaving any rock unturned in looking for opportunities to drive more efficiency, and you saw some of that in the quarter. George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : So was the fleet support in the period a little higher than last year, I mean, or no? Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: No. No. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: About the same. George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : Okay. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Yes. Yes. But a little bit better than what we expected or what we originally planned. George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : And the program margin on the 787, you'd mentioned that the increased margins across the board. You took some middle of the road position based on whether you go to 14 a month or 12? Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: On the guide. So if you look at the low end of the margin guide at BCA, we're trying to take that into consideration as a hold or delay in a 14 a month, so holding at 12. And so that's what's considered on that low end of the guide. George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : Okay. Thanks very much. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: You're very welcome. Operator : Our next question is from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Good morning. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Hey, Hunter. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. So we've seen some deferrals from some major customers on the 37 side. United, Lion Air, just to name a couple. I'm sure you're fully bridged on the MAX but obviously you were almost there anyway. But as you think about the broader transition over the next couple years, are some of your more risky delivery positions still double booked or have you kind of used up a little bit of that buffer? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah hey, Hunter, we feel very confident in our delivery profile on the 37 line and ramp-up of the MAX. As you know, we're stepping up to 47 a month and to 52 and 57, and we are oversold against that profile. And it's not unusual for us to have some shifts in our customers, in some cases deferrals and in some cases accelerations, but across the whole profile every year, we're oversold against that profile. So we're very confident in the MAX ramp-up and our ability to ramp up the 737 line overall. MAX will represent about 15% to 20% of the deliveries from that line this year. And flight test is going well, and we'll begin delivering the MAX here in May. So we remain very confident. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thanks, Dennis. Troy Jeffrey Lahr - The Boeing Co.: Operator, we have time for one more analyst question. Operator : And we'll go to Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead. Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes. Good morning, Dennis, Greg. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Good morning, Peter. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Good morning. Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey. Dennis, just talking back on BDS, you mentioned some kind of upward bias on a couple of your key programs. Is there a way to kind of look at it as 2017 should be kind of the trough and kind of the top line on how you're thinking about it? Or maybe give us just kind of a longer-term projection, how you're looking at the BDS growth profile. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yes. Generally, Peter, as we look at it, we're seeing a flat to moderately up top line on the defense business over the next five years. Some of this is dependent on where we end up on the U.S. defense budget. As you know, we're still under sequestration. It's the law of the land, and we're hopeful and there's some signs that alternatives to sequestration are going to come through as the new baseline. But until that happens, it's hard to say exactly what that future profile will look like. I will say what we're hearing from our customers and what we're seeing from the new administration and from the Hill are encouraging signs in terms of adding robustness to the defense budget and selectively growing. You see some of that reflected in funding for our programs in particular. So not only within the defense market writ large where we're seeing some strength, but I'll say additional strength within some of our specific programs like the P-8, like the V-22, the Apache and our fighter lines. And we see reemerging interest in the F-18 Super Hornet as well as the Growler variant domestically and internationally. So we have clear opportunities. I think we have the right products for our customers in terms of capability and value, and we're in the marketplace to compete, and we have opportunities especially if the U.S. defense budget continues to strengthen. But I will put that caveat on it. We need to see a long-term stable strong defense budget in the U.S. Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Got it. Thanks, Dennis. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that completes the analyst question-and-answer session. I'll now return you to The Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Mr. Tom Downey, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications. Mr. Downey, please go ahead Thomas J. Downey - The Boeing Co.: Thank you. We will continue with the questions for Dennis and Greg now. If you have any questions following this part of the session, please use our media relations team number at 312-544-2002. Operator, we're ready for the first question. And in the interest of time, we ask that you limit everyone to just one question, please. Operator : And first we'll go to Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg. Please go ahead. Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg LP : Hi. Good morning. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Good morning. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Good morning, Julie. Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg LP : Dennis, could you just walk us through your thinking on workforce and how best to size the company to its businesses and growth prospects? Looking back since the end of 2012, think overall head count has fallen by about 27,000 people. And for some people, especially in the Puget Sound region, this is sort of almost feeling like a mass layoff playing out in slow motion. At what point are the cuts deep enough? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, Julie, let me give you a little perspective on that. And I think the data you have seen over the last few years reflects the fact that we work in a very competitive marketplace, and we've talked about the need for global competitiveness and government policies that enable competitiveness. That's why we've been pushing hard on things like EXIM Bank reauthorization, trade policy, tax reform policy, all things that will allow us to be more competitive. We are having to deal with a lot of competitive realities in the marketplace, and we've also committed as a company that while we compete today, we need to invest for the future. And some of the tough affordability actions we've had to take have been necessary so we can continue to fuel our R&D and our innovation machine for the future. So those are kind of the framing statements and strategies around our workforce. Now while we have had workforce reductions over the last few years, we're also very mindful about doing that in a way that's respectful to our team and continues to invest in talent for the future. So we've largely been able to leverage voluntary layoffs and take advantage of natural attrition rather than massive steps. So I think that diligent incremental approach is the right way to do it. It's respectful of our team and it's a way that allows us to continue to invest in the future. And while we've had overall reductions, if you look at the total numbers, I think it's also worth reminding everyone that just over the last couple of years, we've hired more than 11,000 new employees. And so while we've had net reductions overall, we continue to fill the front end of our talent pipeline, bring the best talent into the company, engage at the high school and collegiate levels, our intern programs, to make sure we're making the right talent investments for the future. So this is a challenging equation for us, but we take it very seriously about investing in talent and treating our people with respect while we drive competitiveness and fuel our future innovation. Operator : Our next question is from Doug Cameron with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead. Doug Cameron - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.: Morning. I can't sound quite as chirpy as Julie, but I will do my best. I don't remember the last time anyone asked a space question on the call, Dennis. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yes. Doug Cameron - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.: So let's do that for a change. There were reports in the media last week that Apple was a potential co-investor in your small sats program. Can you comment on that? And just given all the chatter and noise about the Space business over the past two years, be it speculation about Aerojet coming \u2013 and maybe just at a very high level where you could, one, address potential Apple investment, and secondly, at a high level, just how you see the Space business developing. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yes. Well hey, Doug, let me take a cut at that. And I'm not going to comment on any specific partnerships or engagements we have. We are engaged with many, many industry partners across the Space spectrum. So, rather than comment on that, let me give you just a little bit of framing on where we're headed. We do see the Space business broadly as a long-term growth business for us. That includes the Satellite business, both the satellite product lines and the services. And that plays into both the commercial and the defense or military marketplace. We've made investments in that area, like our 702MP midsize bus, our SP small bus, as well as new microsatellites. We're now the only company in the world that has all electric propulsion satellites on orbit serving commercial customers, and we still see significant demand for commercial communications bandwidth. And that's part of what's driving the future marketplace. And you've seen interest in that commercial bandwidth from a lot of parties. You mentioned Apple, but there are many others who are interested in commercial bandwidth for the future. You've probably noted our recent license filings for spectrum in that arena, again, for the opportunity to service a number of customer opportunities downstream. So we're going to continue to selectively invest in our Satellites business as a growth area. We also see human space exploration as an opportunity for the long term, programs like the space launch system for NASA, our work on commercial crew, and continuing to make the right investments, partnerships in the launch marketplace, including our ULA joint venture. All of those are important components for the future. So hopefully that gives you a sense strategically. We see Space as a priority. We see it as a business growth area. That business thrives on industrial partnerships, and we're doing that across large and small companies. And we also see that as a great area to attract future talent. It inspires innovation, and it's a great way for us to draw talent into our company. Operator : Our next question's from Alwyn Scott with Reuters. Please go ahead. Alwyn Scott - Thomson Reuters Corp.: Hi to both. Thank you. Two-prong question on tax reform. First, I wonder if Boeing is still pressing for border adjustment tax, given the outline that we saw today from the administration. And second, would a cut in the corporate tax rate and incentives to repatriate overseas cash make any difference to Boeing's plans for investment in the United States? Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: The answer to your second question is no, because we don't have any cash offshore, other than cash that supports our operations. So we're not in a situation where repatriation is an issue or a priority. Broader speaking, we're a supporter of tax reform. And simplifying the tax code, as well as getting the rate to a point of being able to compete on a global scale, is certainly something that we support. And again, we're looking for efficiency in the tax system as well as the rate. And we're working with the administration and those that have, I'll say, the same priorities in mind, to help the administration think this through and implement it in a smooth fashion. But at the highest level, we're a big supporter of tax reform. It's going to drive jobs. It's going to drive the U.S. economy, broadly speaking. And it's going to allow us to compete in any, whether \u2013 doesn't matter what industry you're in. If you're a global company, it's going to allow you to compete on a global platform. And so we're supportive of that. Operator : Next question is from Dominic Gates with The Seattle Times. Please go ahead. Dominic Gates - The Seattle Times Co.: Hi. Good morning. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Hey, Dominic. Dominic Gates - The Seattle Times Co.: Following up on Julie's employment question, one of the real worries here in the Puget Sound area is of course the 777 rate (63:36). We already have these baked in reductions that are coming to there. And a lot of hope that that will change rests on the introduction of the 777X, and yet you've talked about an upturn in the widebody market happening in the early part of the next decade. And that to me brings up the question, how soon after 777X starts do you actually bring these rates up to what they were? You're going to be going down to delivering 3.5 a month in 2018, 2019. 777X will start delivering in 2020. But how many years is it going to take before you're at seven a month? And what is the impact of that gap on employ \u2013 what is the likely impact here on the Puget Sound of that gap? Can you speak about that? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yes. Dominic, let me frame that up for you. As you know, we're currently at seven a month, and we've already announced the plan to go to five a month in the third quarter of this year. And in fact, we're already feathering in that into the production plan and into the factory space. As we look at filling the 777 bridge over the next couple of years, and I'm talking 2018, 2019, and a little into 2020, and then building on the 777X order book that we already have in place with a firm backlog of 340 aircraft, we see that five a month as a floor through the bridge and through the transition. We'll begin introducing the 777X into final assembly in the factory in 2018. So, mindful of the fact that it goes into service in 2020, but it starts to hit the factory space in 2018. So it's important that all of the lead turns on that in terms of supply chain, factory ramp-up, and the people to do the job are all in place. So, when we step to the five a month later this year, again, that's the floor that we see in the factory in terms of the production line, and then we'll transition from 777 to 777X over the next two to three years, and then be up to full rate as we get into the new decade. Now, where we take that rate in the new decade will be dependent again on how well we do in that marketplace. As I said, we see a demand for more than 9,000 widebody aircraft as we get into that big replacement cycle at the start of the next decade. We think we have the right product lineup with 787s and the 777X, so we're well positioned to take advantage of that marketplace and we have lead time in place to tailor our production rate as we get into the new decade, depending on how well we compete and win in the marketplace. Operator : Our next question is from Patti Waldmeir with The Financial Times. Please go ahead. Patti Waldmeir - The Financial Times Ltd.: Thanks very much. This is a question for Mr. Muilenburg. The congressional Republican leadership just held a press conference today in which they said that one of the biggest achievements, if not the biggest achievement, of the first 100 days of President Trump is deregulation. Are there any significant ways in which deregulation has affected Boeing in the first 100 days? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yes. Just to comment on that, one, the overall focus on deregulation and simplifying processes is one that we've been a strong proponent for. And the administration has been very engaged across government agencies and with industry to find ideas and ways and opportunities to simplify and streamline. Things like FAA certification processes is one place that we're seeing some solid progress. That's helping us more efficiently work through certification on some of our new model aircraft such as the MAX as it's going through flight test and entering into service. So we're already seeing some benefits there of some of the work that's being done with the FAA. In the defense department, we're seeing streamlining of regulations and contractual structures, things like improving the cycle time on foreign military sales as an example, which is an enabler for us on helicopters and fighters. We're seeing progress on things like multiyear procurement programs and performance-based logistics. I mentioned some examples of that earlier. So these are things that are clearly working to our benefit broadly as an industry. I think it's also worth pointing out the progress on EXIM Bank reauthorization. To me that's a very big step. It has a regulatory element as well as a trade element to it. But for some time, we have not had the EXIM Bank fully operating, even though it had been reauthorized by super-majorities on both sides of the Hill. The fact that we didn't have a board quorum has left the bank unable to execute at full volume. And with the recent nomination of two board members, we're hopeful that soon we'll see a fully operational board and fully operational EXIM Bank, and not only to the benefit of Boeing but to our 13,000-plus companies that are in our U.S.-based supply chain and other industries. EXIM Bank is a big enabler for jobs growth across big and small companies. So those are a few concrete examples. We're encouraged by the progress, encouraged by the conversations, and look forward to a continued focus in this area. Operator : Our next question is from Jon Ostrower with CNN. Please go ahead. Jon Ostrower - CNN: Good morning, guys. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Hi, John. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Hi. Jon Ostrower - CNN: Hey. Dennis, can you drill down on your thinking on the NMA business case? Customers, particularly on the leasing side, have asked for an airplane with a cost that's effectively coming in somewhere below $70 million to $75 million. When you look at the combination of manufacturing, flying technology and the aftermarket, what's the weight you're assigning to each of those levers when you're looking at the business model and getting that price tag down? Have you figured out yet how to make a profit on selling a sub $75 million 797? And kind of in that same vein, when you look back on the inception of the 87 business model, what kind of leadership controls have you put in place at the CEO level to ensure you're getting a realistic business plan that looks like it does 15 years after you get started? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Hey, John, first of all, it's important that we start with the customer here. So our primary focus right now is engaging with our customers and understanding their future needs. We are looking at different potential price points in the marketplace, different capacities, range, seat capacity, a whole range of options for our customers. So we haven't finalized that, nor have we finalized a price point for the airplane. Now regardless of where we end up there and whether we decide to launch, in parallel we're doing our due diligence on business case opportunities. That gets into reducing development cost. This is all the work we're doing on step-function reduction in development cost and the development program excellence initiative I mentioned earlier. It gets into production cost reduction, leveraging the work that we're doing on all of our product lines today. Selective automation in our factory spaces is an example, all the work we're doing on second-century design and manufacturing. It also gets into lifecycle value and how we think about services. So as we think about the potential business case, we're evaluating all of those elements of the lifecycle and how that can best serve our customers and best enable us to compete in the marketplace. And we're doing this together as a team. To your point, my leadership team across the entire enterprise, all of our functional expertise across supply chain, engineering, operations, finance, our talent pool, our businesses, all of the capabilities we have, this is a shared enterprise effort as we think about how do we position The Boeing Company to be a global industrial leader for our second century. And the opportunity here in terms of building this business case will help us in that transformation journey as well. So you can bet we're going to be diligent about that. We're going to build a business case that makes sense for our company in the long term and adds value for our customers, and our decisions on whether or not we launch will be dependent on that rigorous business case. Thomas J. Downey - The Boeing Co.: Operator, we have time for one last media question. Operator : And we'll go to Gillian Rich with Investor's Business Daily. Please go ahead. Gillian Rich - Investor's Business Daily : Hi. So my question is about what specific lessons did you guys learn from the Tanker issues and how they relate to the 737 MAX and the T-X. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yes, I think to put that in a capsule, what we've learned is that as we think through detailed design integration, where for the first time we're building a military product, highly modified, in our commercial product line, we see huge cost advantages to bringing that capability in line in our production models. But around the edges of that, things like systems installation, wiring installation, the details that go into concurrently designing and building and how to do that most efficiently, those are the lessons that we're learning. And those are now getting applied to our next stage of development programs. Again, the work we've done on Tanker, while we haven't executed the development program as well as we would like to, it's leading to a high value product for our customers. We're still going to deliver these first 18 airplanes early in the next year, and this is going to provide long-term value to the U.S. Air Force. So it's a long-term franchise program, and as we learn lessons in development programs, we pick those up and we apply them across our enterprise. Makes us better and more competitive for the future. Thomas J. Downey - The Boeing Co.: That concludes our earnings call. Again, for members of the media, if you have further questions, please call our Media Relations team at 312-544-2002. Thank you.",

Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analyst and media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcast live over the internet.  At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Troy Lahr, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Mr. Lahr, please go ahead. Troy Lahr : Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's second quarter 2017 earnings call. I'm Troy Lahr, and with me today is Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Enterprise Performance and Strategy. After management comments, we'll take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. We have provided detailed financial information in today's press release and you can follow the broadcast and presentation through our website at boeing.com. Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals in our discussion today are likely to involve risk, which is detailed in our news release, various SEC filings and the forward-looking statement disclaimer in the presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook. Now, I'll turn the call over to Dennis Muilenburg. Dennis Muilenburg : Thank you, Troy and good morning. My comments today will focus on our second quarter results, the health of our business environment and our performance and growth plans. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and our outlook. With that, let\u2019s move to slide 2. Thanks to the dedicated efforts of employees throughout our company, Boeing delivered second quarter 2017 financial results that included strong operating performance and robust cash generation. During the quarter, we generated $5 billion of operating cash and repurchased $2.5 billion of Boeing\u2019s stock as we continued to deliver on our commitment to returning cash to shareholders, while investing in innovation, future growth and our people.  From 2012 till now, we've repurchased more than 200 million shares and increased our dividend per share by 190%. Revenue in the second quarter was $22.7 billion, reflecting planned production rates and timing of commercial and defense deliveries. Core earnings per share of $2.55 was driven by solid execution across the company. Based on our strong first half 2017 performance and improving confidence in our outlook, we are raising full year guidance for operating margins, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Greg will discuss these in more detail shortly. Now, let's look at the second quarter operating performance for our businesses. For the quarter, commercial airplanes generated revenue of $15.7 billion on 183 deliveries and reported operating margins of 10%. The healthy pace of sales announcements at the Paris Air Show contributed to 183 net new airplane orders or $22 billion during the quarter, adding to our already robust backlog that now stands at more than 5700 airplanes. Other key commercial milestones in the quarter included delivering the first 737 MAX 8, launching the 737 MAX 10 and manufacturing the first 777X test parts in our new composite wing center. Also, the second third and 787-10 aircraft entered the flight test program ahead of schedule. Boeing Defense, Space and Security reported second quarter revenue of $6.9 billion. Operating margins were a record for this business segment at 12.9% on continued strong operating performance. New orders booked during the quarter totaled $5 billion, including a $1 billion award from the US Missile Defense Agency, a contract for the UK Ministry of Defense for 38 Apache attack helicopters and an F-15 support contract with the Defense logistics Agency. Key milestones for our defense and space unit included a successful ground based midcourse defense intercept test and first flight of the second production ready TX trainer aircraft. Also as part of our next step in driving market based affordability, Defense, Space and Security announced a more streamlined organizational structure, designed to accelerate decision making, further improve productivity and enhance our competitive position. Overall and to summarize for the quarter, we delivered solid execution across the company, generated strong cash flow, increased our backlog and returned significant cash to shareholders. With that, let's turn to the business environment on slide 3. We continue to see healthy demand in our commercial Defense, Space and Services markets. In the commercial airplane market, airlines continued to report solid profits and passenger traffic continues to outpace GDP with traffic growth 8% through May. Also, cargo traffic is starting to experience a healthier recovery with 10% freight traffic growth over the first five months of the year. Beyond positive traffic growth trends, we've seen over the past few years an evolution in key market dynamics that we believe in the aggregate are driving greater stability and far less cyclicality for our industry.  For example, demand is more geographically diverse and balanced across the globe. It is more diverse and balanced across the spectrum of customer business models as well. There's also more balance in demand between new airplanes needed to replace older airplanes and those needed to support fleet growth requirements and consumer purchasing patterns to become more stable and consistent, driven by sustained and increasing airline profitability. Reflecting these shifts, we recently updated our 20-year commercial market outlook and we now forecast $6.1 trillion of demand for approximately 41,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years, an increase of more than 1400 aircraft from last year. More specifically, we see demand for more than 29,500 aircraft in the single aisle market and approximately 9100 aircraft in the wide body market.  This long term demand combined with healthy market conditions and a robust backlog provide a solid foundation for our planned production rate increases. Our high confidence in increasing 737 production to 57 per month in 2019 is based on our existing backlog of nearly 4500 aircraft and a production skyline that is oversold through the end of the decade. In the wide body market, we continue to see some varying levels of near term demand across aircraft models. However, we have seen steady orders and have high confidence in a meaningful increase in wide body replacement demand early in the next decade. 777 production for 2017 is sold out and for the current generation 777, we have 111 orders in backlog, which includes four additional aircraft that we booked in July.  Production continues at the seven per month rate before we lower the production rate in August to five per month and as we've previously stated, that production rate will result in 777 deliveries of approximately 3.5 per month in 2018 and 2019 as we transition production to the 777X. At that rate and with the existing orders and commitments in place, we are now in an oversold position in 2018 and approximately 90% sold out in 2019. While we still have more work to do to fill the remaining 777 production slots, based on the current environment and our ongoing sales campaigns, we believe the rate plan that we put in place establishes a floor for the program and supports our production bridge from the current triple 777 to the 777X.  And we have a strong foundation of 340 777X orders and commitments that support our plan for ramping up production and delivery of the new 777X. Our 787 Dreamliner program also stands on a strong foundation for long-term production with over 700 firm orders in our backlog. The recent order from AerCap for 30 787-9 Dreamliners illustrates continued healthy near term demand for this unmatched fuel efficient family of aircraft. As we've discussed on prior calls, we have a focused effort underway to secure additional 787 orders to support the 14 per month production rate planned for the end of the decade. We remain disciplined in our ongoing 787 production rate assessment, with an emphasis on production stability, growing profitability and ensuring that supply and demand are kept in balance. Turning to Defense, Space and Security, we continue to see solid demand for our major platforms and programs. In the enacted FY17 federal budget, Congress added 7 AH-64 Apaches, 12 F-18 Super Hornets and four V22 Ospreys as well as a significant funding increase for space launch system. We're also seeing strong support for numerous Boeing programs above the president's FY18 budget request. International demand for our defense and space offerings remains high as well, in particular for Rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters and satellites. We continue to make progress towards completing a healthy mix of previously announced international sales, including 36 F-15 fighter aircraft to Qatar, 28 F-18 fighter aircraft to Kuwait, up to 48 Chinook helicopters to Saudi Arabia and the final C-17 to India. Our investment in future growth and new sales continues in areas that are priorities for our customers, such as commercial derivatives, Rotorcraft satellites services, human space exploration and autonomous systems.  As part of these efforts, we're also leveraging capabilities and technologies across the enterprise by winning future franchise programs such as the JSTARS recapitalization, Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, Unmanned Carrier Based MQ-25A and the T-X Trainer, along with advanced weapons programs and other important opportunities. Turning to the services sector, we see the $2.6 trillion services market over the next 10 years as a significant growth opportunity for the company. To capture an increasing share of that growth, our new Boeing Global Services business is focused on traditional services such as parts, modifications and upgrades as well as new offerings, utilizing data analytics and information based services. Comprised of major elements from our formal commercial aviation services and global services and support groups, Boeing Global Services successfully began operating as an integrated new business unit on July 1st and it has already begun capturing key market opportunities. On the defense services side, we announced exclusive aftermarket distribution agreements with GE Aviation and Rolls-Royce for engine spare parts that have a combined potential value of more than $10 billion over the life of the program. Also during the quarter, Norwegian selected Boeing global services provides flight training across its entire Boeing fleet and in part to fuel our growth in digital aviation, we launched Boeing analytics.  It brings together our enterprise capabilities and the work of more than 800 analytics experts across our company, we are focused on transforming data into actionable insights and customer solutions. With growing markets and opportunities ahead, our team remains intensely focused on growth, innovation and accelerating productivity improvements to fuel investments in our future. The gains we have achieved thus far this year and those we expect in the months ahead are reflected in the increased guidance for margins, earnings per share and cash flow that Greg will discuss in more detail. With that, Greg, over to you for our financial results. Greg Smith : Thanks, Dennis. Good morning, everybody. Let's turn to slide 4 and we\u2019ll discuss our second quarter results. Second quarter revenue came in as planned at 22.7 billion, while core operating earnings per share increased to $2.55, driven by solid performance across the portfolio. Let\u2019s now move to commercial airplanes on slide 5. For the second quarter, our commercial airplane business reported revenue of 15.7 billion, reflecting the execution of planned production rates and timing of deliveries. BCA operating margins were 10% on solid execution on production programs and within our services business. As Dennis indicated earlier, BCA captured $22 billion in net orders during the second quarter and backlog remains very strong at 424 billion, more than 5700 aircraft, again equating to more than seven years of production. Cost performance on the 787 program continues to improve with deferred production balance declining by $531 million in the quarter. Turning now to Defense, Space and Security results on slide 6. Second quarter revenue on our defense business was 6.9 billion and operating margins were 12.9%, largely driven by strong performance at military aircraft and Global Services. Boeing military aircraft\u2019s second quarter revenue was 2.9 billion, reflecting the planned wind down of the C-17 program. Operating margins of 13.2% reflect overall solid core operating performance. Network and space systems reported revenue of 1.7 billion on planned timing of satellite volume and operating margins were 9.1% for the quarter. Global Services & Support revenue was 2.3 billion, reflecting timing of contracts. And mix in operating margins of 15.4%, reflecting strong execution across the portfolio and favorable contract mix. Defense, Space and Security reported backlog at $58 billion with 37% of that from international customers. Let\u2019s move to cash flow on slide 7. Operating cash flow was very strong at $5 billion for the second quarter, driven by solid operating performance across the company and favorable timing of receipts and expenditures. With regard to capital deployment, as Dennis mentioned, we repurchased 13.6 million shares for $2.5 billion in the second quarter and for the first half of the year, we've completed 28.5 million shares, totaling $5 billion. Our continued balanced cash deployment efforts reflect our ongoing confidence in the long term outlook for our business. We anticipate completing the remaining $9 million repurchase authorization over approximately the next year. Returning cash to shareholders along with continued investment to support future growth again remain a priority for us. Let's move now to cash and debt balances on slide 8. We ended the quarter with $10.3 billion of cash and marketable securities. This cash position provides us flexibility to invest in highly profitable growth opportunities, while again also returning cash to shareholders. We also announced today that we're taking action to further de-risk the company by accelerating $3.5 billion of pension funding, which we expect will eliminate nearly all future mandatory pension funding through 2021.  During the third quarter, in addition to the previously announced $500 million cash pension contribution, we will make another 300 -- $3.5 billion of discretionary pension contribution using Boeing common shares. We will utilize our strong cash position to increase share repurchase by the 3.5 billion above our prior plan for 2017 and we now expect to repurchase approximately $10 billion of Boeing common shares for the full year. We continue to expect operating cash flow to grow annually through the end of the decade and we remain committed to returning approximately 100% of free cash flow to investors. Over the past several years, we have taken meaningful actions to reduce risk in cyclicality in our business and today's actions are another step in that direction. Let's turn now to slide 9 and we\u2019ll discuss our outlook for 2017. We increased 2017 core earnings per share guidance by $0.60 to now be between $9.80 and $10, driven by improved performance across the company and lower than expected tax rate. We're also increasing BCA margin guidance to greater than 10% and BDS margin guidance to greater than 11.5%. As Dennis indicated earlier, we're also raising cash flow guidance for improved performance in tax savings from the additional pension funding. Cash flow guidance is increasing by 1.5 billion to 12.25 billion with approximately $700 million related to tax savings and about $800 million on improved operating performance. We're also lowering CapEx guidance, spending guidance by 300 million to $2 billion for the year on improved efficiency, disciplined spending and some favorable timing. So in summary, our core operating engine continues to deliver strong results, increasing momentum for our company. In the second half of the year, an important focus for us will be ensuring that continued seamless ramp up of Boeing Global Services and leveraging our new three business unit strategy in the marketplace. We\u2019ll also be expanding our efforts in driving key cross enterprise levers to improve productivity and affordability and accelerating innovation across the company, all with an eye towards profitable growth in the second century. So with that, I'll turn it back to Dennis for some closing comments. Dennis Muilenburg : All right. Thank you, Greg. With a strong first half of the year behind us, our team remains focused on further driving both growth and productivity. In addition to the encouraging commercial airplane market dynamics I mentioned earlier in my remarks, we've also taken our own actions to reduce cyclicality in our business, including remaining disciplined in our production rate decisions, de-risking our pension liabilities, strategically phasing our research and development spending, creating labor stability with long-term contracts and expanding our services business, which is also less cyclical.  Our priorities going forward are to leverage our unique One Boeing advantages, continue building strength on strength to deliver and improve on our commitments and to stretch beyond those plans to sharpen and accelerate our pace of progress on key enterprise growth and productivity efforts. Achieving these objectives require a clear and consistent focus on the profitable ramp up in commercial airplane production, continuing to strengthen our defense and space business, delivering on our development programs, growing our integrated services business and leveraging the power of our three business unit strategy, driving world class levels of productivity and performance throughout the enterprise to fund our investments and innovation in growth and to develop and maintain the best team and talent in the industry.  All of which positions Boeing for continued market leadership, sustained top and bottom line growth and to create increasing value for our customers, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. Now, we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first questions comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Doug Harned : Dennis, in the past, you\u2019ve talked about taking free cash flow up sequentially year-over-year. You've obviously got a very big free cash flow number this year, an increase. And first, I want to make sure that\u2019s still true in the following years, but I'd like to understand two aspects of it. First, is your outlook with rising free cash flow assume that you'll get to the mid-teens target for margins that you've talked about in the past or could that be additional upside? And then second, on CapEx, you've taken down CapEx 300 million for this year. How does that fit in with the trajectory going forward where you've got the 777X and you potentially may have longer term new mid-size airplane coming out. So how do you think about both aspects of the cash flow trajectory? Dennis Muilenburg : Doug, first of all, on your initial question, absolutely confirm, we still expect year-over-year cash growth throughout the end of the decade even with a higher foundation starting point for that based on the performance this year. We still expect year-over-year cash growth going forward. A lot of that again is driven by just fundamental performance in the business, increasing profitability on the 787, you can see the progress we're making there and we expect to make more progress going forward, the ramp up on 737 production and just fundamental improved performance across our program. So we still expect this to be a sustained year-over-year cash growth business.  And our work on margins, as you referenced, contributes to that. We still have our target out there for our teams to get to 15% margins by the end of the decade. You can see that we're making progress towards that target. And as we've mentioned to you before, we expect that to be steady progress, not progress that awaits till the end of the decade, we expect to see incremental margin improvement over the next several years. That is a contributing factor and we're keeping that target closely in focus.  And then on the CapEx point, you did see us reduced our guidance for the end of the year in terms of CapEx spend this year, reflecting some efficiencies in our performance as well as a bit of timing, but you should expect to see a very stable CapEx profile going forward. Part of our plan for the company is to have a non-cyclical business and a well-tailored R&D and CapEx profile and we think as we're in the middle of 777X over the next few years, that'll be winding down. We have other investments that we're contemplating for the future, but all of those are feathered in to provide us a very nice stable CapEx and R&D profile for the rest of the decade. Doug Harned : Does that CapEx reduction reflect anything about how triple 777X is proceeding? Dennis Muilenburg : I think it gives you a sign that the program is proceeding on plan. We have hit the peak on the CapEx spending for 777X, the project Wing Center was one of our big investments there. We're now building initial production parts in the composite wing center, so 777X is moving forward right on plan and we expect to begin delivering those airplanes in 2020 as planned. Operator : Our next question is from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Cai Von Rumohr : Thank you so much and good performance. So Dennis, of your plan to get to sort of 15% margins in commercial, how much of that should we anticipate being from extension of accounting blocks and how much of that is just core line performance? Dennis Muilenburg : Yeah. All of those are contributing factors, Cai. Certainly, we're working productivity internally and that's a day-to-day activity in every dimension of our cost profile, of our market based competitiveness work. Both direct and indirect costs, every element of overhead, those are elements that we're working hard. It applies to our supply chain. Recall that 60% to 70% of our cost base in the commercial airplane business is in our supply chain, so the work we're doing through our Partnering for Success initiative. Again, we're making some great progress there with our suppliers and partners. More work to go there and it's also true that favorable mix going forward and what we see in terms of block extensions as we continue to grow our production profile. That certainly contributes as well, those production block extensions are margin accretive. And also related as we stand up our services business, in general, we expect services growth to be accretive to margins. So all of those are contributors to that 15% target. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Howard Rubel. Dennis Muilenburg : Operator, we'll go to the next question. Operator : One moment please. We're having some technical difficulties. From Jefferies, your line is open. Please go ahead. And Mr. Rubel, if your line is on mute possibly. Dennis Muilenburg : I think we should try to go to the next question. Operator : Thank you. Yeah. We\u2019ll go to the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead. Pete Skibitski : Yeah. I wanted to start on MAX execution. With the 6 you delivered in the second quarter, do you feel that you\u2019re on pace to meet that delivery, but you kind of said I think 10% to 15% of the total 737 deliveries for the year. And then kind of along with that, can you give us a sense of how the switch over transition is going on the three lines in Renton, just in terms of kind of switching over the other two lines, from the NG to the MAX and kind of what level of risk you think that entails? Dennis Muilenburg : Let me take a first cut and Greg, feel free to add in here. But the MAX ramp-up is going well. As you noted, the 6 deliveries in the quarter, we're continuing to ramp up right on pace and the airplanes also performing well in the field. As we mentioned before, our production system transitioned overall on 737 to 47 a month was scheduled for this quarter and the production system is now running at 47 a month. So we've successfully ramped up while we've introduced the MAX and we are now in the process of moving from the separate third line to integrating into the NG line and actually have airplanes flowing through that integrated NG MAX line. So team is doing a great job of ramping up the production system and fully integrating the operations. We still expect deliveries to be in that 10% to 15% of the total 737 volume for the year. Greg, have you got anything you want to add? Greg Smith : Yeah. I mean the only thing I would add Pete is, as we've made these transitions in rate, again, think about risk reduction and so I think the team has done a great job of pre-planning that and investing in that third line, getting the program up and running and then transitioning into the main line and this is just another example of how do you de-risk that transition and continue to drive value and meet our customer commitments and the team is doing that. So we've got a big back half in front of us, but they know exactly what they need to do and they're off to a great start. Pete Skibitski : That's great, Greg. Maybe one follow up, period costs, as more MAX enter service and more operators get the aircraft over the next couple of years, do you expect period cost to grow over the next couple of years on that or is that going to be kind of flattish? Greg Smith : It will be around flattish. Operator : Our next question is from Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead. Jason Gursky : I wonder if you could spend a few minutes talking about your updated thoughts on the middle of the market and you obviously spend some time over in Paris and probably had some customer conversations about that aircraft. So maybe just talk a little bit about how the business case is coming along on that one, a little bit about the production system and how you think you're going to get there from a cost perspective? And then you've talked about the free cash flow at work for the rest of this decade, but this is a program that's going to probably began ramping in 2020. So just kind of talk about the handoff from your current development programs into the middle of the market and the impacts that that might have on cash? Thanks. Dennis Muilenburg : We're continuing to make progress on our efforts there as we talk to customers about the potential middle market airplane. We've talked with more than 50 customers around the globe with a diverse set of business models and business needs. We continue to see a potential market there for 2000 to 4000 aircraft. We're continuing to work our way through the details of what that airplane might look like potentially a family of two airplanes working through passenger sizing, range of the airplanes and having good meaningful discussions with our customers.  We're also working through the details of the supporting business case. We're certainly going to leverage all of the investments that we've made across things like 787 and 777X, the composite technology that we've invested in, but an important part of this is also taking a look at the fundamental manufacturing system and how we design and build for the future and taking advantage of some of our new digital tools and that allows to take significant cost out of development, production and improve down field support. And then all of this, we're looking at it through a lifecycle lens.  And as we ramp up our services business, this could also be a contributor to helping us ramp up in services. So that\u2019s all work that's productively moving forward. We're still looking at a timeline that we've talked about before that if we were to introduce this airplane, it\u2019s probably an entry into service in the 2024, 2025 timeframe. So we have time to do our homework and do it well, we\u2019ll make a good disciplined business decision. From a R&D and CapEx standpoint, it feathers in very nicely with the work we have underway.  And by that 2020 timeframe, we\u2019ll be down the backside of the 777X R&D profile and CapEx profile, we\u2019ll begin delivering 777Xs in that time frame and so if we were to launch a middle of the market development program, it would rather end very nicely on the back side of 777X. But we really don't see a significant change to our profile in terms of CapEx and R&D spending. We think we'll see a nice steady profile throughout that time period. So we're going to continue to do our work here and make a good business discipline decision and one that adds value for customers. Operator : Our next question is from David Strauss with UBS. Please go ahead. David Strauss : Wanted to ask about cash progress through the rest of the year. Year-to-date, it looks like advances Greg have been a pretty big tailwind. Your guidance for the full year, how are you thinking about advances? And then your commitment to free cash flow growth from here, how are you thinking about advances playing into that and then also 777X and the inventory build there. Thanks. Greg Smith : Yeah. There was some favorable timing in the quarter on advances, but there will not be favorable timing in the year. So the guide increase is on performance as well as the tax benefit associated with the pensions. So again, as I outlined, about 700 million for the pension, about 800. So this is, you got to equate this to core performance. This is focused on working capital and all elements of working capital, right down to the program and functional level, looking at payables, receivables, probably most of the focus getting into inventory, right down to the line and making a very efficient business decisions there. So you got to equate this to performance.  As you look at the cash flow going forward, I think Dennis addressed it earlier, we still expect it to grow for all the reasons he outlined that I won't repeat them, but on top of that, again, we've got more focus on the elements within cash down to the team level and they're off to a great start. So I think there's more opportunity there for us to capture. In 777X inventory build and so on, is all in those comments about us expecting cash flow to grow. We've taken that all in to consideration.  So it's about execution. It\u2019s about being more efficient as Dennis outlined and it's about executing on our production rate increases as we have and at the same time, looking for opportunities to reduce risk, like we talked about earlier with Pete on MAX or another example on the pension. We're taking that risk off the table and we're pre-funding that to give ourselves again a clear line of sight that really focuses more so on just day to day efficiency and operating performance. David Strauss : And Greg, in terms of the working capital opportunity, receivable, payables, inventories, how far along do you think you are in terms of capturing the opportunity you see there? Greg Smith : I think there's still a lot of opportunity there. And again we're benchmarking ourselves, not just within the industry. We're benchmarking ourselves to the top quartile as Dennis has outlined. So we're benchmarking with people that you wouldn't traditionally benchmark with outside the industry that are really good at this, taking those best practices and bringing them in and there are some areas who are more mature than others and by the way, there's areas within Boeing that we are at best in class level, so how do we take those best practices and bring them across on the other program. So bottom line is, I think, there's more opportunity there for us to capture. Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Myles Walton : I was hoping to follow up on the margins at BCA. Obviously, the core underlying margins, I\u2019m not sure you are kind of pre R&D, the mature margins look like they've been the best and it was a decade and kind of leads me to the next question, which is you raise the guidance to greater than 10% for the year. I think the prior guidance contemplated either retaining your 14 a month target for the 787 or kicking that decision out. Are you implying that you're in a more comfortable position to retain the 14 a month 787 production by the end of the decade with this guidance raise? Dennis Muilenburg : Yeah. The assumptions on the guidance raise around 787 are unchanged. So they're within the guidance there and obviously we haven't, we have assumed that we are going to 14 a month and we've got a market to support that, but we've still got some work to do and so we\u2019ll continue to finish that work, but all of that is taken into consideration in margin guidance. Greg Smith : Those alternatives are bounded by the guidance. Myles Walton : And was there any, just kind of clarification, were there any block adjustments unusual in the quarter. Could you say what they are? Dennis Muilenburg : Just one, 737, nothing unusual, but 737 all MAX. Operator : Our next question is from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Rajeev Lalwani : I wanted to come back, Dennis, to middle of the market aircraft and maybe approach it in a bit of a different way. You\u2019ve been talking more about the prospects of it obviously. Would it be fair to assume that such a program could service leverage to increase aftermarket opportunities on existing programs as opposed to just this new one, and then if you\u2019ve had any successful conversations to that effect? Dennis Muilenburg : Yeah. Rajeev, as I said, as we contemplate middle of the market airplane, we are taking a look at that through a lifecycle value lens services lens. It can be a way for us to amplify some of the investments we're making to grow services. As we look at our parts business downstream and how we structure that for the future and making sure we have the right kind of intellectual property arrangements to do that that, that gives us some opportunity to expand that thought process to other product lines. The investments we're making in digital aviation information based services, the architecture of the airplane to maximize that value.  There's a learning associated there that again allows us to cross-pollinate to our other production lines. We're also thinking through our vertical strategy as we build out vertical capabilities for the future, how we might use a middle of the market airplane to amplify that effort, things like our composite wing investment that you're well aware of, propulsion integration is another area where we've been investing, we're standing up in actuation capability that's going to provide support to 777 and 737, we could further amplify that. So this is a way for us to also build our vertical strategy with an idea that vertical depths can also add lifecycle value. So those are all lenses that we're working on and we are certainly evaluating middle of the market airplane as a mechanism for helping us grow services and as we think through that lifecycle lens, that's a business process approach that again can provide value more broadly to our services business across commercial and defense. Rajeev Lalwani : And just a brief follow-up, just as you look more on the services side and you\u2019ve obviously even talking about a lot more, Dennis. What have you been hearing from some of your suppliers and customers as far as just the feedback which you\u2019re looking to do. Dennis Muilenburg : The key is as we move to this dedicated integrated services business, we're absolutely focused on our customers and we believe there's great opportunity here to add value for our customers and provide better solutions for then. So that's where this all starts. As we've had discussions with our customers those have been very encouraging because we are focused on adding value for them. And we're convinced that with our depth of OEM knowledge, some of the investments we're making and our partnerships with our suppliers that there are ways to do that together. And certainly throughout our supply chain there's interest in what we're doing in the services area. As we contemplate this growth markets I said about $2.5 trillion market over the next ten years. We see that as a growing market and one we're working with our supply chain, we can grow together and provide better value for our customers. That is our focus on this effort. Operator : The next question is from our with Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Howard Rubel : The shift from performance because it's pretty impressive to talk about maybe orders and sort of the outlook for a moment, sort of two parts to it. One is that it looks like book to bill this year based on what you've done in Paris and to date is clearly going to be better than one. But could you also talk a little bit about what's going on in the leasing market because those are kind of what I call shadow orders where we're seeing aircraft being placed that had already been ordered by the leasing company so that you're expanding your footprint and what does that mean and give you confidence in terms of your forward look to volumes? Dennis Muilenburg : Well, first of all on overall book to bill, Howard, we\u2019re still expecting a book to bill of about 1 for the year. You're right we had a very strong Paris Air Show and we're very pleased with the outcome there. And I think in general, there was some upside there compared to what we had expected going into the Air Show. So we\u2019re encouraged by the momentum there, but if we look at overall market both narrow bodies and wide bodies, we still expect orders volume to be similar to last year, a book to bill of about one. As you know there's a lot of timing associated with orders volume. That said with a backlog of over 5,700 aircraft, we don't have a great sense of urgency to have to build overall backlog, we\u2019re in a solid position. We are very focused on filling out the 777 Bridge as a key part of our orders effort. You can see we've made some great progress on that. And I want to reiterate again that we're now in an oversold position in 2018, so that new good news for the 777 Bridge although we still have more work to go there. Now to your point on the leasing companies, we do see a lot of energy there. Again both narrow bodies and wide bodies. And as we have customers around the world that are thinking through different business models, the leasing channels are certainly providing some good support to the overall market growth and you can see that satisfying needs in both passenger and cargo growth. I think just as another really good sign post is during the quarter, AerCap's order for 30 787-9s. While we continue to be mindful of some hesitancy in the wide body marketplace having a premier customer like AerCap's and their releasing horsepower making a big order in the wide body marketplace. I think is another good signal for us. So we're going to continue to be mindful about the risks and be very focused on filling out the 777 Bridge. But I'm feeling good about the progress we're making and I think the energy we see in the leasing market it supports the overall market strength. Operator : The next question is from Andrew Gollan with Berenberg. Please go ahead. Andrew Gollan : So I have a broader question on capital structure. So in light of the decision today that we learned about accelerating the pension funding. In recent years, Boeing has a neutral balance sheet position in terms of gross cash and consolidated debt broadly. So with this injection in pension funding we moved to a net debt position of about 4 billion. I just would like you insights into how you think about capital structure, is this the reflection of just confidence or how you think about the right capital structure for the group relative to history? Greg Smith : Yes, I think it certainly reflects confidence we have in our business in the market and our ability to execute in that market and it goes to the foundation that Dennis talked about as far as the backlog. But I think as far as general capital structure what you see today is what you should expect to see going forward and we're very focused on again on risk mitigation and topline and bottom line performance. And so as we make these decisions like pension and that really ties to our performance. If we weren't performing at the levels we were at, we wouldn\u2019t have the opportunity do something like this and this is a really great opportunity to look after that kind of profile up to 2021 and kind of pull that back, take that risk off the table. And at the same time very committed to meeting our obligations to all of our employees. So returning cash to shareholders, balance deployment, investing in our company in innovation that's what's gotten us here, over the last hundred years that's what's going to get us and allow us lead in the second century as Dennis has articulated and that's going to continue to be our focus. Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to Seth Seifman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman : I wanted to ask about the 787 and very good progress on the deferred balance this quarter, the $530 million dollar reduction. Was there anything kind of unique about this quarter or is that sort of the new floor for deferred reduction going forward. And then when we think about the second half of the year and how much better things could get. I was under the impression that there were some price step downs coming in the second half and that we would see further acceleration from that level? Greg Smith : Seth, I said there's nothing unique, it is just again as we've articulated the kind of big moving pieces on improving deferred. Certainly first and foremost executing to making the deliveries and making rate. Team has done a great job in doing that. Coming down the learning curve in the factories as well as step down in the supply chain and then of course the more favorable mix as we bring more -9s and 10s in. But frankly I guess the only thing that would be a little bit unique here is that we've got -10s and 12, and they\u2019re in early production and that would be more of a headwind. So I think what you see here again beyond that is pretty straightforward. So obviously we expect that to improve going forward as we continue to focus on each of those elements. Again, my credit to the teams in Charleston and Seattle because they've done a great job. Staying day to day focused on every unit being more efficient than the prior one, they in some cases are setting new standards for the company. So back to my kind of best practices. We have teams coming in now that are looking at some of these initiatives they have on A7 and we're bringing them across to places like rotorcraft and the fighter line. So that just gives you a sense of how day to day focus is really making a difference in the progress that's been made in 77 program. Seth Seifman : And to your point, Greg, on 787-10, its showing the value of real manufacturing commonality as well with those first jet planes flowing through the line. Operator : And next we\u2018ll go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Ron Epstein : Dennis, how do you think about the health of your supply chain, particularly as start to go up - continue - not to start but continue to go up in rate on the narrow bodies. Are there any pressure points that you worry about and how do you think about managing those because obviously you guys are doing very well with your inside performance, but how do you make sure everybody kind of feeding that is up to snuff as well, particular as rates go higher. Dennis Muilenburg : You bet. Ron, we spend an intense amount of time with our supply chain just as rigorously taking a look at their productivity curves and investments and ramp up as we do to our internal operations. In fact that's all done hand in hand because we know that we're only going to be successful when our supply chain is successful. And as we're ramping up narrow bodies with the 737 line now up to 47 a month in the production system having just taken that step from 42 to 47, our supply chain has come with us. As you know we've been paying very close attention to the ramp up on the MAX and LEAP engine, and our partners at GE have been doing a great job of ramping up in parallel with us. We\u2019re keeping a very close eye on any other pressure points that we might see in the supply chain. So I don't want to make this sound like it's easy, but it's something that is on track and something that we're paying attention to every day. And we're confident that we have the ability to ramp up to 57 a month. The market certainly supports that kind of the ramp up and by doing it in a disciplined fashion, bringing our supply chain with us, we're confident we\u2019ll be able to execute. This move that we just made from 42 to 47 a month didn\u2019t get a lot of fanfare. But her team executed it really very cleanly and that's really a credit to our team that they know how to do these great ramp ups and do them incrementally to take out risk and bring our supply chain along. Next year, we\u2019ll ramp up to 52 a month and then 2019 will ramp up to 57 a month. So the nice disciplined progression and its part of our partnering for success effort we\u2019re bringing our supply chain along. And we'll continue to keep a close eye on that. if we see any risk points or single source risk points we\u2019ll make sure that we're building a risk mitigation behind those. But right now we're healthy and marching forward. Ron Epstein : And if I may as a follow up to that question, when you think about standing the service organization, how are your balancing obviously your needs and wants in the aftermarket with your suppliers, right, because from the supplier perspective, for a lot of them that's their lifeblood. So how do you balance that? Dennis Muilenburg : As I said earlier, Ron, our objective is to grow together in a growing market, right. This is a market that has a lot of headroom for all of us to serve our customers in a more value added way. Now certainly from a Boeing perspective, at the market as it stands today we\u2019re about a 7% to 9% market share in today's market. So that gives us headroom to grow in a market where clearly we have a significant platform presence that's well beyond 7% to 9% of the market. Going forward we expect that market to expand and so while there are some places where we will logically have some competition between ourselves and our supply chain in terms of competing for certain service market segments, in large part this is about growing the market together and adding more value to our customers. I think we're just beginning to scratch the surface on these digital aviation solutions, a value add for our customers that's going to grow the market and something that we can do together with our supply chain. So that is our preferred business model. Now where we need to we\u2019ll build out vertical capabilities because we're determined to make sure we're adding value for our customers and we've made some of those investments already. We're currently looking through about 40 different categories of support and parts areas where we may invest for the future. In some cases those will be vertical capabilities and some cases new partnerships with our suppliers and in some cases when we need to build an additional supply chain component we\u2019ll make those kind of investments. I think a good example there is the 777X landing gear as an example. So that whole portfolio of options is in front of us. Now the key here is that majority of the work should be growing the services business together, doing it in partnership with our suppliers and in a way that ultimately adds value for the customers. That's how we win in this market. Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Sam Pearlstein : I\u2019m wondering if you could follow up a little bit more on the global services. You did give a 20-year outlook earlier in the week. Can you talk about the 7% to 9% share. Looking at the growth rates of the different end markets that you're targeting. I just wonder when can you get to that aspirational $50 billion target, is that five years, ten years, 20 years, just in terms of thinking about it. And some other related is, as you stand up the global services and pull out what I presume is a relatively high margin business out of the segment, how does that affect your PCA aspirational goal of 15% margin just because it's not going to be a different business. Dennis Muilenburg : Let me take on that first part and then I'll ask Greg to chip in on the second question there. If we take a look at that 50 billion target, revenue target annual sales, we set an aspirational goal for our team that is an aggressive target. We are targeting to hit that level over the next five to ten years, so we provided some span of time to do that. Our preference is to do it more quickly, but we're making the right discipline investment, so we grow in a value added way both for customers and for our company and partners. We do see the majority of that growth being organic investment. We do expect some complimentary inorganic investments either acquisitions or in some cases new partnerships, but working through a whole range of options right now that will fuel that growth. So this is a place where we will invest to grow, but we do see it primarily as organic growth. And I think already we've seen a number of successes here just coming out of the gates better. Encouraging signs on the value we can add for our customers. We stood up Boeing Analytics as you heard that's adding information based services value for our customers.  Just recently we signed contracts with Delta, China Airlines, and Korean Air for airplane health management predictive alerts. We've got a new agreement with AirBridgeCargo for the fuel dashboard, we've got a ten-year service contract with Turkish to optimize navigation capabilities. We've got the agreement with Norwegian that I mentioned in my comments on flight training capabilities. So we're seeing steady progress, great opportunities for us to leverage our OEM depth, leverage our fundamental parts and services business, upgrades and mods, and then really begin to drive accelerated growth in information based services and data analytics. So all of those will contribute to that $50 billion target. We\u2019re going to move forward in a disciplined way, but in an aggressive way. And Greg you want to comment on the\u2026 Greg Smith : I would say from the aspirational goal perspective, it hasn\u2019t changed. So yes, they'll be some movements in the portfolio to the three business units that of course will report out in third quarter and give you further insight into that movement. But that's going to be, the services business is going to be about $14 billion business at about 15%. But the aspirational goal for BDS and BCA is unchanged. Now obviously we're looking at the BGS side of it and looking at the marketplace there and the risk and reward and you can imagine we're raising the bar there internally as well. So it's not just the $50 billion but it's also from a margin perspective is the risk and reward in balance and what we're offering to the customers as far as value goes. So broader aspiration, again, I wouldn't think of it any different with the change in setting up three business units versus two. Operator : Our next question is from.. Troy Lahr : We got time for only one more question. Operator : Okay great, that will be from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead. Peter Arment : Dennis or Greg, when we were Paris we talked a little bit about the kind of the productivity initiatives kind of the champion time concepts and I think we're talking about the 787 for example about in terms of the productivity and what you're squeezing out there. Is this an issue that you're going to be able to still roll out broader across BCA or is that a little more unique just because it was a newer program at 787? Just kind of getting at the productivity gains that you guys are making. Dennis Muilenburg : Peter, absolutely we're going to roll it out, but it's even broader than commercial airplanes. And this idea of champion times not only at the unit cost level but at the complement level. We have teams that are working mid-body and half-body on 787. They're setting new champion times and what we're seeing is this culture of champion time performance. The farther you drill down, the more powerful it is. And we get teams at the workgroup level that are adopting this philosophy. We're now taking that and we're transporting it to other commercial airplane programs. And Kevin McAllister is doing a great job of spreading that across his enterprise. But in collaboration with Leanne over in the defense and space business, the same thing we've taken that same philosophy to our fighter lines, the satellite lines, the rotorcraft lines. So this is part of our One Boeing strategy and this champion time approach to driving productivity we think is a real enabler for the future and our teams are where the great ideas, our people are the holders of our innovation and this champion time work is really unleashing that innovation. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that completes the analyst question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'll now return you to the Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Mr. Tom Downey, Senior Vice President Of Corporate Communications. Mr. Downey, please go ahead. Tom Downey : Thank you, we will continue with questions for Dennis and Greg now. If you have any questions following this part of the session, please call our media relations team at 312-544-2002. Operator we are ready for the first question and we ask in the interest of time that you limit everyone to just one question please. Operator : And we'll go to Doug Cameron with Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead. Doug Cameron : Can I go back to the supply chain stroke services, sort of mantra is that we've got a close eye on this and PFS 2.0 is a win-win et cetera et cetera. But yesterday somebody like kind of trumpeted their latest Partnering for Success deal basically today. Is it a profit warning and is basically scare of bankruptcy? Another of your big partners or pick suppliers basically said, if services expands like you talk about that they might have to change their pricing model. So, is there a disconnect between what you say and some of your suppliers say or have you really got all of this sorted not just now but in the medium term? Dennis Muilenburg : Doug, when we take a look at this again the key is when we talk about growing services we always go back and start with the customer. And this is about adding value for our customers and we can do that in partnership with our suppliers as we always have done in the past. Now certainly as you pointed out there's some sense of nervousness or uncertainty as we ramp up. We understand how that might be the case within some of our supply chain, but our actions are following through, it\u2019s in developing partnerships with our supply chain and adding value for our customers. Now there are going to be some places where we're going to have to make some hard decisions, we're going to have to develop alternatives, we're going to have to build additional supply chain capacity, yes, there will be some hard things that will have to do, but all with a ultimate focus on adding value for our customers. And I do believe overall the services market is a high growth market and the large majority of our work can be work that we grow together with our supply chain and where we do have some hard spots we\u2019ll deal with those. That's what our Partnering For Success initiative is designed to do, it's allowed us to get tough business issues on the table, drive those to resolution so that ultimately we can grow together and ultimately will provide better value for our customers. Operator : The next question is from Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg. Please go ahead. Julie Johnsson : Dennis, you mentioned inorganic growth for BGS a couple of minutes ago. And BDS has been overshadowed over the last few years by the grow with the commercial division. Would you mind just updating your thinking, your approach to mergers and acquisitions. I mean Boeing has been focused on bolt-on deals for long time, maybe going back to the McDonnell Douglas merger. And I'm wondering now with your stock trading up near 230 per share. That's a really rich currency and are you open to considering larger strategic acquisitions? Dennis Muilenburg : Julie, our strategy and our position has not changed. When we look at uses of cash we consistently see our priorities as being first most important news is organic investment. And we are making good use of that today . We are bringing more innovation to the marketplace today than we ever have and that spans our entire business not to leave out or our defense business, it certainly includes things like the 787, the 737 MAX, 377X, but it also includes investments that we're making in programs like TX, our satellites business, the autonomous systems that we're developing. So we are making organic investments across the board that's still our number one use of cash and that's what the purpose about innovating our competition. Secondly, we're going to continue to return cash to our shareholders. And approximately 100% of free cash flow being returned through repurchases and dividends continues to be our second priority. Third is inorganic investments and we don't see a need to change that strategy. We're going to continue to look for bolt-on opportunities things that complement our organic investment, but our best most efficient use of capital is our organic investment machine. That is a well tested, well honed machine one that's producing real growth and we complement it with our M&A actions. And we're going to be focused on growing our services business and targeted verticals and those are areas where we have made investments in the past and will continue to make inorganic investments and we see those as been complimentary as we build out vertical capabilities with lifecycle value. So that's our strategy going forward. Operator : Our next question if from Alwyn Scott with Reuters . Please go ahead. Alwyn Scott : So Boeing has done a lot to restructure, downsize its workforce, reduce production costs. Does Boeing\u2019s size and structure now properly match the revenue and demand that you see or if not how do you think about what more needs to be done? And I'm not thinking about incremental, I'm thinking more about sort of large structural moves. Dennis Muilenburg : You bet. In terms of our business structure, obviously the big move we just made to stand up are integrated services business was a major structural move and we're very pleased with the three business unit structure that we now have. We think that's the right framework for future growth. Now within that we need to be driving competitiveness every day and we're going to continue to be relentless on that front. And just a reminder, our cost structure is much more than headcount. We're looking at all dimensions of our cost structure, this includes our supply chain and includes every category of overhead, includes efficiency both inside and outside. And we're going to be relentless on driving our cost structure down and gaining efficiencies so we can fuel the future. They said before our number one use of cash and what we create as we drive competitiveness is to invest in future innovation. And that's really important investment not only in products and services, it's also in our manufacturing and design systems, it's in our support and services systems. And it's in our people and we're focused on making all of those investments for the future. This is not work that we're ever going to be finished with. This is a relentless effort to drive competitiveness to fuel our future innovation. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to Jon Ostrower with CNN. Please go ahead. Jon Ostrower : Couple of questions. First is on CapEx and how it relates to M&A. You kind of think about the spending you want to put forth as far as your business plan goes. How much are you weighing the existing infrastructure that you have in factory space and current investments as it relates to what you can use for M&A whether it's Composite Wing Center, existing infrastructure in Everett like 787 line and also availability in Charleston and St. Louis. How do you look at that and kind of continuing the M&A thought. You put out a forecast this week that calls for 637 new \u2013 637,000 new pilots over the next 20 years. How much of M&A sizing and the need for an aircraft like that. It relates not only to the congestion at airports, but also a long-term expectation about the availability of pilots and the need to fly larger aircraft if they're not available. Is the pilot shortage a real threat here and is the M&A strategy partially in response to that? Dennis Muilenburg : I'll take the second one, but Greg why don\u2019t you start with the one question. Greg Smith : Look Jon, I think just like any good business discipline and decision you look at capability, you look at capacity and then you look at affordability. And all that will be taken into consideration when we look at the M&A with obviously a clear eye towards winning in the marketplace and how do you do that in the most efficient effective way possible. So basically everything would be considered just like again any good business decision you're going to look at all your alternatives, taking in all those three elements into account. And then make a good business decision at the end of it. So that's what will be embedded into the M&A business case as we think about how we mature that going forward. Dennis Muilenburg : Exactly. And then Jon, on your question about the pilots and demand for the future. We are taking a very hard look at this growing marketplace. This is sort of in the good problem to have category. But as the world needs 41,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years as we see traffic growing at 6% to 7%, 8% so far this year, clearly fleet growth is right in front of us, we're projecting that the global aircraft fleet after you account for replacements will roughly double in size over the next 20 years. That's going to drive pilot demand. And so we're working very closely with our customers on how do we help create that pipeline by the way that affects both our commercial business and our defense business where there is a need for future pilots. Some of it is in how we design our future airplanes, how we improve training efficiency, how we allow for rapid ramp up in talent. Part of our services business is going to be related to improved pilot training and efficiency for our customers. I wouldn\u2019t say that the launch of the middle of the market airplane as we consider our options there is really driven by the potential for pilot shortage, it's really more driven by just the overall market demand. We see traffic growing. We see route structures evolving. There are new point to point regional structures that may require a new airplane. If that's really the basis for the 2000 to 4000 potential market that we see. Now we\u2019ll have to be mindful of pilot shortages as a potential risk area. But we don't see that as the driver for going to a middle of the market airplane, middle of the market is really more driven by market growth and customer needs. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to let Dominic Gates with The Seattle Times. Please go ahead. Dominic Gates : Staying on me the M&A and the next new airplane. You did despite Greg's answer just now, you did during the previous talk about increasing vertical depth, the potential for doing more propulsion work, more wing work. I'm just wondering how significant a shift you see there. Of course historically every new plan that Boeing has come up with has had more buy in it than make in it. The proportion - the make buy proportion has shifted towards buying and like 15 years ago Boeing was talking about getting out of the parts business, but here you're now talking about increasing vertical depth. How significant a shift might we see in that next new airplane in terms of the make-buy proportion. And also how do you see employment within Boeing being affected by that because we're seeing a lot of jobs lost here in Washington State. How do you see that near term as well. Dennis Muilenburg : Dominic, to your first question we do see increasing focus on vertical content and lifecycle value going forward. I think you've seen some of that evolution reflected in the 777 X compared to the 787 where we brought more of the engineering back in-house. We think that's a more efficient way to design and engineer for the future. Composite wing manufacturing, complex composite manufacturing is a core capability that we've brought back in-house and invested propulsion integration as you noted. We see selective areas in actuation systems as a place where we want to invest for the future. We noted the ramp up that we just announced in both Portland and Sheffield associated to 737 and 777 actuation. There are several other categories of capability that we're looking at. And where we can build vertical capability that adds value, takes risk out and adds lifecycle value as we look through the services lines. Those areas we're going to invest. So I think you will see an evolution that's more towards additional vertical content with a clear focus on lifecycle value addition as an evaluation criteria around that. And if we decide to proceed with middle of the market airplane that philosophy, that strategy will be reflected in the airplane. Now in terms of your question around employment, as you know we\u2019ve had to continue to make some tough decisions as we're driving competitiveness. We're continuing to do that in a way that is very respectful of our employees and our people and where we can voluntary layoffs and other actions that are frankly good for our people and good for our company. And this is a continuous process. So I'm not going to try to give you any long-term trend or numbers prediction. Just knowing that we're going to continue to drive competitiveness because we're going to invest in innovation for the future. And ultimately that investment is good for our company, it's good for our people, it's good for growth of our business and it's going to provide value for customers. And that's our headset as we make these decisions, we're going to do the right thing to grow the company and ultimately that'll be good for people as well. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to Peggy Hollinger with Financial Times. Please go ahead. Peggy Hollinger : Just a couple of slightly different questions, not about the performance. We've noticed the controversy over the head of the Ex-Im Bank. And I just wondered whether you think perhaps given that controversy, it would be a good idea to have another nominee or do you think you can work with this nominee. And just a little bit of a statement on where we are with regard to the Ex-Im Bank. And if you could update us a bit on Iran please. Dennis Muilenburg : Yes, on both of those, first, on Ex-Im Bank, again we continue to believe it is fundamentally important that we get Ex-Im Bank up and running and fully reauthorized. There are about $30 billion of deal opportunities in the pipeline that when the bank is fully up and running again can be executed and will create American manufacturing jobs. And those aren't just Boeing deals, those are spread across all of the industry. So fundamentally as a country we need to get the Ex-Im Bank back up and fully running. Now part of that process, the nomination process to fill the Board seats is crucial. We do think it's important that we have a Chairman of the Ex-Im Bank who supports the banks mission. And as various candidates are being evaluated that's an important lens to be looking through. And we know there are a number of nominations inflow right now, we're encouraged that there is action being taken. We are also urging Congress and the administration to move forward with finalizing those nominations, filling the board positions and getting the bank back up and running at full speed. That will be good for the economy and good for American manufacturing jobs. On your on your second question around Iran, we are continuing to make steady progress on that front. Again, all of this is being governed by US government policy and we're staying completely within that licensing process, stepping our way through the gates. That is moving forward on track and we still expect to begin delivering airplanes next year. Troy Lahr : Operator, we have time for one last question. Operator : And that will be from Gillian Rich with IBD. Please go ahead. Gillian Rich : My question is kind of a follow up to an earlier one on what specific changes in the airline industry would you say are driving these requirements for this new kind of mid market plane, like a new design, what specific things that your customers kind of been telling you about? Dennis Muilenburg : When we take a look at the market for this airplane again, we see route structures around the world continuing to evolve as general passenger traffic growth is occurring. In particular, new regional structures, point to point connectivity that's in this 4,000 to 5,000 nautical mile range airplanes that are in 220 to 270 passenger range. That's the ballpark that we're looking at and discussing with customers. So this is really reflects the fact that the overall market is growing and these new regional point to point structures are evolving and those new regional structures aren't served well by existing airplanes in general. And so there is an opportunity here to add value for our customers. That's the real focus here and in order to have a airplane that could serve that marketplace, it needs to have some of the efficiencies in terms of turn times that you get with a wide body and it also needs to have the economic efficiencies that you get with a narrow body airplane. So hence sort of a hybrid approach to what that design might be. Those are the details that we're working through with our customers right now. Troy Lahr : That concludes our call. Again for members of the media if you have further questions please use our media relations team phone number at 312-554-2002. Thank you.",

Operator : Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analyst and media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcast live over the Internet. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Ms. Maurita Sutedja, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Ms. Sutedja, please go ahead. Maurita B. Sutedja - The Boeing Co.: Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. I'm Maurita Sutedja, and with me today is Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Enterprise Performance and Strategy. After management comments, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. We have provided detailed financial information in today's press release and you can follow the broadcast and presentation through our website at boeing.com. Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals in our discussions today are likely to involve risk, which is detailed in our News Release, various SEC filings, and the forward-looking statement disclaimer in the presentation. In addition, we refer you to our Earnings Release and presentations for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook. Now I will turn the call over to Dennis Muilenburg. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Thank you, Maurita, and good morning. My comments today will focus on our third quarter results, the health of our business environment, and our performance and growth plans. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook. Also we are for the first time providing the operating performance and outlook across what is now our three major business segments : Commercial Airplanes, Defense, Space & Security, and Global Services. With that, let's move to slide 2. Thanks to the dedicated efforts of our employees throughout our company, Boeing delivered third quarter 2017 financial results that included record commercial aircraft deliveries, solid operating performance, and robust cash generation. During the quarter, we generated $3.4 billion of operating cash and repurchased $2.5 billion of Boeing stock. We also paid $855 million in dividends, reflecting a 30% increase in dividends per share from last year. We continued to deliver on our commitment to returning cash to shareholders, while investing in innovation, future growth, and our people. Revenue in the third quarter was $24.3 billion, reflecting planned production rates and mix of commercial and defense deliveries. Core earnings per share of $2.72 were driven by solid execution, which more than offset higher spending on the KC-46 Tanker program, which I will touch on shortly. Based on our confidence in the business, we are raising full-year guidance for operating cash flow and earnings per share. Greg will provide additional details in his comments. Now let's look at the third quarter operating performance for our businesses. First, let me spend a moment on the KC-46 Tanker program. The flight test airplanes continue to perform well and have surpassed 2,000 total flight hours. And recently we successfully completed electromagnetic effects testing and the first tanker-to-tanker refueling. However, the program did see additional cost growth due to incorporating changes into initial production aircraft, as we progress through late-stage testing and the certification process. We have not experienced any new significant technical discoveries. And we continue to make steady progress closing out technical risk on the path to final certification and to delivering the first 18 tankers next year. We remain very confident in the long-term value of this franchise. Now onto Commercial Airplanes. For the quarter, BCA generated revenue of $15 billion on a record 202 deliveries. Operating margins of 9.9% reflect higher 787 margins and strong operating performance on production programs, partially offset by cost growth on the KC-46 Tanker program. Continued healthy sales activity contributed to 117 net new airplane orders worth $7 billion during the quarter, adding to our robust backlog that stands at nearly 5,700 airplanes. Key commercial milestones in the quarter included the 737 program successfully transitioning to the higher production rate of 47 per month, along with the continued smooth introduction of the 737 MAX. We have now integrated the MAX into two of the three 737 production lines. On the 787 program, after carefully assessing market conditions, recent orders, and our robust backlog, we confirmed our plan to increase the 787 production rate from 12 to 14 airplanes per month in 2019. The 787 Dreamliner family also surpassed 1 million passenger flights, reaching that mark faster than any other twin-aisle aircraft in commercial aviation history. Also in that quarter, we started building the first complete 777X wing for structural testing, as this exciting new development program remains on track. Now over to Defense, Space & Security. BDS reported third quarter revenue of $5.5 billion with operating margins at 10.2%, reflecting solid operating performance and mix, partially offset by cost growth on the tanker program. Across our Defense, Space & Security portfolio, we continue to provide the best value for our customers through innovative solutions, as evidenced by our $6 billion in new orders booked during the quarter. Those orders included an initial contract award for the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent program, an important future franchise, and a preliminary design contract for the next Air Force One. Additionally, Saudi Arabia became the 20th global Chinook operator, as Boeing received a contract for the first eight CH-47F aircraft. We also captured an award for 14 Super Hornet aircraft for the U.S. Navy, contracts for our autonomous Echo Voyager underwater vehicle, and an order from SES for seven medium-earth orbit satellites. Key milestones for BDS included the successful flight test of an unarmed Boeing-built Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile and the Super Hornet and Growler family reaching 10 million flight hours, demonstrating their proven performance and value to our customers. Turning to our newest segment, Global Services began operating in the third quarter, as we strengthened our focus on capturing value over the lifecycle of our products. BGS reported revenue of $3.6 billion with operating margins of 14.2%, reflecting product and services mix. During the quarter, BGS won new business that highlights the value that we bring to our broad range of commercial and government customers. These included awards from the Defense Logistics Agency to provide spare parts for the F-18, and the Italian Air Force to provide performance-based logistics for their KC-767A tanker. In addition, our Boeing AnalytX portfolio has more than 200 contracts year-to-date to provide digital solutions to our airline customers. And more than 40 commercial airline customers have signed up for our digital navigation applications in the quarter. Currently, more than 60 airlines operating more than 2,500 aircraft are enrolled in our Global Fleet Care program, which offers comprehensive maintenance, inventory management, and engineering services. One of our largest digital offerings, Airplane Health Management, allows airlines to make better and faster data-driven maintenance decisions using the digital information flowing off their airplanes. Currently, more than 90 customers with nearly 4,400 airplanes are enrolled in this subscription program. Overall for the quarter, we delivered solid execution across the company, generated strong cash flow, and returned significant cash to shareholders. And we positioned the company to capture more profitable growth with the successful launch of our dedicated services business. With that, let's turn to the business environment on slide 3. We continue to see healthy demand in our commercial, defense, space, and services markets. In the Commercial Airplanes market, airlines continue to report solid profits. And passenger traffic growth continues to outpace GDP, with traffic growth of 8% through August. Also, cargo traffic is experiencing a healthy recovery, with 10% freight traffic growth over the first eight months of the year. We've also seen, over the past few years, an evolution in key market dynamics that we believe, in the aggregate, are driving greater stability and far less cyclicality for our industry. We see more diverse and balanced demand from a geographical perspective, as well as across the spectrum of airline business models. There's also more balanced demand between new airplanes needed for fleet growth and those replacing older aircraft. And we are seeing more consistent and stable customer purchasing patterns. Our 20-year commercial market outlook forecasts demand for approximately 41,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years, comprised of more than 29,500 aircraft in the narrow body market and approximately 9,100 aircraft in the wide body market. This long-term demand, combined with healthy market conditions and a robust backlog, provides a solid foundation for our planned production rates. Turning to our product segments, starting with the narrow body. Our planned production rate for the 737, going to 57 per month in 2019, is based on our backlog of over 4,400 aircraft and a production skyline that is oversold through the end of the decade. We continue to assess the upward market pressure on the 737 production rate. In the wide body segment, we continue to see varying levels of near-term demand across aircraft models. However, we have seen steady orders and have high confidence in a meaningful increase in wide body replacement demand early next decade. For the current generation 777, we have 101 orders in backlog. We continue to make progress on filling the remaining 777 production slots, as highlighted by the recent order from Aeroflot for six 777s. And we also recently firmed up additional customer commitments into orders, and these will be reflected in our next backlog update. As we have previously mentioned, the 777 production rate moved to five per month starting in August of 2017, per our plan. This will result in 777 deliveries of approximately 3.5 per month in 2018 and 2019, as we transition production to the 777X. At that rate, and with the existing orders and commitments in place, we are in an oversold position in 2018, and approximately 90% sold out in 2019. And while we still have more work to do to fill the remaining 777 production slots, based on the current environment and our ongoing sales campaigns, we believe the rate plan we put in place establishes a floor for the program and supports our production bridge from the current 777 to the 777X. As we look forward to the 777X, we have a strong foundation of 340 777X orders and commitments that support our plan for ramping up production and delivery of this new aircraft. Our 787 Dreamliner program also stands on a strong foundation for long-term production, with nearly 700 firm orders in our backlog. Turning to Defense, Space & Security, we continue to see solid demand for our major platforms and programs. While the fiscal year 2018 U.S. federal budget has not been finalized, congressional support for our key BDS programs is strong. We've seen support for funding levels above the president's budget request for a number of programs, including the F-18, CH-47 Chinook, Ground-Based Midcourse Defense, AH-64 Apache, P-8 Poseidon, and others. International demand for our defense and space offerings remains high as well, in particular for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters, and satellites. We are making progress towards completing a healthy mix of previously announced international sales, including 36 F-15 fighter aircraft for Qatar, 28 F-18 fighter aircraft for Kuwait, up to 40 more Chinook helicopters for Saudi Arabia, and the final C-17 for India. Our investment in future growth and new sales continues in areas that are priorities for our customers, such as commercial derivatives, rotorcraft, satellites, human space exploration, and autonomous systems. As part of these efforts, we are leveraging capabilities and technologies from across the Boeing enterprise for winning future franchise programs such as the T-X trainer, Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent, unmanned carrier based MQ-25A, and JSTARS recapitalization, along with other important opportunities. Turning to the services sector, we see the $2.6 trillion services market over the next 10 years as a significant growth opportunity for our company. Combining the key capabilities of our former Commercial Aviation Services and Global Services and Support groups, BGS is a dedicated services business focused on the needs of government, space, and commercial customers worldwide. Our objective is to deliver agile, cost-competitive solutions to our customers so they can reduce costs, drive efficiency, and ultimately optimize their operations. Global Services will continue to accelerate our capabilities across all Boeing services and support areas, from our parts, maintenance, modifications, logistics support, and training business, to strengthening our data analytics and information-based offerings. We plan to grow this business by leveraging the joint infrastructure of our commercial and government businesses, realizing cost savings to improve competitiveness, building vertical capabilities with life cycle value, and expanding our data and analytics offerings. We will also pursue key investments to expand our services portfolio. Our service expertise, the global reach of our business, and our strong customer partnerships, have us well-positioned to compete and win in this important sector. In summary, with growing markets and opportunities ahead, our teams remain intensely focused on growth, innovation, and accelerating productivity to fuel investments in our future. One such investment announced earlier this month is our planned acquisition of Aurora Flight Sciences, a world-class innovator that specializes in autonomous technologies to enable advanced robotic aircraft in the future. Other leading-edge investments are being accelerated through our HorizonX unit, such as the investment in Near Earth Autonomy announced last week. We see these investments as strategic complements to our existing capabilities across our businesses. With that, Greg, over to you for the financial results. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Thanks, Dennis, and good morning, everybody. Let's turn to slide 4, and we'll discuss our third quarter results. Third quarter revenue increased to $24.3 billion while core operating earnings per share were $2.72, driven by solid operating performance across the portfolio, which more than offset the impacts of the cost growth on the tanker program. And just as a reminder, the prior-year quarter included $0.98 per share impact for favorable tax items. Let's now discuss Commercial Airplanes on slide 5. Our Commercial Airplanes business reported revenue of $15 billion, reflecting planned production rates and delivery mix. BCA operating margins increased to 9.9% on higher 787 margins and strong execution on production programs, again partially offset by the $256 million pre-tax charge on the KC-46 Tanker program. Third quarter operating margins, excluding the tanker charge, were 11.6%. As Dennis mentioned, BCA captured $7 billion of net orders during the third quarter and backlog remains very strong, $412 billion and nearly 5,700 aircraft, equating to more than seven years of production. On the 787 program we've delivered 35 aircraft in the quarter and booked 83 net orders year to date. And additionally, we extended the 787 accounting block by 100 units. This resulted in higher margins on the program and moderates the decline of deferred production balance, which was down $513 million in the quarter. As we previously discussed, the moderation of the decline in deferred production balance is an outcome of the accounting block extension and has no impact on the cash profile of the program. Our teams remain very focused on improving 787 cash generation, driven by favorable delivery mix, additional supplier step-down pricing, and a relentless effort to further drive internal productivity and quality. Let's now turn to Defense, Space & Security results on slide 6. Third quarter revenue in our Defense business was $5.5 billion, reflecting lower planned deliveries and mix. BDS operating margins increased to 10.2% on solid operating performance and mix, offset by a $73 million pre-tax tanker charge. The third quarter operating margins excluding the tanker charge were 11.6%. And again, as Dennis mentioned earlier, Defense, Space & Security won key contract awards worth $6 billion in the quarter. Our backlog stands at $46 billion with 35% from international customers. Let's now move to Boeing Global Services results on slide 7. In the third quarter, Global Services revenue increased to $3.6 billion, reflecting growth in commercial parts, partially offset by the timing of government services revenue. BGS operating margins of 14.2% reflect solid core operating performance combined with parts and services mix. Based on year-to-date performance, BGS is on track to hit full year operating margins of between 15% and 15.5%. BGS continues to focus on expanding its global footprint and providing value to its customers by accelerating our capabilities in parts, engineering, maintenance, modification, training businesses, and digital aviation and analytic offerings. Let's now turn to cash flow on the next slide, please. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was strong at $3.4 billion, driven by solid operating performance across the company and favorable timing of receipts and expenditures. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.5 billion of Boeing stock and paid $855 million in dividends. Our continued balanced cash deployment efforts reflect our ongoing confidence in our long-term outlook for the business. Since the end of 2012, we've returned approximately $40 billion to our shareholders through dividend and share repurchase, while investing substantially in products, services, and our people. We continue to expect operating cash flow to grow annually through the end of the decade. And we remain committed to returning approximately 100% of free cash flow to investors. Returning cash to shareholders, along with combining investments to support future growth again remains the priority for us going forward. Moving now to cash and debt balances on slide 9. We ended the quarter with $10 billion of cash and marketable securities, combined with stable debt levels and credit ratings. Our cash position provides us flexibility to invest in innovation and profitable growth opportunities, while also returning value back to shareholders. Let's now turn to slide 10, and we'll discuss our outlook for 2017. As a result of our strong performance, we're increasing our full-year operating cash flow guidance by $250 million to now be approximately $12.5 billion for the year. We are reaffirming our revenue guidance of $90.5 billion to $92.5 billion. And we are increasing our core EPS guidance by $0.10 to now be between $9.90 and $10.10 on lower-than-expected tax rate. As a result of our new service business segment, we are revising our segment guidance. We expect full-year 2017 Commercial Airplane revenue to be between $55.5 billion and $56.5 billion with operating margins being between 9% and 9.5%. Defense, Space & Security revenue for 2017 is expected to be between $20.5 billion and $21.5 billion with operating margins greater than 10.5%. And finally, we expect Global Services revenue for 2017 to be between $14 billion and $14.5 billion with operating margins being between 15% and 15.5%. We feel good about the strong finish to 2017. And as we look to 2018, we continue to have confidence in our growing revenue as well as earnings and cash. And we'll provide full 2018 guidance during our January earnings call. Longer term, we are aggressively driving productivity through the business to maximize profitability as we strive to continue to improve cash generation and to achieve mid-teen operating margins by the end of the decade. In summary, our core operating engine continues to deliver strong results and increasing momentum for our company. We remain focused on ensuring the continued seamless ramp up of Boeing Global Services and leveraging our new three business unit strategy in the marketplace. We will also continue to expand our efforts in driving key cross enterprise levers to improve productivity and affordability and accelerating innovation across the company, all with an eye towards profitable growth in our second century. With that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: All right. Thank you, Greg. With a strong three quarters behind us, our team remains focused on further driving both growth and productivity. In addition to the stabilizing commercial airplane market dynamics I mentioned earlier in my remarks, we've also taken our own actions to reduce cyclicality in our business, including remaining disciplined in our production rate decisions, de-risking our pension liabilities, strategically phasing our research and development spending, creating labor stability with long-term contracts, and expanding our services business, which is also less cyclical. As the world's largest commercial airplane maker, our nation's second-largest defense contractor, a global leader in space flight, and a growing force in lifecycle services, we are as optimistic about our future and the future of our industry as we have ever been. Our priorities going forward are to leverage our unique One Boeing advantages, continue building strength on strength to deliver and improve on our commitments, and to stretch beyond those plans and sharpen and accelerate our pace of progress on key enterprise growth and productivity efforts. Achieving these objectives will require a clear and consistent focus on profitable ramp up in our commercial airplane production, continuing to strengthen our defense and space business, delivering on our development programs, growing our integrated services business and leveraging the power of our three business unit strategy, driving world-class levels of productivity and performance throughout the enterprise to fund our investments in innovation and growth, and continue to develop and maintain the best team and talent in the industry. All of which positions Boeing for continued market leadership, sustained top and bottom line growth, and to create increasing value for our shareholders, our customers, our employees, and our other stakeholders. With that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator : Our first question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company, LLC: Yes. Thank you very much. So R&D was a little bit lighter than expected in the quarter. And you've taken your guide for the year down to $3.4 billion. That's down $200 million. Why was it light? And what does that imply for R&D going forward? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yes. Hey. Good morning, Cai. Yeah. It was two things, really. I mean some of that's timing, just on 777X, which continues to make good progress. So we got \u2013 but we got a little bit of timing there and performance. So it's really a mix as we look at through the balance of the year, our expenditure profile. As we look into 2018, we should see moderate levels of R&D from what you're going to see this year. So obviously this has been something that we've been laser focused on around efficiency. At the same time, optimizing our timing of our spend across the enterprise. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company, LLC: Thank you. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Thanks, Cai. Operator : Our next question is from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Morning, gentlemen. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Morning. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Morning, Rajeev. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: As we look at the breakout of BGS that you provided today, the year-over-year trends on margins and revenues don't really jump off the page versus some of the things that we've talked about. Can you just help us reconcile that with sort of the growth in opportunity that we've all been looking for going forward? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yes, Rajeev. I think when you take a look at third quarter, obviously this is the first time we're reporting separately in those three operating segments. And the services business that you see reflected there is in line with our expectations. It's a good, solid foundation to start. Obviously, we're making a number of investments to help grow our portfolio going forward. As I outlined in my opening comments, we see the services market of about $2.6 trillion over the next 10 years as very attractive. We're investing in our core businesses around parts and modification capabilities. We're also investing in new analytics capabilities. And we're making some very good progress there on building that platform of products and services. And we expect to translate that into long term top line and bottom line growth. In our current portfolio we're investing in a number of areas that allow us to grow our proprietary parts business, low-cost mods and upgrades, our training businesses. You saw some of the progress we've made with our airline customers on a number of those fronts. Global Fleet Care solutions and performance-based logistics solutions in particular have a lot of strength right now. We're also investing in supply chain capabilities, digital aviation and analytics capabilities. I think a good sign post that you saw was so far this year more than 200 orders in our new AnalytX portfolio. More than 40 airlines signing up for digital solutions in the quarter. So a lot of good momentum as we build a foundation for growth. And we see this as a great growth opportunity for our company. And by getting all of our efforts aligned under a single business unit we expect that to accelerate our growth, both top and bottom line, going forward. And we expect services to be accretive to the bottom line as a result. Operator : Our next question is from Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead. Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Hi. Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Dennis, I was wondering if you could spend a few minutes kind of giving us your most updated thoughts on the narrow body market, particularly the 100 to, let's call it, 140, 150 seat market in light of some of the recent competitive dynamics that have gone on with the CSeries and Airbus. Just remind us kind of your view overall of that market from a size perspective? ?How Boeing might look to address that market going forward? And whether this move really makes a difference at all Thanks. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Hey, Jason, great question. First of all, we continue to see the narrow body marketplace as a very attractive, very strong market. We've said that we're seeing strong passenger growth characteristics around the globe. We're seeing customer diversification. Our backlog is very strong. We have laid out a current market outlook of roughly 41,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years. And roughly 29,000 of those are in that narrow body marketplace. We're continuing to ramp up very significantly on our production lines. As you know, we just moved to 47 aircraft a month on the 737 production line this quarter. You didn't hear a lot of news around that, because it went very smoothly. And that's credit to our team for the way they've ramped up the production there. We're stepping up to 52 a month next year, 57 a month in 2019. As I said, we're sold out through the end of the decade. We continue to see upward market pressure on narrow body production rates. So it's a very healthy marketplace. We have a very healthy production system. And the MAX ramp up within that 737 production system has been very smooth and strong. We've delivered 30 MAXs now. We expect MAX deliveries to make up 10% to 15% of the 737 deliveries this year. I think that's also a very encouraging sign that we're bringing the latest, leading edge technology and innovation to the narrow body marketplace. And production ramp up is going very smoothly. We have high confidence in our strategy, high confidence in our product line. The MAX family is winning in the marketplace. In that 100 to 150 seat category that you mentioned, the [737] MAX 7 is performing strongly. And again, as most of our customers look at family of narrow body products, the MAX family is the strongest family in the marketplace. So we're going to continue to fuel that effort. Some of the recent developments in the marketplace are not surprising to us. As we've said before, it's an attractive market with a lot of global competitors. We like competition. It makes us better. We're confident we can win. But it's important that everybody plays by the same rules. And we're going to continue to invest to win in the narrow body marketplace. Operator : Our next question is from Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Morning, Rob. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Dennis, on the heels of that, you mentioned the [737] MAX 7 targets below 150 [seats], but not a lot below 150. You don't really have a dedicated product there. Airbus, and I think Bombardier before them, have talked about 6,000 aircraft over, I guess a 20-year period, in the below 150-seat market. Strategically, what do you do? Do you want to get into that space? You already talked about the larger number you have in the space that you target, which is 150 and up. But is there an opportunity maybe for you to have a joint venture or a partnership with somebody else? Or to \u2013 does this change your product development strategy on narrow body for the next go round, maybe having two programs, one smaller and one larger? How do we wrap our heads around that? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, hey, Rob. First of all, go back to the fundamentals here. Again, we have high confidence in our strategy. We've laid out a game plan. Our product lineup in the narrow body arena is centered around the MAX airplane and smoothly introducing that into our fleets. You can see the strength of the ramp up that we have planned for those production lines. It's very important that we focus on that core effort and the successful implementation of the MAX family. With 4,400 aircraft in backlog, we're very confident in the position we have and the fact that we're oversold on our production line capacity. We have lots of growth opportunity, both top and bottom line, in our core narrow body business. We have a number of customers who operate 737s today who still have not made their next-generation selection. So, additional upside on MAX orders clearly ahead of us. Now, along with that, we continue to evaluate all of our strategic options, as we always have. And as I said earlier, recent changes in the marketplace, the discussions between Airbus and Bombardier, don't change our plans. We have a strong strategy in place. We'll continue to look at our strategic alternatives. But we don't need to change the path that we're on. We're very confident we're going to continue to look at ways to accelerate our core business, grow organically as our primary growth engine. That will continue to be our growth engine. As we said before, we have clear priorities on usage of cash. Our first use of cash is invest organically. Secondly, returning value to our shareholders, roughly 100% of free cash flow. And then thirdly, mergers, acquisitions, partnerships, that complement our organic strategy. We're going to continue down that path. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. Operator : Next we'll go to Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : Hey. Good morning, gentlemen. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Hey. Good morning. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Morning, Carter. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : Greg, just wondering. You had the \u2013 first, on the unit versus program differences were, I think, negative for the first time on a clean basis since you started delivering the 787 a few years back. And so I wondered if you could give us some color on the moving parts there. Obviously, I think the 787 makes sense. But really the 737, with the early MAXs and the lower 777 volumes, what you saw there in that line, any color would be helpful. And also, away from the 787 block extension that you highlighted, did you have any other block extensions or changes in booking rates on the other BCA programs? Thanks. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Yes. Maybe I'll address that one first, Carter. So on 737, we did have a block extension, 200 aircraft; 767, we also had one at 12 aircraft; and then as you mentioned, 787 at 100. And then when I look across the booking rates on the production programs at BCA, frankly, just due to good solid performance, we had increase on margin across the board on all of our programs. So again great, great performance across all elements of the portfolio in BCA this quarter. Yeah. On the unit versus program it \u2013 as you know, quarter-to-quarter, there's a lot of mix going on here between whether we have early builds or a customer mix or early entry, I'll say, into service aircraft. And this quarter was really, I'll say, kind of pretty even, as far as no early builds. And didn't have, I'll say, some of the nuances that we've had from quarter to quarter over, again, customer mix or early introduction. So, good solid quarter all around again on unit-by-unit performance, again across all the BCA platforms, and also great performance on the period expense. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : Yeah so that \u2013 go ahead. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Our investment in productivity initiatives and getting that down to the team level on the production factory floors, you can really see the momentum of that investment. And it's showing in the unit cost reduction. And we're making steady progress across all the production lines. And that unit cost focus really drives the right behavior. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Yeah. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : So it's fair to say that there wasn't any big offset. We should assume that the... Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: No. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : ...non-787 production programs had very small if any differences? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Correct. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : Great. Thanks, guys. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Morning, Noah. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Morning. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Dennis, at the Investor Day, you sounded relatively enthusiastic on actual change to sequestration, not just for 2018, but on a multi-year basis. Wondering if you could update us on how that feeling has changed, if at all? And specific to 2018, you mentioned the budget process. If you have a view on sort of milestones there, or where you think investment growth could shake out? And then, as it flows through into your business, do you expect BDS to return to growth on a full year basis as you move into 2018? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: You bet. Hey, Noah, on your first question, if we take a look at the overall defense marketplace, again, an attractive market for the long run. Here in the U.S. with the defense budget, we do see momentum towards increasing the defense budget. Now obviously, the process of getting through the budget resolutions and the FY 2018 budget, we're still in the midst of that process. But the president's budget request shows an increase of roughly 10% over the current BCA [Budget Control Act] caps that are represented through sequestration. We're seeing support on the [Capitol] Hill, and from both parties, in terms of finding an alternative to sequestration. And I think as you see, the realities of the security environment around the world, the need for national security, growing momentum for a strong and growing long term defense budget. And I do think that's important for the country. And we're seeing strong political support with that framework in mind going forward. So I remain hopeful that we'll see an alternative to sequestration. And that that will translate into a long term stable defense budget with some upside to the current budget. And I think when you look at specifics around Boeing programs within that, again we see strong support for those core programs. And I mentioned a few of them, F-18 fighters, Apache and Chinook helicopters, the V-22, the P-8, frankly, the tanker program. As we transition to production, we see some upside on that program. So across our portfolio \u2013 satellites as well \u2013 we see strength there. And so that gives us some momentum for growing top line in our defense budget through the end of the decade. It'll be modest growth but we see some opportunity to grow the top line of the business. As you can see, the team has been doing a great job of bringing that to the bottom line as well. And then additive to that is we continue to see strong international demand. And it's important to note that about a third of our backlog is \u2013 of our defense backlog is outside of the U.S. And we continue to see robust demand around the world for our defense products. So that combination gives us strong prospects for our defense business. And that will also dovetail with growing our services business. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Should we expect BDS to grow top line in 2018? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, we expect it to be flattish. But the trajectory that you're going to see over the next few years towards the end of the decade is going to be flat to moderate growth, top line, and as we've talked before. And it will be dependent on what happens with the U.S. defense budget. And as momentum grows on the defense budget, you'll see that reflected directly in our defense business. But we see that as a solid core business that's stable to moderate growth through the decade. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Morning. Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I was hoping, Greg, you could just clarify on Kai's question. I think you said moderate for 2018 R&D. I just wasn't clear if that's moderate expenditure or moderate growth. The question I had for you also, Greg, was on the deferred production decline. And obviously because of the block extension, it's probably masking the improvement that you saw on a unit cost basis. And just kind of back of the envelope, it looks like the unit cost per aircraft probably improved about a couple million dollars a copy. Is that the right ballpark? And that's it for questions. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Yes. No, you're right on, Myles. I mean we saw improvement quarter over quarter on unit. And again I'd say that's coming from all aspects of the cost structure and the mix that we talked about. But I think \u2013 and certainly you got to see some of that when you were in Charleston, and you'll see that as well in Everett. And as we talked about getting that into the supply chain as well. And frankly, there's been some productivity best practices that we were able to show you in Charleston that we're trying to replicate across the company. So you saw some of that really coming to a level of maturity and hitting on those units in the quarter. So good performance. Obviously still a lot of work to go going forward, but we got some good momentum taking place there. On your first question, relatively stable from a dollar basis. That's the best way to think about it for 2018. But as I said earlier, that's been an area obviously that we've been spending a lot of time on, looking for efficiencies, not only within the program, but across the company. And across multitude of programs of where we can institute best practices and where we can really drive efficiency on the R&D as far as not obviously expenditure, but also from a timing perspective and bring these cycles down. And so there's still a lot of work again to be done there. But good progress so far year to date. And we'll expect that to continue next year. Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: You're welcome. Operator : Our next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much and good morning. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Morning, Seth. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Morning. Dennis, you spoke about upward pressure on 737 rates. I wonder if you could characterize that pressure a little bit more. Tell us kind of is it intensifying? What are the types of things that you're looking for before deciding whether you would increase that rate? And on the supply side, how you think the supply chain is coping with the ramp that's underway now? And even if you wanted to raise the rate, when they would be ready to handle it? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yes, Seth. We continue to remain very disciplined on those production rate decisions. As you know, that's an important part of how we're going to manage our backlog going forward. As I've characterized it earlier, we're in a very strong position on the 737 line now as we bring the MAX online. And the fact that our team smoothly cut to 47 a month this quarter I think is a great signpost and a great demonstration of our ability to ramp up and do it in a disciplined, methodical way. We're going to step up to 52 next year and then 57 in 2019. As I said, we're oversold against that profile. We continue to win campaigns. And so the general direction of the pressure is upward. And as always, we continue to evaluate additional rate increases as possibilities for the future. But all of that is done through the lens of ensuring we can do it in a good, disciplined, stable matter. Right now we're very focused on successfully ramping up to 57 a month, bringing our supply chain along. As I said, things are going well on the MAX. But we want to keep an eye on every dimension of our supply chain to make sure as we incrementally step up that we can bring this whole supply chain along with us. And that's where we're going to focus for right now. And as we consider alternatives and the upward market pressure, we'll be looking at it through that supply chain lens. That's certainly one of the key decision criteria associated with that. Market forces here are very clear. Passenger traffic trends are strong. As the MAX has been introduced, we're getting great feedback from our airline customers. Reliability of the jet, performance of the jet is outstanding. The value proposition for our customers is clear. So we expect to see continued upward pressure. And we're going to continue our disciplined production rate decision process. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Next we'll go to Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead. Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Dennis and Greg. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Morning, Peter. Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Dennis, just maybe a quick one. There's been a lot of talk about kind of the 767 production, just kind of as there's been some interim demand out there that may be looking for that market size. Can you give us an update on your thoughts on maybe taking production up there? Or what the demand looks like for 767? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: You bet, Peter. We continue to feel very strong about the 767 production line. As you note, we just recently stepped up to 2.5 a month on that production line. That's fueled by both commercial interest, including strong freighter interest, as well as the upcoming ramp-up on the tanker program. The fact that we have a combined line that can serve the needs of our commercial and military customers is a unique strength of that line. We continue to see broader customer interest. So we'll evaluate those opportunities. But the fact that we have a healthy production line, an airplane that provides a unique value proposition, both to commercial and military customers, and we don't see the 767 line as a sunsetting production line. It's a strong, long-term production line, and it does have some growth opportunities for us. If you look at that current market outlook that I mentioned earlier, sort of in that small widebody class, if you will, about 5,000-airplane market size out there is part of our current market outlook. So it's a substantial marketplace. The 767 is well positioned. And for some customers, it's a great value proposition. So we're investing in that line. And that's one of the reasons I have great confidence in the future of the tanker program as well as a decades long franchise for both production and support. Our ability to have a combined commercial/military line is a unique strength. Maurita B. Sutedja - The Boeing Co.: Thank you. Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks for the color. Maurita B. Sutedja - The Boeing Co.: Operator, we have room for one more question. Operator : And we'll go to Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Hey, Doug. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. I wanted to go back to Global Services. Now that it's set up, you've clearly got some very aggressive growth targets for the long term there. If you look at this, can you give us a sense, how would you \u2013 how do you split it between commercial and defense? And I'm thinking in terms of what the mix is today and revenues? Kind of how the margins compare? And where do you see the relative growth opportunities over the next five years or so? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah. Doug, right now, I won't give you the precise split here. But it's about a 50/50 split between our commercial and defense businesses. That comes and goes with timing of various contracts and how we provide service support to our customers. But we expect to see growth across both the commercial and defense dimensions of that business. And we expect it to be fairly balanced when we look at overall fleet positions that we have with our defense and commercial customers in their fleets around the world and the new investments we're making. And our ability to provide global support to customers on both defense and commercial provides some unique opportunities. It gives them a chance to combine infrastructure, warehousing, spares distribution. There's some real cost advantages to our customers when we can serve them across these commercial and defense sectors. So we're interested in maintaining that balance and critical mass. If you look at the components of that business, just to give you a rough breakdown today, things that are related to parts and supply chain are about 40% of that business, engineering mods and maintenance is about another 40%, and then items around digital aviation, analytics, and training is the remaining roughly 20% of the business. We're investing in all of those sectors. We think we have a lot of upside in our core parts business, as we rebuild intellectual property and some of our vertical capabilities. And we expect that to create lifecycle value. I would say in terms of percent growth opportunity, where we really see the greatest opportunity in our digital aviation and analytics portfolio. As we drive information-based solutions, you see some of the uptake in our customers on things like our AnalytX solutions with more than 200 new sales and portfolios distributed this year, our health monitoring services. As our airplanes, platforms, and spacecraft get smarter and smarter, there are more and more opportunities to leverage that data to provide value for our customers. And the key here around our whole services business growth is looking through that customer value lens. And we think we have a unique opportunity to provide that. And that fuels our growth expectations. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Are there timing differences when you look at some of the things you mentioned, where some of the growth \u2013 some areas you may expect to see the growth in the near term, in the next couple years? And some other ones may be very attractive but longer term? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah. I would say in the supply-chain area and mods and maintenance, those are critical mass capabilities that are in place today that we can grow rapidly, more rapidly in the near term. The digital solutions, while the rate of growth is strong in the near term, building that critical mass will take some time. And those are some areas where we're investing for the future as well, both organic and inorganic. And I expect those investments to pay off significantly in the longer term. So that's the way I would look at the balance. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that completes the analyst question and answer session. For members of the media . I will now return you to The Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Mr. Phil Musser, Senior Vice President of Communications. Mr. Musser, please go ahead. Phil Musser - The Boeing Co.: Thank you very much. We'll continue now with questions for Dennis and Greg. And so if you have any questions following this part of the session, please make sure to call our Media Relations team at 312-544-2002 after this call. In the interest of time, operator, I think we're ready for the first question. And I just ask that folks limit their questions to one so that we can get to as many questions as possible in the time allotted. Operator, let's go ahead. Operator : And first go to Doug Cameron with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead. Doug Cameron - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.: Sorry, I just picked up the phone. Is it me? Phil Musser - The Boeing Co.: It is. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Hi, Doug. Doug Cameron - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.: Excellent. Sorry about that. Dennis, you've had six weeks to digest or at least work out what you might say more on industry consolidation and particularly following United Tech/Rockwell. At the time, you said \u2013 again, Boeing said you were ?skeptical that there were any benefits for the industry, for your customers, and I'm guessing by definition yourselves. So how has your thinking evolved there in the past six weeks? And how do you think you might react, given you'd previously flagged that you might seek to exercise contractual rights or follow regulatory paths, et cetera? So what's the thinking six weeks down the line? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, Doug, no significant change on that front. We've taken an initial look at the proposed deal. We remain skeptical. We continue to look at this through a customer value lens. And it's really important that as we see consolidations in our supply chain that those consolidations produce value for our customers and produce value for Boeing. And it's important for us to protect the health and diversity of that supply chain in the long term interest of our customer and our industry. And until proven otherwise, we still remain skeptical. And we do have tools related to contractual obligations and regulatory matters. And if necessary, we're able to leverage those tools and make use of them. We continue to get more details on the deal. But until we've been able to look at that in some more depth, we can't make any final decisions here. But just go back to the bottom line. This needs to produce value for our customers, value for the health of our supply chain. And we're skeptical until proven otherwise. Operator : Our next question is from Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg. Please go ahead. Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg LP : Oh, hi. Good morning, everyone. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Morning. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Hi, Julie. Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg LP : I just wanted to focus on tanker for a little bit. Have \u2013 what confidence do you have right now that the technical issues that have cropped up for the first 18 planes are now resolved? Is this the last charge that we can expect for that block? And what does Boeing need to do going forward to avoid a repeat of this with the next big defense aircraft program that it wins? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Julie, first of all on tanker, I think it's important again to put this in the context of the long term value proposition of this program. And we remain very confident there. As you know, the opportunity is measured in hundreds of aircraft. We expect this to be a long term production and support franchise, one that will add tremendous value for our customers. And the need for the new tankers is very clear. So the fundamentals of the program are strong, the long-term value proposition is very strong. Now it's been a challenging development program, as we've said all along. And we're not completely to the finish line yet, but we are clearly closing in. We've completed more than 2,000 hours of flight testing. We have six aircraft in the flight test program now. We have more than 30 aircraft that are flowing through our production system. I can tell you that the flight test aircraft are performing very well. We're about 80% complete with the flight testing required for initial delivery. And while we've had some issues that have occurred during flight tests that are normal to tanker testing, like the boom scraping issue that you've seen in the news, these are not unusual items. And I can tell you the feedback we've heard from the customers flying the airplanes is that the airplanes are flying well. And the controllability of the boom is excellent. And overall, the tanking capability of the airplane is going to provide great benefit to our war fighters and our service men and women. And we're going to continue to march through the remainder of the flight test program and finish up certification of the aircraft. The challenges we're having right now are related to just implementing final detailed changes on the aircraft to get them to a final certification standard. These are not unusual. But we do have a lot of airplanes flowing concurrently through the production system. So it's a matter of just working through those volumes of airplanes. Having been out on the tanker production line multiple times as recently as last week, I can tell you the airplanes are coming together very well. The first delivery tanker is out of the factory, it's through paint, it's through the fuel dock, and we're getting it prepared for final certification and delivery. And we'll deliver those first 18 aircraft in 2018. And then we'll move into the production program. So, work to go yet. We're not completely through the flight test program, but we're clearly closing in on delivery. Long term lessons here, to second part of your question. It's important, on these fixed price development programs, that we have firm and stable requirements up front. And an understanding when we get to the back end of these programs on certification, as we work through details of concurrent development and production. We still have some items to work through on how we do concurrency and do it efficiently. We're learning on that. And those lessons learned get applied to the next development program. And again, we're confident on the future. And I think this all goes back again to the long term value proposition of the tanker program. It's clear. It's a strong value proposition. We're going to deliver the airplane. It's going to add a lot of value for our customers. Operator : Our next question is from Dominic Gates with The Seattle Times. Please go ahead. Dominic Gates - The Seattle Times Co.: Hi. Good morning, Dennis and Greg. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Morning. Dominic Gates - The Seattle Times Co.: If I \u2013 first of all, I'd just like to ask about, the levels of employment here in Washington state have been sinking, partly for cyclical reasons, partly because you've moved work to other places for five years now. And we've passed the 20,000 milestone. But just recently, some of the programs fell short of people. And Boeing has been asking retirees to come back short term, very short term. So what is the outlook? Did you perhaps cut too much there? And what is the outlook for employment? Do you see it continuing \u2013 that 20,000 job reduction continuing? Or do you see perhaps an end to the job cuts here at some soon moment? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, Dominic, let me frame that for you. As you've rightly pointed out, we have been on a trend of reduced employment over the last few years. We've been doing that in a very respectful way, focused on our workforce, leveraging voluntary layoffs and natural attrition. And while that's true to the overall employment levels for our company, it's important to note that underneath that, we have areas of growth and we have other areas of decline. So it's not a one-size-fits-all in terms of that approach. And I think it's worth noting that, while we've come down in overall employment over the last three years, during that same time period, we've actually hired 11,500 new people into The Boeing Company. So you can see the ebbs and flows of the workforce that come with a big global industrial company. Now the most recent action here, as you noted, we've asked a small segment of retirees to come back to help us on some of our production programs in Commercial Airplanes, unique knowledge capabilities where we can quickly apply their expertise to our production lines. Again, that's a normal ebb and flow of the workforce as we work through our production programs. So nothing unusual there from my viewpoint. We're going to continue to be very thoughtful about how we manage our employment levels going forward. And I'm not going to give you specific projections on the future. But it's important that we continue to be respectful of our workforce. We put a lot of value in our people. And when we need to make reductions, we're going to do it in the right way. And when we have growth opportunities, we're going to make sure we hire and build the best talent in the world. In the end, our people are our most important investment, and we're going to continue to operate that way. Operator : Our next question is from Benjamin Zhang with Business Insider. Please go ahead. Benjamin Zhang - Business Insider : Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. I just had a quick question about the Airbus/Bombardier CSeries tie-up. Do you believe the \u2013 your complaint with the Department of Commerce, does it sacrifice or put in jeopardy your relationship with Delta Air Lines? And also, does the tie-up with the CSeries \u2013 Airbus tie-up \u2013 make you more interested in jumping back into the 100 to 150 seat market? Thanks. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Benjamin, let me give you a little context around that again. First of all, really important to understand that our fundamental strategy is strong. We're confident in that strategy. We're going to continue to exercise that strategy. We expect heavy competition in the marketplace, because it's an attractive marketplace. And we like to compete. Competition makes us better. But it's really important that everybody play by the same rules. And that was the reason that we initially brought the trade case. I think as you've seen in the initial determinations by the Department of Commerce, there are questions about the steps that have been taken with the CSeries aircraft. The Department of Commerce will continue to run that process. We expect to see outcomes from that over the next few months. And our position on all of this is that we simply want all the competitors to play by the same rules. And we're trying to do this in a very respectful way. We have great relationships with our customers in Canada, great deal of respect for our Canadian customers. We've been in Canada for 100 years. We have 2,000 direct employees in Canada. We have hundreds of suppliers. We contribute $4 billion of economic base to Canada through our supply chain every year. And we're going to continue to serve our customers there. Likewise, Delta is a very important customer to us. And a great deal of respect for them. We want to continue to work with them and support them for the future. So these are not actions that are targeted at customers or countries. These are matters of fair trade. We are happy to compete. We just want everybody to play by the same rules. Operator : Next, we'll go to Jon Ostrower with CNN. Please go ahead. Jon Ostrower - CNN: Hey. Good morning. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Morning. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Hey, Jon. Jon Ostrower - CNN: Hey, question about the process that unfolded over the summer. There's been numerous reports that Boeing was first approached by Bombardier, and Boeing rejected those advances. I wonder if you could discuss why Boeing decided not to pursue additional talks? And what was your thinking around that? And also just a second piece of this. As you dive into the acquisition of Aurora Flight Sciences, and how it's been working on the D8 airliner concept and the technology around that, how much of that process and that work that's been going on there are you hoping to ultimately bring into the commercial product line, whether it's for existing products or for NMA [New Midsize Airplane] over the coming years? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah. Hey, Jon, on your first question, I'm not going to speculate or offer comments on any speculation around conversations we might be having in industry. I'll just go back to the point that we remain very confident in our strategy. We've described that strategy. We've invested in our product lines. We'll put our product lines up against any competitor. We want to compete on a fair and level playing field. And with that, we're very confident in where we're headed. And recent actions that you see that Airbus and Bombardier have announced are not actions that change our game plan. And while we execute our strategy, we're going to continue to evaluate all of our alternatives. As always, we're making a number of organic investments. We evaluate different opportunities for inorganic or partnership models as well. And we're going to continue to keep those options open. And the key here is we have a strategy in place. We're going to grow organically. We are resourced to do that. We're confident in our product line. And we're going to complement that with other inorganic actions. And we're going to stick to that strategic path. Nothing has changed on that front. To your second question on Aurora, I think this dovetails exactly with what I just said. When we have an opportunity to make an acquisition that complements our organic strategy and allows us to advance our overall strategic game plan, we're eager to do that. And Aurora brings leading edge capabilities in unmanned aircraft, commercial technology applications, as you pointed out, an innovative culture, agile culture, advances some of our work on building out our autonomous vertical capabilities. All of those are very valuable. And we are really looking forward to the combination of Boeing and Aurora and what we can together bring to our customers now with this acquisition. And that will include applications in our commercial market segment. Operator : Our next question is from Patti Waldmeir with The Financial Times. Please go ahead. Patti Waldmeir - The Financial Times : Thanks for taking the call. You have said that your trade complaint was not aimed at any particular customers or countries. But can you comment on whether you are concerned that the situation may jeopardize future defense orders from the U.K. or Canada? And also your general counsel said that Bombardier would have to pay duty even if it builds the planes in Alabama. Can you clarify how you would expect that to happen if the production is taking place in the U.S.? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, Patty. First of all, again I'll go back to the fundamentals here of we're happy to compete, but it's important that everyone plays by the same rules. That's why we brought the trade case. And we're mindful that while we bring a trade case like this, that there are ripple effects and implications to various customers and country relationships. And we value those relationships. So when we make a decision like this, it's based on the fact that, for the long term, we have to have a fair and equal playing field. And we're mindful of how we're taking our actions on the trade case, so that we respect our customers while we do that. And we do think our long term relationships in the U.K. and Canada will certainly outlast this current trade matter. We've been together, as I said, for 100 years in places like Canada and in the U.K. And we expect those long term relationships to be sustained. And we're going to continue to work with our customers in both countries. Regarding the announcements around production plans and the potential of ramping up a new plant in Alabama. Again the Department of Commerce will go through its evaluation. And I think you've seen in the initial evaluation that there are concerns. It's clear to us that Bombardier's actions on the CSeries, where they have received illegal subsidies and they've exhibited dumping behavior, those will be evaluated by the Department of Commerce. And we'll await the outcome of that evaluation. And we don't see the recent announcements around the partnership plan or new production lines changing that process or changing our position on the fact that the trade matter needs to be addressed. It's important that everybody plays by the same rules. Phil Musser - The Boeing Co.: Great. Operator, I think we have time for one more question if we can do that? Operator : Certainly. And we'll go to Ted Reed with TheStreet. Please go ahead. Ted Reed, your line is open if you're on mute possibly? And we will move on to Glenn Farley with King TV. Please go ahead. Glenn Farley - King Broadcasting Co.: Hi, guys. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Hey, Glenn. Glenn Farley - King Broadcasting Co.: Looking at your production rates on the 737 and the upward pressure, you're going to 57, that's been announced for some time. It has been said that Renton could possibly accommodate up to 63 airplanes. You're talking about the pressure, and then we have NMA, which we all expect will come to fruition. Could NMA take the pressure off, considering we would be sort of a borderline area there? Or does Boeing have to build a bigger plant to keep building more 737s? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yes, Glenn, first on your 737 question. You're correct that we're seeing that upward pressure in the marketplace. We are evaluating production rates beyond the 57 a month. That's always part of our due diligence around production rate plans for the future. I think the great thing that you see is our team on the 737 program has found a way to continue to drive efficiency in that line, so that we can accommodate production rate increases within the factory footprint that we have and to deliver the highest value airplane in the marketplace. And you see that with the MAX that's now being introduced and the value proposition to our customers is very clear. So I'm very proud of our 737 team, what they're doing. And that productivity advancement is what is allowing us to look at expanding production rate for the future, both the committed rate to 57 a month as well as options beyond that. And now regarding the Middle of the Market airplane, or NMA, again, we continue our studies there. We haven't made a decision to launch or not launch that airplane. We're continuing to evaluate with customers. We continue to see a potential entry into service in the 2024, 2025 timeframe. So we have time to do our homework and do it well. We do see that as a market segment that is complementary to our 737 market segment. And we don't see those as overlapping segments. So this is really a separate decision. And we'll make that decision based on the business case merits of that marketplace. I can tell you, we're going to be very disciplined about that decision. And we still have work ahead of us. Phil Musser - The Boeing Co.: Great. Thank you all very much for your questions. That concludes our earnings call for today. Again, for members of the media, if you have further inquiries or questions, please call our team at 312-544-2002. Thank you all for participating and have a great day.",

Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analyst and media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcast live over the Internet. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Ms. Maurita Sutedja, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Please go ahead. Maurita Sutedja : Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. I'm Maurita Sutedja, and with me today is Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Enterprise Performance and Strategy. After management comments, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. We have provided detailed financial information in today's press release and you can follow the broadcast and presentation through our website at boeing.com. Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals in our discussions today are likely to involve risk, which is detailed in our News Release, various SEC filings, and the forward-looking statement disclaimer in the presentation. In addition, we refer you to our Earnings Release and presentations for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook. Now I will turn the call over to Dennis Muilenburg. Dennis Muilenburg : Thank you, Maurita, and good morning. Let me begin today with a brief overview of our 2017 operating performance followed by an update on the business environment and our expectations going forward. After that Greg will walk you through the details for our finance results and outlook. Now let\u2019s move to Slide 2. Thanks to the dedicated efforts of employees throughout our company, Boeing delivered 2017 finance results that included record earnings, record cash flow and record commercial aircraft deliveries. Furthermore, all three of our businesses increased their backlog in 2017. We sharpened our focus on profitable, sustained long-term growth strategies.  Disciplined execution of our production and development programs, delivering greater lifecycle value, including growing our services business and driving further quality and productivity gains across the enterprise. We also demonstrated our commitment to our customers and to ongoing investment in our people and our business, well, once again returning significant value to our shareholders. For the full-year, we generated record operating cash flow of $13.3 billion. We repurchased 46.1 million shares or $9.2 billion and made dividend payments totaling $3.4 billion in 2017. In December, we reinforced our commitment to returning value to shareholders as our Board of Directors authorized our new $18 billion share repurchase program and a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend. The increases are part of our balanced cash deployment strategy and reflect the confidence we have in our strong line of products and services and the long-term outlook for the business. Turning to our core operating performance for the year, Boeing Commercial Airplanes reported revenue of $56.7 billion driven by record 763 deliveries, including the delivery of the first 74 737 MAX airplanes. This was our sixth consecutive year of leadership in airplane deliveries. Net new commercial airplane orders were healthy 912 and brought our robust backlog to a new record of more than 5,800 airplanes, which equates to about seven years production at current rates. Key commercial airplane milestones in 2017 included the successful launch of the 737 MAX 10 and the smooth transition of 737 production lines as we met our MAX delivery expectations, while increasing production of 47 airplanes per month.  Also, in the year, we completed the first flight of the 787-10. Earlier this month, the 787-10 received an amended type certification from the FAA, clearing the airplane for commercial service. We plan to deliver the first 787-10 to our launch customer, Singapore Airlines in March.  The 777X development program remains on track as well as we began production of the first 777X flight test airplane. Boeing Defense Space and Security had a solid year, posting healthy revenue and margins and with the team securing some key awards and making progress and critical program milestones including continued progress on the tanker program.  In the quarter we received FAA certification for the 767-2C aircraft, verifying that the fundamental design of the KC-46 Tanker is safe and reliable. This is a key building block for the program as it retires risk and builds confidence as we continue our test efforts and work to complete the next phase of certification. We continue to make steady progress, closing out technical risk on the path to final certification and to delivering the first 18 tankers this year. We remain confident in the long-term value of this franchise. Additionally, the contract to provide the first KC-46 international tanker to Japan, highlights the broader demand and market opportunity we see for this program. Across our Defense Space and Security Portfolio, we continue to provide the best value for our customers to innovative solutions, as evidenced by our $10 billion of new orders booked during the quarter, which included the contract to provide 36 advanced F-15 fighters to Qatar. Other key milestones for BDS included meeting our commitment to the Missile Defense Agency to have 44 ground-based interceptors in place by the end of 2017 and delivery of the 150th EA-18G Growler to the U.S. Navy.  During the quarter, we continue to make progress on the commercial crew program. As we successfully completed design certification review, which is a requirement prior to docking with the International Space Station. During the year, we reorganized our business to establish Boeing Global Services, as we strengthened our focus on capturing value over the lifecycle of our products. Since beginning its operation in July of 2017, BGS is continue to win new business and that highlights the value we bring to our broad range of commercial and government customers. The awards included a contract for F-15 sustainment for Qatar. In order for 7 737-800. Boeing converted freighters from GECAS a 787-landing gear exchange agreement with All Nippon and P-8I training agreement for India. These awards highlight the strength of our one Boeing offerings. Before I close this 2017 recap, I'd like to offer a few thoughts on Amber Air and the potential combination announced at the end of last year. We have a longstanding history of collaboration with Amber Air, spanning multiple decades. We're interested in the business combination because we see strong strategic value and clear synergy in a number of areas, including highly complementary product lines, advanced vertical capabilities, broadening service offerings and leveraging world class talent and other combined resources.  This deal is aligned with our long-term strategy of first robust and continuing organic growth investment and returning value to shareholders complemented by strategic acquisitions and enhanced and accelerate our growth plans. Our commitment to balance cash deployment and returning cash to shareholders remains unchanged. For obvious reasons we cannot share any more details about the ongoing discussions but these discussions are productive and we\u2019re continuing to have active dialogue with the key stakeholders. In summary, during what the momentum building year we achieved record earnings and cash flow, delivered strong core operating performance and strengthened our business for profitable long-term growth while making strategic investments to accelerate into our second century and returning cash to our shareholders.  With that, let\u2019s turn to the business environment on slide 3. We continue to see health demand in our commercial, defense space and services markets. In the commercial airplanes market, airlines continue to report robust profits and passenger traffic in 2017 grew by more than 7% through November exceeding the long-term trend of approximately 5%. Also, cargo traffic exceeded 9% growth in 2017 through November driven by strong trade and industrial production in all regions. As we look to 2018, we expect passenger traffic to grow between 5.5 and 6%. Our global customer continues to recognize the compelling value proposition that our new more fuel-efficient product family brings to the market. The strong new order activity in 2017 reflected this healthy demand.  For 2018, we expect our new order intake to be moderated but still at a very healthy pace. We have also over the past few years seen an evolution in key market dynamics that we believe in the aggregate are driving greater stability and far less cyclicality for our industry. We see more diverse and balanced demand from a geographical perspective as well as across the spectrum of airline business models.  There also is more balance demand between new airplanes needed for fleet growth and those replacing older aircrafts and we are seeing more consistent and stable customer purchasing patterns. Over the long-term, we remain highly confident in our 20-year commercial market outlook which forecasts demand for approximately 41,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years, comprised of more than 29,500 aircrafts in the narrow body market and approximately 9,100 aircraft in the wide body market. This long-term demand combined with healthy market conditions and a robust backlog provides a solid foundation for our planned production rates. Turning to our product segments starting with the narrow body, our planned production rate for the 737 going to 57 per month in 2017 is based on our backlog of more than 4,600 aircraft and a production skyline that is sold out into early next decade. We continue to assess the upward market pressure on the 737-production rate.  In the wide body segment, we have seen steady orders for 787 and 777 airplanes and have high confidence in a meaningful increase in wide body replacement demand early next decade.  For the current generation 777 we received 40 net new orders in the year bringing the backlog to 102. We continue to make progress on the 777 bridge as highlighted by the recent orders as we transition production to the 777-X, we expect 777 deliveries of approximately 3.5 per month in 2018 and 2019 as previously announced. While we still have more work to do to fill the remaining 777 production slots, based on our progress of maturing commitments into firm orders, managing the skyline and working new campaigns, we continue to believe the rate plan we put in place establishes a floor for the program and supports our production bridge from the current 777 to the 777-X. As we look forward to the 777-X, we have a strong foundation of 340 orders and commitments that support our plan for ramping up production and delivery of this new aircraft. We also captured nearly 100 orders for the 787 Dreamliner family in 2017. A strong foundation for long-term production. With more than 650 firm orders in our backlog, our plan to increase Dreamliner production of 14 airplanes a month in 2019 is well supported. Turning to Defense Space & Security, we continue to see solid demand for our major platforms of programs. While the fiscal year 2018 U.S. federal budget has not been finalized, congressional support for our key BDS programs is strong. We've seen support for funding levels above the President's budget request for a number of programs, including the F-18, CH-47 Chinook, Ground-Based Midcourse Defense, AH-64 Apache, the V-22 and space launch system. In addition, just recently the Missile Defense Agency announced its intention to issue a sole source contract to Boeing for expansion of the ground based Midcourse Defense Program.  International demand for defense and space offerings remains high as well, in particular the rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters and satellites. As I mentioned earlier, we signed a contract to provide 36 advanced F-15 fighters to Qatar and we\u2019re making progress towards completing other previously announced international sales, including 28 F-18 fighter aircrafts for Kuwait, up to 40 more Chinook helicopters for Saudi Arabia, and the final C-17 for India. Our investment in future growth and new sales continues in areas that are priorities for our customers, such as commercial derivatives, rotorcraft, satellites, services, human space exploration, and autonomous systems. Much of that investment\u2019s supports priority we placed in capturing future franchise programs where we are also leveraging capabilities and technologies from across the enterprise for the T-X trainer, ground-Based Strategic Deterrent, unmanned carrier based MQ-25A, and JSTARS recapitalization, along with several other important opportunities. Turning to the services sector, we see the $2.6 trillion services market over the next 10 years as a significant growth opportunity for our company. In this market, both our commercial and defense customers remain focused on improving aircraft readiness and availability while driving improved operational efficiencies. The formation of Boeing global services by integrating the services capabilities of government, space and commercial sectors into a single customer focused business, allowed us to offer market leading portfolio of service solutions that our customers can use to optimize their operations. We aim to grow faster than the average services market growth of 3.5% as we expand our broad services offerings to gain the market share. Operating as a third business unit of Boeing, BGS provides agile, cost competitive services to commercial and government customers worldwide. Our global fleet care program that currently has more than 60 airlines operating more than 2,500 enrolled airplanes is an example of where we bring a high value, low risk and efficient fleet maintenance operation solution to our customers.  Digital Solutions remains a key enabler for us as well with our portfolio reaching around $1 billion in 2017. This market leading position helps us empower our customers by leveraging the data, coming of the airplanes to reduce lifecycle cost. This capability combines with our operating and parts, maintenance, modifications, logistics, support and training as well as the BGS business to drive is the accelerating force across all Boeing services and support areas.  Our focus remains on optimizing the business and expanding our portfolio offerings to position BGS for long-term sustain profitable growth. Our services expertise, the global reach of our business and our strong customer partnerships have us well position to compete and win in this important sector.  On a macro level, one significant development that took place in December last year was the enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The new tax law about US companies to better compete on the world stage, create more quality jobs for US workers and invest in innovation. For Boeing, this tax reform gives us the stronger foundation for the investment in our future help us win in the marketplace. The tax reform will have a clear and direct benefit to Boeing, our employees, suppliers, our communities and other stakeholders.  As we announced in December, we will make a $300 million investment in corporate giving work force development and workplace improvements as a result of the new tax law. We will also make additional investments and innovation driving new products, new services and new capabilities. Greg will go through the implications of the new tax law and our financial results and outlook in more detail later. In summary, with growing markets and opportunities ahead, our team remains intensely focused on growth, innovation and accelerating productivity improvements to fuel our investments in the future.  With that, Greg over to you for the financial results. Gregory Smith : Great. Thanks, Dennis. Good morning everybody. Let\u2019s turn to slide four and we\u2019ll discuss our full year results. Revenue for the year was a strong $93.4 billion on record commercial aircraft deliveries and continued growth in services and solid defense base of security execution. Core earnings per share totaled $12.04 for the full year another record reflecting strong operating performance across the company and favorable tax reform impact of a $1.74 per share.  The tax reform earnings impact primarily resulted from the re-measurement of our net US deferred tax liability in the fourth quarter to reflect the reduction in the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Operating cash flow for the year was also a record at $13.3 billion. The robust cash generation is largely driven by strong operating performance across all businesses.  Let\u2019s move now to our quarterly results on slide five. Fourth quarter revenue increased to $25.4 billion driven by growth in all three businesses while core earnings per share grew to $4.80 driven by strong operating performance across the portfolio as well as favorable tax reforms impact as I mentioned of $1.74 per share.  Let\u2019s now discuss commercial airplanes on slide six. Our commercial airplane business revenue increased to $15.5 billion during the quarter on higher planned production rates and delivery mix.  BCA operating margins increased to 11.5% on strong execution across all programs. BCA captured $25 billion in net orders during the fourth quarter and the backlog remains very strong at $421 billion and now more than 5,800 aircrafts equating to around seven years of production. On the 787 programs, we delivered 36 aircrafts in the quarter and booked 94 net orders for the year. The deferred production balance declined as planned by $591 million in the quarter. Our teams remain focused on improving 787 cash generation driven by favorable delivery mix, additional supplier step down pricing and a relentless effort to further drive internal productivity and first-time quality.  Turning now to defense, base and security results on slide 7. Fourth quarter revenue increased to 5.5 billion reflecting higher weapons and rotorcraft deliveries and operating margins were 10% driven by performance slightly offset by mix. During the quarter, BDS won key contract awards worth $10 billion and our backlog stands at $50 billion with now more than 40% of that from international customers.  Turning now to Boeing Global services results on slide 8. In the fourth quarter, revenue increased to 17% for the quarter and 5% growth for the full year met our objective to outpace the average annual service market growth rate of 3.5%. TGS operating margin was strong at 15.4% reflecting solid execution offset by a mix in the quarter. TGS results were a testament to team\u2019s focus on achieving topline growth while maintaining disciplined execution. A key win during the quarter underscores the strength of our one Boeing offerings to our customers.  Let\u2019s turn now to cash flow on the next slide 9 please. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter and full year was strong at 2.9 and 13.5 billion respectively. The results were driven by strong operating performance across the enterprise. Cash generation will continue to be a top priority going forward, in fact half of our employee incentive score is based on cash flow to ensure that we are fully aligned to this important objective across the company. Now turn to slide 10. In 2017, we repurchased $9.2 billion of Boeing stock and paid 3.4 billion in dividends. As Dennis mentioned earlier in December last year we reinforced our commitment to returning value to shareholders as our Board of Directors authorized the new $18 billion share repurchase program and a 20% increase to our quarterly dividend.  Our continued balance, cash deployment activity reflects our ongoing confidence in the long-term outlook for our business. Balanced and prudent cash deployment is a product of our consistent focus on shareholder value and disciplined cash management.  Since the end of 2012, we returned approximately $40 billion to our shareholders through dividend and repurchases. During this period, we raised our dividend by over 250% and reduced our share count by more than 205 million shares and significantly reduced volatility and risk around our pension through freezing our plans and pre-funding efforts. While executing these we also continue to invest in key strategic areas to ensure our long-term sustained growth for Boeing.  Prudently and strategically manage our R&D and capital expenditures to create value for our customers and for our shareholders. We will continue to expect operating cash flow to grow annually through the end of the decade and we remain committed to returning approximately a 100% of our free cash flow to investors, while continuing to invest in future growth opportunities. Let\u2019s now move to cash and debt balances on slide 11. We ended the quarter with $10 billion of cash and marketable securities and stable debt levels and credit ratings. Our cash position once again provides us flexibility to invest in innovation and profitable growth opportunities, while returning value back to our shareholders. Let\u2019s now turn to slide 12 and we\u2019ll discuss our outlook for 2018. Building on the strong performance we posted in 2017, our guidance for 2018 reflects improved core operating performance, additional productivity capture and as we long discussed growing cash flows. The guidance incorporates the estimated benefit of the tax reform on earnings in cash flow, net of additional investments that we will make as a result of the new tax law. The guidance also includes the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition and pension post-retirement accounting standards, which came into effect January 1, 2018. Our expected effective tax rate for 2018 is approximately 16%. The two primary drivers for the difference between this rate and the new federal rate of 21% are one being the R&D credit and due to our considerable investments in innovation and new technologies that allow us to bring market leading products and services to our customers and the other key element is the deduction as a result of selling our products and services to non-U.S. customers, while creating intellectual property, excuse me, and manufacturing of our products here in the United States. Obviously, we're still in the early stages of the implementation of the new tax law and therefore we may refine our estimate impact of the future quarters and we'll update you accordingly.  As I mentioned, we have adopted a new revenue recognition standard as of January 1, 2018 to meet the required implementation timing under U.S. GAAP. Under these new standard contracts that previously recognized revenue based on deliveries, our performance milestones will now recognize revenue as costs are incurred. It will not change the total amount of revenue recognized, only accelerate the timing of when the revenue is recognized. The change in revenue standard will not affect cash flows. The new standard primarily impacts our defense contracts including certain military derivative aircraft contracts in our BCA business. It will not however impact revenue recognition for commercial airplane contracts in BCA. The new pension and post retirement accounting standard involves reclassification of certain pension and benefit items from our operating to non-operating. The adoption of the new standard has no impact on our sales, core earnings, cash flows or liabilities. And for comparison purposes as part of this earnings release, we have provided restated 2017 and 2016 financial information, incorporating the adoption of these new accounting standards. Revenue for 2018 is forecasted to be between $96 billion and $98 billion, largely reflecting higher planned 737 production and growth in defense space and security and services which is more than offset by the planned 777 volume, lower 777 volume as we transition for the 777x. We continue to expect revenue growth over the remainder of the decade and additional commercial production rate increases plan as we deliver on a robust backlog and execute on our defense space and security and services growth strategies.  Core earnings per share guidance for 2018 is set to be between $13.80 and $14.00 per share on higher volume, improved productivity and affordability and the impact of tax reform.  Operating cash flow for 2018 is forecasted to increase by $1.7 billion to be approximately $15 billion largely driven by the following. Improving 787 cash generation, higher 737 production and improved tanker profile partially offset by the cash impact from the 777 investments and planned 777 lower volume.  At the same time the net impact of higher cash tax payments is incorporated and although we have a benefit from the lower effective tax rate, our cash tax payments will still increase compared to the prior period as our unit profitability continues to be improve on the 787 programs. Capital spending is forecasted to be approximately $2.2 billion returning to our more normalized level and includes the timing shift to some expenditures that were expected in 2017. Our 2018 commercial airplane revenue guidance is set to be between $59.5 billion and $60.5 billion. And as we previously discussed this is largely based on the higher deliveries on 737 program offset by the planned lower 777 volume. The ramp up was 737 MAX production continues and we expect 737 MAX to account for between 40% and 45% of our total 737 deliveries in 2018. In all, BCA is expected to deliver between 810 airplanes and 815 airplanes for the full year. Commercial airplanes operating margin guidance is greater than 11% on improved operating performance that more than offset the impact of the lower 777 volume. The margin guidance also reflects all planned production rate increases.  Defense space and security revenue guidance for 2018 is between $21.5 billion and $22.5 billion reflecting the sale of our last C17, increased weapons volumes and strength of our overall international fighter business.  Operating margin guidance for our defense business is approximately 11% based on continued productivity efforts across the portfolio. Global services revenue guidance is between $15 billion and $15.5 billion with operating margins of approximately 15.5%. And as we\u2019ve discussed we aim to grow faster than the average service market growth of 3.5% as we expand our broad service offerings and gain market share while maintaining and growing overall profitability.  We expect research and development spending to increase to approximately $3.7 billion in 2018 with around 70% related to BCA as we invest in future growth while BBS and BGS also continue to invest in key strategic opportunities. This R&D spending forecast also includes the timing shift of some expenditures that were planned in 2017.  Tax reforms certainly provides a stronger foundation for us to make additional investments in our business such as R&D. Our funding will continue to be focused on core programs, key future franchises, productivity enablers such as automation and capabilities to further expand our vertical content, life cycle capture and other key growth areas such as autonomy. We will continue to make the required investments at innovation and technology to ensure our products and services continue to win in the marketplace. And going forward, we expect our overall R&D spending as a percentage of revenue to be relatively stable.  While our organic investment remains the primary engine for our growth we continue to look for opportunities to partner with other industry players and investments that accelerate our life cycle value strategy and vertical content as we demonstrated by the recent joint venture with Adient for seats, announced earlier this month. Consistent with prior years and given the seasonality of our business as we look into the next quarter we expect first quarter revenue to be the lowest of the year of revenue. Core earnings per share is estimated to be approximately 15% of full year earnings and Q1 operating cash flow forecasted to be approximately 10%, again driven by the timing of receipts and expenditures in the seasonality of our business. So, in summary our core operating engine continues to deliver strong results and increase our momentum for our company. We remain focused on ensuring we continue the seamless ramp up of Boeing global services and leveraging our three business units strategy in the marketplace.  And as I mentioned, we\u2019ll continue to make prudent disciplined investments to create value for our customers and our shareholders, while at the same time set challenging goals and objectives around elements of our operation and support functions tied to profitability and efficiency to generate cash and improve working capital all with an eye towards profitable growth in the second century and maintaining our commitment to balanced cash deployment and returning value to our shareholders and to our customers.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments. Dennis Muilenburg : Thank you, Greg. As I reflect on 2017, this first full year of our second century was a year of strong performance and record results on many different fronts both operational and financial. We would not have been able to do it without the hard work and dedication of our employees and the great partnership we have with our customers.  In addition to the stabilizing commercial airplane market dynamics I mentioned earlier in my remarks, we\u2019ve also taken our own actions to reduce cyclicality in our business. including remaining disciplined in our production rate decisions, de-risking our pension liabilities, strategically pacing our research and development spending, creating labor stability with the long-term contracts and expanding our services business which is also less cyclical.  We have executed on our long-term strategy for robust and continuing organic growth investments and returning value to shareholders complimented by strategic acquisitions that enhance and accelerate our growth plans. As we look to 2018, our teams remain focused on further driving both growth and productivity. As the world\u2019s largest commercial airplane maker, our nation\u2019s second largest defense contractor, a global leader in spaceflight and a growing force in lifecycle services we are optimistic about our future and the future of our industry as we have ever been. Our priorities going forward are to leverage our unique One Boeing advantages, continue building strength on strength to deliver and improve on our commitments, and to stretch beyond those plans and sharpen and accelerate our pace of progress on key enterprise growth and productivity efforts. Achieving these objectives will require a clear and consistent focus on a profitable ramp up in our commercial airplane production, continuing to strengthen our defense and space business, growing our integrated services business and leveraging the power of our three business unit strategy, delivering on our development programs, driving world-class levels of productivity and performance throughout the enterprise to fund in innovation and growth, disciplined leading edge investments and balance value creating cash deployment and continuing to develop and maintain the best team and talent in the industry. All of which positioned Boeing for continued market leadership, sustained top and bottom line growth, and increasing value for our customers, shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders. With that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Carter Copeland : Just a quick clarification and question, Greg, on the unit versus program net differences were small, I wondered if you could just tell us if there was anything on a gross program basis that was significant in that and if you took any margin revisions on the various programs this quarter?  And then on Boeing Global Services, you\u2019ve got some variability around the margin and at least the quarterly data that we've seen to-date and you commented about mix having an impact there and just in terms of understanding the algorithm, the profit algorithm here, how much variability should we expect in those sorts of numbers and how much mix impact could we see quarter-to-quarter in that business, just help us understand that one if you would? Gregory Smith : Yeah. It\u2019s a good question because you're right, it's obviously considering the type of portfolio on the contract and the number of contracts, you are going to see variability just through whether customer mix or product offering mix quarter-over-quarter. But I think the ranges that you've seen it in and then as we kind of restated the numbers you get a good sense of kind of where it operates, but on a quarter-to-quarter basis, yeah, we\u2019re going to see some variability in there. But I would say that the team's very focused as we brought these units together and we talked about this prior is the cost structure.  And so, they're not only are kind of working on what they're offering in the marketplace, but they're also working across the enterprise on the synergy opportunities as they bring the defense and the commercial, say, backroom services together there. So, part of the objective here obviously is to grow the margin profile, but you're going to see variability just because of the nature of the business. Dennis Muilenburg : On program margin we had a couple of moving pieces, we have the last early builds 787 deliver and then we have a couple of the 737-test aircraft in flow for fourth quarter. But other than that, we had margin expansion across all BCA programs.  And Carter the only thing I'll add on the BGS front is, both Greg and I says we\u2019re focused on long-term profitable growth. So, while you see some variability on margins depending on particular contracts in customer frameworks, we expect to grow both top and bottom line and we are focused on that at top line growth will be profitable growth. Operator : Our next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman : So, another question about services and just thinking about growing in excess of the market at 3.5% and looking at maybe 5% this year which is kind of what we were expecting. But, you could grow 5% for a very long time and not get close to $50 billion. And so just wondering if acquisitions are playing a greater role and your longer-term outlook for the services business? Dennis Muilenburg : Yeah. Seth, let me take and cut it down quicker. First of all, you\u2019re right for the total year we performed at about 5% growth versus 3.5% in the market. Saw a bit of acceleration beyond that in the fourth quarter, note that we just launched the business in the middle of the year, so we\u2019ve got six months under our belt. So, I\u2019d say that a good start but a lot of work is still ahead of us.  We have set that longer-term $50 billion target for growth in this business achieving that over the next 10 years we\u2019ve been very focused on achieving that. We still see organic growth as a primary engine here. And continuing to outpace the market, growing at 5% to 6% a year at the start is a good start, we see some opportunities to accelerate that as we expand our parts business. Our engineering mods and maintenance business has some significant potential, our training business and then as we ramp up digital solutions in particular we see that as an enabler. Again, we\u2019re at the early part of that digital growth, we surpassed the $1 billion milestone just this past quarter in terms of volume in our digital business. That\u2019s a market meeting position that still has a lot of headroom. We see organic growth is our primary engine as we head towards that $50 billion mark. We see an opportunity to complement that with M&A to your point, but we don\u2019t see the M&A is the primary growth engine here. It\u2019s primarily organic growth with complementary actions. I think a good example of that is the seats JV that we announced with Adient during this past quarter, that\u2019s the way for us to generate lifecycle value for our customers. It\u2019s something that complements our product line platform businesses and it\u2019s a services growth enabler for the longer-term.  And we\u2019re going to continue to look for those kind of partnership or acquisitions to augment our services and business. Also, as we build out our vertical capabilities with both organic and inorganic actions, we expect those verticals capabilities to transition into lifecycle value or services growth. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Douglas Harned : I wanted to go back to BCA margins because when you look at guidance you\u2019re guiding to above 11% for 2018 that would be the best that I think maybe ever. Now, when you go there how do you see the different programs progressing to get you there and then when you look longer term out for 2020, you\u2019ve talked about getting to around 15% margins. Is that still the trajectory you\u2019re looking at and what needs to happen to get you to a target like that? Dennis Muilenburg : Yeah, Doug let me jump on that first thing, Greg and I [indiscernible] on the program specific. First of all, Doug that 15% margin target mid-teens target remains our clear focus and getting there towards the end of the decade and we are unwavering in that focus and I think what you see is this progress along that path in 2017. You see our guidance in 2018 as another step towards that.  As we mentioned before we expect our progress to be steady over a multi-year timeframe to achieve that long-term target. That includes actions we \u2018ve taken throughout the enterprise to reduce our cost structure, market-based actions, reducing every element of our cost structure both in terms of direct labor cost and also significantly in our supply chain, we\u2019ve made some significant progress and are partnering for success initiative but we have more ahead of us than what\u2019s behind us. We see that as a significant lever for the future, balanced R&D deployment and making sure we\u2019re continuing to execute on the development programs as another complement of that. And then also on the pricing side, ensuring that our pricing is holding up in the marketplace by bringing in the highest value products.  So, we\u2019re on a solid trajectory, we remain very focused on the end goal here, lot of hard work to go yet but it's an achievable target and one that we will relentlessly pursue. Greg do you want to add anything? Gregory Smith : Yeah, just maybe a little bit detail on the programs. Obviously, we\u2019re expecting 787 to improve through time and I think the team has done a great job getting us to this point but the amount of initiatives that they have in place as they look forward is key to capturing that margin and I think again off to a great start and frankly setting some standards for our company about best practices, right down in the factory floor reducing flow time and improving first time quality in all aspects of the operations. So that\u2019s obviously going to prove in the mix Doug as we\u2019ve talked about we\u2019ll have a different mix profile on the 787 line that will also be favorable. You now 737 managing through the implementation of the math, team has done a great job, done a great job a lot of de-risking done upfront, that\u2019s really helped us from a margin perspective and just an overall cost objective as we made that transition and that obviously is off to a great start and will continue that momentum as we get more MAX aircraft in the line and that\u2019s more than offsetting the investments we\u2019re making in 777-X and then this transition between the rates on 777 to 777-X.  So, and that beyond and then the other things that Dennis mentioned around period cost and the overall broader one company initiatives where we\u2019re leveraging best practices and getting them implemented and a reminder we\u2019re all on one company score here and so that\u2019s the primary driver.  So, we\u2019re really embedding these best practices and bringing them across whether it's from states, fighters to commercial or vice versa really trying to amp that up because we\u2019ve got some great practices in segments of our business that we really went to leverage more going forward. Dennis Muilenburg : And to Greg\u2019s last point there, Doug as you recall, we launched Boeing analytics during the past year and we\u2019re just starting to see some of the benefits of applying those advanced analytics tools across our whole enterprise as another way to optimize, close, gain efficiencies in our factories, take out cost and I think we're just beginning to see the benefits of what those high-powered analytics tools can bring to our overall enterprise operations. So that will be another important ingredient going forward. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead. George Shapiro : Yes, good morning. One for you Dennis and then one for Greg. The question for you Dennis is, with the seat venture that you have and you\u2019re talking of, doing some avionics. Do you have an objective is to how much you want to build internally now versus how much you outsourced to suppliers and how that mix might change?  And then the one for you Greg, is this R&D in 2017 was $400 million less than your initial guide. Did all of that get shifted into 2018 or was there just some underspending in 2018 has some of that for something else? Thanks. Dennis Muilenburg : Hey, George. On your first question regarding the verticals, that strategy is one that we launched this past year and we focused in on some key areas where we believe deepening our vertical capability will add value for both Boeing and our customers and at the same time produce lifecycle value to grow our services business. And so, we really began to focus that in the few areas that we see is as needle movers for us. One key area is in actuation, as you noted previously, we've stood up operations at Boeing Sheffield and Boeing Portland to begin building actuators for 777 and 737s, we expect to continue to grow scale in that vertical area. We see avionics as an attractive area both hardware and software and stand up of Boeing avionics this past year. That\u2019s scaled up now to several hundred engineers and we\u2019re working together across the enterprise and with our supply chain in that area. We see interiors selectively in the interiors area as a growth segment, that's where the seats JV comes into play as an example.  And so, we're going to continue to invest in these vertical areas. We're going to be disciplined about it. We don't intend to be vertical everywhere, but where we can add vertical capability that's not able for Boeing and customers and creates long-term services value, we're going to invest.  And in some cases, that will be done in partnership with existing suppliers, in some cases we may be looking at shifting more content between internal work and our supply base. Again, we\u2019ll do that in a disciplined manner in a way that produces value. Greg, do you want to take the second question? Gregory Smith : Yeah, yeah. Really good question on R&D, I mean frankly, it's a little bit of both. I mean, there's some timing that we moved into 2018 and we've incorporated that, but there was also some underrun in as you know, this R&D expenditure, all elements of that, we've got very strong discipline and oversight in place. So, we are working and when we talk about affordability, R&D is a key element of that. So again, little underspending and then some shifting into 2018. George Shapiro : Okay. If I\u2019m still on, Dennis could I pin you down just maybe a little bit like seating. Do you have an objective as to how much seating you rather supply yourself versus buying from outsiders? Dennis Muilenburg : That balance is to be determined over time, George. We're going to start by ramping up this joint venture. We know we have some pinch points in the current supply chain and we can release some of those pinch points with this capability. We think we can bring unique value to customers and the scale of that business will be determined over time. It will be balanced between internal and external capabilities, but we intend to produce value here and we\u2019re very serious about these investments. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu : I guess could you comment on working capital assumptions for 2018. How we should think about that and then the moving pieces there and particularly with regards to the 777 and inventory impact and any offset to that. Thank you. Dennis Muilenburg : Yeah. No, question Sheila. This is the [indiscernible] this transition between 777 and 777-X and building the static aircraft as well as the test aircraft, there is more headwind with regards to working capital on 777. That\u2019s more than offset by the elements that I talked about where 87 is getting better, 37 productions will improve. On top of I\u2019ll say the productivity initiatives, tanker and I mentioned as well.  So, all of those more than offsetting the inventory build as we work through transaction from 777 to 777-X. And then lastly as I mentioned even though the tax rate has come down and we are going to pay more cash taxes in 2018 as a result of the improving unit cost performance on the 787.  So those are the big moving pieces, but we\u2019re very steely eyed on all the elements of working capital and as I mentioned in my remarks that this is a top priority and you\u2019ve seen it in our results and you\u2019re going to continue to see it in our results going forward that we\u2019ve got again everybody diligently focused and it\u2019s on everybody's scorecard around working capital, inventory, payables, receivables. And so, we\u2019re going to continue to work that engine as we work through these great transitions, product transitions and rate increases. Sheila Kahyaoglu : And just a follow up, how do we think about advances and the assumptions there? Dennis Muilenburg : Yeah. There is not a big impact on advances from 2017 to 2018. Again, there is some moving pieces in there, but certainly not a big contributor to the cash flow profile year-over-year from 2017 to 2018. Operator : Our next question is from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead. Pete Skibitski : Just curious on the MAX integration into the three lines \u2013 and do you have the MAX on all three lines right now or maybe not quite yet since it\u2019s not half of the total deliveries. And as we going through that are you seeing any execution problems at all, the yellow or red on the risk register or looking now to CNE and your suppliers. Just wanted to get more color there given the ramp. Dennis Muilenburg : Yeah. Pete the ramp continues to be right on track. We delivered 74 MAXs during the past year. Greg mentioned in his comments as we ramp up -- continue to ramp up production overall going to 47 a month to 52 a month this coming year during the rest of 2018 and then 57 a month next year. That rate planned ramps up are continuing on track.  This year we expect deliveries -- MAX deliveries to be about 40% to 45% of the total 737 deliveries. So, implementations on the lines is right on track. I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019m just very impressed by what our 737 team is doing. I had a chance to be on the line again just recently and they\u2019re implementing productivity improvements, production lines, flow improvements, tax time improvements, all while rolling the MAX into the line.  So, while it\u2019s a challenging situation it\u2019s a high-volume line, fast moving line, we\u2019re continuing to ramp up while we introduce the MAX into the line. It requires daily focus and daily attention; the ramp up continues on track and we\u2019re not seeing issues or any problems that are out of the ordinary. And we remain confident that we\u2019ll achieve our MAX ramp up cost for 2018. Pete Skibitski : That\u2019s right, good to hear. One quick one in the 787-10 certification, congrats on that number one. But maybe for Greg, Greg given how you guys have talked about the cost structure on the -10, should we expect to see kind of an immediate improvements to 787 unit margins as that kind of gives you a more meaningful part of the mix or is it going to take maybe a couple of years before that impacts the year. Gregory Smith : It's going to take a little bit of time Pete, as we bring it into the production system and it becomes I\u2019ll say more heavily weighted versus the overall delivery. But I tell you what, when you look at again to Dennis\u2019s point like 37 MAX implementations how the team has implemented the -10 in the factory and minimize disruption in that, you remember that objective we have around commonality has really paid off. So as its transitioning through the factory and the cruiser cycling, the amount of disruption is really minimized and frankly I would characterize it as the best practice going from one derivative to another.  And so that\u2019s really going to help the overall margin profile and the flow of the aircraft in all other I\u2019ll say operational aspects of the business. So, they\u2019re off to a great start bringing that aircraft into the production system but you\u2019ll see more of that as a weighted as the overall deliveries going forward. Operator : Our next question is from Rajeev Lalvani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Rajeev Lalvani : Honestly there is a lot out there on middle of the market aircraft maybe even return of the 767 passengers. Just with tax reform coming through, how does that impact the thinking as far as how you\u2019re purchasing the middle of the market in particular and should we expect some sort of decision this year as to whether or not you\u2019re moving forward? Dennis Muilenburg : Yeah, Rajeev we continue to have productive discussions with our customers on middle of the market more than 50 customers have engaged, we\u2019re continuing to expand those discussions. We still this as an airplane if we launch it is one that would enter into service in the 2024, 2025 timeframe. So, we haven\u2019t made any changes there.  As you\u2019ve probably noticed over the last couple of quarters, we did stand up a program management team with Mark leading the day by day program activity. So that\u2019s a serious investment on our part as we get more into the details of the program, not only the specifics around the airplane and the systems but taking a look at production systems and all elements of the business model.  We still have time to do the work and determine the business case, we\u2019re not going to launch this airplane unless the business case makes good sense for both us and our customers and we also have some enterprise transformation objectives that we wanted to achieve as we look at our second century production and supply chain systems.  So, all of that is interwoven and we haven\u2019t change the timeline we\u2019re going to continue to have a very disciplined process on how we evaluate this and we still have time to do our homework and make the right decisions. So, we\u2019re not going to be rushed into a decision here. I will say with the tax reform as Greg pointed out, it does increase our ability to invest in innovation and in the future not only in product lines but also the underlying production and supply chain systems and that will just help us further solidify the business case and if we launch give us even additional confidence. Maurita Sutedja : All right. Operator, we have time for just one more analyst question. Operator : Thank you and that will be from Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead. Jon Raviv : Hey, curious you\u2019d talked about higher R&D, you also have higher CapEx ticking up a little bit, you mentioned some timing elements there? What do you see as the long-term trajectory for CapEx and how much of that growth is defense versus how much commercial, I guess especially on the defense side where you're seeing growth comeback on some of those budget mark-ups and where do [indiscernible] of DCs pointed to even higher growth ahead? Dennis Muilenburg : Yeah, well, right now, obviously, it\u2019s predominantly weighted to BCA, really supporting the rate increases that we've talked about. And at the same time, I would say there's some enterprise initiatives and business initiatives around investments in things like automation and I\u2019ll say lean efforts of where we can optimize the factory. So, there's some investments in productivity, balanced with investments in growth. So that kind of what you're seeing in there right now.  I mentioned this is that 2.2 is kind of more of a normalized level. It's going to shift year-over-year depending on our growth opportunities that come. So that you'll see more capital going into services as an example. But as you mentioned in defense as we see opportunities there, if they make sense and they deliver value back to the bottom line, we're going to make the right, the prudent investments in capital in that business. So as those opportunities come up on themselves, frankly, if we have an opportunity to get ahead of it and de-risk some of those initiatives or investments, we\u2019ll do that as well.  We have -- again we\u2019ve got a firepower to do that which I think positions us uniquely, but we're going to be really smart, and prudent about it as we have been for the last number of years. So that discipline is going to continue to be in place when we see these opportunities in the future. Operator : Ladies and gentle that completes the analysts question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019ll now return you to the Boeing Company for Introductory remarks by Mr. Phil Musser, Senior Vice President of Communications. Mr. Musser, please go ahead. Phil Musser : Thank you very much. Good morning, everybody. We're going to continue now with media questions for Dennis and Greg. And if you have questions following this part of the session, please follow-up with our Media Relations team by calling the office or emailing us directly. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the first question in the interest of time, and we\u2019d ask that you limit your questions to just one question. So, let\u2019s go ahead and enroll. Operator : And we\u2019ll go to Doug Cameron with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead. Doug Cameron : So, to press I'm asking what appears to be the first tax question after 1,700 analyst questions, but its Greg's fault, so Greg you kind of pin some things you might do with the tax benefits, but at the same time you said that R&D would be relatively stable, CapEx is turning to more normalized level. So, the kind of simplistic question is what's changed? Will you actually do this different if R&D is relatively safe stable and CapEx is going through a more normalized level, I don't quite understand it. Dennis Muilenburg : Doug, let me comment on that, and then I\u2019ll let Greg to jump in too. Couple of things on tax reform benefits and how we're rolling that into our plans going forward. One is, some very targeted investment in our workforce, our workplace and our communities and that\u2019s a previous announcement we made on $300 million investment with more opportunities ahead, but those are very important investments for us on the talent side, on training for the future, enabling our employees with advance capabilities, workplace improvements that will enhance productivity and investing in our communities along important lines like veterans and veterans' support.  We will also complement that with significant additional investments in innovation and while we said R&D stable note that was R&D stable relative as a percentage of revenue. So, we\u2019re growing revenue, we\u2019re also going to be growing R&D and the tax reform benefit will allow us to accelerate some of that work on advance prototyping activities and we\u2019ll accelerate work on productivity initiatives and our factory spaces, some of what we call our second century design and manufacturing capabilities, analytics, building out some of the vertical capabilities that we talked about earlier. You saw some of those items on Greg\u2019s cash deployment chart. And we will be ramping up our investment and innovation as a result tax reform in a meaningful way. Greg, you want to say anything. Gregory Smith : Yeah. Doug there is some of that in the CapEx as well, obviously as Dennis indicated more of it in the R&D, but the CapEx without tax reform would have been slightly lower. And so, we are making some strategic investments in there and utilizing those resources to really feel winning in the marketplace at the same time making the investments in productivity, training and development as Dennis indicated.  So, I think we\u2019ve really taken a hard look at this and looked at what\u2019s the best use of our capital to win in the marketplace. At the same time, meet our overall objectives that is to drive profitability that again will allow us to continue to invest in the business. So, that\u2019s kind of the cycle I\u2019ll say the streams that these investments need to go through, but we have to, Dennis' point increase on both. Operator : Our next question is from Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg. Please go ahead. Julie Johnsson : I just had a quick question on about the ITC decision on Friday and the rather measured response by the commerce secretary. So, where does this leave Boeing? And at this point do you have any regrets for pursuing the anti-dumping case given the outcome? Dennis Muilenburg : Yeah. Julie, first of all as you noted in our statement we were disappointed with the outcome of the ITC ruling. Frankly, we won\u2019t have the details until the full ruling is released later in February. So, all we know at the moment is the outcome, we await the details of the ruling and that will help us understand some of the rationale behind it and allow us to make decisions on our path forward.  I will say that we remain firm in our stance on the need for fair global trade, it\u2019s really important for the future that we all play by the same rules. We may consistent on that team for years, we will continue to be consistent on that team. And when we see practices that are not consistent with everybody playing by same rules, we\u2019re going to raise the issue. And you can count on that in the case going forward as well. Regarding the ITC matter, we\u2019ll take a look when we get the outcomes here in the middle of February. Operator : Our next question from Gillian Rich with Investor's Business Daily. Please go ahead. Gillian Rich : Hi. So, I had a question, I know that you raised your dividend buyback in December. If you have any plans to raise it -- increase the dividend or buyback this year at all and can you give me an update on the timeline for CST-ST 100 Starliner? Dennis Muilenburg : Sure, I\u2019ll take the first one. Yeah, like I mentioned we got authorization from our Board to increase to a $18 billion share repurchase program. So obviously that will give us some time period here two to three years of repurchasing opportunity so that will continue throughout this year and in to next year and a little bit into the further. So that kind of step I would think of it that way Gillian.  And then on the dividend, that\u2019s something honestly, we will review on an annual basis as you\u2019ve heard me mention we\u2019ve made some pretty significant investments in our dividend or increases in our dividend. So, we continue to monitor that from a competitive perspective with our peers outside of our peers, talk to our shareholders that\u2019s an annual process. So, as we get closer to the end of the year we\u2019ll do another assessment and then we\u2019ll decide what we want to do with the dividend. But again, we have been very committed to returning cash to shareholders as I indicated 100% of our free cash flow we\u2019ve committed to delivering back to shareholders while at the same time making some significant investments in future growth opportunities for the company. So, it\u2019s a balanced approach that we have in place and you shouldn\u2019t expect that to change going forward. Gregory Smith : And then on the commercial crew Starliner effort, we\u2019re continuing to march smartly through the development program. As I noted we just completed the design certification review which is a major milestone in the program, we\u2019re continuing through the test program and we had plans in place for a first launch later this year and we\u2019re continuing to work this very closely with our NASA customers. And more broadly we see human space exploration as a very important marketplace for us for the future and we\u2019ve led in that market since it was created and we intend to be a leader in human space like going forward and the Starliner effort is a key part of that. Operator : The next question is from Dominic Gates from Seattle Times. Please go ahead. Dominic Gates : Hi good morning, another question related to Bombardier and that decision with the ITC, it seems that the loss last week was possibly because of the details of the delta order where you didn\u2019t have a plan competing in that particular campaign. So, if Bombardier, there is an expectation that after that results Bombardier will begin to sell in to the US market. We expect orders possibly pretty soon. If they were to sell this CS-300 the bigger airplane would you possibly reignite the ITC case large and longer one?  And then secondly expecting Bombardier to start selling into the US market where does that leave you with Embraer and your discussions with Embraer? How do you see -- what are your plans if you get Embraer to counter what Bombardier will do which of course will become Airbus? Dennis Muilenburg : Yeah, Dominic to your first question, its important again to note that we haven\u2019t seen the details of the ruling or the vote that was taken last week. So, we need to see those details before we can make any decisions on plans forward.  I think it's important to note that the department of commerce did make an earlier ruling regarding dumping behavior and a result identified the tariffs. That ruling still stands. As to the ITC hearing it has to show harm and imminent import and until we see the details of that ruling we simply don\u2019t know the rationale behind it. So more to come when we determine that.  I think for the longer term, again the important principle here is we stand for fair global trade and. And as always, we're all playing by the same rules we are more than happy to compete. But it's important that we play by the same rules. That will be our standard for any future decisions that we make. And the opportunity with Embraer, we do think is, it\u2019s an important one, it's a great strategic fit. We continue to have productive discussions on that topic. We know that the government of Brazil has raised some concerns or issues that we fully respect and we're working through the details of potential options going forward and doing that in a very diligent way. So, I'm hopeful that we can bring that feel to conclusion, but more work to go on that front.  Even if that doesn't happen, we have a very strong plan for the future. We have a solid strategy, we know exactly how we're going to grow for the future, we've got the right investments to identified, we are ready to compete and win in the future regardless of the outcomes of these trade matters and where the potential deal with Embraer and we're going to stay very focused on executing that strategy. It's a winning strategy. Operator : Our next question is from Alwyn Scott with Reuters. Please go ahead. Alwyn Scott : Hi everyone. I just wanted to follow-up. Boeing has talked a lot about in the past about the competition from Airbus, Bombardier, COMAC, serious threats, which prompted cost cutting including job cutting, but given your strong performance now in your outlook, how do you see over the competitive environment is now? Is it not really so difficult as you thought? Are there any risks that you see and related to that Boeing reduced employment 6% last year, but you just said at the start of the call that the tax cuts give you an opportunity to create more quality jobs? Does Boeing plan to add significantly to its employment this year and if so, where and why? Thanks. Dennis Muilenburg : Alwyn on the first part of your question, the competitive environment is tougher than ever. And it's not getting any easier. The fact is we operate in a very attractive market space. It's about $7.5 trillion market over the next ten years. It's a growing market. I\u2019d say it's probably the most attractive industrial market in the world. And as a result, it's attracting more competition both at the OEM level and at the supply chain level. So, we expect the competition to only get tougher. And our focus is to make Boeing ever tougher from a completive standpoint as well. So, it's really important that we continue to drive our competitive efforts, our affordability actions. So that we can compete and win in the marketplace. And really important to note that as we drive our affordability actions that creates our fuel for the future. Our business is based on self-generated R&D and innovation and investment. And that is a cycle that we need to continue to stay in front of them. We\u2019re going to continue to drive affordability so that we can invest in the future. Now regarding employment levels, you're right, we have come down significantly over the last few years. We've done that in a way that is respectful as possible of our people, managing it through primarily through natural attrition and voluntary layoffs. While we\u2019ve had reductions in that we've also continued to hire on the front end of our talent pipeline, literally thousands of people over the last three years as we continue to refresh our talent pipeline. We're going to continue that balanced approach as well. More of an employment plateau in the near-term, but we still have reductions in some areas, other areas where we'll increase. Those are natural ebbs and flows of our various programs. But while we do that we're going to continue to keep our talent pipeline fresh and continue to invest in our people. So that we can win in the future. Operator : And we\u2019ll go to Jon Ostrower with CNN. Please go ahead. Jon Ostrower : Question about the discussions with Embraer. How much of the outcome of that strategic plan is coupled with completing the business case for NMA? Is that a large component of your thinking around a new airplane for 2024, 2025. And in terms of bigger and broader question on the tie up, how is this particular strategic arrangement going to position you with China in mind specifically as the future competitors given what Alwyn was asking? Dennis Muilenburg : Hi, Jon. First of all, the work that we\u2019re doing on middle of the market and the Embraer action are two separate activities, they\u2019re not dependent on each other or influencing each other. And I would expect that to continue to be case. Now that said, our discussions with Embraer, those are discussions that have been going for a relatively long period because we do see complementary combination between our companies with complementary product lines, verticals capabilities, services capabilities and innovation and talent investments. But those are all advantages that would span multiple marketplaces around the globe. Certainly, that combination could make us more competitive globally, but our strategy is not dependent on it. And our primary focus for the future will continue to be organic growth investments as our primary strategic growth path. Maurita Sutedja : Okay. I think operator that wraps our call. Thank you very much for everyone being with us today. And I think that concludes the end of our earnings call for fourth quarter 2017. Thank you very much.",

Tim Hepher - Reuters Jacqueline Klimas - POLITICO LLC Marcus Weisgerber - Government Media Executive Group LLC Operator : Good day everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analyst and media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcast live over the internet. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I am turning the call over to Ms. Maurita Sutedja, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Co. Please go ahead. Maurita B. Sutedja - The Boeing Co.: Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. I am Maurita Sutedja, and with me today is Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Enterprise Performance and Strategy. After management comments we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. We have provided detailed financial information in today's press release and you can follow the broadcast and presentation through our website at boeing.com. Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals in our discussion today are likely to involve risks which is detailed in our news release, various SEC filings and the forward looking statement disclaimer in the presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook. Now I will turn the call over to Dennis Muilenburg. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Thank you, Maurita, and good morning. Let me begin today with a brief overview of our first quarter operating performance followed by an update on the business environment and our expectations going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook. Now let's move to slide 2. Thanks to the dedicated efforts of employees throughout our company, Boeing delivered strong first quarter 2018 financial results that included higher revenue, earnings and operating cash flow, driven by solid execution on production programs and services. During the quarter, we generated $3.1 billion of operating cash and repurchased $3 billion of Boeing stock. We also paid $1 billion in dividends, reflecting a 20% increase in dividends per share from last year. We continued to deliver on our commitments of returning cash to shareholders while investing in our people, innovation and future growth. Revenue in the first quarter was $23.4 billion on higher volume of commercial deliveries and mix, along with services and defense contract volume. Core earnings per share of $3.64 was driven by strong performance across the businesses, volume and mix and lower tax rate. Based on our strong first quarter 2018 performance, we are raising full year guidance for operating cash flow, earnings per share, and Commercial Airplane's operating margins. Greg will discuss these in more detail shortly. Now let's look at the first quarter operating performance of our businesses. For the quarter, Commercial Airplanes generated revenue of $13.7 billion, reflecting 184 deliveries with operating margins of 11.0%. Continued healthy sales activity contributed to 221 net new airplane orders worth $18 billion during the quarter, adding to our robust backlog that stands at more than 5,800 airplanes and is worth $415 billion. Key commercial milestones in the quarter included the delivery of the first 787-10 Dreamliner to Singapore Airlines and the first 737 MAX 9 to Lion Air group. We achieved first flight of the 737 MAX 7, completed firm configuration on the 737 MAX 10 and hit the 10,000th production milestone for the 737 program. The smooth introduction of the 737 MAX into our production and delivery stream continued with 36 737 MAXs delivered in the quarter. On the 767 program, after carefully assessing market conditions and customer demand, we plan to increase the rate of production from 2.5 to three per month beginning in 2020. Today's 767 freighters are the best they've ever been and the demand for the 767 continues to grow from both freight and military customers around the world. In the quarter, we started building the first 777X fuselage for structural testing as this exciting development program remains on track. Additionally, our partner, GE, achieved the first flight test of the GE9X engine. Now over to Defense, Space & Security. BDS reported first quarter revenue of $5.8 billion, reflecting international fighters and weapons volumes and the final C-17 sale with operating margins of 11.3%. The $12 billion of new orders booked by BDS during the quarter demonstrates the value we bring to our customers across our Defense, Space & Security portfolio. These orders included the Missile Defense Agency's sole source contract extension to Boeing for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense program, an initial contract for 28 F-18 Super Hornets for Kuwait, a contract for the final C-17 for India and a Joint Direct Attack Munition kits contract for the U.S. Air Force. Key milestones for BDS included the second commercial cruise spacecraft achieving power-on and delivery of the space launch system's intertank hardware to NASA for testing and integration. In the quarter, the KC-46 Tanker program achieved a successful refueling flight between two KC-46 tankers, which completed the required supplemental type certificate fuel onload testing. Additionally, earlier this month, we completed all planned supplemental type certificate flight tests for the Tanker program, a very significant milestone that we've been aiming towards since we took first flight three years ago. We are making steady progress, closing out technical risk on the path to final certification and to delivering the first 18 tankers this year. We remain confident in the long-term value of this franchise. Turning to Global Services, BGS reported revenue of $3.9 billion with operating margins of 16.3%, reflecting higher commercial volume along with product and services mix. During the quarter, BGS won new business totaling approximately $5 billion that demonstrates the value that we bring to our broad range of commercial and government customers. These included an F-15 Saudi support contract award, a follow-on contract to support the Royal Canadian Air Force's Chinook fleet and the landing gear exchange contract for Aeromexico. These orders highlight the strength of our One Boeing offerings. Also in the quarter, BGS completed flight testing for the 737 Boeing Converted Freighter Program and signed a new distribution agreement with GE for T700 engines. In summary, we delivered another quarter of strong operating performance, captured noteworthy additions to our large and diverse backlog and returned significant cash to shareholders. With that, let's turn to the business environment on slide 3. We continue to see healthy global demand in our commercial, defense, space and services markets. These markets are growing and sizable at $7.6 trillion over the next 10 years. In the commercial airplanes market, airlines continue to report robust profits and strong passenger traffic, outpacing global GDP. Passenger traffic in 2018 grew nearly 6% through February. Meanwhile, cargo traffic maintained its strong momentum, growing by 7.7% in 2018 through February, as we see trade and industrial production growing in all regions. Our global customers continue to recognize the compelling value proposition that our new more fuel-efficient product family brings to the market, as reflected in the healthy new order intake we've seen year-to-date. We continue to see the trend of diverse and balanced demand from a geographical perspective, as well as across the spectrum of airline business models. There also is more balanced demand between fleet growth and replacement of older aircraft, and we are seeing more consistent and stable customer purchasing patterns. We believe the evolution in key market dynamics in the aggregate are driving greater stability and far less cyclicality for our industry. Over the long term, we remain highly confident in our commercial market outlook which forecasts demand for approximately 41,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years, comprised of more than 29,500 aircraft in the narrow-body market and approximately 9,100 aircraft in the wide-body market. This long-term demand, combined with healthy market conditions and a robust backlog, provides a solid foundation for our planned production rates. Turning to our product segments. Starting with the narrow-body, our planned production rate for the 737 going to 52 per month this year and 57 in 2019 is based on our backlog of more than 4,600 aircraft and a production skyline that is sold out into early next decade. We continue to assess the upward market pressure on the 737 production rate. In the wide-body segment, we have seen steady orders for the 787 and 777 airplanes and have high confidence in a meaningful increase in wide-body replacement demand early next decade. For the current generation 777, we received five net new orders in the quarter, bringing the backlog to 90 aircraft. We continue to make progress on the 777 bridge as highlighted by these orders and the recent letter of intent from Qatar Airways for five 777 freighters. As we transition production to the 777X, we expect 777 deliveries of approximately 3.5 per month in 2018 and 2019, as previously announced. While we still have more work to do to fill the remaining 777 production slots, based on our progress of maturing commitments into firm orders, managing the skyline and working new campaigns, we continue to believe the rate plan we put in place establishes a floor for the program and supports our production bridge from the current 777 to the 777X. As we look forward to the 777X, we have a strong foundation of 340 orders and commitments that support our plan for ramping up production and delivery of this new aircraft. We also captured 24 orders for the 787 Dreamliner family in the quarter, a solid platform for long-term production. With more than 630 firm orders in our backlog, our plan to increase Dreamliner production to 14 airplanes a month in 2019 is well supported. We continue to see repeat orders for the 787 Dreamliner, as demonstrated by the order from American Airlines earlier this month for an additional 47 787s. And the recent Hawaiian Airlines decision to select the 787 as its flagship airplane for medium to long haul flights highlights the strong market preference for the 787 and its superior value. Turning to our 747 and 767 programs. With our unmatched freighter product lines, we are well positioned to capture the increased cargo demand. During the quarter, UPS ordered 18 incremental freighters including 14 747-8s and 4 767s. We remain focused on our long-term strategy to capitalize on the strength of the aerospace industry fundamentals. It is important to have this in perspective as we navigate through global trade discussions. Boeing is a global company with operations around the world supporting commercial and government customers in more than 150 countries. We are continually working in a range of geopolitical and business environments. We maintain strong relationships with our customers, suppliers and other stakeholders around the world and continue in our own efforts to proactively engage the different governments. A strong and vibrant aerospace industry is important to global economic prosperity. Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid demand for our major platforms and programs. The final appropriation bill for fiscal year 2018 U.S. federal budget funds our key programs across our fixed wing, rotorcraft and commercial derivative aircraft and also missile, space and satellite products. With our portfolio of reliable, proven and affordable products, we continued to see strong support for our key products in the fiscal year 2019 President's budget. The highlights include increased funding for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense program and various programs in our weapons portfolio. Additionally, there continues to be support for increased procurement of the F-18 Super Hornet across the future year's defense plan. International demand for our defense and space offerings remains high as well, in particular for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters and satellites. As I mentioned earlier, we received an initial contract for 28 F-18 Super Hornets to Kuwait and a contract for the final C-17 to India. And we are making progress towards completing other previously announced international sales including additional Chinook helicopters for Spain and Saudi Arabia. Our investment in future growth and new sales continues in areas that are priorities for our customers such as commercial derivatives, rotorcrafts, satellites, services, human space exploration and autonomous systems. Much of that investment supports the priority we have placed on capturing future franchise programs where we are leveraging capabilities and technologies from across the enterprise for the T-X trainer, ground-based strategic deterrent, unmanned carrier-based MQ-25A and JSTARS recapitalization along with several other important opportunities. Turning to the services sector. We see the $2.6 trillion services market over the next 10 years as a significant growth opportunity for our company. In this market, both our commercial and defense customers remain focused on improving aircraft readiness and availability while driving improved operational efficiencies. BGS provides agile, cost competitive services to our customers worldwide. We aim to grow faster than the average services market growth of 3.5% as we further expand our broad portfolio of services offerings and continue to gain market share. Strong orders of $5 billion in the quarter along with other agreements announced earlier this year demonstrate the progress we are making in this key area. They reflect our customers' recognition of our value proposition in helping them optimize the performance of their fleets and reduce operational cost through the lifecycle. These activities stretch across BGS's four capability areas including parts, engineering modifications and maintenance, digital aviation and analytics and training and professional services. Earlier this month we announced a number of new products and services across the BGS portfolio including tools powered by Boeing AnalytX, such as self-service analytics and the Service Bulletin Value Tool. We also added new features to Aviator, an all-in-one app that provides centralized access to a seamless integrated suite of tools. These new service capabilities are driving lifecycle innovation in the form of faster flow times, lower operational costs and enhanced end-to-end reliability. As these tools are introduced to fleets, aircraft will become more efficient and less expensive to operate. Our focus remains on optimizing the businesses and expanding our portfolio offerings through organic growth investments such as vertical capabilities, complemented by strategic acquisitions to position BGS for sustained long-term and profitable growth. Our services expertise, the global reach of our business and our strong customer partnerships have us well positioned to compete and win in this important sector. Highlighting again the value we bring as One Boeing is the recently announced memorandum of agreement for a joint venture between Boeing and Saudi Arabian Military Industries to provide sustainment services for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia fleet of fixed and rotary wing military aircraft, demonstrating the strength of our comprehensive defense platform and services offerings. In summary, with growing markets and opportunities ahead, our team remains intensely focused on growth, innovation and accelerating productivity improvements to fuel our investments in the future. With that, Greg, over to you for our financial results. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Thanks, Dennis, and good morning everyone. Let's turn to slide 4 and we'll discuss our first quarter results. Revenue for the quarter was strong at $23.4 billion reflecting higher volume of commercial deliveries, favorable mix, along with improved service and defense volume. Core earnings per share of $3.64 reflect strong performance across the business, again driven by higher volume and improved mix along with a lower tax rate. All of these more than offset the additional tanker cost growth in the quarter of $81 million. Before we go into the business performance, I should also note that with the adoption of the new accounting standards including revenue recognition, as of the beginning of this year, we have adjusted our financial statements to comply with these new standards. Let's now discuss Commercial Airplanes on slide 5. Our Commercial Airplane business revenue increased to $13.7 billion during the quarter, reflecting higher deliveries and improved mix. BCA operating margins increased to 11% driven by strong operating performance on production programs, reflecting the volume and mix and also timing of some period expense. BCA captured $18 billion in net orders during the first quarter and backlog remains very strong at $415 billion and more than 5,800 aircraft, equating to approximately seven years of production. On the 787 program, we delivered 34 aircraft and booked 24 net orders in the quarter and our team remains focused on improving 787 profitability and cash generation, driven by favorable delivery mix, additional supplier step-down pricing and a relentless effort to further drive internal and supply chain productivity. Let's now turn to Defense, Space & Security results on slide 6. First quarter revenue increased to $5.8 billion reflecting the sale of the final C-17 and higher international fighters and weapons volume. Our continued focus on productivity and execution resulted in margins growing to 11.3%. During the quarter, BDS won key contract awards worth $12 billion and our backlog stands at $50 billion with 36% of that from international customers. Let's turn now to Boeing Global Services results on slide 7. In the first quarter, Global Services revenue increased to $3.9 billion, reflecting higher commercial services volume. Year-over-year growth of 8% for the quarter meets our objective to outpace the average annual services market growth of 3.5%. BGS operating margins were strong at 16.3%, reflecting ongoing productivity efforts as well as mix of products and services. During the quarter, BGS won key contract awards worth approximately $5 billion and our service backlog now stands at $20 billion. BGS results were a testament to the teams and the enterprise focus on achieving top-line growth while maintaining disciplined execution. The key wins during the quarter underscore the strength of our One Boeing offerings to our customers. Let's turn now to cash flow on slide 8. Operating cash flow for the quarter was strong at $3.1 billion, driven by planned higher commercial production rates, strong operating performance across the business and favorable timing of receipts and expenditures. We remain focused and on track with our balanced cash deployment strategy, and in the first quarter we repurchased $3 billion of Boeing stock and paid $1 billion in dividends, reflecting a 20% increase in dividend per share from last year. We continue to anticipate completing the remaining $15 billion repurchase authorization over approximately the next two years. Since the end of 2012, we've returned $45 billion to shareholders through dividend and share repurchase at the same time we've invested in key strategic areas to ensure long-term sustainable growth for Boeing. We remain committed to returning approximately 100% of our free cash flow to investors, while continuing to invest in future growth opportunities. Let's move now to cash and debt balances on slide 9. We ended the quarter with nearly $10 billion of cash and marketable securities, and our cash position continues to provide us with flexibility to invest in innovation and profitable growth opportunities while again returning value back to our shareholders. Let's turn now to slide 10, and we'll discuss our outlook for 2018. As Dennis indicated earlier, due to our strong Q1 performance and our outlook for the year, we're raising 2018 earnings per share, BCA margin and cash flow guidance. We increased 2018 core earnings per share guidance by $0.50 to now be between $14.30 and $14.50. BCA margin guidance is increasing to approximately 11.5% from our prior guidance of greater than 11%, and operating cash flow guidance is increased to be between $15 billion and $15.5 billion from our prior guidance of approximately $15 billion. As we look towards the remainder of the year, we remain focused on strong execution and risk mitigation within our company and through without our supply chain. So in summary, our core operating engine continues to deliver strong results. We will continue to use a three business unit strategy as a key differentiator in the marketplace, make prudent investments, leverage the talent and innovation across the company. At the same time, we will continue to set challenging goals and objectives around elements of operations and support functions tied to profitability and efficiency to generate cash and improving working capital while delivering value to our customers. All of these will help us achieve our goal to grow year-over-year revenue, cash flow and margins. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for closing comments. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Thank you, Greg. With a strong first quarter on which to build continued momentum for the year, our team remains focused on further driving both growth and productivity. We would not have been able to achieve these strong results without the hard work and dedication of our employees and the great partnership with our customers and suppliers. In addition to the strong commercial airplane market dynamics I mentioned earlier in my remarks, we've taken our own actions to reduce cyclicality in our business. This includes remaining disciplined in our production rate decisions, de-risking our pension liabilities, strategically phasing our research and development spending, creating labor stability with long-term contracts and expanding our services business, which is also less cyclical. We have executed on our long-term strategy of robust and continuing organic growth investment and returning value to shareholders, complemented by strategic acquisitions that enhance and accelerate our growth plans. As the world's largest commercial airplane maker, our nation's second largest defense contractor, a global leader in space flight and a growing force in lifecycle services, we are as optimistic about our future and the future of our industry as we have ever been. Being a global company, we are continually working in a range of geopolitical and business environments. We maintain strong relationships with our customers, suppliers and other stakeholders around the world, and we will continue to engage in our own efforts to proactively work with different governments. Our priorities going forward are to leverage our unique One Boeing advantages, continue building strength on strength to deliver and improve on our commitments and to stretch beyond those plans and sharpen and accelerate our pace of progress on key enterprise growth and productivity efforts. Achieving these objectives will require a clear and consistent focus on the profitable ramp-up in Commercial Airplane production, continuing to strengthen our defense and space business, growing our integrated services business and leveraging the power of our three business unit strategy, delivering on our development programs, driving world-class levels of productivity and performance throughout the enterprise to fund our investments in innovation and growth, disciplined leading-edge investments and balanced value-creating cash deployment and continuing to develop and maintain the best team and talent in the industry, all of which position Boeing for continued market leadership, sustained top and bottom-line growth, and increasing value for our customers, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. With that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator : Our first question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Good morning, Doug. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Could you describe in more detail where you stand on your two most current new programs? And I guess specifically, on the MAX, are you comfortable with your ability to insulate the delivery ramp from supplier delays, such as the LEAP engine and Spirit fuselage? And then on the 777X, where do you see the greatest challenges in getting that airplane into service on schedule in 2020? And could there be any risk to free cash flow from that program other than early inventory build? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Hey, Doug. Let me take a cut at that and then, Greg, feel free to add anything in. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Sure. Yeah. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Hey first of all, on the MAX, again we're feeling very bullish about that program. The MAX introduction has gone well. The customer intros operationally have been effective. The airplane is performing well in the field. Reliability for the fleet in the field is very high, so we're pleased with the performance of the program. On the production systems side, feathering that into the mainline of the 737 factory overall has gone well. We're continuing to hit all of our customer delivery commitments. You notice that we delivered 36 MAXs in the first quarter. We expect about 40% to 45% of our 737 deliveries this year will be MAXs. That's right on plan. Now to your point, we're continuously keeping a very close eye on our supply chain. And while there's been some challenges in the LEAP engines, there's been some noted challenges in fuselages with Spirit, those are all issues that we're on top of. We're working very closely with our partners. They are responding well, and we're continuing to meet all of our customer delivery commitments. And we're going to keep a close eye on that. We're ever vigilant on our supply chain. We know there will be pressure points as we ramp up, but we're confident that we'll continue to ramp up and hit our delivery marks. On the 777X, just had a chance again to visit the team last week, and we're marching through the development program. We're now building the first static airplane. We're going to be building, or we're underway, on production on the first flight test airplane as well so you see real hardware coming together in the factory. The associated production system transformation for the 777X is being implemented. That includes some of the automation that we're building into the core 777 line to de-risk it for 777X. So we're marching right through the factory step-up as we implement 777X. We're going to be building those airplanes, getting into the flight test program and the program remains on track for 2020 delivery. Now again, any time we've got a big development program, Doug, as you point out, it's one that we keep a very close eye on. So daily the team is working 777X with great focus, great intensity, but the development program remains on track and the R&D profile that we committed to, the spend profile remains on track, getting to your point on cash management. So we're confident but again ever vigilant on our development program. Greg, you got anything you want to add? Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: No. I think you captured it well. Having the mid-body in the factory right now and watching the components coming into the factory and the team knocking down any risk that they have in place real-time. And I think some of the upfront work we did on de-risking is you're seeing that paying off but we're watching it closely. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Are there any points when you're seeing higher risk step in this process whether it's related to the wing, wing joined, final assembly, any timing that we should be cognizant of as you look at the next year or so? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: I think, Doug, the key wait points will be once the first static airplane is fully assembled and we get into tests of that airplane, getting into the flight test program on schedule as we get into next year will be important. So that'll be a key milestone for us and that's the point at which we hand off the airplane if you will from the ground laboratories, the simulation facilities where we've wrung out the risk and we get into the flight test program and then just executing on the flight test program. So those wait points will be visible as we head into next year and then of course getting to first delivery in 2020. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: You bet. Operator : Our next question is from Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Morning. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Good morning, Rob. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: So wanted to ask you on the reconfiguration of the aft section of the 787-8 for better production commonality and also these new orders that you've taken. It puts a little bit more life into that variant. Does that impact the configuration of a future NMA perhaps at the high end? And what's the latest status on timing for some kind of authority to offer on NMA? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Hey Rob, on your first question, we're very pleased with the progress we're making on the 787 production line overall and commonality between variants in the production system is a key part of that productivity plan. As you well know, we have very high commonality between the Dash 9 and 10 which is borne out in the early production costs on the 787-10 and so we're pleased with that progress. And then as you noted on the 787-8, there have been some opportunities to drive additional commonality in particular in the aft body between the Dash 8 and Dash 9. And that has shown up as flow time reductions in the factory, additional efficiency and cost reductions. And you're right, that has given us some additional life and strength in the 787-8 variant. That said, going forward, we still see more of the future mix being Dash 9s and 10s but fundamental strength in the Dash 8 as well. And we're going to continue to look for opportunities for production system commonality between the variants. To your second question on NMA, we continue to make progress on our studies there. Again, we have not made a launch decision at this point, but we're having very good discussions with our customers, continuing to hone details of not only the airplane but perhaps even more importantly the associated production system, taking a hard look at the business case. Timing of that decision is still to be determined as we work our way through the details. We have time to do our homework and do it well, but I will say we're making progress and clearly advancing our analysis. We still see that airplane, if we decide to launch, is a 2025 timeframe airplane in terms of entry into service, so we have time to do our homework. And the R&D profile for that airplane if we proceed would feather in very nicely on the backside of 777X. So from an overall cash deployment, cash management standpoint, we feel confident as well. So. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Dennis. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: We feel confident as well. So we'll do our homework and continue to stay very close to our customers and make sure we're meeting their future needs. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Dennis, what's the outer limit on when you'd have to make an announcement to launch to make that 2025 timeframe? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: We're not going to pin that down too tightly, Rob, because really this is about having the business case discipline and making sure we have crystal clarity on the future production system, which is part of our broader enterprise transformation. But this is something that we'll be getting to over the next year, if you want to put a rough bounding on it. Again, the idea is an airplane that would enter into service in the 2025 timeframe. So if you back off from that timeframe with our standard milestones, you'd be looking at a decision in that timeframe. But to me, this is not one where we're going to be making a decision just based on a schedule that we have to meet. This is about having a disciplined business case, a future production system and making sure that we're meeting our customers' future needs. This is really about providing value to our customers. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. Operator : Our next question's from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Morning, David. David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Wanted to follow up on 777X. So within your forecast that cash flow's going to continue to grow from here, what exactly are you assuming for 777X in terms of the inventory build over the next couple of years? And then following on that, how key is the reversal on Tanker, getting that delivered and that flowing from a big cash burn, I assume closer to cash breakeven to cash flow positive. How key is that to allowing for your forecast for free cash flow continuing to grow? Thank you. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, I mean, I'll start with Tanker, David. As you know, we're going to start delivering here this year. So it is important from a cash perspective when you look at the year-over-year from 2017 into 2018. And then beyond that, it's modest growth really from there. So this is kind of the transitional year on the program but also obviously from a cash perspective. I think when you look at the 777X, a lot of what you talked about is what's been taken into account in our forecast. So obviously, building the static aircraft and having those in inventory as well as the blanks that we're firing, the risk mitigation efforts that we're putting into the line is also taken into account combined with the production rate. I'll say kind of slow on ramp-up from there. So all of that is kind of taken into consideration as we talk about continued growing cash flow. Now other moving pieces around there are obviously significant. 787 going up in rate, 737 going up in rate as well, Dennis just talked about the 767 up slightly. So you got to kind of take all those into consideration, combined with some of the headwind we'll have on 777X. But we've bounded that in our forecast, and like I said, taken that into consideration around our commentary around growing cash flow. David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Greg, in terms of 777X actual inventory, are you thinking the equivalent of like 15 to 20 production aircraft in flow by the time you get the first delivery in 2020? Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: I think it's a little bit less than that, David. I mean again, you got the static aircraft and then you got the flight test aircraft that will be out operating and getting test points. So obviously those won't be delivered in the near term. So you've got that kind of built-up inventory along with the production rate ramp-up and the advances coming in on the 777X. So taking all that into consideration within that kind of that 2020, 2021 timeframe. David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Okay. Operator : Next we'll go to Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Good morning. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Hey, Sam. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Can you talk a little bit about the tariffs and the sanctions environment and really how that's impacting any customer discussions and then also how you're thinking about the impact on the supply chain? And how you do things, whether it's aluminum, titanium, et cetera? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: You bet. Yeah, Sam, as you might guess, this is something we're keeping a very close eye on. This is daily actions and daily vigilance on this topic. We're engaged with governments around the world. Obviously one of the hot topics right now is the U.S.-China trade relationship. We know aerospace is very important to both countries, and while some initial statements have been made about potential tariffs, none of those severe actions have been implemented. And we're frankly encouraged by the continuing dialogue. And we've heard from leadership in both countries that both are seeking to find negotiated positions that will be productive for both countries. The fact that the administration just announced a senior-level trip to China next week to have negotiations and continue the engaging dialogue I think is another positive indicator. So we're staying very engaged on that front. We know trade policy is very important. But this is not a surprise to us. We operate in a global environment. We have to deal with these kind of issues continuously, and we're going to stay very close to our customers and the governments as we proceed. But we're hopeful for a positive outcome from the discussions between the U.S. and China. More broadly on some of the other matters you mentioned, material costs, titanium supply chain, aluminum and so on, again we're not seeing anything there that's material effect right now. We're very engaged with our suppliers, as you might guess. Over many years we've been continuing to build alternative sources, and daily we're testing our supply chain for any pressure points. And that is a continuous process and one where we remain ever vigilant. And I think just the fact that you can see our production system continues to run well, we're continuing to meet our customer deliveries, it tells you that we're effectively managing that risk. And we're just going to stay very close to it, and our team is on a daily basis, hourly basis, engaged with our supply chain. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I feel like a few years ago there were some issues with regard to titanium, and you ended up carrying a little bit more than usual. Is there anything in terms of the inventory levels we should think about where you might do the same in terms of getting some additional buffer? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: No, Sam, we really don't see any changes there. Those actions that we took a few years ago, those were long-term actions. So we're still frankly benefiting from some of those actions. And that's allowed us to diversify our supply chain, maintain the right inventory levels, balance that around the world. And we're going to continue to actively manage that portfolio. Greg, you have anything to add? Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: No. You're absolutely right. You won't see any impact on the inventory, Sam. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good morning, guys. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Hi, Ron. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : It's really encouraging that the 767 rate's gone up on the heels of improving health in the air freight market. Can we look at that? Or do you guys see any other indicators that the large aircraft markets have stuff bigger than 787s? That, that segment of the market, 777, 777X, 74, we're starting to see at least the early stages of recovery there? Because it seems like that market really kind of got hit hard. And are we finally starting to see some pick-up there or not? I mean what's your sense on that? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, Ron, as you know, the freight cargo market had been down for a couple of years. We saw some re-strengthening last year, and we see further strengthening year-to-date. So I think as I mentioned in my comments, we see freight traffic growth at 7.7% so far this year through February. That's another encouraging sign. We do see long-term strength in that market. We're seeing it grow across all regions around the world. We're seeing general increases in trade levels and transport levels. E-commerce, the growth of e-commerce, is also fueling some of that. So we see this as a longer-term growth trend. That's part of what's factored into our decision to increase the 767 production rate from 2.5 to three per month in 2020. But as you noticed, we're also seeing increased orders for 777-Fs, 777 freighters, including the letter of intent from Qatar just this past quarter, as well as two additional birds for ANA. So we're seeing strength in those larger freighters. And the UPS order on 747s I think is another good indicator. So again, we're going to be, maintain a very balanced approach on our production delivery schedules and our production rates. But the fundamental strength in the freighter market is encouraging. And I would say our product lineup to support that demand is a really good lineup. So we're pleased with the fact we've got a portfolio with different airplane scales that can satisfy that growing need. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : But do you see that as a leading indicator for potential pick-up in passenger demand, for passenger jets I mean in that segment? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: I don't know that I see that as a indicator that would ripple into passengers. Those two marketplaces have some common catalysts. I'd say world GDP growth, trade growth, is something that can support passenger growth. But in many cases we've seen passenger growth be somewhat independent of GDP growth based more on just the fact that we see a rising population of travelers that are entering the market for the first time. So while an increased freighter market I'll say can be helpful to the passenger market, we see the passenger market growth being independently strong based on other factors. And that's why we continued to see sustained passenger growth of almost 6% so far this year and that is a long-term trend and we're seeing more and more new city pairs being connected. We're seeing global network traffic grow. We're seeing 100 million new passengers per year in Asia alone. And by our estimates, less than 20% of the world's population has even taken a single flight in their life. So you can see that passenger growth has a lot of headroom beyond what might be driven by cargo growth. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, great. Thank you guys. Operator : Our next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning everyone. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Hi, Noah. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Good morning. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Greg, what can you share with us about the change in the 787 cash unit accounting margin through the year, end of 2017 to end of 2018, that you're embedding in your cash flow outlook? Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Well, I mean you've got the obviously the improvement in mix that we've talked a lot about and you've seen how smooth the Dash 9 has entered into the production system as we planned and you've seen the ramp-up in deliveries there year-over-year. As well as the Dash 10, you've seen us hit significant milestones there, making our first deliveries, so again that mix will start to pick up some pace here throughout the year and into next year. You got the supplier step-down as we've talked about and then the including the additional productivity in the factory. But those are really the big elements, certainly mix being the biggest one. And the team's done a fantastic job of getting these airplanes not only certified but getting them into the production system on time and doing that smoothly. And that obviously is impacting the cash flow and improving the cash flow overall and of course improving the deferred production. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Sequentially you had a faster pace of deferred decline but on fewer units. So the sequential cash margin jump just looks pretty good compared to what it was the last few quarters. But you also have your seasonality of cash flow, total cash flow guidance quarter to quarter implies the first quarter is a little higher than normal. So I'm trying to figure out if you're assuming that the nice, looks like several hundred basis points of sequential change that you had in the quarter keeps going or if that slows down as you move through the year. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: No, I mean we expect continued increase in productivity and overall cash profile will improve on the 87 through the balance of the year. I mean like I said to you, the difference I think you saw here was primarily due to some mix and some step-down pricing. But I think because of the elements of you got three different variants in the production system and so on and that's why I keep kind of bringing you back to cash flow. Look at the overall cash flow of the program and that ties directly to the productivity, ties directly to the mix and the step-down in the supply chain that we've talked about a lot as we move through these blocks and you're seeing that improving. So I think the team is executing extremely well, not only in our factories but reaching back into the supply chain and improving the productivity there that's helping on the nonrecurring side, like things like the Dash 10 but also helping overall on the recurring side. You're going to continue to see improvement on the 787 going forward. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: You're welcome. Operator : Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Yes. Thank you very much. So your commercial profitability looked really good even if one excludes the lower R&D, certainly than we expected. Could you give us some color on that in terms of were there any increases in program accrual rates? Were there any increases in the block sizes? And lastly, given your R&D was so low in that quarter, it looks like it has to ramp very sharply to get to your full year bogey. Is that number perhaps a little bit conservative? Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, Cai, it's expected to ramp and that again is tied primarily to the profile that Dennis articulated earlier on the 777X. So that's what we plan, and look, if we see more opportunities with regards to R&D spending, we'll certainly capture them and we're as focused on that level of spending as we are of any level of spending in the company. So we do have challenging targets out there for the team but they're achievable. But there's some timing elements that come in from quarter-to-quarter. So we do expect the back half to be a little richer in R&D. As far as block extensions, we extended the 737 by 200 units and then the 767. And then as far as booking rate changes, we saw an increase really kind of very slightly but across the board on all programs. So good core performance, and again, I think the productivity focus we've had for the last number of years and continuing on that path and sharing of best practices across the entire company and leveraging that, at the same time getting out into the supply chain and taking these best practices out and allowing them to be more efficient and sharing the benefit of that on our overall program performances continues to be the objective. But there's a lot of focus and energy around it. Team's doing a great job but plenty more for us to do here. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, Cai, just to reinforce Greg's last point there, that fundamental productivity machine, that's a relentless effort that we have the whole enterprise just focused on. And the longer-term goal we set to drive our business to mid teen margins and what you see in this quarter is another step of progress towards that longer-term goal and we expect to make sustained progress on margin expansion across all of our businesses. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thank you very much. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: You're welcome. Maurita B. Sutedja - The Boeing Co.: Operator, we have time for one more analyst's question. Operator : And that will be from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : Hey. Good morning guys. Nice quarter. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Good morning. Thanks, Carter. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Thanks, Carter. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : Just a couple quick points of clarification if I can, Greg. On the unit profitability versus program, was that good 787 offsetting anything material in the other programs or did you have a contribution from any of the others in a positive sense? And then on BGS, I think you commented around favorable mix. Can you just help us, since BGS is new to all of us, understand what that means and what we should expect in mix terms? Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, well maybe I'll start there. I mean as you know, this is a breadth of a portfolio and a lot of contracts, so you're going to see variability quarter-over-quarter, but like as Dennis just articulated, we've set objectives for ourselves to drive not only a top line but bottom line and margin overall productivity. So the team's getting their arms around. We've talked some of the backroom opportunities as we brought these two businesses together and really leveraging again some of the, I'll say kind of core operational aspects of the business at the same time grow the top line. So you're going to see some variability in there, but net-net the objective is to continue to grow those margins and we think there's good opportunity to do that, at the same time deliver better value to our customers. So just kind of like I said watch quarter-over-quarter. You're going to see some variance and really that's just contract mix in there. But overall, expect margin expansion for that business. On the program versus unit, obviously the biggest difference here from what we've talked prior quarters is we have no more 787 early builds. So it's a lot cleaner I'll say comparison when you look at unit versus program, and again you're seeing the fundamentals on the unit basis of improvement productivity taking place unit after unit and looking for further opportunity. And you saw that in the quarter. So a lot of the productivity initiatives that we've had in place, teams continuing to focus on them and chip away at them and obviously, they're impacting unit and therefore they're impacting the cash profile. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : Is there anything material outside of the 787 program in either direction? Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: No, not really, Carter. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: You're welcome. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that completes the analysts' question-and-answer session. I will now return you to The Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Mr. Phil Musser, Senior Vice President of Communications. Please go ahead Phil Musser - The Boeing Co.: Thank you. We'll continue now with media questions for Dennis and Greg. If you have questions following this part of the session, please contact the Media Relations team here in Chicago. Operator, we're ready for the first question. And in the interest of time, we'd ask you please that you limit your questions to just one. Thank you. Operator : And first go to Doug Cameron with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead. Doug Cameron - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.: Oh, great. Dennis, I'm a youngest child. I well remember my sisters used to push me to the front in front of my parents to ask for something or break some bad news, so here we go. It's about 20 years since you announced plans for the China Completion Center, maybe not quite 20 years, but can you just give us an update on that? I mean, how long does it take to build a big shed? And when do you actually expect to start putting aircraft through there? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Hey, Doug. Good morning. Hey, to your question, yeah, we've been engaged in China for a long time, as you point out. The new delivery and finishing center that we're building in Zhoushan is underway, so site preparation has been initiated. Construction is under way. We're still driving towards a goal of beginning to have operational capability towards the end of this year. We're working very closely with our Chinese partners to drive that to closure. So we're in stride. We're on track to open that capability, and it will be something in the near term. Operator : Our next question is from Tim Hepher with Reuters. Please go ahead. Tim Hepher - Reuters: Hi, Dennis. Can you hear me? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, got you, Tim. Good morning. Tim Hepher - Reuters: Hi. Good morning. Thank you very much. You mentioned where you were talking about some of the various sanctions issues amongst the geopolitical problems. Of course, an important one is Iran, and that we understand is completely out of your hands. You've said very clearly you will follow U.S. policy. But presumably you must be planning what to do. You must have some contingency plans for the 15 777-300ERs that you were supposed to sell them. I believe, if I'm not mistaken, the first one was originally due to be delivered this month. So have you had a chance to examine whether if that deal does collapse, you would have to cut 777 production further, bearing in mind that when you last adjusted production you said that your target incorporated the Iran order? And could you just tell us roughly how many aircraft would have been involved this year and next year? Thanks. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, Tim, we're continuing to manage our overall 777 production skyline very effectively and understand the risks and implications around the Iranian aircraft deal. First and foremost, it's important again to restate that we continue to follow the U.S. government's lead here, and everything is being done per that process. We have no Iranian deliveries that are scheduled or part of the skyline this year, so those have been deferred again in line with the U.S. government process. And I can tell you with confidence that we've continued to build risk mitigation into our 777 production plan. The plan that we outlined for you, the production rate that we've put in place is not dependent on the Iranian orders. If those orders do come to fruition, if we do ultimately deliver airplanes, those represent opportunities for us. Again, we're going to follow the U.S. government's lead and we've ensured that from a skyline management standpoint and from a production systems standpoint, we are not dependent on those aircraft. And the good news is that the fundamental strength of the 777 product line and the increased sales volume that we're seeing in the marketplace both for 777-300ERs and for the 777 freighters has only bolstered our confidence in that line. And while we still have some work to do to fill out the remainder of the 777 bridge, we're steadily marching through that, and we think we're well positioned. So as I said earlier, the production system delivery plan, the skyline, the delivery rate that we've already announced we think represents a solid position for that program and we're on track to bridge to the 777X. Operator : Next question is from Jacqueline Klimas with POLITICO. Please go ahead. Jacqueline Klimas - POLITICO LLC : Hi. Thanks so much for doing this. I'm hoping you guys can talk a little bit about how or whether the administration's focus on space and the proposed budget increase in the space program is impacting Boeing's investment and prioritization of its space business segment. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, Jacqueline. Good morning and thank you for the question there. We continue to see the space segment and human space flight in particular as one of our key investment areas going forward. We're encouraged by the administration's support and strong leadership on that topic. That includes funding for NASA programs, among those the Commercial Crew Program where we're marching through the milestones on our CST-100 Starliner, as well as support for the space launch system program and deep space exploration. We do think strong and continued funding of those NASA programs is really important to our country, and that sustained funding and support that we're seeing from the administration is very encouraging. I also think the reinstitution of the National Space Council under Vice President Pence's leadership and guidance, along with President Trump, has been a very important step. We're encouraged by that as well. And we're continuing to invest in that area. We do see it as an important business segment for our future. And Boeing has had a leadership role in human space exploration since it was invented, and we continue to expect to lead in that field. Phil Musser - The Boeing Co.: Great. Operator, we have time for one more question from media. Operator : And that will be from Marcus Weisgerber with Defense One. Please go ahead. Marcus Weisgerber - Government Media Executive Group LLC : Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Dennis, about two years ago the narrative on St. Louis was pretty grim, mostly alluding to the end of fighter production. Now you have the President of the United States actually sitting in a Super Hornet. I was wondering if you can reflect kind of on the turnaround of the defense business in recent years and how politics and the recent budget deal is changing your outlook for the defense business. Thank you. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, Marcus, thanks for your question there. I'd say first of all, from a macro standpoint, again we're encouraged by the strength of the U.S. defense budget. And I think after several years of having to endure the damage of sequestration and a challenging defense budget, we're now seeing reemerging strength of that budget supported by both parties, and we're encouraged by the future year plans that we've seen. And that is something that has bolstered our expectations for our defense business going forward. Now in particular to St. Louis, the support for individual programs there has been strong both domestically and internationally. Our weapons business, which is based there, has been strong and we're continuing to see growth there in a number of programs and our fighter business. And that includes F-15 international sales as well as upgrades to the F-15 fleet domestically. And perhaps most encouragingly is the progress we're seeing on the F-18 Super Hornet line. And I think it's a testament to the quality of the product. You can hear our customers are very supportive. The U.S. Navy and what that airplane is doing for them every day in the fleet is important. And we have a great program that's producing capability that our customers need. And we're looking forward to continuing to grow that program going forward. As you noted, a couple years ago, we had some questions about that production line. We can now see both the F-18 and the F-15 production lines extending far into next decade. And one good example of that is in the five-year future defense plan, we see a Navy request now for 110 new Super Hornets as well as the Service Life Extension Program for the existing Super Hornet fleet. So we're bullish about the fighter lines for the future. Phil Musser - The Boeing Co.: Thank you, Dennis. That concludes our earnings call for today. Again, for members of the media, if you have further questions, please call our Media Relations team at 312-544-2002 or contact us via e-mail. Thank you very much.",

We have provided detailed financial information in today's press release and you can follow the broadcast and presentation through our website at boeing.com. Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals in our discussion today are likely to involve risks, which is detailed in our news release, various SEC filings and the forward-looking statement disclaimer in the presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook. Now, I will turn the call over to Dennis Muilenburg. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Thank you, Maurita, and good morning. Let me begin today with a brief overview of our second quarter operating performance, followed by an update on the business environment and our expectations going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook. With that, let's move to slide 2. Thanks to the dedicated efforts of employees throughout our company, Boeing delivered strong second quarter 2018 financial results that included higher revenue and earnings and strong operating cash flow, driven by solid execution across the company. During the quarter, we generated $4.7 billion of operating cash and repurchased $3.0 billion of Boeing stock. We also paid $1.0 billion in dividends, reflecting a 20% increase in dividends per share from last year. We continued to deliver on our commitment to returning cash to shareholders, while investing in our people, innovation and future growth. Revenue in the second quarter was $24.3 billion, reflecting higher volume of commercial deliveries and favorable mix, along with services and defense contract volume. Core earnings per share of $3.33 was driven by strong performance across the businesses, volume and mix and lower tax rate, partially offset by a write off due to the previously announced Spirit litigation outcome and cost growth on the KC-46 Tanker program, which I'll address shortly. For the full-year, we are raising guidance for revenue to reflect higher volume at BDS and BGS. Additionally, we are adjusting BCA and BDS segment operating margin guidance. Greg will discuss these in more detail in his section. Before we delve into the second quarter operating performance for our businesses, let me spend a minute on the KC-46 Tanker program. We continue to make steady progress towards final certification for the KC-46 Tanker and recently completed all flight tests required to deliver the first aircraft, which is expected to be in October of this year, as now agreed upon with the U.S. Air Force. This is a significant milestone for us and our customer, representing the culmination of three years of testing and over 3,300 flight hours. However, the program did see additional costs growth in the quarter of $334 million after-tax, primarily due to higher estimated costs of incorporating changes into six flight tests and two early build aircraft, as well as additional costs as we progress through the late-stage testing and certification process. Regarding these flight test and early build aircraft, as flight testing to support the first delivery was completed, and final configuration of each aircraft has been defined, the plan to complete manufacturing of these eight aircraft is now clear and firmed up. While there is still a lot of work ahead of us, we now have a very clear line of sight what is needed to deliver these highly, mission-capable aircraft to our customers. We remain confident in the long-term value of this franchise, a program that is going to have a production run measured in hundreds of airplanes and decades of follow-on support and training. With that, now let's look at Commercial Airplanes. For the quarter, Commercial Airplanes generated revenue of $14.5 billion, reflecting 194 deliveries, with operating margins of 11.4%. Continued healthy sales activity contributed to 239 net new airplane orders worth $16 billion during the quarter, including 91 wide-body orders, adding to our robust backlog that stands at nearly 5,900 airplanes and is worth $416 billion. Year-to-date, we have captured over 900 net new orders and commitments. The 737 MAX program marked its one-year anniversary of entering revenue flight service in the quarter and its production ramp-up continued. To-date, we have delivered 162 MAX's, with 52 of them delivered in the quarter. As for the 777X program, in the quarter, we moved the first two test airplanes into the low-rate initial production line in the main factory and we also began the systems testing for this exciting development program. We remain on track for first 777X delivery in 2020. Now, over to Defense, Space & Security. BDS reported second quarter revenue of $5.6 billion, reflecting the Kuwait F-18 production contract award and higher weapons volume with operating margins of 9.3%. The $7 billion of new orders booked by BDS during the quarter demonstrates the value we bring to our customers across our Defense, Space & Security portfolio. These orders included finalization of the production contract for 28 F-18 Super Hornets to Kuwait, an additional order for 18 F-18 Super Hornets for the U.S. Navy and three P-8 Poseidon aircraft for the U.S. Navy, as well as a multiyear contract for 58 V-22 Osprey aircraft. Key milestones for BDS included induction of the first F-18 aircraft into the Service Life Modification program, two successful tests for the U.S. Air Force's Minuteman III, and production of the 100th P-8 aircraft. On the commercial satellites side, we successfully completed the O3b mPOWER preliminary design review with SES. Turning to Global Services. Our integrated services business completed its first full-year of operation at the end of the quarter. BGS reported second quarter revenue of $4.1 billion with operating margins of 14.7%, reflecting higher volume along with product and services mix. During the quarter, BGS won new business totaling approximately $4 billion that demonstrates the value that we bring to our broad range of commercial and government customers. These included an F-18 depot maintenance contract for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, a Global Fleet Care contract for Primera Air's 737 fleet and performance-based logistics contracts to support the Netherlands' rotorcraft fleet. These orders highlight the strength of our One Boeing offerings. Additionally, BGS delivered its first 737 Boeing Converted Freighter in the quarter. As part of our growth strategy of complementing organic investments with selected strategic acquisitions; in May, we announced our agreement to acquire KLX, a major provider of aviation parts and services. By combining the talent and product offerings of our Aviall business and KLX, we'll provide a one-stop shop that will benefit our supply chain and our customers in a meaningful way. Also, in the quarter, we announced a proposed partnership with Safran to jointly design, build and service auxiliary power units. This move will strengthen Boeing's vertical capabilities as we continue to expand our services portfolio and make strategic investments that accelerate our growth plans. In summary, we delivered another quarter of strong operating performance, captured noteworthy additions to our large and diverse backlog, returned significant cash to shareholders and complemented our organic growth with planned, strategic, inorganic investments. With that, let's turn to the business environment on slide 3. We continue to see healthy global demand in our commercial defense, space and services markets. We've recently revised the size of these growing markets upward to $8.1 trillion over the next 10 years. In the Commercial Airplanes market, airlines continue to report robust profits and strong passenger traffic, outpacing global GDP. Passenger traffic in 2018 grew 6.8% through May. Meanwhile, cargo traffic maintained its strong momentum, growing by 5.3% in 2018 through May, as we see trade and industrial production growing in all regions. Our global customers continue to recognize the compelling value proposition that our new more fuel-efficient product family brings to the market, as reflected in the healthy new order intake we've seen year-to-date. We continue to see the trend of diverse and balanced demand from a geographical perspective, as well as across the spectrum of airline business models. The changing nature of travel, with the expansion of network city pairs and rising middle-class population in emerging markets, have fundamentally expanded traffic patterns and underpinned sustained growth. There also is more balanced demand between fleet growth and replacement of older aircraft, and we are seeing more consistent and stable customer purchasing patterns. We believe the evolution in key market dynamics, in the aggregate, is driving greater stability and far less cyclicality for our industry. Over the long-term, we remain highly confident in our commercial market outlook, which now forecast demand for nearly 43,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years, up from our previous outlook of approximately 41,000 airplanes. This is comprised of more than 31,000 aircraft in the narrow-body market and approximately 9,000 aircraft in the wide-body market. These deliveries, of which 44% will be driven by replacement demand, will double the size of the global fleet. This long-term demand, combined with healthy market conditions and a robust backlog, provides a solid foundation for our planned production rates. Turning to our product segments. Starting with the narrow-body, our production rate of 52 per month starting June of this year and planned increase to 57 in 2019 is based on our backlog of nearly 4,700 aircraft and a production skyline that is sold out into early next decade. We continue to assess the upward pressure on this 737 production rate. In the wide-body segment, we have seen steady orders for 787 and 777 airplanes and have high confidence in a meaningful increase in wide-body replacement demand early next decade. For the current generation 777, we received 19 net new orders in the quarter, bringing the backlog to 96 aircraft. The renewed strength in the air cargo sector has provided support for the 777 bridge, as highlighted by recent orders, which included incremental freighters for FedEx and DHL. Additionally, earlier this month, we finalized Qatar Airways' order for five 777 Freighters and received a letter of intent for 29, 777 Freighters from Volga-Dnepr and CargoLogicHolding. As we transition production to the 777X, we expect 777 deliveries of approximately 3.5 per month in 2018 and 2019, as previously announced. As you can see from the recent activities, we continue to make good progress on the 777 bridge, and while we still have some work to do in filling the remaining 777 production slots, in particular for 2020 and beyond, based on our progress of capturing new orders and commitments, managing the skyline and working new campaigns, we continue to believe the rate plan we've put in place establishes a floor for the program and supports our production bridge from the current 777 to the 777X. As we look forward to the 777X, we have a strong foundation of 340 orders and commitments that support our plan for ramping up production and delivery of this new aircraft. We also captured 59 orders for the 787 Dreamliner family in the quarter, a solid platform for long-term production. With more than 650 firm orders in our backlog, our plan to increase Dreamliner production to 14 airplanes a month in 2019 is well-supported. We continue to see repeat orders for the 787 Dreamliner, including from Qantas, Bank of China Aviation and United. These repeat orders, coupled with continuing attraction from new carriers such as Bamboo Airways' recent commitment for 20 787s, highlight the strong market preference for the 787 and its superior value. Turning to our 747 and 767 programs. With our unmatched freighter product lines, we are well-positioned to capture the increased cargo demand. During the quarter, FedEx announced an order for 12 incremental 767 Freighters. This further supports our 767 production rate increase from 2.5 per month to 3 per month in 2020. We remain focused on the strong long-term aerospace industry fundamentals, as highlighted by the continued strength of traffic. It is important to have this in perspective as we navigate through global trade discussions. As a global company with operations around the world, supporting commercial and government customers in more than 150 countries, Boeing maintained strong relationships with our customers, suppliers and other key stakeholders around the world. We will continue to engage with leaders in these countries to urge a productive dialog to resolve trade differences, highlighting the mutual economic benefits of a strong and prosperous aerospace industry. Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid demand for our major platforms and programs. The final appropriation bill for fiscal year 2018 U.S. federal budget funded our key programs across our fixed wing, rotorcraft and commercial derivative aircraft and our missile, space and satellite products. Boeing continues to see strong support for our key products in fiscal year 2019 President's budget and in Congress, including increased procurement of 110 F-18 Super Hornets across the future year defense plan and support for a fourth multiyear procurement for the F-18, and increases for various programs in our weapons and rotorcraft portfolios. The BDS portfolio is well-positioned with mature, world-class platforms to address current needs. International demand for our defense and space offerings remains high as well, in particular, for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters and satellites. As I mentioned earlier, we finalized a production contract for 28 F-18 Super Hornets for Kuwait and received a multiyear contract for the V-22 Osprey, which includes four aircraft for the government of Japan. Recently, New Zealand selected the Boeing P-8 Poseidon aircraft as its new maritime patrol aircraft. We are making progress towards completing other previously-announced international sales, including additional Chinook helicopters for Spain and Saudi Arabia. Our investment in future growth and new sales continues in areas that are priorities for our customers, such as commercial derivatives, rotorcraft, satellites, services, human space exploration and autonomous systems. Much of that investment supports the priority we have placed on capturing future franchise programs, where we're also leveraging capabilities and technologies from across the enterprise for the T-X trainer, Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, and the unmanned carrier-based MQ-25A along with several other important opportunities. Turning to the services sector. We see the $2.8 trillion services market over the next 10 years as a significant growth opportunity for our company. BGS provides agile, cost competitive services to our customers worldwide. We aim to grow faster than the average services market growth rate of 3.5% as we further expand our broad portfolio of services offerings and continue to gain market share. Strong orders of $4 billion in the quarter reflect our customers' recognition of our value proposition in helping them optimize the performance of their fleets and reduce operational cost through the lifecycle. These activities stretch across BGS's four capability areas; including parts, engineering, mods and maintenance, digital aviation and analytics and training and professional services. Our digital solutions powered by Boeing analytics provide airlines with advanced optimization and analysis, as illustrated by a recent contract from Etihad Airways to implement our crew management solutions to support the planning and operation of their 7,500 crew members. The flexibility and strength of our optimization and the crew management suite will allow Etihad to solve complex issues with ease, and support their decision-making process with detailed quantifications of risks and costs. Our focus remains on optimizing the businesses and expanding our portfolio offerings through organic growth investments, such as strengthening our vertical capabilities, complemented by strategic acquisitions, to position BGS for long-term sustained growth and profitable growth. Our expertise, the global reach of our business and our strong customer partnerships have us well-positioned to compete and win in this important sector. Before I close this business environment section, I would like to spend some time on Embraer. Consistent with our enterprise strategy of pursuing strategic investment opportunities where they demonstrate real value and accelerate our organic growth plans, earlier this month we signed an MOU with Embraer for formation of a joint venture comprising the commercial aircraft and services business of Embraer. This proposed partnership will strategically align with Boeing's commercial development, production, marketing, and lifecycle services operations, strengthen the vertical capabilities of Boeing and enhance value for our customers through industry-leading products and services. Additionally, we will create another joint venture to promote and develop new markets and applications for defense products and services, especially the KC-390 multi-mission aircraft. This comprehensive enterprise-wide collaboration with Embraer will create the most important strategic partnership in the aerospace industry, strengthening both companies' leadership in the global market and creating more value for both companies' customers, shareholders and employees. While this agreement is a significant step, a considerable amount of work remains. And in the coming months we'll continue to work with Embraer and its shareholders, the Brazilian government and regulators among others to complete the transaction. In summary, with growing markets and opportunities ahead, our team remains intensely focused on growth, innovation and accelerating productivity improvement to fuel our investments in the future. With that, Greg, over to you for our financial results. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Thanks, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to slide 4 and we'll discuss our second quarter results. Revenue for the quarter was strong at $24.3 billion, reflecting higher volume of Commercial Airplane deliveries, favorable mix, along with an increased volume at both Defense, Space & Security, as well as Boeing Global Services businesses. Core earnings per share of $3.33 reflect solid execution across the businesses, higher volume and improved mix, along with a lower tax rate. The results were partially offset by an after-tax charge of $124 million related to a receivable write-off due to the previously announced Spirit litigation outcome and cost growth of $334 million after-tax on the KC-46 Tanker program. As Dennis mentioned, we're raising our full-year revenue guidance to reflect higher volume at Defense, Space & Security and Global Services; and additionally, we are adjusting Commercial Airplane and Defense, Space & Security segment operating margins. I'll provide more details on our 2018 outlook further in my remarks. Now let's discuss Commercial Airplanes on slide 5. Our Commercial Airplane business revenue increased to $14.5 billion during the quarter reflecting higher deliveries and improved mix. BCA operating margins increased to 11.4%, driven by strong operating performance on production programs, higher 787 margins and timing of some period expense, partially offset by a $307 million pre-tax charge on the KC-46 Tanker program. Second quarter BCA operating margins excluding the Tanker charge were 13.3%. BCA captured $16 billion in net orders during the second quarter and the backlog remains very strong at $416 billion and nearly 5,900 aircraft equating to approximately seven years of production. On the 787 program, we delivered 38 aircraft and booked 59 net orders in the quarter; and additionally, we extended the 787 accounting block by 100 units. This resulted in higher margins on the program and, therefore, moderated the decline of deferred production balance this quarter. The overall cash profile of this program continues to improve through the improved mix, supplier step-down pricing and our team's day-to-day focus on improving 787 profitability and cash generation. Let's now turn to Defense, Space & Security results on slide 6. Second quarter revenue increased to $5.6 billion, driven by F/A-18 production contract award for Kuwait and higher weapons volume. BDS margins of 9.3% reflected our continued focus on productivity and execution, offset by $111 million pre-tax charge on the KC-46 Tanker program. Second quarter BDS operating margins excluding the Tanker charge were 11.2%. During the quarter, BDS won key contract awards worth $7 billion and our backlog stands at $52 billion with 35% of that from international customers. Turning now to Boeing Global Services results on slide 7. In the second quarter, Global Services revenue increased to $4.1 billion, reflecting higher volume, predominantly driven by increased parts sales. Year-over-year growth of 15% for the quarter and 11% in the first half of the year more than meets our objective to outpace the average annual service market growth rate of 3.5%. BGS operating margins were solid at 14.7%, reflecting ongoing productivity efforts, as well as mix of products and services in the quarter. During the quarter, BGS won key contract awards worth approximately $4 billion and our backlog now stands at $20 billion. This month marked the one-year anniversary of the launch of Boeing Global Services business and we're proud of the team's accomplishments. BGS results year-to-date are a testament to the team and the enterprise focus on achieving top-line growth, while maintaining disciplined execution. The key wins this year underscore the strength of the One Boeing offering to our customers. Let's now turn to cash flow on slide 8. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was strong at $4.7 billion, driven by planned higher Commercial Airplane rates, stronger operating performance across the business and timing of receipts and expenditures. Year-to-date, cash flow remained strong at $7.8 billion. We remain focused and on track with our balanced cash deployment strategy. In the second quarter, we repurchased $3 billion of Boeing stock and paid $1 billion in dividends, reflecting a 20% increase in dividend per-share from last year. We continue to anticipate completing the remaining $12 billion repurchase authorization over the next 18 months to 24 months. And since the end of 2012, we returned more than $48 billion to our shareholders through dividend and share repurchase. At the same time, we've invested more than $30 billion in key strategic areas to ensure long-term sustainable growth for Boeing and our customers. We remain committed to returning approximately 100% of free cash flow to investors, while continuing to invest in future growth opportunities. Let's move now to cash and debt balance on slide 9. We ended the quarter with nearly $10 billion of cash and marketable securities, lower debt levels and stable credit ratings. Our cash position continues to provide us with the flexibility to invest in innovation and profitable growth opportunities while again returning value to shareholders. Turning now to slide 10. And we'll discuss our outlook for 2018. For full-year guidance, we're raising revenue guidance by $1 billion to now be between $97 billion and $99 billion from our prior guidance of between $96 billion and $98 billion. The increase in revenue reflects the growth from key international fighter awards and higher weapons revenue for BDS and higher parts revenue for BGS. As a result, we're increasing guidance by $500 million to be between $22 billion and $23 billion for BDS and between $15.5 billion and $16 billion for BGS. We're also updating full-year BCA and BDS segment operating margin guidance to reflect BCA's strong performance and cost growth on the KC-46 Tanker program this quarter. BCA margin guidance is increased to now be greater than 11.5% from our prior guidance of approximately 11.5%, again reflecting strong performance and offsetting the growth on the Tanker program this quarter. BDS margin guidance is reduced to now be between 10% and 10.5% from our prior guidance of approximately 11%, again primarily due to reflecting of the impact of the KC-46 Tanker growth. The rest of the full-year guidance including EPS, cash flow and aircraft deliveries remain unchanged and by holding EPS and cash flow guidance we are absorbing the impact of the Tanker cost growth and Spirit litigation charge, offsetting that with performance. As we look toward the remainder of the year, we remain focused on strong execution, including development programs and risk mitigation within our company and throughout our supply chain. So in summary, our core operating engine continues to deliver strong results. We will continue to use our three-business-unit strategy as a key differentiator in the marketplace, make prudent investments and leverage talent and innovation across the company. At the same time, we'll set challenging goals and objectives around elements of operation and support functions tied to profitability and efficiency to generate cash and improve working capital, while delivering value to our customers. All of these will help us achieve our goal to grow year-over-year revenue, cash flow and margins. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: All right. Thank you, Greg. With a strong couple of quarters providing solid momentum for the year, our team remains focused on further driving both growth and productivity. We wouldn't have been able to achieve these strong results without the hard work and dedication of our employees and the great partnership we enjoy with our customers and suppliers. In addition to the strong Commercial Airplane market dynamics I mentioned earlier in my remarks, we have taken our own actions to reduce cyclicality in our business. This includes remaining disciplined in our production rate decisions, de-risking our pension liabilities, strategically phasing our research and development spending, creating labor stability with long-term contracts, and expanding our services business, which is also less cyclical. We've executed on our long-term strategy of robust and continuing organic growth investment in returning value to shareholders, complemented by strategic acquisitions and partnerships that enhance and accelerate our growth plans. The recently-announced planned strategic partnerships with Embraer and Safran and agreement to acquire KLX Aerospace are entirely consistent with this strategy. As the world's largest aerospace company spanning Commercial, Defense, Space and Services, we are as optimistic about our future and the future of our industry as we have ever been. Our priorities, going forward, are to leverage our unique One Boeing advantages, continue building strength on strength to deliver and improve on our commitments and to stretch beyond those plans and sharpen and accelerate our pace of progress on key enterprise growth and productivity efforts. Achieving these objectives will require a clear and consistent focus on the profitable ramp-up in Commercial Airplane production; continuing to strengthen our Defense and Space business; growing our integrated services business and leveraging the power of our three business unit strategy; delivering on our development programs; driving world-class levels of productivity and performance throughout the enterprise to fund our investments in innovation and growth; disciplined, leading-edge investments and balanced value-creating cash deployment; and continuing to develop and maintain the best team and talent in the industry, all of which position Boeing for continued market leadership, sustained top and bottom line growth, and increasing value for our customers, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. With that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator : As a reminder, in the interest of time, we are asking that you limit yourself to one single-part question. First, we'll go to the line of Peter Arment of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, Dennis, Greg. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Hey. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Hey. Good morning, Peter. Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Dennis, could you address the kind of the supply chain readiness, I guess, particularly on the narrow-body side? Some of the comments coming out of Farnborough is that the engine OEMs are still studying these higher rates and they don't seem to be ready to committing to them yet. Maybe if you could just give us some color. And do you still need that 18-month to 24-month kind of lead time to make a right decision? Thanks. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: You bet, Peter. Hey, first of all, very important that we continue to work with our supply chain on our overall production ramp-up. So, as I mentioned in my comments, we've just moved to 52 a month on the 737 line, as of June. We're still planning to ramp-up to 57 a month next year, and as I've mentioned in my comments, we continue to see upward pressure from the marketplace. We are selling and filling skyline out in the 2023 and beyond timeframe. Now in our current production system, while we see challenges and you've heard from our supply chain on some of the pressure points, things like fuselages and engines, which are well acknowledged and those are items we work on a day-to-day basis, we're continuing to ramp-up our supply chain and it's healthy and we're meeting our customer delivery requirements. And I think that's the key as we're continuing to hit on deliveries. And as we contemplate future rate increases, we're going to continue to look at the supply chain in an integrated manner. And there are no doubt pressure points as we ramp-up, that's why we need to continue to be very deliberate, very disciplined in these decisions. We've done that. We've done more than 20 rate breaks since 2010, so we know how to do this. We're going to continue to apply that same disciplined approach. But I will say that the market pressures indicate upward pressure, and as we approach our decision points with the lead times as you outlined, we'll do that in a very deliberate and disciplined manner. Operator : Next, we have the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is open. Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC : Good morning, everyone. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Good morning. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Good morning. Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC : Can we talk about commercial aircraft profitability? Given margins excluding the Tanker costs were over 13%, so maybe could you talk about the moving pieces as we move through the remainder of the year? Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, Sheila. Well, I mean, to-date, you've seen improvement kind of across the board on the production programs and obviously with the block extension on the 787, we've seen the results of that this quarter. And going forward, you're going to continue to see a lot of productivity efforts across the programs, but you're going to see some shifts in period expense, in particular, R&D. So, we'll have some more R&D in the back half and I think of that as just timing, primarily driven by 777X. And then, we've also got some investments that we're making around productivity in the back half that aren't reflected in the first half. So, I'd say, those are the big moving pieces, but we're seeing obviously great performance across the board. Obviously a lot of focus, in particular, around taking best practices across the enterprise, and bringing them not only to Commercial Airplanes but across all of the portfolio. So there's a lot more, I'd say, One Boeing effort going on leveraging best practices and we're going to continue to do that as we strive to increase margins and cash flow going forward as Dennis and I have articulated. Operator : Next, we have the line of Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much, and good morning. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Good morning. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I wonder. Good morning. If you guys could talk a little bit about the cash flow profile of the Tanker program from here and maybe thinking about a couple of the different elements, including any additional cash that might be needed on other aircraft that are in inventory beyond the ones that you mentioned? Any penalties that the Air Force might be entitled to, along with on the positive side the inventory reduction that comes from the deliveries? Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, I'd say, Seth, obviously Tanker is going to continue to improve the cash profile going forward as we make more progress and then reach the milestones that Dennis articulated in the first delivery, there being in October. So, we've got a number obviously of aircraft in work now and as we deplete that inventory and start delivery, you'll see improved cash in the years to come. So, it won't be anything near-term, everything has been contemplated on the near-term for the balance of this year. But even as we talked about cash flow growing going forward, this is a key element of that, but not a significant moving piece when you think about the broader, I'll say cash levers of the company. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: And, Seth, just to add a little more color on Tanker itself, I think a key thing to note, again in the quarter as I mentioned, while we took the charge on those early-build aircraft and flight test aircraft, I think, it's very important to note the milestone we achieved in the quarter of completing all of the flight testing associated with first delivery, getting all of our artifacts submitted for final certification, and getting crystal clarity on what is left to build out these aircraft. So, we have a known configuration, flight testing is completed. Now, we need to finish the work to get to delivery and that'll produce the results that Greg mentioned. Operator : And next, we have the line of Rajeev Lalwani of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, Dennis. Hi, Greg. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Good morning, Rajeev. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just given, staying on the Tanker, obviously, you've had some challenges on the program, you've managed them reasonably well; but as we look forward to the 777X and maybe the NMA, what are you doing to just de-risk those programs so that you don't have similar obstacles like you did on the Tanker? Is it more of a digital approach? Or are you trying to manage a timeline a bit? Just some color there to help us get comfortable with any risk going forward? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: You bet. Yeah, Rajeev, on that we've got a very focused effort on enterprise development programs and lessons learned and learning from each of the programs as we execute them. And while Tankers had its challenges, we have learned a lot through that process, especially in our commercial derivative lines and how we do development programs that span our commercial production, and military certification requirements. Tanker was especially complex because of the multiple certifications required both commercial and military. That's not a complexity that we have on a product like 777X or NMA. That said, several lessons learned. One includes digitizing our engineering at a more detailed level upfront. This is the model based engineering initiatives that we have underway, as an example. Also, more significant investments in system integration labs upfront to de-risk development and eliminate downstream discoveries, and that's been very effective for us on 777X, and also some of the early prototyping in the production systems, again to de-risk key areas as we move into the production flow. And we're seeing that reflected again on 777X as the first two airplanes have now moved into the low-rate initial production line. All of these early de-risking steps are showing up in a positive way on 777X and we're going to be keeping a close eye on that as we build-out the flight test aircraft and move into flight test; but given that we're into the heart of 777X right now, we've got a healthy development program on track to deliver on 2020 as scheduled. We're seeing clear signs of improvement in our overall development program process. So, that's our headset going forward and we'll continue to learn. I think this is one of the benefits of our phased R&D approach. Rather than doing multiple development programs in parallel, we're now doing a much more sequential approach, so that we can learn program-to-program and continue to reduce risk going forward. Operator : Next, we have the line of Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey. Thank you. Good morning. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Morning. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Hi, Hunter. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey. So, you talked about mix driving some pressure on BGS margins and I think you called out parts sales as a driver of the top line. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Yeah. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : As we learn more about this business, what are some of the moving parts that help and hurt mix there that we should think about going forward and whether that's like by end-market or contract type? And the second part of the question is, as the business fills up, would you may be willing to trade a little bit of margin for some top line opportunities? Thanks. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, Hunter, you're right. I mean, it's a very different portfolio than the other businesses, so you're dealing with thousands of contracts and a couple million different, I'll say, kind of offerings through parts or other services. So with that, just the nature of that business, you're going to end up with some ebbs and flows quarter-to-quarter depending on how that mix plays out. So, the portfolio is very different obviously and that's going to drive some of that change; but beneath that, the focus continues to be on core operating performance, the cost structure, the working capital around that business. So that engine is going to continue to run quarter-over-quarter, week-after-week, month-after-month, but you are going to end up seeing these movements quarter-to-quarter. But end objective, grow the business as we've talked about a lot, at the same time grow the bottom-line and expand margin, and that's the underlying objective of this business and ultimately, we think we can serve our customers much better in doing that. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: We're staying very focused on our overall effort to drive to mid-teen margins across the entire business and so to your last part of your question, Hunter, on margin growth and BGS, we expect margins in BGS to be accretive to our overall enterprise margin, so this is all about profitable growth. Operator : Next up, we have the line of Carter Copeland of Melius. Your line is open. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Carter, we can't hear you. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : Wow. This is leaving mute on two days in a row. I'm losing my skills. Sorry, guys. Just a quick clarification and a question on expanding on what Seth asked. Greg, can you confirm if the 787 unit versus program was positive or negative in the quarter? And then just on this whole Tanker cash flow, just because the size of the charge and how we should think about impacting the cash, are the terms of payment with the customer on that payment upon delivery of the aircraft or milestone-based ahead of that? Thanks, guys. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, they're milestone-based, performance milestone-based. And with regards to the 787, we did see, obviously, we saw unit improvement this quarter across-the-board. Operator : And next up, we have the line of Doug Harned of Bernstein. Your line is open. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thank you. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Hey, Doug. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I know at Farnborough, you got a number of 777 orders and can you help us understand where you stand on filling the bridge to the 777X? And then perhaps give us a sense of what you think that 777X ramp will look like, given the planned entry into service in 2020? And along with that, just when you expect we'll likely see more orders for the 777X rather than just the 777? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: You bet. Hey, Doug. Great question. The key thing on 777 is, we've seen very strong recovery in the Freighter market, in particular, and you see that in the demand and recent orders. We've got 24 new orders year-to-date for 777s through the end of the second quarter. Since the end of the quarter, an additional five from Qatar, 777 Freighters. So, year-to-date, 29 new orders for 777s. Beyond that, we have the additional announcements that have been recently made, including the letter of intent from Volga-Dnepr for 29 777s. We continue to have a number of other campaigns underway as well. So, you really see the strength of the market there continuing to build our confidence in filling out the bridge. As I said, we're really now focused on skyline slots 2020 and beyond. We still have work to do, but our confidence continues to grow based on recent sales successes and what we see as sustained growth in the Freighter market. Now, as we look beyond that and headed towards 777X development, I think a key fact for you is, today, we have 340 orders and commitments in place for the 777X. For the Dash-9 variant of that, we have 273 orders of those 340 orders. And if you want to compare that to where we were at the same time on the 777-300ER back when it was introduced, at that same point in time, relative point in time, we had 70 orders. So 273 orders versus 70 orders. That should give you a sense of the confidence we have in the backlog for 777X. Now, we still continue to have additional campaigns and high interest in the 777X, but we're in very good shape as we look at our production pipeline and backlog position to ramp up successfully on the 777X. So, the key focus now is move into flight test on the 777X, finish out the current 777 bridge, where we have growing confidence again, and then get to EIS for 777X in 2020. And I would say all of the dimensions of that puzzle continue to firm up and we're seeing growing confidence, and that's why the production rate plan we've put in place, we see that as a very clear floor for the production program, and we look forward to moving into the 777X. Operator : Next in queue, we have the line of David Strauss of Barclays. Your line is open. David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Morning. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Good morning. David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I wanted to ask about cash flow. So, I think, Greg, you talked earlier about earlier in the year that you saw prepayments as relatively neutral for the year. I think year-to-date, we're running at $3 billion. Are you expecting those to reverse as we go through the second half? And then, second part on inventory, it looks like ex the drawdown in 787 deferred, you've had about $1 billion inventory build this year. Is that 777X? Or is that just related to the 37 ramp? Any color there. Thanks. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, the inventory is a little bit of both, David. Obviously, 777X inventory being the biggest driver and will continue to be through the balance of the year and into next year. With regards to the advances, yeah, you're absolutely right. I mean, they move around quarter-to-quarter depending on the PDP schedule, so we've seen some this year more front-loaded than we will in the back half of the year, and we've taken that into consideration with the guide. Operator : Next in queue, we have the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Your line is open. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah, hey. Good morning, guys. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Thank you, Ron. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Hi. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I think at Farnborough, Dennis, you mentioned on the 797, I think, the quote is, \"We want to be in the 2025 window with maybe a 2019 launch\". When we think about the 79 or the middle market, whatever it's going to be, maybe, should we start \u2013 in our financial forecast start building in something for that? Because it seems like the drumbeat is really gaining momentum. And then, the second part of the thing would be, when we think about it, is it a wide-body? Is it a narrow-body? I mean, where are you guys on that now? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, Ron. First of all, as you know, we haven't made a launch decision, but we continue to look at the middle of the market airplane. And as you heard at Farnborough continue to have very productive customer discussions on that topic. We do see a marketplace where for 4,000 aircraft to 5,000 aircraft and we're very focused now on deliberately going through our business case to make a good launch decision. We are protecting 2025 as the entry into service date that aligns with our customers' needs and desires. So, we're doing the appropriate long lead work to protect that delivery date and we're looking at making a launch decision in 2019. And again, we're going to be very deliberate about that and make sure business case that makes good, solid sense and that's our headset going in. So, we're not going to predetermine the answer there. We're talking to our supply chain and we're taking a look at every dimension of the program and we've got to look at this through a lifecycle lens both in airplane and downstream services and make sure we're producing value for customers. So, that's our headset. And in terms of your question about wide-body or narrow-body, again as we look at configuration options and details and begin firming that up, what we're hearing from customers is we need something that has the comfort and twin-aisle benefit of wide-bodies but has narrow-body economics. And that's frankly the challenge of closing the business case, and it goes back to all the work we're doing on transforming our enterprise to drive efficiency in development production and support. And if we build the confidence and the data we need to make a business case that closes, we'll launch and if we don't, we'll continue down the path with our current product lines. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Next, we have the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Good morning, Rob. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Good morning. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: With your very strong margins at BCA, especially ex that charge, clearly, you've done a lot with costs, you're going to continue to do that, but I wanted to ask about the pricing side of the equation, especially in the context of Airbus comments last week at the show about pricing opportunity, given the scarcity of slots. So, I know, you have to balance that against higher rates, but how should we think about pricing over the next few years? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Well, Rob, when we take a look at that, first of all, I think it's important to note that pricing is holding up. It's driven by a number of different parameters, includes supply versus demand as you're pointing out, but it's also value that we generate for our customers and making sure that that value proposition is clear. So, everything we do on the pricing front is looked through that customer value lens and that's our focus. And the fact that pricing is holding up and you can see that reflected in our performance is a good sign of the unique value that our product lines are delivering for our customers. I will say as you look across our narrow-body and wide-body product lines, it's very clear that our products deliver operating cost advantage and value advantage for our customers, and that's a key part of our equation going forward. We're also keeping in mind the fact that we have this enterprise-wide global support and services capability. So, in many cases, we think about pricing, we're looking at it holistically across airplanes and services, which I think is a unique part of the Boeing value proposition. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Between the pricing and the cost element, do you have a sense of when you can hit this 15% type margin at BCA? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Well, as we said we're driving towards that mid-teen margin by the end of the decade. That's been our objective. You can see the progress we're making, and as we mentioned before, we expect it to be continuing incremental progress. There's not going to be a big step function or a hockey stick. It's continuous, focused, incremental performance and I think as you can see in our data, Rob, you see the core BCA margins minus the Tanker charge up over 13%. That ought to give you a good indicator of the progress that we're making. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yeah. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: We are going to be relentless on this focus and it's really about driving out cost, driving productivity, working with our supply chain, and being diligent about our production rates. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks, Dennis. Operator : Next, we have the line of Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, everybody. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Morning, Noah. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Hey. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Greg, was the 787 cash unit margin up or down in 2Q versus 1Q? And then any willingness to even if in a wide range kind of give us an indication of where you've taken that to. And then similarly, on the program accounting margin, on the program even if in a wide range maybe help us out on how big of a change you made on it? Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, Noah, I mean, I think overall you're seeing 787 improvement like I said across the board. As you look at kind of the big levers and the cost structure there that we've talked about, the mix improving, the overall productivity unit-over-unit in our factories and again really leveraging the best practices, looking at the commonality between a 9 and a 10, and I'll say kind of how that improves productivity in our factory and in our supply chain is pretty significant, combined with the supplier step-downs that we have in place contractually. And again, our own focus internally and even going out into the supply chain, taking our productivity where we've been successful in areas of productivity and bringing that out to the supply chain to help the overall program improve. So, I wouldn't say it's one thing, Noah. It's many levers that we're working on and trying to pull and you're seeing that in the unit margin and the overall cash profile of the program. And as we've said a number of times, I mean, the way the team looks at this, the way we look at it is unit-over-unit, what do we need to do to improve and be even more competitive in the marketplace and how do we leverage the best practices within our factories, combined within services, between defense-based security, and in commercial and also within the supply chain. So that's been I'll say the cadence and the level of effort that's been going on and that's going to continue. And like I said, you're seeing that in the overall cash profile of the program, improving, combined with going up in rates very smoothly and getting that Dash-10 into the production system smoothly where we're going to deliver approximately 14 aircraft this year, Dash-10s. Very, very smooth introduction, and that really goes to the commonality of that design versus Dash-10 and the team's relentless focus on ensuring that we get that into the hands of the customer on-time, minimized risk. Somebody asked about risk earlier on. It's a great example of de-risking how we bring up a derivative program into the production system. So, point is, a lot of different things, but you're going to see that continued effort going forward on this program and all the other ones. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Appreciate that color. Any ability to give us a sense of where the program accounting margins sits at this point? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Well, it's improved, obviously, with the block extension, that helped and, again, if you go out in that further block you're seeing favorable mix, pricing, and supplier obviously step-down along with our own productivity. So, as we March through time, you're going to see an improvement overall to that margin incrementally as we move forward in those blocks. But like I said, here day-in and day-out, it's about unit performance, meeting our targets, utilizing all our working capital initiatives, and in all of our productivity, but we're focused. Unit-over-unit, ultimately will translate into program margin. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you. Operator : Next, we have the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Hey, Sam. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about, you mentioned the joint venture with Safran and APUs and I guess I'm trying to think about how do you balance the spend on a new plane with some of the significant nonrecurring engineering in areas like nacelles, APUs, maybe even avionics that takes place. And that's typically borne by suppliers and how does that factor into your thinking about potentially launching a new plane? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, Sam, we figured that into our overall organic investment profile and that phased R&D plan that I mentioned earlier, and as part of our organic investment we're very focused on a few key verticals. We don't need to be vertical everywhere, but there are a few areas where when we look through a customer value lens, it's clear that we can add value. The work on APUs with Safran is one of those areas. You mentioned avionics. It's another area. Interiors is another area, we've looked at where we've announced a joint venture with Adient. So, those are very targeted areas, well-known investments. As part of our organic profile, those have been feathered in with our broader R&D investments in new platforms and product lines, including things like the 777X and some of our new defense products and services. So, that's all part of an integrated R&D plan. And the way we've laid that into the profile is done in a way to ensure synergy between our verticals that we're building and our future platform products, and it's important that we do that in a synergistic way. So, I would view that as an integrated organic investment plan, not something where we're trading verticals or platforms. It's doing it together with an eye towards creating value for customers, and then where it makes sense, we augment that with inorganic investments. That cash deployment strategy remains constant. And as we talked about, while we make those organic and inorganic investments, we've also committed to returning 100% free cash flow to our investors, and that commitment remains solid. Maurita B. Sutedja - The Boeing Co.: Okay. Operator, we have time for one more analyst question. Operator : Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Ken Herbert of Canaccord. Your line is open. Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Morning. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Good morning, Ken. Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey, Dennis and Greg. I just wanted to follow-up, Dennis, on your comments earlier specifically on, as you look at everything now much more with a lifecycle lens, I'm just curious on the NMA, assuming you move forward there, how does that lens impact your analysis of the business case in terms of the market opportunity? And then second, and maybe more importantly, how that might potentially impact your go-to-market strategy as you obviously have opportunities now to capture economics in a much broader range. I'm just curious, if you can provide any more detail as to your thinking around that and how it might specifically get applied or used around the NMA. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, well, in particular, as we look at the business case for NMA, as I said, we're looking at it both from an airplane and downstream services standpoint, so an integrated lifecycle view, again, where can we create value for customers? And depending on the customer set, there's a different value proposition for different airlines. In some cases, we can reduce operating costs. In some cases, we can help them reduce capital investment costs. So, we're factoring that entire equation into our business case. It does give us more parameters to look at. It gives us more ways to construct a business case for the future, and taking that holistic lifecycle view, just gives us a more robust business case. It also, as you pointed out, will affect our potential go-to-market approaches, again, how we can tailor a value proposition for different customers. And it will drive different ways of how you might design such an airplane. Again, from the start, thinking about digital solutions and the architecture of the airplane, so that it can enable optimized services for customers. So, it's not only something that factors into the business case, it also affects how we would design the airplane. So all of that is being done in our business case analysis. And I'll go back to my earlier point that it's important that we get it right, and we're going to take the time to get it right. We're protecting the EIS date for our customers at 2025, and if we decide to launch this development program, the R&D profile would be on the back side of 777X, so it would feather in nicely and be consistent with our overall cash flow priorities. Operator : And that does complete the analyst question-and-answer session for this morning. I will now return you to The Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Mr. Phil Musser, Senior Vice President of Communication. Mr. Musser, please go ahead. Phil Musser - The Boeing Co.: Thank you very much, operator. We'll continue now with media questions for Dennis and Greg. If you have any questions following this part of the session, please contact our Media Relations team by e-mail or at 312-544-2002. Operator, we're ready for the first question, and in the interest of time, we ask that you limit everyone to just one question, please. Operator : Certainly. And our first question comes from the line of Julie Johnsson of Bloomberg. Your line is open. Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg LP : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Hi. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Good morning, Julie. Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg LP : Hey. Just to circle back on narrow-body rate, it seems to me that Boeing is taking sort of a more cautious or measured approach to evaluating rate increases into the 2020s, while your competitor is talking about rate 70 or even rate 75. I'm just wondering if the supply chain can actually support the rates that Airbus has been publicly mulling. And if they move forward, is Boeing going to have to keep pace, especially given the very strong demand environment? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, Julie, let me provide some additional perspective on that. Again, we're going to be very focused on being disciplined about our rate decisions and our production ramp up. We've got important work ahead of us. We've just moved to 52 a month on the 737 line. We're going to move to 57 a month next year. As we said the market pressures do indicate upward pressure on that rate. That's a challenge, but it's a good challenge to have, but at every one of these steps we're going to bring our entire supply chain along and I think you see that reflected in our performance. We're continuing to meet our delivery commitments to our customers. That's the lens that we put on these production rate decisions. We see pressure points in the supply chain. We work those on a day-to-day basis and we're very focused on maintaining our discipline. And we'll make rate decisions not only informed by market pressures, but informed by our ability to execute them successfully, and I think our track record of doing 20 successful rate breaks over the last several years speaks to our approach. And while I can't comment on our competitor's approach, what I can comment on is our disciplined approach. We're going to maintain that approach. We're working very closely with our supply chain to bring them along in an integrated fashion. That'll continue to be our focus going forward. Operator : Next, we have the line of Brian Sozzi of TheStreet. Your line is open. Brian Sozzi - TheStreet: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Hey, Brian. Brian Sozzi - TheStreet: Dennis, since the last time we talked we got the Space Force announcement and I'm curious how you're thinking about it and what type of dollar impact could that potentially new program mean to a Boeing? And then on the Services business real quick for you guys, are you planning to get more aggressive on acquisitions there to build that out? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, well, first of all, Brian, on Space Force and more broadly on the Space business, I'm very encouraged by what I see as the administration leaning forward on investing in space, and all dimensions of the Space business, not only Space Force, but more broadly, the work that's going into space exploration and the reinvigoration of that entire ecosystem. And we've had the opportunity to participate as part of the National Space Council and be on the user Advisory Group there, partnered with the administration. So, we have industry voice at the table as we shape these potential opportunities. So from that standpoint, I'm very encouraged about the U.S. Government leaning forward and investing in space. It's good for business. It creates growth opportunities for us. It's also a great way to develop STEM talent for the future. Now, when we look at our growth opportunities going forward, we do see the Space business as an important part of that and that spans from low earth orbit commercial travel and access to the space station. It includes our satellite business and it includes deep space exploration, including the space launch system with a focus on returning to the moon and then stepping to Mars. So, we're going to continue to lean forward in that business. It's an important investment area for us. Stepping back to your second question on services, we continue to see that as a very attractive growth market for us, and we've set a high bar target of growing that to be a $50 billion a year business over the 5 year to 10 year timeframe. And while we're a year into that effort, I think we have some good signs, especially if you look at the growth year-to-date of 11% versus 3.5% in the market. Good signs that our strategy is working. A lot of work ahead of us and it's an integrated organic and inorganic investment strategy, primarily driven again by organic investment parts, mods and maintenance, our training business, our digital business, those are all known organic investments. And where it makes sense we'll complement that with inorganic investments, but we clearly see acquisitions as a bolt-on complement to what is primarily an organic investment strategy. Operator : Next, we have the line of Dominic Gates of Seattle Times. Your line is open. Dominic Gates - The Seattle Times Co.: Good morning, everyone. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Hi, Dominic. Dominic Gates - The Seattle Times Co.: I want to ask about the maturity of the 777X, the new automated technology that you've introduced there. So you have both the new wing center and you've added the wing assembly automated equipment now for that and you've also got the FAUB fuselage robotics. Both of those initially had some issues, challenges as they were new. Are they now, both the fuselage and the wing automated systems, now operating the way that you want them to? And how will you plan to use any of that for NMA? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, Dominic, we continue to make very good progress on those automation systems and while I won't declare them to be in final state, it's very clear that we've made progress both on the fuselage automated systems as well as the wing build system. And I think the key thing that you see in our focus here is that while those automation systems were designed purpose-built to be used for 777X production, we've de-risked those systems by pulling them forward in the factory and applying them to the current 777 program where it makes sense. So, we've been able to use that as a way to de-risk and as you pointed out, there have been some challenges as we've ramped up those automation capabilities. That's exactly why we pulled them forward into the 777 line is to experience and de-risk those systems. We've seen them continue to mature. We're seeing operational efficiency gains in our factory. We're seeing safety benefits for our workforce. We're seeing quality benefits. All of the things we hope to get out of the automation are coming to bear and we're going to continue to mature those as we move into the test program for 777X. And if we decide to launch NMA, part of that would leverage the next generation of automation technology. Again, as we digitize our airplanes, it becomes even more straightforward to apply these automation techniques and we're going to see costs and schedule benefits. We're going to see safety benefits for our workforce, and this is a key part of how we're transforming the Boeing enterprise for the future. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Operator, we have time for one more question from the media. Operator : Certainly. Our last question will come from the line of Andrew Tangel of Wall Street Journal. Your line is open. Andrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal : Hi, there. Thanks for taking the question. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Hi, Andrew. Andrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal : Hey. The Chinese carriers and lessors have previously played a significant role in the orders and commitments at the airshows in Paris and Farnborough, but there weren't that many fresh deals from Chinese companies. At the recent airshow in Farnborough, by one estimate, almost half of Boeing's new orders and commitments at last year's Paris airshow came from Chinese companies. What do you make of the relative absence of a large number of Chinese buyers at this year's airshow, especially in light of how much growing demand you expect from China over the next couple of decades? And does this potentially signal that Chinese buyers are holding off making orders or commitments because of some of the trade friction including between the U.S. and China right now? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, Andrew, look at our total orders book, as we noted, very strong. And in fact, if you look at total orders and commitments year-to-date of more than 900 aircraft, commercial aircraft, that gives you a sense of the overall strength of the market. I don't find it surprising one way or the other that we may or may not have orders from a particular region or a particular customer at the airshow. We don't design our orders profile around airshows. We have some customers who want to make announcements at airshows and we work with them to do that, but our view is much more of a steady, sustained growth and orders throughput and you see that reflected in our month-to-month orders and sales. Our Chinese customers are exceptionally important to us. They're a big part of the backlog we have of the 5,900 aircraft we have in backlog. They're a strong portion of that. The future market we talked about, the world needing 43,000 airplanes roughly over the next 20 years, about 7,200 of those are in China, so it's an important customer for us. We're well-positioned in China. We're working closely with our customers there. We're ramping up capability in China, while we ramp-up in the U.S. as well. And I'll go back to my fundamental point that as we think about China-U.S. trade relationships, aerospace is something that's good for both countries. It's mutually beneficial. It creates growth capacity in China. It's helping them grow their economy, it's growing jobs in China, and as China grows, it's growing jobs in the U.S. and our 737 production line for example, as we ramp-up building on Chinese demand, that's growing U.S. manufacturing jobs. And it's very clear to us that free and open trade environment and good relations between China and the U.S. is not only beneficial to the aerospace business, but in turn the aerospace business is beneficial to the economies and jobs of both countries. Phil Musser - The Boeing Co.: Thank you. That concludes our second quarter earnings call. Again, for members of the media, if you have further questions, please contact our Media Relations team at 312-544-2002 or via e-mail. Thank you very much.

Johnson - Thomson Reuters Marcus Weisgerber - Defense One Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst and media question-and-answer sessions, are being broadcast live over the Internet. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I am turning the call over to Ms. Maurita Sutedja, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Co. Ms. Sutedja, please go ahead. Maurita B. Sutedja - The Boeing Co.: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's third quarter 2018 earnings call. I'm Maurita Sutedja and with me today is Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Enterprise Performance & Strategy. After management comments, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. We have provided detailed financial information in today's press release and you can follow the broadcast and presentation through our website at boeing.com. Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals in our discussion today are likely to involve risk, which is detailed in our news release, various SEC filings and the forward-looking statement disclaimer in the presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook. Now, I will turn the call over to Dennis Muilenburg. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Thank you, Maurita, and good morning. Let me begin today with a brief overview of our third quarter operating performance, followed by an update of the business environment and our expectations going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook. Now let's move to slide 2. Thanks to the dedicated efforts of our teams across the company, Boeing delivered third quarter 2018 financial results that include higher revenue, earnings per share and operating cash flow, driven by solid execution across the company. During the quarter we generated $4.6 billion of operating cash and repurchased $2.5 billion of Boeing stock. We also paid $1 billion in dividends, reflecting a 20% increase in dividends per share from last year. We continued to deliver on our commitment to returning cash to shareholders while investing in our people, innovation, and future growth. Revenue in the third quarter was $25.1 billion, reflecting higher services and defense contract volume. Core earnings per share of $3.58 was driven by strong Commercial Airplane performance and a lower tax rate, primarily related to federal income tax audit settlements, partially offset by charges related to planned investments in the newly-awarded T-X Trainer and MQ-25 unmanned aircraft and cost growth on the KC-46 Tanker. For the full year, we are raising guidance for revenue and earnings per share and reaffirming operating cash flow. We're also raising BCA segment operating margin while reducing BDS margin guidance. Greg will discuss these in more detail in his section. With that, let's take a look at Commercial Airplanes. For the quarter, Commercial Airplanes generated revenue of $15.3 billion, reflecting 190 deliveries, with operating margins of 13.2%. Continued healthy sales activities contributed to 171 net new airplane orders worth $13 billion during the quarter, adding to our robust backlog that stands at more than 5,800 airplanes and is worth $413 billion. Year-to-date we have captured more than 630 net new orders. The 737 program continues to make good progress on its recovery plans to overcome supply chain challenges with 61 aircraft delivered in September, an improvement from July and August. In the third quarter we delivered 138 737s. We expect to recover the 737 line by the end of the year with fourth quarter deliveries expected to be above the production rate. The MAX production ramp-up continues. To-date we have delivered 219 MAXs, 57 of them in the quarter. We continue to expect MAX to account for between 40% and 45% of total 737 deliveries in 2018. The 787 program further matured its rate readiness for 14-per-month next year. The program's ongoing quality and productivity strides helped to position us for a successful ramp-up. We continued to see improvements in first-pass quality and champion times being set across-the-board. As for the 777X program, in the quarter we completed the static test airplane and moved it into test set up. We have also started building flight test airplanes on the low-rate initial production line in the main factory. We plan to start flight testing in 2019 and remain on track for the first 777X delivery in 2020. Now, over to Defense, Space & Security. BDS reported third quarter revenue of $5.7 billion reflecting higher volume across its business, including government satellites, Tanker, F-18, and weapons. Operating margins were negative 4.3% primarily due to charges related to planned investments in the T-X and the MQ-25 programs which I will touch on shortly. BDS booked $12 billion of new orders during the quarter, demonstrating the value we bring to our customers across our Defense, Space & Security portfolio. Those orders include wins on important future franchise opportunities. The T-X Trainer, the MQ-25 unmanned aircraft and the MH-139 helicopter. We also received the fourth KC-46 Tanker production lot for 18 additional Tankers in the quarter. T-X is the Next Generation trainer providing the U.S. Air Force with advanced training capabilities to replace the T-38C Talon. We anticipate the T-X to be a franchise program for much of this century. Beyond the current U.S. Air Force contract, with potential global market opportunities for both trainer and light attack platforms of up to 2,600 aircraft plus ground-based trainers and advanced simulation technologies, representing a $40 billion multi-decade platform and services opportunity. The MQ-25 is the U.S. Navy's first operational carrier-based unmanned aircraft. Unmanned aircraft systems are proving critical in every aspect of air combat with MQ-25 autonomy and artificial intelligence technologies, applicable to a market opportunity of greater than $20 billion, for more than 200 production and derivative aircraft. The MQ-25 and T-X wins are the culmination of years of unwavering focus improving our technology and de-risking the programs. We have developed and flight tested two all-new production-ready T-X jets with 71 flight tests having been completed to-date. We've demonstrated deck handling and engine trials on MQ-25 and we currently have an MQ-25 prototype aircraft in ground testing that is being prepared for first flight. Our planned investments in these two programs will further mature technologies to address the sizable market potential as well as meet current customer commitments. Boeing will recognize the investments through an after-tax charge of $541 million in the quarter. This strategy reflects a commercial investment mindset, a deliberate and purposeful decision to position ourselves to capture significant future market opportunity in services, support, training and platforms in the autonomous systems, trainer and light attack markets. To give you a sense of the multi-decade return on investment, the initial T-X contract represents less than 20% of the full production run opportunity and less than 10% of the total lifecycle services, support and upgrades opportunities. These investments are in-line with our balanced cash deployment strategy and leverage the strength of Boeing's business portfolio and financial performance to create sustained, leading-edge capability for our customers in the U.S. and globally, and the foundation of growth and valuable long-term franchises for all of our stakeholders. Key operational milestones for BDS in the quarter included achieving first flights for Apache and Chinook for the Indian Air Force, and on the commercial satellite side, we successfully completed the acquisition of Millennium Space Systems, a provider of agile, flight proven small-satellite solutions complementing our existing satellite portfolio. We continue to make steady progress towards final certification of the KC-46 Tanker and in September, we received the supplemental type certificate verifying that the refueling and mission avionics systems meet all FAA requirements. The milestone marked completion of KC-46 FAA certification. We are working with our U.S. Air Force customer towards completing all the steps required to deliver the first Tanker aircraft this quarter. In the third quarter the program booked cost growth of $140 million after-tax due to higher-than-expected effort to meet customer requirements to support delivery of the initial aircraft as well as incremental delays in certification and testing. And while there's still work ahead of us, we are moving closer to delivering these highly-mission capable aircraft to our customer. Currently four aircraft have completed the FAA ticketing process and have moved to the Boeing Military Delivery Center. We remain very confident in the long-term value of this franchise, a program that is going to have a production run measured in hundreds of airplanes and decades of follow-on support and training. Now, turning to Global Services. BGS reported third quarter revenue of $4.1 billion, representing a 12% growth year-to-date. Operating margins of 13.3% reflected higher parts and supply chain solutions volume, product and services mix, and higher period costs driven by investments to grow our portfolio offerings. During the quarter, BGS won new business totaling approximately $4 billion. This included an order from GECAS for 20 737-800 Converted Freighters, an F-18 spares contract for the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency, service contract for KC-46 Tanker for lots 3 and 4, P-8A training contracts for the U.S. Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force and a service support contract for the newly-awarded MH-139 helicopter for the U.S. Air Force. These orders highlight the strength of our One Boeing offerings. Additionally, BGS completed the first heavy maintenance check on P-8 for the U.S. Navy. Earlier this month we completed the acquisition of KLX, a major global provider of aviation parts and services, part of our growth strategy of complementing organic investments with targeted strategic acquisitions. This transaction brings together the talent and product offerings of Boeing and KLX to provide a one-stop shop that will allow us to create significant value for our customers. The resulting boost in supply chain capability enables us to better serve our customers while profitably and purposefully growing our business. Our integration activities are well underway and progressing smoothly. Separately, we are finalizing the definitive agreements for our proposed partnership with Embraer. In the coming months we'll continue to work with Embraer and its shareholders, the Brazilian government and regulators, among others, to complete the transaction and create the most important strategic partnership in the aerospace industry. In summary, we delivered another quarter of strong operating performance, captured noteworthy additions to our large and diverse backlog, including key future defense franchises, returned significant cash to our shareholders, and complemented our organic growth with planned strategic inorganic investments. With that, let's turn to the business environment on slide 3. We continued to see healthy global demand in our commercial, defense, space and services markets, markets that are growing and sizable at $8.1 trillion over the next 10 years. In the commercial airplane market, airline profitability remains strong and passenger traffic continues to outpace global GDP. Passenger traffic in 2018 grew 6.8% through August. Meanwhile, cargo traffic maintained its upward momentum, growing by 4% in 2018 through August. Our global customers continue to recognize the compelling value proposition that our new, more fuel-efficient product family brings to the market as reflected in the healthy new order intake we've seen year-to-date. We continue to see the trend of diverse and balanced demand from a geographical perspective, as well as across the spectrum of airline business models. The changing nature of travel with the expansion of network city pairs and rising middle-class population in emerging markets has fundamentally expanded traffic patterns and underpinned sustained growth. There also is more balanced demand between fleet growth and replacement of older aircraft and we are seeing more consistent and stable customer purchasing patterns. We believe the evolution in key market dynamics in the aggregate continues to drive greater stability and far less cyclicality for our industry. Over the long-term, we remain highly confident in our commercial market outlook which forecasts demand for nearly 43,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years. These deliveries, of which 44% will be driven by replacement demand, will double the size of the global fleet. This long-term demand, combined with healthy market conditions and a robust backlog provides a solid foundation for our planned production rates. Turning to our product segments, starting with the narrow-body. Our current production rate of 52 per month and planned increase to 57 in 2019 is based on our backlog of nearly 4,700 aircraft and a production skyline that is sold out into early next decade. We continue to assess the upward market pressure on the 737 production rate. In the wide-body segment, we've seen steady orders for the 787 and the 777 and have high confidence in a meaningful increase in wide-body replacement demand early next decade. For the current generation 777, the renewed strength in the air cargo sector has provided support for the 777 bridge as highlighted by recent orders, bringing the backlog to 87 aircraft. As we transition production to the 777X, we expect 777 deliveries of approximately 3.5 per month through 2019 as previously announced. While we still have some work to do in filling the remaining 777 production slots, in particular for 2020 and beyond, we feel confident about the 777 bridge progress. As we look forward to the 777X, we have a strong foundation of 340 orders and commitments that support our plan for ramping up production and delivery of this new aircraft. We are focused on further bolstering the 777X skyline. We also captured 21 orders for the 787 Dreamliner family in the quarter, bringing the total year-to-date orders to more than 100. With nearly 1,400 firm order since its launch and more than 600 in the backlog, our plan to increase Dreamliner production to 14 airplanes a month in 2019 is well supported. We continue to see repeat orders for the 787 Dreamliner, including the recent order from United for 9 additional 787-9s highlighting the strong market preference for the 787 and its superior value. Turning to our 747 and 767 programs, with our unmatched freighter product lines, we are well positioned to capture the increased cargo demand. This supports our 767 production rate increase from 2.5 per month to 3 per month in 2020. We remain focused on the strong, long-term aerospace industry fundamentals. It's important to have this in perspective as we navigate through global trade discussions. Boeing maintains strong relationships with our customers, suppliers and other stakeholders around the world. We continue to engage with leaders in these countries to urge a productive dialogue to resolve trade differences, highlighting the mutual economic benefits of a strong and prosperous aerospace industry. Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid demands for our major platforms and programs. The BDS portfolio is well positioned with mature world class platforms to address current needs and new franchise programs to build the future. Boeing continues to see strong support for our key products from the Pentagon and in Congress. The fiscal year 2019 Defense Policy Bill authorized a fourth multi-year procurement for the F-18 and supported increases in munitions production in the Pentagon's aviation readiness efforts. The final appropriations bill for fiscal year 2019 U.S. Defense budget added funding for additional rotorcraft, funded the requested quantities of our key programs across our fixed-wing and commercial derivative aircraft portfolios, and funded our missile, space and satellite products. Demand from outside of the U.S. for our defense and space offerings also remains high, in particular for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters and satellites. Our investment in future growth and new sales continues in areas that are priorities for our customers. We will continue to leverage capabilities and technologies from across our enterprise to win important opportunities such as the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent. Turning to the services sector. We see the $2.8 trillion services market over the next 10 years as a significant growth opportunity for our company. BGS provides agile, cost competitive services to our customers worldwide. We aim to grow faster than the average services market growth rate of 3.5% as we further expand our broad portfolio of services offerings and continue to gain market share. Strong orders of $4 billion in the quarter reflect our customers' recognition of our value proposition in helping them optimize the performance of their fleets and reduce operational costs through the lifecycle. These activities stretch across BGS's four capability areas, including supply chain, engineering modifications and maintenance, digital aviation and analytics, and training and professional services. Our focus for BGS remains on optimizing the businesses and expanding our portfolio offerings through organic growth investments such as strengthening our vertical capabilities, complemented by strategic acquisitions position BGS for sustained long-term and profitable growth. Our expertise, the global reach of our business and our strong customer partnerships have us well positioned to compete and win in this important sector. On the digital analytics front, we will begin integrating a new data analytics tool into all Boeing Defense Australia support contracts, enhancing its position as a leading fleet services provider in the region. The Boeing AnalytX systems, featuring new technologies developed by Boeing in Australia, will give the Australian defense force access to more platform data than ever before, enabling Boeing to increase fleet readiness, safety and reliability while reducing maintenance costs. In summary, with growing markets and opportunities ahead, our team remains intensely focused on growth, innovation and accelerating productivity improvement to fuel our investments in the future. With that, Greg, over to you for our financial results. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Thanks, Dennis and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to slide 4 and we'll discuss our third quarter results. Revenue for the quarter increased to $25.1 billion reflecting solid BCA deliveries, and higher volume at Defense, Space & Security as well as Global Services. Core earnings per share of $3.58 reflect strong Commercial Airplane performance, higher Global Services earnings, and a $412 million tax benefit related to the settlement of federal income tax audits for the years 2013 and 2014. These were partially offset by after-tax charges of $541 million related to the planned investment on T-X and MQ-25 programs and $140 million after-tax charge on the KC-46 Tanker. Now, let's discuss Commercial Airplanes on slide 5. Our Commercial Airplane business revenue of $15.3 billion during the quarter reflected lower deliveries, largely offset by favorable mix. BCA operating margins increased to 13.2% driven by strong operating performance on production programs, higher 787 margins, and timing of period cost. This was partially offset by a $112 million pre-tax charge on the KC-46 Tanker program. BCA captured $13 billion of net orders during the quarter and backlog remains strong at $413 billion and more than 5,800 aircraft equating to approximately seven years of production. On the 787 program, we delivered 34 aircraft and booked 21 net orders in the quarter, and the overall cash profile of this program continues to improve through favorable mix, supplier step-down pricing, and our team's day-to-day focus on improving 787 unit costs and overall cash generation. Let's now turn to Defense, Space & Security results on slide 6. Third quarter revenue increased to $5.7 billion, driven by higher volume across the BDS business, including government satellites, Tanker, F/A-18 and weapons. BDS margins of negative 4.3% reflected the $691 million pre-tax charge on the planned investments related to T-X and MQ-25 programs and cost growth on KC-46 Tanker program of $64 million pre-tax. As Dennis mentioned, our T-X and MQ-25 investments are based on deliberate and intentional decisions to create long-term valuable products and services franchises. In selective key market opportunities such as these, we are taking into account the considerable market potential in our business cases and not just the initial order quantity with the current contracts. For accounting purposes, we have to assess the anticipated costs and expected revenue over the life of the initial contract without taking into account the potential additional future market opportunities. Our planned long-term investments translate into earnings charges against these programs in the quarter. The charges do not impact cash flow in the quarter and our cash flow guidance for the year. These investments leverage the strength of Boeing's business portfolio and financial performance and provide a foundation of growth and valuable long-term franchises for all of our stakeholders. These investments are consistent with our strategy of capital deployment priorities of investing in organic growth. And finally, along with the T-X and MQ-25, BDS won a number of additional key contract awards bringing its total orders in the quarter to $12 billion. BDS backlog increased to $58 billion with now 31% from outside the United States. Turning now to Boeing Global Services results on slide 7. In the third quarter, Global Services revenue increased to $4.1 billion reflecting higher volume predominantly driven by increased sales of parts and supply chain solutions. Year-over-year growth of 14% for the quarter and 12% year-to-date more than meet our objective to outpace the average annual service market growth rate of 3.5%. BGS operating margins were solid at 13.3% reflecting ongoing productivity efforts as well as mix of products and services in the quarter, offset by higher period costs for investments focused on expanding our portfolio of offerings going forward. During the quarter, BGS won key contract awards worth approximately $4 billion bringing our backlog to $20 billion. The key wins this year underscore the strength of our One Boeing offerings to our customers. Let's now turn to cash flow on slide 8. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was strong at $4.6 billion primarily driven by timing of receipt and expenditures, planned higher commercial production rates, and strong core operating performance across the business. We remain focused and on track with our balanced cash deployment strategy. In the third quarter we repurchased $2.5 billion of Boeing stock and paid $1 billion in dividends reflecting a 20% increase in dividend per share from last year, and we continued to anticipate completing the remaining $9.6 billion of repurchase authorization over the next 12 months to 18 months. Since the end of 2012 we've repurchased approximately 230 million shares and increased our dividend more than 250%. At the same time, we've invested more than $30 billion in key strategic areas to support long-term sustainable growth for Boeing, our customers, and our shareholders, and we remain committed to returning approximately 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders while continuing to invest in future growth opportunities. Let's now move to cash and debt balances on slide 9. We ended the quarter with $10 billion of cash and marketable securities, stable debt levels, and credit ratings. Our cash position continues to provide us with flexibility to invest in innovation and profitable growth opportunities while again returning value to shareholders. Let's now turn to slide 10 to discuss our outlook for 2018. For full year, we're raising our revenue guidance by $1 billion to now be between $98 billion and $100 billion. This increase in revenue primarily reflects the higher BDS and BGS volume inclusive of the KLX acquisition. As a result, we're increasing revenue guidance to now be between $16 billion and $16.5 billion for BGS and between $22 billion and $23 billion for BDS. We're also updating our full year BCA and BDS segment operating margin guidance to reflect BCA's strong performance and investments in T-X and MQ-25 this quarter. BCA margin guidance is increased to now be between 12% and 12.5% from our prior guidance of greater than 11.5%, again reflecting strong performance and timing of some period expenses. BDS margin guidance is reduced to be greater than 6.5% from our prior guidance of between 10% and 10.5%, again primarily reflecting the investments in the T-X and MQ-25 programs. We are increasing our full year core earnings per share guidance by $0.60 to be between $14.90 and $15.10 on net improvements after accounting for lower than expected tax rate, performance and charges. We're reducing our full year guidance for capital expenditures to now be approximately $2 billion, a $200 million decrease from our prior guidance of $2.2 billion, again reflecting timing of spending as well as performance. As we look towards the remainder of the year our key focus areas include, continuing to manage the 737 recovery progress within our factories and throughout our supply chain, starting the delivery of KC-46 Tanker and continued healthy order momentum as well as continued strong execution across the portfolio. So in summary, our core operating engine continues to deliver strong results. We will continue to use our three business unit strategy as a key differentiator to win in the marketplace, make prudent strategic investments, and leverage the talent and innovation across the company. At the same time, we will set challenging goals and objectives around elements of operations and support functions tied to profitability and efficiency to generate cash and improve working capital while delivering value to our customers. All these will help us achieve our goal to grow year-over-year revenue, cash flow, and margins, so with that, I'll turn it back to Dennis for some closing comments. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: All right. Thank you, Greg. With a strong three quarters behind us our team remains focused on further driving both growth and productivity. These results were achieved through the hard work and dedication of our employees and the great partnership we have with our customers and our suppliers. In addition to the strong Commercial Airplane market dynamics I mentioned earlier in my remarks, we have taken our own actions to reduce cyclicality in our business. This includes remaining disciplined in our production rate decisions, de-risking our pension liabilities, strategically phasing our research and development spending, creating labor stability with long-term contracts, and expanding our services business, which is also less cyclical. We have executed on our long-term strategy of robust and continuing organic growth investment and returning value to our shareholders, complemented by strategic acquisitions and partnerships that enhance and accelerate our growth plans. The planned strategic partnerships with Embraer, Safran, and the recent KLX acquisition and Adient joint venture are entirely consistent with this strategy. Our priorities going forward are to leverage our unique One Boeing advantages, continue building strength on strength to deliver and improve on our commitments and to stretch beyond those plans and sharpen and accelerate our pace of progress on key enterprise growth and productivity efforts. Achieving these objectives will require a clear and consistent focus on the profitable ramp-up in Commercial Airplane production, continuing to strengthen our Defense, Space & Security business, growing our integrated services business and leveraging the power of our three business unit strategy, delivering on our development programs, driving world-class levels of productivity and performance throughout the enterprise to fund our investments in innovation and growth, disciplined leading-edge investments, and balanced value-creating cash deployment and continuing to develop and maintain the best team and talent in the industry. All of which position Boeing for continued market leadership, sustained top and bottom line growth, and increasing value for our customers, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. With that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator : And first to the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead, sir. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you, good morning. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Hey, good morning, Doug. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: This will probably \u2013 this will exceed the one part. I'd like to just discuss the approach you're taking on defense. You'll be working on fixed price development contracts for MQ-25 and T-X and there's no question those will be big programs but the history of fixed price development as you know has not been good, and Boeing has been part of that history. And you took this approach on the Tanker, it's been continually more difficult than expectations. So can you describe how long it will be before you expect these new programs to generate returns and what the cash profile should be over time? And then, how do we get comfortable that you're accurately measuring the risk on these? And I'm just curious, do you see these kinds of competitions as the future here? I mean these are aggressive bids and bring back a history to all of us. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, Doug, let me take a shot at your macro question, and then Greg, I'll ask you to add in on the cash flow profile as well. Now first of all, Doug, this is a targeted and very deliberate strategy focused on some key defense franchises that we believe have lifecycles that are measured in decades and between T-X and MQ-25, those two programs combined have roughly a $60 billion opportunity space connected with them, so one, big targeted franchises. We have taken a look at these in a very careful, diligent way, and have invested up front with a business case that is very strong and the return to our shareholders as a result is going to be very strong. So think of applying a commercial mindset to franchises that are measured in decades. These capabilities are also going to bring immediate leading edge benefit to our customers and our men and women in uniform. So there's customer benefit and shareholder benefit. So, first point is that key strategic focus. And to give you a sense of it on T-X, the initial contract here represents less than 20% of the total production run and less than 10% of the total services volume available in that contract space, so we have a tremendous investment capability here. Secondly, to your point on risk. We have purposely, with these investments, significantly de-risked these programs, and they are fundamentally different than Tanker. On T-X, for example, we have two production-ready jets flying today. We've done 71 test flights already. We are highly confident in this program. These are small development programs leading to rapid production. So as you recall when we started Tanker, we still had a Tanker design on the drawing board. In contrast, today we have two flying production units for T-X. Same thing on MQ-25. We made purposeful investments over the last few years to build a prototype aircraft that'll be going into flight test in the coming year. So again, the idea here is to accelerate capability for our customers and move swiftly to production. As a result, the risk profile of these programs are dramatically different than Tanker. So a solid business case, a significantly de-risked program, all looked at through the lens of making a good business case investment that is going to be good for our customers and our shareholders, and frankly, with the strong cash performance of our company, our strong financial performance overall, we have the fuel to do this. This is an excellent use of cash in organic investment. So I'll just provide those overarching comments, so Greg, if you want to add-on in terms of cash profiles and expectations. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, I guess, I'd start kind of at the highest level, that our view of growing cash flow going forward doesn't change as a result of these wins. We've taken all that into consideration. If you kind of look at from a timeframe perspective on each of the programs, the MQ-25 through that EMD phase ends in about 2024 and then on T-X, the options start to begin in 2022. So it kind of gives you a sense of the \u2013 I'll say the breadth and timeframe along that development phase and then entering into production. So again, I think at the highest level, the cash flow profile that we are expecting for us to generate isn't going to change at all as a result of these. And I think as Dennis said, we made investments that are behind us as well that really try to de-risk both of these programs moving through the EMD phase and then ultimately moving into production. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Operator : Next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Hey, good morning, guys. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Good morning. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : It seemed like the quarter went actually pretty well in terms of getting the 737 supply chain back on track. I was wondering if you could just kind of talk about that a little bit more and then, when you think about what happened with the supply chain in this quarter, how do you think about like the next rate up and then potentially getting working towards 70 and how the supply chain can handle that? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah. Hey, Ron, great question and we have been and continue to be very focused on 737 production program execution and recovery. We are seeing our supply chain return to a healthy condition but we're continuing to monitor that on a daily basis. As you've seen, we've had to work through some risk issues in particular on fuselages and engines with Spirit and CFM and we now have fuselages being delivered to our purchase order plans and we're also seeing engine recovery and while we still have some work to do there, we're anticipating engine recovery towards the end of the year. You can see that reflected in deliveries, as well. The strong September deliveries give us building confidence on the recovery and as you've noticed, we have not changed our year-end guidance for deliveries, so we remain confident that we'll hit our total delivery target for the year. As a result, in the fourth quarter, as a composite, you should expect to see deliveries exceeding the 52 a month production rate. Again, those deliveries will be more back-loaded in the quarter as always but we're seeing good signs on our recovery across the board. And we're going to continue to stay very, very focused on executing that. Now, as we look to next year, as you know, we're planning to step-up to 57 a month. We are taking some lessons learned from the recent 52 a month step and applying those. That includes ramping up staffing earlier. So some of the additional staffing we brought onboard for 52 a month is staying in place to help us with the 57 a month step. Supply chain health and in-depth monitoring of that has also been turned up and I think what you'll also see is that the nature of the next step is a little different. This year was especially challenging as we stepped to 52 a month and we also had major model mix changes. Roughly half of the airplanes this year are NGs and half are MAXs. As we get to next year and towards the 57 a month rate break, we'll be almost entirely MAXs by that point. So the model mix challenge will not be as difficult as we step to 57 a month next year. So we're also factoring that into our planning. But I'll say bottom line here is we're staying very, very focused on this. It's very important that we continue to hit deliveries for our customers, and in general, we're seeing positive signs in our supply chain recovery and remain confident on the overall 737 production profile and ramp-up plans. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much and good morning. I wanted to follow up with another 737 question, this time on the demand side. You've talked about the upward pressure on demand and the potential to move higher than 57 a month. Is it possible to make a decision on that while there are still a lot of outstanding trade questions with regard to China or does that stuff have to kind of get settled before you can move forward with thinking about that investment? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, Seth, when we take a look at the trade environment, we maintain a long-term view on that. Certainly, something that's very important to us, we're very engaged in the dialogue and conversations with the U.S. government and with other governments around the world. In particular on the U.S. China relationship, we're very engaged with our Chinese airline customers and leadership in China, along with the U.S. government and both countries are interested a healthy aerospace industry. In China, from a macro standpoint one of the fastest growing commercial aviation markets in the world. Over the next 20 years we said a world that needs 43,000 new airplanes; about 7,700 of those are in China. Traffic growth patterns are very strong in China and the rising middle-class population is a tremendous driver there, well beyond normal, I'll say GDP metrics, so about 150 million new passengers every year in Asia are fueling that growth. So China is very interested in a healthy growing aerospace industry. Same thing in the U.S.; when you take a look at trade and trade surplus, the greatest trade surplus generator in the U.S. is aerospace, and within that sector, Boeing and our supply chain are by far the biggest component and that all leads to American manufacturing jobs. So there's strong reasons in both U.S. and China to have a healthy, prosperous aerospace industry. You combine that with backlogs and as we said earlier, with more than 5,700 aircraft, 5,800 aircraft in backlog today, and in particular, for narrow-bodies, 737s, strong backlog, we're filling skyline in the 2023 timeframe, right? So this is a long-term view. So while we pay attention to trade, and we're very engaged in it, it's very important to us, it's not something that changes our near-term modeling and analysis. Our decisions around stepping up to 57 a month are strongly supported by the backlog that we have in position and the commitments we have with customers and really our decision drivers around stepping to 57 a month will be health of the production system, the supply chain, our ability to execute that in a way that's smooth for our customers and profitable for our company. And so it's very much focused on that internal operational productivity and a healthy production line. And we're going to step to 57 a month when we're ready to step, and we remain confident that that step we'll take next year and we're going to continue to do our diligent work to make sure that's done in a smooth manner. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Next we go to Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead. Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes, good morning, Dennis, Greg. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Morning, Peter. Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: A question on BDS, just looking at the growth profile and going forward you've had a tremendous amount of wins with T-X, MQ-25, you've got the Tanker with the KC-46, obviously the helicopter franchises, P-8. How do we think about the growth just in the budget backdrop when we think over the next couple years? Thanks. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, Peter I think there are a couple of factors there. One, as you said, the macro environment, the budget is healthy and strong. We've seen good, positive signs on strengthening U.S. defense budget, not without risk, as we look to future defense budgets and Budget Control Act profiles and it's a year-to-year battle as you know. But we've seen more and more signs of sustained, long-term stable defense budget in the U.S. International defense budgets continue to strengthen as well. As Greg said earlier, about a third of our backlog is in international defense, so the macro budget environment for defense is strong right now. Within that, funding for our programs has been very good and as you noted with our recent T-X and MQ-25 wins, our MH-139 win, all of those will fuel growth. As we step the Tanker program into production, that will fuel growth as well. And if you look at that in a composite, we still see our defense business as a modest growth business. It's healthy and the recent wins are going to make it even more healthy. Operator : Our next question is from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : Hey, good morning, gentlemen. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Morning, Carter. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : I just want to go back to the BDS charges and the investments as you've characterized them, just two elements. As you think about bidding this way, what do you target? Are you thinking about risk-adjusted ROIs? How do you square that with your current incentives on near-term earnings per share? And then secondly, was there something different about your offerings in each case? I mean, a competitor \u2013 you took a $700 million charge, you had a competitor say they would have lost $5 billion on it. Do you think there are differences in cost or product capabilities versus the KPPs or assessments of the overall risk? If you could help me with those two things I'd appreciate it. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Carter, I'll take the first cut and then, Greg, feel free to add in here. First of all, again, our mindset around this is to focus on those key defense franchises that create long-term value, sustained decades of opportunity, so these are a few very select very targeted areas, and as we've mentioned over several years now, T-X and MQ-25 are in that category. We've made purposeful investments to de-risk the programs to build flying hardware, to provide capability for our customers and our men and women in uniform to accelerate capabilities for them and to invest in a smart way that creates value for our customers in the long-term. To your point on incentive targets for our team, our incentive targets are a balanced set of targets, both annual and long-term, and what you see here is an exact reflection of that philosophy. It's making the right short-term investments to produce long-term value, and the fact that we were able to make these investments and in a single quarter in essence, pay for those investments, because of the great performance of the company, shows our ability to fuel smart investments through the future. That is the balance and I think unique capability that this company brings to our customers. That's really our mindset around these kind of investments and we remain very confident that the investments we make here have great business cases, will create great value for our shareholders as well as value for our servicemen and women. So that's an important parameter for us. Now, in terms of your comment about the competitive environment, I can't really comment on our competitors' bid positions but what I can comment on is the fact that we're able to bring very affordable solutions to our customers because of the investments we've been making in productivity. I think as you're well aware as we've had \u2013 as we've shown many of our investor partners, the fact that we're investing in things like our second-century design and manufacturing capabilities, advanced digital designs, all of these Next Generation design production and support capabilities are being reflected in these new products that we're bringing to our defense customers. So they are affordable, they are extremely capable, they provide great capability for our customers, and they create value for our shareholders. Greg? Anything you want to add on that? Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, I guess just your question specifically on the business case. NPV, return on invested capital, I'd say very traditional way to look at a business case, but as Dennis said, not just looking at the contract quantity, but looking at the broader market opportunities and what it would take to win, and obviously, stressing that, and looking at that through various lenses to ensure that we have what we would \u2013 what we expect from a net present value perspective and a return on invested capital. So I'd say kind of multi-dimensional about how we're looking at it and then how we look at the risks associated with it but look, as far as the two platforms go, it's obvious that we have been spending a lot of time and energy and expertise from across the company to have something such as T-X that's flying that made its first flight in 2016 and as Dennis said, 71 flights under its belt, and then MQ-25 at the same time, things like doing an engine run in 2017. So we've really tried to work hard to leverage the enterprise, the model-based engineering that Dennis talked about and the productivity and try to de-risk these the best we can and bring purpose-built and purpose-designed platforms to the war fighter that I think are clearly game-changing and are going to add value to our customer and to our war fighter and to our shareholders. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Further to Greg's point, you see our unique ability across our commercial and defense businesses to share and replicate and build these technologies, so these advanced design and manufacturing capabilities that we're maturing on programs like the 777X, are able to apply to new defense programs, those lessons learned applied back to our commercial business so there's tremendous synergy there that I think is unique to our company. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : Thanks for the color, guys. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: You're welcome. Operator : Next question we'll go to Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, good morning. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Hey, Rob. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: At the risk of staying on the topic, I want to just ask for clarification. So Dennis, you said you've already made these investments in the quarter and you have the two prototype T-X aircraft but I took from Greg's comments that most of these investments are planned and I'm taking that as from a cash perspective and so I wanted to ask you if they are truly ring-fenced or is there potential for investment creep, kind of like with Tanker? And then the last part of this question is since you clearly saw these opportunities differently than your competitor, can you elaborate more specifically a bit about the commercial market or foreign military market opportunity? Who's going to take up the other 80% of the targeted production for example and 90% of the sustainment? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: I'll answer the second part of that, Rob, but Greg, why don't you take a cut at the first part and in particular how we've ring-fenced this and how the investments play out. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And you had it right, Rob, obviously from an accounting perspective we've recognized the costs associated with this effort, but from a cash flow perspective as I was talking a little earlier, you'll see a profile that'll go out over that between the two of them, the kind of 2022 to 2024 timeframe so all of that kind of modeled through that period and obviously, I'll let Dennis talk a little more on the de-risking but we've really tried to get out in front of that and that's the investments we have made to get these products to the state that they're in today. And there's a big differentiator there obviously when you got two airplanes flying that have been flying since 2016 and have 71 test flights, it's not coming off a piece of paper to move into development and into production so it certainly minimizes the risk profile going forward. And MQ, again, we've done a lot of \u2013 between engine runs and ground taxi tests and deck handling trials, things like that, and invested in some labs and tried again to de-risk it. So it's a different risk profile than you've seen in some of the other development programs and I try not to repeat too much of what Dennis said, but we're leveraging the best of Boeing and bring it in a selective way to these campaigns, so this is the approach we took on these, because we saw the long-term value proposition here and it strategically fit into what we had laid out as far as where we want to play today and going forward, and we selectively lean forward into these two and we think they're going to be very valuable franchises for all our stakeholders. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: And then, Rob, further to that value point so that the broader marketplace here certainly initially with the U.S. Air Force and training capabilities and take a look at today's T-38 Talon fleet that will be replaced by this airplane. So the opportunity for growth in the U.S. training fleet is substantial and as you know, our Air Force's training needs are significant and so T-X Trainer is well placed to meet that capability. We've also purpose-built, purpose-designed the airplane so that it can also be applied to other international customers who also have training needs and as you well know, the U.S. Air Force tends to lead the globe in terms of training capabilities and so international customers and allies will very typically align to the same product lines, and we've already had a number of inquiries from other customers around the globe on the back side of the T-X award. Further to that, we purpose-designed this airplane to also be able to be modified to be a light attack fighter aircraft, again to support global markets and if you look at the cumulative market space in the U.S. and around the globe, we see T-X as a market for about 2,600 aircraft, in addition to ground-based trainers and other support services. And if you look at all of that as a composite across T-X and MQ-25, very realistically, this is a $60 billion-sized marketplace so that gives you a sense of why this is a good investment. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yeah. That's very helpful market size, thank you. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: You bet. Operator : Our next question is from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, good morning. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Good morning. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Hey, good morning. David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Wanted to follow-up on the 737, looking for some additional color there. Dennis, can you give any sort of quantification on the number of unfinished jobs today versus a month or so ago, or the progress you're making there and are the airplanes rolling off the line today, do they have any unfinished jobs or are they rolling off the line clean at this point? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, we're continuing to ramp-up on our recovery plan. If I look at every element of the recovery factors, flow-through the factories, jobs that are completed in position, if I take a look at jobs that travel between stations, jobs behind schedule, airplanes on the ramp, supply chain health, we're watching things like part shortages in the factory. Across that entire set of metrics they're all trending in right direction and while we're not complete with the recovery yet, we have made substantial progress over the last couple of months and the best indicator of that frankly is airplane deliveries, and you saw the 61 aircraft delivered in September and as I said, we expect for the fourth quarter deliveries, in total will be above the 52 a month production rate that we're at, so we're continuing to work off the inventory of aircraft that have been on the ramp outside of the factory. More and more, we're seeing airplanes being completed in place in the factory and while we're not done, all of the trends are headed in the right direction, just to give you a sense of how it's going. And we're going to stay very, very focused on it and get that wrapped up, get the production line back to full health and as I said, we're committed to meeting our year-end overall delivery guidance. Operator : Next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Co. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes, thank you very much. So you took your R&D guide down by $200 million and yet R&D was a lot lower than I think most of us expected in the third quarter and to get to even your lower number, R&D has to ramp-up sequentially by close to $300 million. First, is that a conservative estimate so that that has some more opportunity and what does that imply for the R&D run rate corporate-wide next year given you're considering the NMA? Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, the run rate expectations going into next year, Cai, haven't changed, but there's certainly some timing from quarter-to-quarter just between the transition of 777X and some of the MAX spending and then just some of the other projects we have in place, so I wouldn't read too much more into that other than some timing. As far as kind of broader, I'll say, kind of at a high-level R&D spend to revenue, still kind of that 3.8%, 3.9% is still what we see going forward, taking all of what we talked about into consideration. So think of quarter-over-quarter here just more timing between programs. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: You're welcome. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Thanks, Cai. Operator : Next question is from Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead. Myles Alexander Walton - UBS: Thanks, good morning. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Morning, Myles. Myles Alexander Walton - UBS: I was wondering if we can we talk about the BCA margins and the kind of underlying margins you've seen over the last couple quarters, what you're looking for in the fourth quarter and Dennis, it looks that mid-teens margin target is going to arrive a year early in 2019. Greg, is there any pushback you're going to give me as a conservative CFO to tell me that's not going to happen? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Hey, Myles, first of all, thank you for the feedback there. You do see the progress in our margin performance and as we said, we're very intent and focused on that, and strong performance by our Commercial Airplane team in the quarter. There are a number of items behind that, but it reflects the overall drive on productivity and performance across our product lines and the investments we're making there are showing results, and we laid in a long-term plan to make this a mid-teens margin business. We are making great progress on that journey and we remain very committed to that. As we said before, not only getting there by the end of the decade but then beyond that, continuing to grow our margins and as Greg mentioned in his comments, we see this as a long-term year-over-year cash growth and margin growth business. Greg, do you want to add some color to Myles' point there? Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, Myles Alexander Walton - UBS: Talk me off the ledge here? Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: I'm sorry? Myles Alexander Walton - UBS: You want to talk me down? Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Well, I'm going to give you the facts. Look, there's been a lot of effort been going on program-to-program. In particular on the 787 of improving the margin profile and we talked a lot about it. The mix, supplier step-down and then just our own productivity and sharing those best practices across the company, and everybody's on one score in the company and that's one of the big enablers. So, it's first and foremost on everybody's mind of how do you leverage these best practices and bring them to the program. So you're seeing some of that. You're seeing a lot of discipline on the spending across-the-board, that is obviously very cash focused, just like the program margins are, but you are seeing some ebbs and flows quarter-to-quarter. So you're going to see a little more period expense in the fourth quarter. So we had some favorable timing in third quarter and you'll see some of that come back in the fourth quarter and obviously we're keeping a mindful eye on some of the things that Dennis talked about and I did as far as what we're watching between now and the end of the year. In particular, 737 delivery profile, so that recovery plan is something that we're focused on daily, and in particular, around our engine recovery and so we're taking that into consideration as well. So lots of moving pieces, but net-net, the objective hasn't changed. You're seeing progress towards that objective and you're going to see that continue. Myles Alexander Walton - UBS: Thanks. Operator : Next we'll go to Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC : Hey, good morning and thank you for the time. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Hi, Sheila. Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Just on services, the margins compressed a little bit. Can we talk about the implied recovery in Q4 and maybe what the some of the period costs were associated with that and how we think about the profitability profile of that business as KLX plays into it? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, Sheila, first of all, overall services business, we're very focused on growing profitably, so growing both top and bottom line. You'll see that year-to-date, as we said, about 12% growth in our services top line, so our growth strategy is working. You do see some variability on bottom line performance in margin quarter-to-quarter. We did make some targeted investments in the third quarter that you see in the local margins there, but you can see we haven't changed our year-end guidance for BGS margin. So we still expect this to be a robust-growing business both top and bottom line. And Greg...? Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, a lot of initiatives in place here as well. Obviously bringing the two together and really looking for efficiencies across the board. A lot of effort going on there and obviously, the go-to-market, but there's thousands and thousands of contracts, obviously in this business, so as I think I mentioned on prior calls, you're going to see some ebb and flow from quarter-over-quarter just by mix alone but the overall objective long-term, get outside of quarters here and look kind of year-over-year, is to continue to grow the margins and deliver something to our customers that's really differentiating and that's why we brought these businesses together and I think you're seeing some of that starting in our order book and in our backlog, and it's bringing the best of Boeing to the services elements just like we do on the platform. But again, that objective of being the most efficient \u2013 delivering those services in the most efficient way delivers value back to us to reinvest and to our shareholder and back to our customer, so that objective has not changed at all. Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the analyst question-and-answer session. I will now return you to the Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Ms. Anne Toulouse, Interim Vice President of Communications. Ms. Toulouse, please go ahead. Anne C. Toulouse - The Boeing Co.: Thank you and good morning. We will continue the call with media questions for Dennis and Greg. If you have any questions following this part of the session, please call our Media Relations team at (312) 544-2002. Operator, we are now ready for that first question. In the interest of time we ask that you limit everyone to just one question please. Operator : Thank you and we'll go to Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg. Please go ahead. Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg LP : Hi, good morning, everyone. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Morning, Julie. Julie Johnsson - Bloomberg LP : Greg, you'd mentioned that Boeing now selectively is taking sort of longer-term market opportunity into account when it looks at a business case for products like T-X and MQ-25. Does that mindset and that sort of strategic outlook carry over to the NMA? And just sort of curious also if it does, how you go about ring fencing risk and costs. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, I'd actually say the MQ and T-X are really more looking at it like we typically do and you would on a commercial-type opportunity, so it's really the reverse of that. Having said that, there's a lot of things that we're doing on these programs that Dennis indicated that we're looking at about how does that make us more efficient and more productive on the NMA, and how does it de-risk the NMA business case. So this is where it really is bringing the best of Boeing together in really not reliving lessons, leveraging our investments and our lessons learned across the portfolio. So as we've had NMA teams, we've had 787 teams over on T-X. We've had T-X teams over on NMA and on 787, and we've had people like Mark Jenks, who was obviously a key element on the 787, reviewing T-X. So it's really more again, looking through that commercial, I'd say pretty \u2013 I'd say kind of standard business case over that total market opportunity and what's it take to win in that market and how do you competitively differentiate yourself and bring value back to all the stakeholders and really look for any opportunities to de-risk and leverage again, some of the lessons learned from across the company. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Tangel with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead. Andrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal : Hi there, good morning. Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Morning, Andrew. Gregory D. Smith - The Boeing Co.: Morning. Andrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal : You all talk about the strong state of the airline business and industry overall, strong profits in passenger and cargo growth. Recently, some low-cost airlines have ceased operations and there are some predictions that some other carriers may not make it through the winter as they face higher fuel bills and labor cost. How concerning is that to Boeing, given how much new demand for commercial planes you've all been seeing from low-cost carriers around the world and how much exposure do you have to the order book and how much exposure do you see to demand for commercial aircrafts at least in the short-term? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Andrew, to your point, while we do see some variability amongst the broad range of airline customers that we have, I would say as a composite, we're continuing to see airline profitability trending in a good direction. The airline industry is very healthy overall, across all of the different types of business models including low-cost carriers. And so while there have been some selective challenges within the industry, as a composite it's a strong and healthy airline industry. It's being well-managed. And part of it is the fact we're able to provide our airline customers with advanced capability technologies that are helping them drive profitability and further growth. So we keep an eye on that, but we feel very confident in the overall health of the airline industry, but more broadly, the health of the macro passenger traffic market. Again, year-to-date, 6.8% growth in passenger traffic. It continues to significantly outpace global GDP. That is a fundamental difference from almost any other big industrial sector, and the growing middle-class population around the world is really the driving factor behind that. As I said, 150 million new passengers every year in Asia; people that fly for the first time. Less than 20% of the world's population has yet taken a single flight. So when you think about the macro population trends around the world, that's fueling growth and that's going to be good for the airlines, it's going to be good for us as airplane producers, and if you look at the overall strength of our current market outlook, that 43,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years, we remain very confident in that. In fact we continue to see upward pressure on our market assessment. Operator : Next question is from Eric Johnson with Reuters News. Please go ahead. Eric M. Johnson - Thomson Reuters : Thank you, guys. Appreciate the opportunity. Dennis, I wanted to ask about the charge on T-X and if it is in some way an effort to sort of front load the pain and anticipate a situation similar to what is happening with KC-46. In other words is it inevitable that it may go off course? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: No, Eric, it's dramatically different than that. These, as Greg said, these are planned, purposeful investments up front with a commercial business case wrapped around them. And in particular, on T-X, we have one, de-risked the program with investments that are behind us, having built those two production-ready flying aircraft. That reduces risk in the development program which makes it significantly different than Tanker. But if you look at the forward investments, where we're taking the charges in this quarter, those apply to the future production program and the business case around those, because we see a production opportunity that is well beyond the current contract, the initial contract. So think of these as investments that enable a production run that begins in the early 2020s and will extend literally for decades. So it's fundamentally a different approach. It's making a commercial-like investment in a defense program where we have confidence that it will run for decades both in terms of production line and support and services. Investments behind us are the ones that have de-risked the program and also make it dramatically different than Tanker. Anne C. Toulouse - The Boeing Co.: Operator, we have time for one last question. Operator : That will be from Marcus Weisgerber with Defense One. Please go ahead. Marcus Weisgerber - Defense One : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Earlier this month the White House released an assessment of the defense-industrial base which warns of excessive Chinese-made content in American weapons. And in light of that the Pentagon is planning a legislative package and they are saying they plan to invest in U.S. areas of the supply chain to reduce that Chinese dependence. So my question is does the report make you look differently or reassess any of your suppliers and do you have any indication if Boeing supply chain will be getting any of those pentagon investments? Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.: Yeah, we are very much connected into the defense-industrial base policies and plans, working hand-in-hand with the Pentagon and our U.S. customers. We, as a matter of normal business, have great visibility into our Supply Chain and all of the export/import rules and regulations that get applied to that are built in and are something that's built into how we do business every day. So as we look at deep supply chain capabilities and supply sources, this is not new to us. In fact these are things that we completely understand and govern our business today, and we'll be continuing to work jointly with the Defense Department as we define sources for the future and ensuring that we have, I'll say the diversity of supplier sources that we need here in the U.S. to satisfy our defense customer needs. I don't see this as anything that's going to substantially change our business model or our Supply Chain going forward. It will just add additional discipline to ensure the security of that Supply Chain. Anne C. Toulouse - The Boeing Co.: Okay, that concludes our earnings call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analysts and media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcasted live over the Internet. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I am going to turning the call over to Ms. Maurita Sutedja, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Ms. Sutedja, please go ahead. Maurita Sutedja : Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. I'm Maurita Sutedja. And with me today is Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Enterprise Performance & Strategy. After management comment, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. As always we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. And as a reminder you can follow today\u2019s broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com. Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals we include in our discussion this morning are likely to involve risks, which is detailed in our news release in our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this rough presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook. Now, I will turn the call over to Dennis Muilenburg. Dennis Muilenburg : Thank you, Maurita, and good morning. Let me begin today with a brief overview of our 2018 operating performance, followed by an update on the business environment and our expectations going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook. With that, let's move to Slide 2. Thanks to the dedicated efforts of our teams across the company. Boeing delivered strong 2018 financial results that included record revenue, earnings per share and operating cash flow, driven by record commercial air craft deliveries, higher defense space and securities and services volume and strong performance. And all of our three businesses increased their backlog in 2018. We sharpened our focus on profitable, sustained long-term growth strategies, disciplined execution of our production and development programs, delivering greater life cycle value, including growing our services business and driving further quality, safety and productivity gains across the enterprise. For the full year, we generated record operating cash flow of $15.3 billion. We repurchased 26.1 million shares for $9 billion and made dividend payments totaling $3.9 billion in 2018.We continue to deliver on our commitment to returning cash to shareholders while investing in our people, innovation and future growth. In December, our Board of Directors authorized a new $20 billion share repurchase program and a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend. The increase is a part of our balanced cash deployment strategy and reflected the confidence we have in our strong lineup of products and services in our long-term outlook for the business. Turning to our core operating performance for the year, Boeing Commercial Airplanes generated revenue of $60.7 billion reflecting a record 806 deliveries, including the delivery of the first 787\u201310 Dreamliner and the first 737 Max 9. During the year, we delivered 256 Max airplanes nearly half of the total 737 deliveries. Continued healthy sales activity contributed to 893 net new airplane orders during the year adding to our robust backlog stands at nearly 5,900 airplanes and is worth $412 billion. Our backlog equates to about seven years production at current rates. B Commercial Airplane milestones in 2018 included the delivery of the 787 Dreamliner and the first airplane from the new 737 completion center in China. The 737 program increased its production rate to 52 per month and made good progress on its recovery plans to mitigate supply chain challenges with the 173 aircraft delivered in the fourth quarter. Also in the year, we completed the first flight of the 737 Max 7 and delivered the first Max Boeing business jet airplane. The 777X program achieved a number of key milestones last year as we rolled out the static test airplane and began production of the flight test airplanes. We recently completed Final Body Join for the first flight test airplane and turned on its electrically powered systems. We plan to start flight testing this year and remain on track for the first 777X delivery in 2020. Meanwhile the 787 program further matured its rate readiness. We have started transitioning 14 per month in our factories and supply chain as we prepare to begin delivering at this higher rate. We expect to complete the transition in the second quarter. Now over to Defense, Space & Security. BDS reported revenue of $23.2 billion, a 13% growth year-on-year, reflecting higher volume across its business. BDS booked $36 billion of new orders during the year, including wins on important new franchise opportunities like the T-X trainer, the MQ-25 unmanned aircraft and the MH-139 helicopter. More recently, in the fourth quarter, BDS was awarded contract to modernize the entire Spanish Chinook Helicopter fleet and a joint ground system to provide tactical satellite communications for the U.S. Air Force. BDS made progress on a number of critical program milestones, including delivering the first two KC 46 tankers to the U.S. Air Force earlier this month. Two more tankers have been accepted by the Air Force, and we expect to deliver these aircraft imminently. We look forward to working with the Air Force and the Navy during their initial operational test and evaluation of the KC-46, as we further demonstrate the operational capabilities as this next generation aircraft across refueling, mobility and combat weapon system missions. Additionally we receive the contract provide the second KC-46 international tanker to Japan. This highlights the broader demand in market opportunity that we see for this program. Other key operational milestones for BDS included the unveiling of the SB-1 Defiant helicopter Boeing and Sikorsky are developing for the U.S. Army's joint multirole technology demonstrator program and completing another Minuteman III flight test. We continue to ramp up the activities for the T-X and MQ-25 programs. These wins are the culmination of years of unwavering focus, improving our technology and derisking the programs. We have developed and flight tested two all-new production ready T-X jets with 76 flight tests having been completed to date. We've already seeing strong interest as well for the T-X from outside of the U.S. On MQ-25, we have demonstrated deck handling and engine trials. Our MQ-25 prototype aircraft is currently in ground test and expected to undergo first flight this year. Now turning to Global Services. BGS reported revenue of $17 billion, representing 17% growth year-on-year. Business operations begin in July of 2017. BGS growth is consistently outpaced the average for the services market. BGS continues to win new business, highlighting the value we bring to our broad range of commercial and government customers and the strength of our One Boeing offerings. BGS booked new orders totaling approximately $18 billion in 2018. The awards included support services and sustained the contracts for military customers globally such as the recent C-17, F-18 and F-22 contracts with U.S. Navy and Air Force and F-15 for Qatar. In addition to the strong momentum in its parts and supply chain business, BGS continues to expand its market-leading digital solution portfolio and customer base. In the fourth quarter, more than 5,300 commercial and military aircraft were monitored in flight by airplane health management, a cloud-based real-time health monitoring solution. Adding to the list of our digital analytics customers Shenzhen airlines recently signed up for crew pairing and rostering services. Shenzhen will be the first airline in China to use Boeing analytics power crew management solutions bringing the most advanced data analytics capabilities to the airlines, allow them to focus on their core business is serving their customers while improving efficiency and cost. In the fourth quarter, we also completed acquisition of KLX, a major global provider of aviation parts and services. Boosting our supply chain capability enables us to better serve our customers while profitably and purposefully growing our business. Our integration activities continue to progress well. We've retained the top KLX talent and are on track to achieve or exceed our business case synergy value. Additionally, last year we started operations for our airplane seat joint venture with Adient, and an Auxiliary Power Units joint venture with Safran. These partnerships support Boeing's vertical integration strategy to strengthen in-house capabilities and depth in key areas to offer better products that deliver greater value to our customers, grow our services business and generate greater life cycle value. We've also made progress in our strategic partnership with Embraer. We've recently received approval by the Government of Brazil and signed definitive agreements with Embraer. The Embraer shareholder votes scheduled for February 26 is the next major milestone. Over the coming months we'll continue to work with Embraer global regulators and other stakeholders to complete the transaction and create the most important strategic partnership in the aerospace industry. Assuming the approvals are received in a timely manner, we expect to close the transaction by the end of this year. In summary, we delivered another year of strong operating performance, captured noteworthy additions to our large and diverse backlog, returned significant cash to our shareholders, invested in our people and in our business to drive innovation and excellence and complemented our organic growth with planned strategic inorganic investments. With that, let\u2019s turn to the business environment on Slide 3. We continue to see healthy global demand for our offerings in commercial, defense, space and services. These are sizable sectors that are growing and backed by strong fundamentals with a combined market opportunity of $8.1 trillion over the next 10 years. I would note that as a global company with customers in 150 countries, we're always mindful of the potential impact of geopolitical and macroeconomic forces. We continue to track a host of near-term issues and mitigate potential risks as appropriate. We value and maintain strong relationships with our customers, suppliers and other stakeholders around the world, reinforcing the mutual economic benefits of the strong and prosperous aerospace industry. In commercial aviation, global passenger traffic continues to grow faster than GDP and long-term trends. The 2018 passenger traffic grew 6.6% through November, representing the ninth straight year of above trend growth. We believe the changing nature of travel with more connected city pairs and the rising middle-class has fundamentally expanded traffic patterns and supports sustained growth. At the same time, airlines are maintaining capacity discipline, keeping supply demand imbalance as industry profitability remains near historic highs. Meanwhile, Air Cargo continued its solid momentum in 2018 with traffic increasing nearly 4% through November. Our customers continue to recognize the superior value proposition of our more fuel efficient airplanes as reflected in the strong intake of new orders we saw last year. For 2019, we expect to see our new order intake to be moderated but still at a healthy pace. Our sales expectations are built on the diverse demand that we\u2019re seeing around the world and across airline business models. There also is more balance between airplanes purchase for fleet growth and replacement leading to more stable purchasing patterns. We believe the evolution in these key market dynamics in aggregate continues to drive less cyclicality for our industry. Over the long term, we remain highly confident in our outlook, which forecasts demand for nearly 43,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years, which will help double the size of the global fleet. These long-term demand fundamentals combined with healthy market conditions and a robust backlog provides a solid foundation for our planned production rates. Now turning to our product segments, starting with the narrow-body, our current production rate of 52 per month and planned increase to 57 this year is based on our backlog of more than 4,700 aircraft and a production skyline that is sold out into early next decade. The 737 program added 13 new customers during the year and the Max family surpassed 5,000 net orders in December. We continue to assess the market upward pressure on the 737 production rate. As with all rate increases, we continue to assess the supply chain readiness as well as the market demand in an integrated manner as part of our disciplined decision-making. In wide-body segment, we have seen steady orders for the 787 and the 777, and have high confidence in a meaningful increase in wide-body replacement demand early next decade. The current generation 777 continued its steady sales momentum with 51 net orders. The 777 program is captured more than 2,000 orders since its launch. These additional orders brought the backlog to 100 aircraft and provide further support for the 777 bridge. Turning to the 777X, we've recently launched our Boeing Business Jet variance, the longest range business jets ever that can connect virtually any two cities in the world. We have a strong foundation of 340 orders and commitments for the 777X, which support our plan for ramping up production and delivery of this new aircraft. We\u2019re focused on further bolstering the 777X skyline. The combined 777, 777X production rate is slight for month. As we transition to 777X, we continue to expect the delivery rate to be approximately 3.5 aircraft per month in 2019, and we expect the delivery rate to increase slightly in 2020 as we continue to assess 777 demand as well as 777X timing. The 787 Dreamliner extended its status as the fastest selling twin-aisle jet in history with 109 net orders last year or more than 1,400, since the program launched. Highlights include Hawaiian Airlines and Turkish Airlines becoming new 787 customers. American Airlines and United Airlines added to the growing list of repeat 787 Dreamliner customers, highlighting the strong market preference for the 787 family and its superior value. With more than 600 in the backlog, our plant increased Dreamliner production to 14 airplanes per month this year is well supported. Turning to our 747 and 767 programs. With our unmatched freighter product lines, we are well-positioned to capture the increased cargo demand. We added four new orders for the 747 in the fourth quarter. And as previously announced, we planned to increase 767 production rate from 2.5 per month to 3 per month in 2020. As Defense, Space & Security, we continue to see solid demand for our major platforms and programs. The BGS portfolio is well-positioned with the mature world-class set of platforms to address current needs and innovative capable and affordable new franchise programs to build the future. We expect to continue to see broad support for our products in the Pentagon and Congress. Fiscal year 2019 defense bills authorized a fourth multiyear procurement for the F-18 fighter, added funding for additional rotorcraft, funded the requested quantities, our key programs across our fixed wing and commercial derivative aircraft portfolios and supported our missile, space and satellite products. While the fiscal year 2019 NASA appropriations have not yet been enacted, Congress is also demonstrated robust support for our key space exploration programs. Demand from outside the U.S. for our defense and space offerings also remains high, in particular for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters and satellites. Our investment in future growth and new sales continues in areas that are priorities for our customers. We will continue to leverage capabilities and technologies from across our enterprise to win important opportunities such as the ground based strategic deterrent. Turning to the services sector. We see the $2.8 trillion services market over the next 10 years as a significant growth opportunity for our company. BGS provides agile, cost competitive services to our customers worldwide. We aim to continue to growing faster than the average services market growth rate of 3.5% as we further expand our broad portfolio of services offerings and continue to gain market share. BGS' 17% year-over-year revenue increase solidifies our confidence and the growth opportunities and our team's ability to capture it. Strong orders of $18 billion as the year reflect our customers' recognition of our value proposition and helping them optimize the performance to their fleets and reduce operational cost through the lifecycle. Our focus for BGS remains on optimizing the businesses and expanding our portfolio offerings through organic growth investments such as strengthening our vertical capabilities, complemented by strategic acquisitions and partnerships positioned BGS for sustained long-term and profitable growth. Our expertise, the global reach of our business and our strong customer partnerships have us well-positioned to compete and win in this important sector. In summary, with growing markets and opportunities ahead, our team remained intensely focused on growth, innovation and accelerating productivity improvements to fuel our investments in the future. For example, the first test flight of our autonomous passenger air vehicle prototype last week chose our efforts to continue to lead with the safe, innovative and responsible approach to new mobility solutions. Our One Boeing strategies and offerings across our three businesses are key differentiators that helps demand our position as the world's leading aerospace company. With that, Greg, over to you for the financial results. Greg Smith : Great. Thanks, Dennis. Good morning, everybody. Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our full year results. We booked record revenue of $101 billion in 2018, exceeding $100 billion for the first time in the company's history. This is driven by record commercial aircraft deliveries, higher Defense, Space & Security volume and continued growth in services. Core earnings-per-share totaled $16.01 for the full year, and other record reflecting higher volume, improved mix and solid execution across the company. Operating cash for the year was also a record at $15.3 billion. The robust cash generation was largely driven by higher volume and strong operating performance across the businesses. Let\u2019s move now to our quarterly results on Slide 5. Fourth quarter revenue increased to $28.3 billion driven by growth in all three businesses while core earnings per share grew to $5.48, driven by higher volume and strong operating performance across the portfolio, which outweighed the favorable tax reform impact in the fourth quarter of last year. Now let's discuss Commercial Airplanes on Slide 6. Our Commercial Airplane business revenue of $17.3 billion during the quarter reflected higher deliveries and favorable mix. BCA operating margins increased to 15.6%, driven by higher 737 volume and strong operating performance on production programs, including higher 787 margins. BCA captured $16 billion of net orders during the fourth quarter and the backlog remains strong at $412 billion with nearly 5,900 aircraft, representing approximately seven years of production. We delivered 238 aircraft in the quarter, including 173 737s. And as we discussed, the 737 deliveries for the year were back loaded due to production and supply chain recovery efforts. Let's now turn to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 7. Fourth quarter revenue increased to $6.1 billion driven by higher volume across the BDS portfolio, including F-18 satellites and weapons. BDS margins increased to 10.9%, reflecting solid performance and favorable mix. BDS added $5 billion of new orders in the quarter, bringing its backlog to $57 billion with 30% of that from outside of the United States. Turning now to Global Services results on Slide 8. In the fourth quarter, Global Services revenue increased $4.9 billion, reflecting higher volume predominantly driven by increased sales of parts and supply chain solutions. Year-over-year growth of 17% for the full year, which was predominantly driven by organically more than meets our objective to outpace the average annual service market growth rate of 3.5%. BGS operating margins were strong at 15%, reflecting the mix of products and services in the quarter, as well as improved performance partially offset by higher period costs for investments focused on expanding our portfolio of offerings going forward. During the quarter, BGS won key contract awards worth approximately $6 billion bringing our backlog to $21 billion. These wins underscore the strength of our One Boeing offerings to our customers. Let's turn now to cash flow on Slide 9. Operating cash flow for the quarter and full year was strong at $2.9 billion and $15.3 billion respectively. These results were driven by planned higher volume strong operating performance across the business and some timing of receipt and expenditures. We remain focused and on track with our balanced cash deployment strategy. In 2018, we invested $5 billion in R&D and CapEx, repurchased $9 billion of Boeing stock and paid $3.9 billion in dividends reflecting a 20% increase in dividend per-share from last year. And we also completed the KLX acquisition in the fourth quarter. The strength of our business and our confidence in the sustainable long-term outlook are powering investments in productivity, innovation and growth, while delivering on our commitments to return cash to shareholders. As Dennis mentioned earlier in December, last year we reinforced our commitment to returning value to shareholders as our Board of Directors authorized a new $20 billion share repurchase program in a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend. Over the last five years, we've repurchased more than 205 million shares and increased our dividend by more than 180%. At the same time, we've invested nearly $35 billion in key strategic areas of our business to support long-term growth sustainability for Boeing, for our customers and our shareholders. We remain committed to continue to execute on our balanced cash deployment strategy going forward. Let's move now to cash and debt balances on Slide 10. We ended the quarter with $8.6 billion of cash and marketable securities, $13.8 billion of debt and stable credit ratings. Our cash and debt position reflects the acquisition of KLX in the fourth quarter. And our balance sheet position continues to provide us with flexibility to invest in innovation and profitable growth opportunities while again returning value back to shareholders. Turning now Slide 11 to discuss our outlook for 2019. Building on the strong performance in 2018, our guidance for 2019 reflects higher volume, improved core operating performance, additional productivity capture and continued focus and effort to drive growing cash flows. Total company revenue for 2019 is forecasted to be between $109.5 and $111.5 billion, largely reflecting higher plan 737 and 787 production rate and growth in both services as well as defense, space, and security. Core earnings per share guidance for 2019 is set to be between $19.90 and $20.10 per share on higher volume, favorable mix and improved productivity and affordability. Operating cash flow for 2019 is forecasted to increase by $2 billion to be between $17 billion and $17.5 billion. This is largely driven by improved 787 cash generation in 2019, higher overall volume, including 737 and 787 production and improving tanker cash profile that partially offset by increased plan 777X inventory related test aircraft and early build units and higher cash taxes, primarily due to improved unit profitability, as well as higher planned R&D spending in 2019. Capital spending is forecasted to be approximately $2.3 billion and includes the timing shift some expenditures that were expected in 2018. Our investments align with our long-term growth and productivity strategy that supports for programs, innovation, productivity verticals and services. And before we discuss the business unit guidance I would like to highlight the beginning of in January 2019, we are changing the realignment of our military derivative aircraft contracts, such as the KC-46 tanker P-8 Poseidon VC-25 Air Force 1 between BCA and BDS. This changes to better reflect the contractual relationship with the end customers as BDS calls the prime contract. This accounting realignment does not change how BCA and BDS execute together on these contracts. Also it does not expect total Boeing sales, earnings assets, cash flow assets or liabilities. Our 2019 segment guidance includes the impact this realignment, and beginning in January 2019, revenue and costs associated with military derivative aircraft that was previously reported in both BCA and BDS will now be 100% reported in the BDS segment. And for comparison purposes as part of the earnings release, we provided restated 2018 and 2017 financial information incorporating this accounting change. Now for 2019, commercial airplane revenue guidance it is set to be between 64.5 and 65.5 billion. And as we've discussed this is largely driven on the higher deliveries of 737 and 787 program, partially offset by the impact of the military derivative aircraft realignment the BDS. The ramp up on the 737 Max production continues and we expect 737 Max to account for approximately 90% of total 737 deliveries in 2019. In all BCA's expect to deliver between 895 and 905 airplanes for the full year. Incorporating this delivery guidance assumptions, our plan 737 and 787 production rate increases and the inter company deliveries of the military aircraft from BCA to BDS. Commercial Airplane operating margin guidance is set to be between 14.5% and 15% on higher 737 volume and improved operating performance, which more than offset the higher period costs including R&D. The margin guidance also reflects all plan production rate increases. Defense, Space & Security revenue guidance for 2019 is between $26.5 billion and $27.5 billion, reflecting the higher volume in our new programs, strong backlog on core programs and the impact of the military derivative aircraft realignment from BCA. Operating margin guidance for defense business is greater than 11% based on continued productivity efforts across the portfolio, offset by less favorable mix. Global Services revenue guidance is set to be between $18.5 billion and $19 billion with operating margins of greater than 15%. BGS margin guidance reflects solid performance, mix of products and services as well as investments to expand our portfolio of offerings. And as we discussed, we aim to grow faster than the average service market growth rate of 3.5%, as we expand our broad service offerings and gain market share while maintaining and growing margins. We expect research and development spending to increase to approximately $4.1 billion in 2019, with approximately 60% related to BCA as we invest in future growth. BDS and BGS also continue to invest in key strategic growth opportunities and productivity enablers. In addition, we will continue to make investments at the corporate level for technology and innovation, with enterprise applicability. This 2019 R&D forecast also includes some timing shifts and some expenditure previously planned in 2018. Our R&D funding will continue to be focused on our core programs, key future franchises, productivity enablers such as automation, prototyping and capabilities to further are vertical content, lifecycle capture, and other key growth areas such as economy and mobility solutions. We will continue to make the required investment innovation and technology to ensure our products and services continue to win in the marketplace. And going forward, we expect our overall R&D spending as a percentage of revenue to be relatively stable. While our organic investment remains the primary engine for growth, we may partner with other industry players and investments that accelerate our lifecycle value strategy and strengthen our vertical capabilities and content, as demonstrated by the proposed strategic partnership with Embraer, which assuming all approvals are received in a timely manner we expect to close by the end of the year. Now consisted with prior years and given the seasonality of our business, as we look into the next quarter, we expect first quarter to be the lowest quarter of the year for revenue. With the relatively light commercial airplane deliveries, January is expected to have slow delivery activity consistent with prior year trends and reflects the supply chain recovery plans. Core EPS is estimated to be approximately 20% of the full year earnings, and first quarter operating cash is forecasted to be approximately 10% to 15%, again driven by lower volume and the timing of receipts and expenditures. As we look towards the remainder of the year our key focus areas are continuing to manage the 737 recovery progress within our factories and throughout our supply chain, including assuring rate readiness for a smooth transition to 57 a month, also working together with our U.S. Air Force customer delivering additional KC-46 tankers, continuing healthy order momentum, especially our new program such as the 777X, as well as strong execution across the portfolio including T-X and MQ-25 development. So in summary, our core operating engine continues to deliver strong results. We continue to use our three business unit strategy as a key differentiator to win in the marketplace, make prudent strategic investments and leverage the talent and innovation from across the company. At the same time, we will set challenging goals and objectives around elements of operations and support functions tied to profitability and efficiency to generate cash, improve working capital while drive value to our customers. All these will help us achieve our growth goal to grow year-over-year revenue, margins and cash flow. With that, I'll turn it back to Dennis for some closing comments. Dennis Muilenburg : All right. Thanks Greg. 2018 was the year of strong performance and record results on many different fronts operationally and financially. A demonstration of how our team remains focused on further driving both growth and productivity. These results were achieved through the hard work and dedication of our employees and the great partnerships that we have with our customers and suppliers. In addition to the strong commercial airplane market dynamics I mentioned earlier in my remarks, we have taken our own actions to reduce cyclicality in our business. This includes remaining disciplined in our production rate decisions, derisking our pension liabilities, strategically phasing our research and development spending, creating labor stability with long-term contracts, and expanding our services business, which is also less cyclical. We've executed on our long-term strategy of robust and continuing organic growth investment and returning value to shareholders, complemented by strategic acquisitions and partnerships that enhance and accelerate our growth plans. The planned strategic partnerships with Embraer, the recent KLX acquisition, and the seats and APU joint ventures are entirely consistent with the strategy. Our priorities going forward are to leverage our unique One Boeing advantages, continued building strength on strength to deliver and improve on our commitments and to stretch beyond those plans and sharpen and accelerate our pace of progress on key enterprise growth and productivity efforts. As always, we'll continue to keep a close eye on the geopolitical and macroeconomic forces and prudently manage the risks. Achieving these objectives will require a clear and consistent focus on the profitable ramp-up in Commercial Airplane production, continuing to strengthen our Defense, Space & Security business, growing our integrated services business and leveraging the power of our three business unit strategy, delivering on our development programs, driving world-class levels of productivity and performance throughout the enterprise to fund our investments in innovation and growth, disciplined leading-edge investments and a balanced value-creating cash deployment strategy and continuing to develop and maintain the best team and talent in the industry, all of which position Boeing for continued market leadership, sustained top and bottom line growth and increasing value for our customers, shareholders and employees and other stakeholders. With that, we will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Rajeev Lalwani : On the 737 at what point you expect to be caught up on deliveries? And what are the pressure points identically? Also how does that inform the latest thinking and timeline on decision beyond 57 a month? Dennis Muilenburg : Certainly 737 production system health remains a key focus for us. As you can see by the fourth quarter deliveries with 173 in the quarter and 69 in December, good signs of recovering to our production plan. You can also see the increased rates reflected in our full-year guidance for deliveries for 2019, as we continue to ramp up. I would say we still have work to do on the recovery efforts. We have seen some good solid progress. We still have work to do inside our own factories and in our supply chain. And that is the daily and weekly focus for us, very intense effort. I'll say within the supply chain, we have seen some solid recovery in several areas. We still have some areas that need work including engines. And we are doing some additional work with CFM, including deploying some additional Boeing personnel to their factories and to their sub tier suppliers. So that\u2019s one area that will have some additional focus for us in the first quarter. And as Greg mentioned, just in terms of production profile for the year, we expect the first quarter to be the lightest quarter of the year, and we expect January to be the lightest month within that quarter. So we are going to continue to work hard on production system holds and recovery. And then as you alluded to, at same time, we are moving forward on our plans to ramp up to 57 a month during the year. Some elements of the supply chain have already moved to that position. We still have some work to do before we move the entire line to 57 a month. And we are going to be very, very disciplined in that process. Again we are making good progress. We know exactly what needs to be done, but we are going to just look at this through very clear eyes and step through it day-by-day, week-by-week, and make sure that we in a very disciplined and smooth way move to 57 a month. I think we learned some lessons from the 52 a month step that we did last year. And those lessons are certainly being applied this year on the 57 a month are rate changes. But you see all of that again reflected in our plans and our guidance for 2019. Operator : Our next question is from Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead. Myles Walton : Could you catch us up on your latest thinking on the NMA? And maybe tie that to your view on moderating demand, I guess, if -- demand would obviously fluctuate a bit if you chose to launch the aircraft with the pile of launch customers, I would imagine. So maybe just juxtapose those two different points. Dennis Muilenburg : Myles, I would say -- first off, to take a look at NMA, we are still working through that same disciplined decision process that we talked about previously. We\u2019re making progress on that. We had very productive conversations with customers. We understand the markets. It's clear that there is a market need, but we\u2019re working through the details of the business case. And as we said, we are going to be very disciplined on how we do that. And while we\u2019re making progress, we're not up to our decision point yet. And just to provide clarity on that, as we mentioned before, we do see a decision point this year and that is a decision of whether we would offer the airplane in the market. And we need to complete the business case analysis before we arrive at that decision, but that is one that\u2019s for this year. And then assuming a positive market response or depending on the market response, we will make the final launch decision next year. So it's a two-step decision process as we've always done with Commercial Airplanes and a very disciplined process. All of that, we're continuing to work our development program work and maturing the technologies, reducing risk in parallel to protect a 2025 EIS or Entry Into Service. We think that remains important to our customers. So we\u2019re working all of that in parallel. And again will March in a disciplined way through our decision process. Our assessment of the market and the size of that market hasn\u2019t changed. Now, to our broader question on orders and how the markets looking, again, we continue to see strong demand signal. So I think you see that reflected in orders volume for this past year with 806 deliveries and 893 orders. And, while as I said, we expect some moderation or timing on orders going forward, we have a very robust backlog position with about seven years of backlog -- equipment backlog in position now. If you look at the stats on traffic growth, Cargo, global expansion of route structures all the fundamentals remained very strong, and we\u2019re encouraged by that. So we expect to see continuing steady orders volume. I wouldn't expect that to change significantly depending on the NMA decision. So we\u2019re going to be in the marketplace continuing to compete and win. I guess one other reminder on NMA, if we do decide to proceed with the authority to offer -- don't expect a big change in the R&D profile. This is all part of our planned R&D profile. As Greg said earlier, we expect R&D to continue to be roughly the same in terms of percentage of revenue going forward. So as revenue grows, you will see some R&D growth. That will be at the same percent. And if we launch NMA, it will better end on the backside of 777X. So from a profile standpoint it fits very nicely. Greg anything, do you want to add on that? Greg Smith : No. Thanks. We got it. Operator : Next question is from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Spingarn : So your margins of BCA are now in your target area of the mid-teens, with the 2019 guidance where it is. And you're still not fully ramped with production rates as more upside there, and you built the higher R&D into the 19 forecast. So I wanted to ask how much of this 2019 improvement in margins is volume versus mix versus productivity? And with the supply chain initiative still ongoing, what is your longer term margin potential now? How much further can you go. I was going to ask you how much it differs with and without a new airplane. But I think you just answered that part. So the components of the improvement in 2019 and then what the potential is long-term not that you've gotten this far. Dennis Muilenburg : Yes. No, no. It\u2019s a great question, Rob. I would say it's all the above. I mean certainly, the increased volume is a big driver to that, but the mix of that volume is important. And we have talked about and particularly 787 executing on bringing in the -9 or -10 flawlessly into the market and meeting the commitments to our customers there and ensuring that happens smoothly while going up in rate. You saw that in '18, and you are going to see that in '19 as we look to go to 14 a month there, but the productivity engine. So -- I'll say the targets that we've set for ourselves is the same play book that we put in place for last number of years of really just looking where we have opportunity, where we can leverage best practices. We have talked a lot about this for One Boeing effort. But there is a lot of -- there is a lot behind that. and leveraging things that are going on F/A-18 on 87, and leveraging things on 87 over onto Chinook and vice a versa. That's now part of our operating rhythm. And certainly it's how we are all rewarded and ultimately how the company is rewarded. So this complete alignment to leverage these practices same in the supply chain. So the whole partnering for success effort is -- some of that is also where we have had productivity gains, how do we take those back in the supply chain frankly make the supply chain even better. But to come up with ways where we can both take that to the bottom line and reinvest in growth for the future. So I would say, it plays into all three, but I, Rob, I would think about the playbook, the same playbook you saw for the last couple of years that\u2019s the playbook. And I would add to that benchmarking ourselves outside. The full global industrial champion effort that you could imagine that target keeps moving. So when we look at the cost of the function what's the cost us to run a function or how efficient are we with our capital and with our R&D and what are some best practices within industrials, outside the industrial, how we bring them back in the Boeing, make it part of our operating rhythm and hold ourselves to a standard that it's not necessarily industry, it could be -- its best-in-class. And then again, holding ourselves accountable and targeting ourselves to go achieve all that. So I would say same playbook so we don't really have a cap. I think I would say it's really just continuing to look for opportunities and compete to win, use some of that. Robert Spingarn : It is your pace of improvement because you hit your target or at least you will in '19 based on the guidance. And again, you are not done improving the organization. So is there a new target? Dennis Muilenburg : Rob, we are not slowing down. So as we said we set a target. We've been aggressively pursuing that. We've made some great progress and part of the team's efforts there. But the competition is only getting tougher, and we are not going to slowdown. So the pace of progress you have seen is the pace of progress we aim to sustain. And what we are looking for is continued year-over-year margin and cash flow growth. That's part of our planning. That's the framework that we set up for the team. And we are going to push with that pace. Operator : Our next question is from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Carter Copeland : Greg, I wonder if I just get a couple of clarifications on the quarter and then a question about the guidance. With respect to what you printed, just wanted to check on the unit earnings that the --, it looks like the 737 is still unit below your program margin, but not by much. And then with respect to the 87 deferred, it looks like you had a margin expansion there that kept the deferred down. I just wondered if that was correct. And then just building on Rob's question, what\u2019s built into your 19 plan? Do you have any material differences and period expense outside of R&D that you envision for next year that we should be considering. And so, can you help us quantify how we think about that? Dennis Muilenburg : Yes. I mean, I would say outside of R&D, we definitely got some investments around productivity and systems that were making again, thinking about kind of long-term competitiveness. So we've got some money put aside in there and budgeted for the year. Carter Copeland : Does that help year-on-year. Dennis Muilenburg : Yes. So obviously, we will manage that extremely tight as we always do, but we got budgets in place there and clear initiatives in business cases to go drive that. They're at a little over and above what we we're spending in 2018. Carter Copeland : All included in that. Dennis Muilenburg : All included. Absolutely, yes. Greg Smith : And your Unit 2 program, you got it, you right on it. I mean 737, but increase in 787, we had a block extension in the quarter that was a big driver of that units, sorry, that program margin increase. Operator : And next we go to Douglas Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Douglas Harned : I wanted to continue on the 787. And just to understand a little bit better, how you\u2019re looking at this longer-term and in terms of cash margin improvement? I mean, at a point now where you don't have that many shades in the mix anymore, and then you're going to have more [indiscernible]. And then, if I look at pricing, I wouldn't expect you to get a lot more from there. So can you talk about, as you look at the next few years, how you see that cash margin trajectory evolving and what's likely to drive it? Greg Smith : Yes. Well, it's going to continue to grow, Doug. And as Dennis said, I mean the team's done a great job executing to our commitments, our rate breaks. But I know I keep going on about this, but we\u2019re not bringing two derivatives in while going up and rise. There is no small path and they done it extremely well, and then at the same time, leveraging the best practices. So that's all going to continue to play out. As you go forward here, you're right bringing in more --10s because the mix of the higher 9s and 10s, right now, it's predominantly 9, and --10 is good. You\u2019re going to see the benefit of that over that longer-term period from the cash perspective and then going up in rates. So you'll see the cash associated with those advances as well as with that higher rate. But again, at the same time bringing down the expenditures, and do not forget we've got step down pricing as well on the supply chain that will play into that along with our own productivity. So it's probably fits into about six categories of things that need to happen or things that are just going to happen through time as we execute through each of these blocks and having a more favorable mix combined with continuing to have a step down from the supply chain. So, again, we see growing cash flow on the 787. They have done a great job in delivering on their commitments to shareholders, but also the customers and now we\u2019re moving into the next phase,  moving up into 14 and continuing to capture productivity gains. Douglas Harned : And then just on the -10, when you delivered, I think, nine of them in Q4. So would it be fair to say that your -10 margins were probably a little less mature in the quarter we just saw and you should get some improvement out of that as well. Is that clear? Greg Smith : To your point still relatively early in the production system and in the supply chain. So as that becomes more mature just like we would normally will come down that learning curve as the supply chain will and we will capture the benefits of that. Dennis Muilenburg : To that, Doug, there is also big benefit from the high level of manufacturing commonality between the -10 and 9, which accelerates and reinforces what Greg said. And then the value proposition for that airplane in the market with our customers is very clear that it's generating value and its winning in the marketplace on the pricing side. It's holding up well there as well just because of the value its creating for our customers. Operator : Next question from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman : So you mentioned the idea of, I think, trying to bolster the backlog for 777 and 777x. And you talked a lot in the past about call wide-body replacement orders coming in the early part of the next decade. Does that mean in the near-term, are there 777x order opportunities or fewer opportunities in the near-term kind of focus on more of the classic and freighters and we are we kind wait until we get into the early part of the next decade to see the orders for the 777X comes through. Dennis Muilenburg : Seth, we\u2019re working both in parallel. Certainly during the last year we've seen some great progress on the 777 with the 51 net orders in the year. And that's really strengthens that the bridge that we\u2019re building 777 to 777X. We still have some work to do to fill out the remainder of the bridge, but our confidence continues to grow in our ability to do that. And as we've made that progress, we are now shifting our teams more and more to 777X opportunities. As you said we do see a high wave of replacement demand early in the next decade. But that means those sales campaigns are underway now. So those are very active, we\u2019re engaged with a number of customers around the world. The 777x clearly is bringing a value proposition as the market gets attractive. And you'll see us focusing more and more on those 777x campaigns here during this coming year. So that's a very near-term effort as well. And all of that is consistent with the investment profile and the production system ramp and transition that we talked about earlier. Operator : Next, we will go to David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss : In the free cash flow walk that you provided, you highlighted the headwinds from 777x in 2019. Could you maybe talk about, is 2019 going to be the peak year for 777x investment, I\u2019m thinking mainly working capital. And how many airplanes do you plan on kind of having in flow before you actually start making deliveries? Greg Smith : Yes. The profile, David, certainly for the reasons you described building the inventory and the test aircraft and so on. So this year there is more headwind. And then as we move into 2020, that headwind will moderate. And so we will start to have some more positive cash flow with the combination of 777X moving into production and then into delivery. So this is kind of a peak year for us on, I will say, cash usage on 777 combined with 777x. So as Dennis said, transitioning the airplane today in the factory and moving through building up that move from development to production will be key, and obviously, a big driver on the cash flow and things are going well out there today. So we got very good early signs that the aircraft is moving into production system smoothly and any challenges we're having we\u2019re working through we know what they are, but so far so good. So that'll be a big driver of cash flow going forward. David Strauss : And did I hear you say that 777 deliveries in 2020 would actually step up a bit is that just the legacy kind of 777 rate holding and 777X starting to deliver? Greg Smith : Well, it's really the combined of the two. So it\u2019s the X and the 777. Now having said that, it's indicated we\u2019re still seeing lot of demand for the 777, in particular, in the area freight. So we\u2019re feathering all this together and making sure that we're in the marketplace and we are meeting the demands of the customers in the near-term, but at the same time feathering in the 777X. So that\u2019s kind of a key in 2020. But we're not seeing good demand there on the 777. So we will -- that will be a combined production rate on those two programs. Dennis Muilenburg : Yes. Just for clarity, 2020, production system will be operating in five months, when we look at that delivery rate, slightly increasing over the current 3.5 months delivery rate, that's the combination of 777 and 777X as Greg mentioned. Operator : Next we will go to Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Going back to commercial profitability just because this is such a standout, how sustainable is the 100 bps of margin improvement? Are there any mix impact we should be thinking about with the 777 coming in with this changing customers dynamics for any pricing dynamics that would alter that trajectory? Greg Smith : You're thinking kind of beyond '19? Sheila Kahyaoglu : Yes. Greg Smith : Well, I mean, there is a lot of moving pieces. Obviously, when you get into '19, we're more stable at 14 a month and we're more stable at the 57. So again, we should be able to capture productivity and we're expecting to capture productivity in that. And there are some mix movements certainly between the 777 ramping down and the X moving in. So there's a lot of moving pieces, but I think, Sheila, and I will let Dennis comment here. But the objective we have in place is the same one as I address in the prior question. We\u2019re looking for opportunities where we can derisk production system and bringing in automation where we can bring in automation and bring in best practices with an overall objective to grow margins and fund our future and return cash to shareholders. So that's playbook. You should just think of that is the same no matter what the mix. So we don\u2019t let mix be the deciding factor. Mix is mix. It's our job to try to offset that or use that to our advantage the best way possible. Dennis Muilenburg : Yes, and just to reinforce that Sheila, as Greg said, a lot of moving parts here, but the sustained margin growth trends is one that's long-term. So we expect to continue to see year-over-year margin growth in 2019 and further growth in 2020 and beyond. So this is all about long-term sustained top and bottom-line growth. And the gain book that we're operating here will drive that year-over-year. Operator : Next question is from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hunter Keay : Let's think about the NMA for a second. I don\u2019t want to mid pick little bit, but again, as you just mentioned that NMA was going to be a two-step decision process with the final decision coming in '20. Are you saying that you would make the announcement for the public so to speak in '20 after talking your customers in '19? So if you could just clarify that announcement. And then the second part of the NMA question is how are these conversations going with your customers around this plane being used as a replacement aircraft versus opening up new market maybe relative to new designs in the past? Thanks. Greg Smith : Yes, Hunter, let me take on the first one there. The process we are talking about here, the decision process, is identical to what we do so in all of our previous programs. So this year's decision is what we call authority to offer, that\u2019s based on a business case and our ability to go and have detailed discussions with customers that will be something that will be publicly announced once we make our decision around that. So that will be information that you will see and that will initiate deep and meaningful customer conversations. And then depending on market response and our ability to build the right kind of group of launch customers then we get to official launch -- authority to launch decision next year. So both of those steps are typically public steps, and ones that you would see. Again, I want to reemphasize the discipline that we are putting into this figure not only decisions related to the airplane in that market, they are also decisions related to the enterprise transformation objectives that we have in terms of production system for the future. So we are looking at this as a total enterprise effort and really being very disciplined in our business case analysis. And then your second question Hunter? Hunter Keay : Yes, it was sort of just how the conversation is going through your customers preliminarily at least around this plane being used as sort of an enabler of opening up new point-to-point markets versus replacement relative to say really I was thinking about 787 specifically, but just broader in general. Thanks. Greg Smith : Yes, we have talked extensively with customers here, more than 60 customers and very consistent feedback. And we do see several different market segments and potential applications for this airplane. We do see a market need here that's in between today's narrow-body and wide-body families. It\u2019s a market area that really cannot be addressed by modifying those existing platforms and aircraft. Some of that is medium haul -- medium-range segments that today are being served by -- I'll say inefficient use of wide-body. And we see that as an opportunity for airline customers to gain efficiency. But a good portion of this is also creation of new medium-range route structures. And just as we saw with introduction to 787 where we saw roughly already 200 new city pairs emerged because of the capability of the airplane in the medium-range marketplace, are again 4,000 to 5,000 mile kind of range. We see an opportunity for significant regional city pair growth from this airplane. And that's another area where we are gaining customer feedback. So there are multiple segments of applicability, significant customer interest. The key here is for us to build a business case that\u2019s going to create value for our customers as well as value for our company and our shareholders. And that's the work we still need to finish. Operator : Next we go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Ron Epstein : Just a question, and maybe a follow-up. How do we think about the 900 airplanes like where do you have to transition 73 and 78 to get to 900. That\u2019s a lot of airplanes. Total make 75 a month right on average? Dennis Muilenburg : Yes, Ron, you've made the right calculation here. So as I mentioned, we\u2019re well into the 14 a month rate step on 787, and we expect to complete that transition in the second quarter. So that's a moving forward very briskly and on track. On the 737, we've already moved parts of the supply chain to 57 a month. But we still have some work to do on some elements of the supply chain in particular with engines and CFM. And we\u2019re not going to make that full transition of 57 a month. And so we\u2019re very confident that were ready. And it's important that we do that in a very disciplined way. So you can back into the number mathematically with about 900 deliveries for the year note that 900 roughly deliveries for the year also includes the military derivative. So P8 tankers are all included in that number, just for clarity. Ron Epstein : And the maybe one follow-on on the NMA question. In the business case you may think about NMA, how do you think about it and the potential relationship it could have with the future family of narrow-bodies? Dennis Muilenburg : It's one of the parameters that we think through anytime we're thinking about investments for the future make us we realize earlier. We fundamentally have changed our R&D investment strategy for the companies that it's feathered over the long term where we can sequence development programs so that we gain the benefits of continuous development and lessons learned program-to-program rather than stacking multiple development programs on top of each other. And that\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking through NMA as well. So not only the development programs or that particular airplane in the market it will serve, but also how do we sequence it, how do we leverage learning\u2019s from 777X, how do we leverage what we're learning from things like T-X and roll that into NMA, and then how could we use an NMA investment to think about leverage and creating the production system for even more distinct future whether that be some future narrow-body airplane or other alternatives that we might invest in. But think of this is a continuum of R&D effort. This again is all key to creating a sustained growth business where top and bottom line of both long-term sustained growth levels. That is our approach here. And so we\u2019re thinking about NMA in that multi-program context. Ron Epstein : Got you. Can I ask one more at the tail end here? Maurita Sutedja : I think, we're \u2026 Ron Epstein : Can I ask just sort of quick one? Just for Greg. Greg, when we think about the 727 engine versus the MAX, just for modeling purposes it's going to review 90% MAXs this year. How do we think about the margin profile of one variant versus the other? Greg Smith : Well, it's still kind of early introduction, right. So you take that into account, but net-net, you\u2019re in a similar margin profile as you're on NG. It's really just more around on timing from a unit perspective. It's how they are feathered in. So I wouldn't think of it any different. It's really just again more timing. Maurita Sutedja : Okay. So operator, we have time for just one more analyst question. Operator : That will be from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead. Peter Arment : Hey, Dennis, just maybe an easier one on book to bill expectations in 2019, I guess, specifically around 737 MAX orders, you mentioned you had 13 new customers in 2018 and you had, really I think 5,000 aircraft since the launch. So that\u2019s close to 68%, I think, of the covers of NGs. Just how you are thinking about the order momentum with that program? Thanks. Dennis Muilenburg : Peter, we continue to see strong order momentum there I think just another sign of it this week earlier you saw ANA's announcement about their intent to buy the MAX. And that\u2019s another addition to fleet there. So we see continued momentum on the MAX sales front. That airplane is creating value in the market for our customers. And we are oversold against our production profile. We talked earlier about ramping up to 57 a month. We are oversold against that profile. We're filling skyline slots way out in 2023. We continue to see upward market pressure overall on the production rate as result. And we think the demand for that airplane continues to be sustained. So while we have great orders volume and momentum this year. And I mentioned we might see some moderation in that demand this coming year. We still expect book to bill to be in that one-to-one range and there is always timing variability. But in terms of the MAX, the demand signals in the marketplace continue to be very strong. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that completes the analyst question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now return you to The Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Ms. Anne Toulouse, Interim Vice President of Communication.  Ms. Toulouse. Please go ahead. Anne Toulouse : Thank you. We will continue the call with media questions for Dennis and Greg. And if you have additional queries following this session, please call our Media Relations team at (312) 544-2002. Operator, we are ready for that first question. And in interest of time, we ask that you limit everyone to one question please. Operator : And first to the line of Andrew Tangel with Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead. Andrew Tangel : Some other manufacturers have reported seen economic weakness in China, the major headwinds. What are you all seeing? And are the orders from China setting lines picking up and overall. Where do you expect to see that moderating order intake coming from around the world? And where is either demand slowing a bit or gross slowing a bit from what you all see? Greg Smith : Yes, Andrew, let me touch on the China question first. We continue to see strong demand in China overall in terms of market dynamics. As I said earlier, over the years, we see a world that needs about 43,000 new Commercial Airplanes. We remain very confident in that outlook and about 7,700 of those 43,000 are in China. And that remains solid traffic patterns in China continue to progress. We're seeing passenger growth there that exceeds the overall market growth around the world and we also see passenger traffic growth there continuing to exceed GDP growth. So those market fundamentals remain strongly in place. In terms of our orders volume in China that's typically pace by timing of their five-year planning. So it tends to come in waves. So that\u2019s why we, again, as we look to the future we expect to see some timing adjustments on orders, but overall volume over the long-term remains very strong. And that really applies to my broader comment to about moderation of orders in 2019. As we look to the long-term the market fundamentals are very strong. And we see long-term volume of orders continuing to grow and adding backlog. It just gets into a question of local timing quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year as our customers meet their fleet needs. So nothing here that I would say is a macro trend or substantial change. We just see fundamental aerospace growth and air traffic growth as a long-term sustainable trend. And with the backlog of about 5,900 aircraft to roughly seven years of production, that gives us the ability to whether any local variations and maintain a long-term view in terms of sustain growth. Operator : Our next question is from Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg. Please go ahead. Julie Johnsson : If I just wanted to make sure that I understood what your -- that point you're making on China, Dennis, do you potentially see a low in orders this year because the next five year plan is looming in the headlights. And then totally unrelated question and apologies for that, but where does CFM stand on its catch-up plan for the LEAP? How unusual is it for Boeing to embed your people in their supply chain? Dennis Muilenburg : Julie, on your first question regarding China that was exactly my point earlier, given the five-year planning cycle there, we are having ongoing discussions with our customers in China, the Chinese government, the U.S. government. This also factors into the trade dialogue between the U.S. and China. But these are all factors that we\u2019re very much engaged in. Again, we expect China as a long-term growth market for us. But exactly how those efforts play out over the next quarter or two is still an open question as we proceed with trade discussions. I can tell you having been intimately involved in the discussions and engagement with the governments both U.S. and China, we see our progress on that front and we see convergence. And we also see that there is clearly a mutual benefit of having a healthy aerospace industry for both the U.S. and China. China needs the airplanes for growth to fuel their economy and to meet their passenger growth and cargo growth needs. And here in the U.S. our aerospace business is a tremendous U.S. jobs generator, manufacturing jobs. We hired 34,000 people last year. And we, as an aerospace industry here in the U.S., create about $80 billion a year trade surplus for the country. So there is mutual interest, and I hope the aerospace business. We expect that to lead the reproductive pre-discussions between the U.S. and China or at least be part of that. And then that will factor into the ultimate orders volume and timing with China. That's just a little additional context there. Regarding your CFM question, it's not unusual for us to have Boeing personnel at our suppliers sites and down into their supply chain. That's a very typical process that we would have. But I will say again as it goes 737, one of the supply chain health issues that we're spending a lot of time on right now is engines and our work with CFL. And so we\u2019re deploying additional resources with them into their factories and supply chain. Now we do expect to recover. We\u2019re seeing signs of recovery. But we still have work to go. And being deeply engaged in our supply chain as part of how we do business. Operator : Our next question is from Sylvia Pfeifer with Financial Times. Please go ahead. Sylvia Pfeifer : I had the China question which was one of my main ones. Can I just ask you about Brexit then? I know you\u2019re in a very different position to Airbus here in the UK. But I just wondered whether you see any risk to your operations in the UK in the event of hard Brexit just a few weeks ago before the 29th of March. Dennis Muilenburg : Silvia, we're continuing to seek a very close eye on that as you might guess. And again, we\u2019re very involved in the discussion. That's -- we\u2019re committed to our operations in the UK. We've ramped up significantly over the last many years roughly doubling the size of our operations, roughly tripling the size of our supply chain in the UK and those are long-term sustained investments. And we don't expect that to change based on the outcome of Brexit. That's said we are keeping a very close eye on it and making sure it doesn't impact our operations. I think just as further sign of our commitment in the UK. You will note that during the last year, we opened our new operation in Sheffield where we\u2019re doing some advanced manufacturing work. It's also helping us to build out our actuation vertical capably, so just another example of our long-term commitment to the UK and the investments that we will continue to make. Maurita Sutedja : Okay. Operator, we have time for one last question from the media. Operator : And that will be from Dominic Gates with the Seattle Times. Please go ahead. Dominic Gates : As I\u2019m going back to the 737 MAX situation and CFM, in December with the delivery of 69 airplanes, it did seem like you have almost fully recovered. Has there been some further setback? And is the need to send people to CFM, is that because there's a problem with the ramp-up of the engine production? Or is there some configuration change that\u2019s become necessary? Can you just tell us a bit more? Also what's the timeline you expect to be back to normal, let's say? Greg Smith : Yes, Dominic, first of all, as you saw in our December deliveries, as you alluded to, we did see some recovery across our supply chain, including engine supply and that enabled us to drive those December deliveries of 69 aircraft. But we were not yet fully recovered at that point, so we've continued to work supply chain recovery and there still work to go there. There is nothing here that I would say is an issue associated with having to change configuration or make that kind of alteration to the engine. This is really about just ramping up production and doing it efficiently and being able to get a liner profile engine deliveries that matches up with our factory production rate for the airplane and synchronizing those production systems. That's really what we're focused on. We still have work to go to get CFM to be supporting our 52 a month production rate and having those systems synchronized and then even more work to go yet to get them ramped up to 57 a month. And that's really what we're focused on. This is about production system ramp-up and synchronization. And by us getting deeper into the factories, it's going to give us better insight on long lead items. And, frankly though, I think help us do best practice sharing between Boeing and CFM, which is part of how we operate, right. That will make us better and it will make CFM better. And that work that we plan to be very focused on in the first quarter and timing of that is reflected in our overall delivery guidance for the year. So you can see that factored in. But we're going to be very, very disciplined about insuring supply chain health before we fully move to the 57 a month production rate. Anne Toulouse : Okay. That concludes our earnings call. Again, for members of the media, if you have further questions, please call our team at (312) 544-2002. Thank you.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Boeing Company's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst and media question-and-answer sessions, are being broadcast live over the Internet.  At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I am turning the call over to Ms. Maurita Sutedja, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Boeing Company. Ms. Sutedja, please go ahead. Maurita Sutedja : Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's First Quarter 2019 Earnings call. I'm Maurita Sutedja, and with me today is Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Enterprise Performance and Strategy.  After management comments, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions]. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. And as a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation to our website at boeing.com. Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals we include in our discussions this morning are likely to involve risks, which is detailed in our news release and our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this web representation.  In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.  Now I will turn the call over to Dennis Muilenburg. Dennis Muilenburg : Thank you, Maurita, and good morning. Let me start by saying that all of us at Boeing have been deeply affected by the accidents in Indonesia and Ethiopia beyond anything I can recall in my 34 years with this great company. We all feel the loss and the gravity of these events personally, and we continue to extend our deepest sympathies to the families and loved ones of the passengers and crews on-board the flights. Nothing is more important to us than the safety of the flight crews and passengers who fly on our airplanes. We know every person who steps aboard one of our airplanes places their trust in us, and we are committed to earning and re-earning that trust and confidence.  Recent events have been a deep reminder of the importance of our enduring values at Boeing : safety, quality, and integrity, even more so in the difficult times we face now. Our work demands the utmost excellence. These recent accidents have intensified our commitment to continuous improvement as we design, build, and support the safest airplanes in the sky. That's our responsibility to our customers and their passengers. We own it.  I know from personal experience that when there's something that we can do to make any of our products better and safer, we will do it. If there's something that we can do to help our customers improve the training and education of their pilots or mechanics, we will bring that forward. If there's something that we can do to make airplane development programs or the certification process better and safer, we will pursue it. Our culture is to go above and beyond, to deliver safe airplanes and live by a commitment to continuous improvement.  Ever since the Lion Air accident, our top technical experts, engineers, and test pilots have been working with regulators from all over the world on a software update that will make the 737 MAX one of the safest airplanes ever to fly. Our test pilots now completed over 135 flights, totaling more than 230 hours of airtime with the software update. We are taking a disciplined approach, completed our technical flight-testing last week, and look forward to completing near-term milestones leading to final certification. As part of our continued collaboration with hundreds of stakeholders, nearly 90% of our 50-plus MAX operators around the world have participated in simulator sessions that include the software update. We're committed to ensuring all who operate the MAX are fully prepared when the grounding is lifted and the fleet returns to service. This includes a comprehensive package of training and educational resources that we're developing and deploying.  In light of our commitment to continually improve safety, as we have always done, I've asked the Boeing Board of Directors to establish a committee to review our company-wide policies and processes for the design and development of the airplanes we build and to assure the highest level of safety on the 737 MAX program as well as our other airplane programs and to recommend improvements to our policies and procedures.  As we continue to work through these steps, and as previously announced, we adjusted the 737 production system temporarily from 52 aircraft per month to 42 per month to accommodate the pause in MAX deliveries, allowing us to prioritize additional resources to focus on safely returning the MAX to service. This decision will also enable us to invest in the broader health and quality of our production system and supply chain. We will continue to assess our production plans, and we'll make decisions at various waypoints as to whether further rate adjustments are needed based on information we have at that time.  The timing of return to service for the MAX will continue to be paced by ongoing work with global regulators and our customers. Our previously issued 2019 financial guidance does not reflect the MAX impacts. Due to the uncertainty of the timing and conditions surrounding the return to service of the 737 MAX fleet, new guidance will be issued at a future date. I want to personally thank the various government agencies, our industry partners, and my Boeing teammates for their tireless efforts over the past few weeks and months. This includes the more than 600 737 suppliers, many of whom are small to midsized businesses, who have stepped up to work with us as we navigate the 737 production plan changes. We could not build our airplanes without them.  On behalf of the entire Boeing team, I also want to thank our customers and their passengers for enduring the disruption caused by this issue. We deeply regret the impact this has created. Our company's 100-year-plus legacy is built on the foundation of developing, producing, and supporting safe products. We are committed to ensuring the 737 MAX achieves the highest standards for safety, performance and reliability.  Now let me turn to an overview of our first quarter operating performance, followed by an update on the business environment and our expectations going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and how we are maintaining financial discipline and prudently managing liquidity as we work through the safe return-to-service of the MAX.  With that, let's move to Slide 2. Thanks to the dedicated efforts of our teams across the company during the quarter, we recorded revenue of $22.9 billion and core earnings per share of $3.16, reflecting lower volume of 737 deliveries, partially offset by higher defense and services volume. We generated $2.8 billion of operating cash and paid $1.2 billion in dividends, reflecting a 20% increase in dividends per share from last year.  Now let's look at the first quarter operating performance for our businesses. For the quarter, Commercial Airplanes generated revenue of $11.8 billion reflecting 149 deliveries. Fewer 737s were delivered in the quarter due to the grounding of the 737 MAX. We saw healthy widebody orders in the quarter, and our backlog remains robust at more than 5,600 airplanes worth $399 billion. Key commercial milestones in the quarter included the 787 program's smooth transition to rate 14 per month while maintaining the highest quality standards, and the first 777X flight test airplane rolled out after passing the factory gauntlet test. 777X flight testing will begin this year with first delivery and entry into service as scheduled for 2020.  Now over to Defense, Space & Security. BDS reported first quarter revenue of $6.6 billion and booked $12 billion of new orders, demonstrating the value we bring to our customers across our Defense, Space & Security portfolio. These orders included a multiyear contract for 78 F-18 Super Hornets; contract for five Extra Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicles for the U.S. Navy; 5 E-7 AEW&C aircraft for the U.K. Royal Air Force; and 19 P-8 Poseidon aircraft for the U.S. Navy, Royal Norwegian Navy, and the U.K. Royal Navy. Key milestones for BDS included completion of the first Ground-Based Midcourse Defense test with two interceptors, demonstrating the robustness of the system, successful environmental testing of the Commercial Crew spacecraft and the first flight of the SB>1 DEFIANT helicopter. We delivered the first 7 KC-46 Tankers to the U.S. Air Force in the quarter, with the eighth delivered just this past Friday. We are committed to continuous improvement in delivering the highest quality products to our customers. We look forward to working with the Air Force and the Navy during their initial operational test and evaluation of the KC-46 as we further demonstrate the operational capabilities of this next-generation aircraft across refueling, mobility, and combat weapon systems missions. Turning to Global Services. BGS reported revenue of $4.6 billion, representing 17% growth year-on-year. Since its operations began in July of 2017, BGS' growth has consistently outpaced the average for the services market. BGS continues to win new business, highlighting the value we bring to our broad range of commercial and government customers and the strength of our One Boeing offerings. During the quarter, BGS won new business totaling approximately $4 billion, which included contracts for V-22 Performance-Based Logistics for the U.S. Navy and P-8A training for the U.K. Royal Air Force, an order for GECAS for 10 737-800 converted freighters and an agreement to optimize crew operations for Royal Air Maroc. Additionally, BGS expanded its global distribution of hardware and chemical products through a long-term agreement with Dubai-based Joramco.  Also in the quarter, to expand its rapidly growing unparalleled digital services portfolio, BGS completed the acquisition of ForeFlight, a leading provider of innovative mobile- and web-based aviation applications. We also achieved a major milestone in our proposed strategic partnership with Embraer. On February 26, Embraer received its shareholder approval to proceed with the deal with over 97% support. Over the coming months, we'll continue to work with Embraer, global regulators and other stakeholders to complete the transaction and create the most important strategic partnership in the aerospace industry.  In summary, our current first order of business is to -- is the safe return to service of the 737 MAX, and we've made the adjustments necessary to allow our teams to prioritize additional resources and focus on this effort. At the same time, we are maintaining our focus on keeping the business strong and healthy. As they demonstrated in the first quarter, our team continues to execute on operating performance and capture noteworthy additions to our large and diverse backlog. With that, let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3. We continue to see healthy global demand for our offerings in commercial; defense, space; and services. These are sizable sectors that are growing and backed by strong fundamentals, with a combined market opportunity of $8.1 trillion over the next 10 years. As a global company with more than 100 years of history and customers in 150 countries, we value and maintain strong relationships with our customers, suppliers and other stakeholders around the world, reinforcing the mutual economic benefits of a strong and prosperous aerospace industry. Recent events underscore the value and importance of those relationships. In commercial aviation, global passenger traffic continues to grow faster than GDP and long-term trends. In 2018, we saw the ninth straight year of above trend growth passenger traffic. So far in 2019, passenger traffic has grown at 5.9% through February.  On the air cargo market, we saw a contraction in the year-to-date traffic. While we expect the cargo traffic headwinds to linger in the near term, we anticipate recovery in the latter part of the year. Our view of the demand fundamentals remains unchanged. We remain highly confident in our industry outlook, which forecasts the demand for nearly 43,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years, which will help double the size of the global fleet. We believe the changing nature of travel has fundamentally expanded traffic patterns and supports sustained growth. At the same time, airlines are maintaining capacity discipline and keeping supply and demand in balance as industry profitability remains near historic highs.  I will also note as an aside that there's a demand for nearly 800,000 qualified pilots over the next 20 years and around 750,000 maintenance technicians. And we, at Boeing, are committed to doing more to ensure that, that demand is met. You'll hear more from us on this as we work with global partners to develop the way forward.  It is clear that long-term demand fundamentals provide a solid foundation for our commercial business. There also is more balance between airplanes purchased for fleet growth and replacement, leading to more stable purchasing patterns. We believe the evolution in these key market dynamics in aggregate continues to drive less cyclicality for our industry. The narrowbody segment will command the largest share of new deliveries. We expect airlines to need more than 31,000 single-aisle airplanes in the next 20 years. These new airplanes will continue to stimulate growth and provide required replacements for older, less efficient airplanes. Our 737 program has a backlog of more than 4,400 aircraft and a production skyline that is sold out into early next decade.  In the widebody segment, we have seen steady orders for the 787 and the 777, and we have high confidence in a meaningful increase in widebody replacement demand early next decade. The current generation 777 continues its steady sales momentum with two new orders from DHL. These additional orders brought the backlog to 92 aircraft and provide further support for the 777 bridge.  Turning to 777X. We added a new customer in the quarter with 18 new orders, plus 24 options from IAG Group, the parent or British Airways. We are honored that British Airways has selected the 777X as part of its fleet for its next century. These orders bring total 777X orders and commitments to 364, a strong foundation that supports our plan for ramping up production and delivery of this new aircraft. We continue to focus on further bolstering the 777X skyline. We continue to expect the delivery rate to be approximately 3.5 aircraft per month in 2019 as we transition to the 777X with a slight increase in 2020 as we continue to assess 777 demand as well as 777X timing.  The 787 Dreamliner extended its status as the fastest-selling, twin-aisle jet in history with 38 net orders in the quarter, adding to more than 1,400 since the program launched. With approximately 600 aircraft in our 787 backlog, our current production rate of 14 airplanes per month is well supported. In the quarter, we captured 38 new orders for 787, including 20 from Lufthansa and 10 from Bamboo Airways. Also earlier this month, we delivered the first 787-10 to All Nippon Airways. With this milestone delivery, ANA becomes the first airline in Asia to operate the entire Dreamliner family. The market-leading fuel efficiency of the 787 has enabled ANA and more than 50 other airlines to open more than 230 new nonstop routes around the world.  On our 767 program, we added four new 767 freighter orders in the quarter. And as previously announced, we plan to increase the 767 production rate from 2.5 per month to three per month in 2020.  At Defense, Space & Security, we continue to see solid demand for our major platforms and programs. The BDS portfolio is well positioned with mature, world-class platforms to address current needs and innovative, capable and affordable new franchise programs to build the future. We continue to see broad support for our products from the Pentagon, NASA and Congress. The President's fiscal year 2020 budget proposal includes the purchase of Boeing F-15 and F-18 fighter jets, Apache and V-22 Osprey rotorcraft, JDAM weapons, satellite programs and key commercial derivative programs like the KC-46 Tanker and the P-8, among other platforms. Our fighter line is in one of the healthiest positions since the start of the decade. We continue see support for the F-18 through the recent multiyear award, which will take deliveries through 2023. We expect to continue delivering Super Hornets off our production and service like modification lines to the U.S. Navy into the 2030s, where they will be at the forefront of naval aviation for decades to come.  At the same time, the President's budget leverages billions of dollars on technology upgrades made by Allied Nations to pursue and purchase the next-generation Eagle, the F-15X, allowing U.S. Air Force to replace its fleet of F-15Cs with a more capable, survivable and affordable air superiority fighter.  We are also maintaining a clear focus on future franchises, including the ongoing MQ-25 and T-X development programs with flight test scheduled for this year, our NASA Commercial Crew and Space Launch System programs at the leading edge of space exploration and the GBSD competition. Demand from outside the U.S. for our defense and space offerings also remains high, in particular for rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters and satellites.  Turning to the Services sector. We see the $2.8 trillion services market over the next 10 years as a significant growth opportunity for our company. BGS provides agile, cost-competitive services to our customers worldwide. We aim to continue growing faster than the average services market growth rate of 3.5% as we further expand our broad portfolio of services' offerings and continue to gain market share. Strong orders of $4 billion in the quarter reflect our customers' recognition of our value proposition in helping them optimize the performance of their fleets and reduce operational costs through the life cycle. Our expertise, the global reach of our business and our strong customer partnerships have us well positioned to compete and win in this sector. In summary, the growing markets and opportunities ahead, our team remains committed to growth, innovation and accelerating productivity improvements to fuel our investments in the future. Our One Boeing strategy and offerings across our three businesses are key differentiators that strengthen our position as the world's leading aerospace company. As we work to safely return the 737 MAX to service, our team is determined to keep improving on safety in partnership with the global aerospace industry and the broader community to ensure air travel remains the safest form of transportation the world has ever known.  With that, Greg, over to you for our financial results. Gregory Smith : Thanks, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Before we discuss the first quarter results, let me also touch on the 737 MAX and explain how the grounding has impacted our financials to date and what we're focused on today and going forward. Let's move to Slide 4, please.  As a result of the 737 MAX grounding, we delivered over 50 fewer 737 aircraft in the quarter than originally planned. This resulted in lower BCA revenue, operating earnings and cash. In addition, BCA earnings were also reduced by period costs associated with the MCAS software update and development of related training materials. We also booked approximately $1 billion of additional costs due to the adjustment to the production rate to 42 a month. The additional costs are due to the lower production rate causing fixed costs for the 3,100 aircraft in the block to be amortized over a longer period of time. Costs also included additional labor, escalation and support. This, therefore, reduced the 737 program and overall BCA margins. As you know, when the program margin is adjusted, it will affect current quarter and booking margin for subsequent periods. With regards to cash, lower delivery payments due to fewer 737 deliveries, combined with building and storing 737 aircraft, adversely impacted operating cash in the quarter. Now looking forward, the key drivers of financial impact related to the 737 are return to service time line and conditions; the delivery ramp-up, which will depend then on how fast we can deliver the aircraft once the fleet returns to service and how fast our customers can accept the aircraft; and finally, the 737 production rate profile going forward. These factors will impact the future delivery rate profile and, therefore, impact revenue and earnings. It will also influence the cash receipt profile, including both delivery and prepayments -- predelivery payments. This, in conjunction with corresponding supply chain arrangements, will determine our cash expenditure profile and associated working capital going forward. We expect our financial results to continue to be adversely impacted until we safely return the 737 MAX to service, ramp up production rates and resume deliveries to customers. We will continue to assess our production plans going forward and have established waypoint milestones along our plan. This will allow us to make decisions based on information we have at that point on whether to further adjust production rates as required.  From Day 1 of the grounding, we've been doing detailed scenario planning around return to service and production rates, including analyzing the implications on our supply chain, customer fleet and deliveries to fully understand the range of financial outcomes. At the same time, we've been proactively and prudently managing our operations and liquidity position and working on actions to minimize the impact on our customers and our financials. As Dennis noted, we're taking steps amid current challenges to preserve the future value and growth of this important franchise for our company and for our customers. Some of these proactive steps include the production rate adjustment to 42 a month, and we've initiated comprehensive daily oversight into factory health such as reduction in jobs behind schedule and also suppliers' progress to getting back to master schedule, customer delivery profile and path to seamless return to service. We've also taken actions to prudently manage liquidity and increase our balance sheet flexibility. These include an even sharper focus on productivity and strategic prioritization of spending. We're diligently reviewing all levers available to minimize the financial impact. Our multiyear-focused efforts on disciplined cash management, productivity efforts and growing healthy margin businesses help position us on better footing to navigate the current challenges.  As Dennis mentioned, given the dynamic of 737 MAX return-to-service time line in activities, we are not in a position today to provide a forecast of the impacts of the 737 MAX grounding on our full year 2019 financials. We will provide you with an update of full year 2019 financial forecast when we have clarity on return to service of the MAX fleet, our production plans, delivery ramp-up profile and corresponding financial impacts. Returning the MAX safely to flight has been priority one and a team effort that leverages the best talent from across Boeing. Since Day 1, we've established a cross-functional team following a disciplined process to organize and manage a broad range of activities involved. We've assigned a leader of our enterprise program management function to manage this critical effort with senior leaders, established a situation room to facilitate the discussions and track upcoming activities and deliverables. The team meets daily with our executive council fully engaged. We have dedicated senior management leads for key elements, such as investigation and return-to-service activities, regulatory process, customer support and training, customer engagement, 737 production supply chain, government relations, finance, communications and branding. We've also brought in outside technical and strategic experts to assist in areas such as engineering reviews and strategic communications as we work to restore the confidence across all our stakeholders. We will continue to apply whatever resources are required to return the 737 MAX safely into the fleet and take the time necessary to do so, working hand-in-hand with our customers. At the same time, we will also remain focused on our priorities in delivering results with excellence.  So with that, let me move to Slide 5, and I'll discuss our first quarter results. Revenue for the quarter was $22.9 billion, reflecting lower Commercial Airplane deliveries partially offset by higher Defense and Services volume. Core earnings per share of $3.16 reflects these, along with a lower tax rate and a customer financing impairment.  Now let's discuss Commercial Airplanes on Slide 6. Our Commercial Airplane business revenue decreased to $11.8 billion during the quarter, reflecting the more than 50 fewer 737 deliveries I mentioned earlier. That was partially offset by favorable mix in the quarter. BCA operating margins decreased to 9.9% driven by lower 737 deliveries, partially offset by higher 787 margins. The margins include the 737 MAX impacts I outlined earlier. In the quarter, BCA captured 91 net new orders but also removed 210 aircraft in backlog related to Jet Airways due to liquidity issues experienced by the airline. The net impact was a $3 billion net order increase. BCA's backlog continues to remain strong at $399 billion and more than 5,600 aircraft equating to more than six years of production.  Let's now turn to Defense, Space & Security results on Slide 7. First quarter revenue increased to $6.6 billion, reflecting higher volume across satellites, weapons and surveillance aircraft, which is partially offset by lower C-17 volume. Our continued focus on productivity and execution result in margins growing to 12.8%. The margins include solid program performance, a gain on sale of the property partially offset by unfavorable mix. The sale of this excess property is the result of the team's continued market-based affordability efforts to optimize our footprint. During the quarter, BDS won key contracts worth $12 billion, and our backlog stands $67 billion with 31% from outside the United States.  Let's turn now to Boeing Global Services results on Slide 8. In the first quarter, Global Services revenue increased to $4.6 billion, reflecting higher volume across the portfolio and the acquisition of KLX completed in the fourth quarter of last year. Year-over-year growth of 17% for the quarter outpaces the average annual service market growth rate of 3.5%. BGS operating margins of 14.1% reflect ongoing productivity efforts offset by mix of products and services in the quarter and the unfavorable adjustment on the defense training contract. During the quarter, BGS won key contract awards worth approximately $4 billion, and our backlog now stands at $21 billion.  Let's turn now to cash flow on Slide 9. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $2.8 billion driven by lower 737 deliveries, offset by solid underlying performance and favorable timing of receipts and expenditures. As mentioned earlier, we expect continued working capital pressure to adversely affect cash flow until MAX deliveries resume. Strong operating cash flow from other parts of the business, a strong balance sheet and further balance sheet levers will help provide appropriate liquidity during this period. In the first quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends, and we repurchased $2.3 billion of Boeing stock in the quarter. And until we have clarity on the 737 MAX return-to-service, we have temporarily paused our share repurchase program. However, our long-term balance cash deployment strategy and commitment remains unchanged. Let's now move to cash and debt balances on Slide 10. We ended the quarter with $7.7 billion of cash and marketable securities, slightly increased debt levels and stable credit ratings. Our credit rating of A and A2 were recently affirmed. Our strategy of maintaining a strong balance sheet provides us with substantial borrowing capacity through capital markets access and unused credit facility of $5.1 billion.  We have ample access to long-term debt in the bond markets and short-term debt in the commercial paper markets. Our long-term goals and strategic objectives remain unchanged. We will continue to use our three business units strategy as a key differentiator in the marketplace, make prudent investments and leverage talent innovation from across the company.  So in summary, while focusing on the very important priority of safe 737 MAX return-to-service and minimizing the significant impact on our customers and the flying public, our team continues to keep the core operating engine strong, delivering results and meeting customer commitments. We recognize that we have a lot of work and not insignificant challenges in front of us in the weeks and months to come, but we're confident we have the right focus, team and resources to navigate through them. We are committed to providing you with additional updates on the MAX return-to-service progress and production plans as we have more information. We will strive to continue to keep all of our stakeholders informed through our public statements and information posted on our website. Once we have further clarity, we will schedule a follow-up investor and media conference call to discuss the financial impacts and revised 2019 guidance.  So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for some closing comments. Dennis Muilenburg : All right. Thank you, Greg. When I started at this company more than three decades ago, our amazing people inspired me. I see how they dedicate their lives in extraordinary talents to connect, protect, explore and inspire the world safely. And that purpose and mission has only grown stronger over the years. Our team is determined to keep improving on safety in partnership with the global aerospace industry and broader community. It is the shared sense of responsibility for the safety of flight that spans and binds all of us together. Our leadership role is clear. Our commitment is resolute, and our pursuit of excellence is never ending. We own it. In these challenging times, I'm even more confident in our team and our customers. We'll stay true to our values, and we will come through this even stronger. While we continue to be focused on the very important priority of engaging with our global regulators and customers on the safe return to service of the 737 MAX, I'd also like to thank the Boeing team for remaining focused on further driving both growth and productivity. We wouldn't have been able to achieve these first quarter results without the hard work and dedication of our employees and the great partnerships we have with our customers and suppliers. The long-term fundamentals for our business remains strong, and our key priorities are unchanged. We will continue to execute on our long-term strategy of robust organic growth investment and returning value to shareholders, complemented by strategic acquisitions that enhance and accelerate our growth plans. We will leverage our unique One Boeing advantages, continue building strength on strength to deliver and improve on our commitments to our customers and partners around the world. With that, we will take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And first in line, we have Myles Walton with UBS. Myles Walton : Dennis or Greg, how is the 737 return-to-service effort disrupting or influencing both the 777X certification effort ongoing and then your decision on the NMA? Given that this is all hands on deck for the MAX, I imagine there's some cannibalization of resources on the 777X. And then on the NMA, how is your view on that changing given the less clear picture maybe of where the certification is or will be in the future? Dennis Muilenburg : Yes. Myles, good question. First of all, again, I want to stress and reiterate the point that we are very, very focused on the safe return to service of the MAX, and that remains our top priority. Clear focus, clear resources being applied, and daily engagement, hourly engagement by me, Greg, and the leadership team. And we're going to continue to focus there and get that airplane back up and flying for our customers.  As part of that process, we are taking a look at our certification processes. We remain confident in the fundamental processes. But as part of our continuous improvement mindset, we always take a look at opportunities to improve. So we're welcoming the government joint authorities' technical review that's been announced, and we'll be supporting that as appropriate. As you've heard earlier, I've also asked Boeing Board to stand up a committee to take a look at our certification processes and identify any potential improvements. And if we find any opportunities to improve, we will certainly adopt those on a go-forward basis. As far as the ripple impact or potential impact of the 777X, we haven't seen any direct impact. Again, our team has been very strong about continuing to drive 777X development and performance in parallel with our return-to-flight -- or return-to-service efforts on the MAX. We've deployed our teams accordingly and make sure that we've resourced high-priority efforts on 777X. As noted earlier, we have rolled two flight test birds out of the factory, number three and number four are in the final assembly, and we look forward to getting into flight testing here this year and delivering that airplane on schedule in 2020. We do not see any changes to the underlying certification process. But again, as I said, if we find areas to improve, we will certainly adopt those.  As to your NMA question, we're continuing our work on that in parallel. Certainly, the higher priority -- highest priority for us is the 737 MAX\u2019s safe return to service. So, we have prioritized our resources accordingly while we continue to work on our NMA effort in parallel. We're still looking at that as a potential opportunity for a 2025 entry into service date. We still have work to do before we get to an authority to offer a decision. We're still working on a pace to try to do that this year, as we previously announced, but I want to be very clear that when it comes to resource questions and application of resources, our top priority is the safe return to service of the 737 MAX. Operator : Our next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Douglas Harned : As you've talked about, you have a technical fix that you're testing now for the 737 MAX, and it sounds as though you have some pretty good confidence in that. If we assume that the technical solution, that, that is what is needed, that works, then I sort of look at this as three important processes here. One, you've got to work with the authorities, the airlines, the flying public to give them the confidence that the solution works. Second, you've got an operational process where you've already taken rate down but you want to be able to take that rate up very quickly as soon as the airplane can return to service safely. And then third, you have a commercial process where customers are awaiting delivery, they've been making progress payments.  And so what I'm interested in understanding is as you think of that first task, that first process, which the time line on it seems somewhat uncertain, how does that drive the way you look at different rates scenarios going forward operationally and the way your work with your customers who put money in and they've -- they're expecting to get delivery of this airplane? Dennis Muilenburg : Yes, Doug, our plan integrates across all of those dimensions as it should, because they're all interrelated. I will say on that first path, returning the airplane to service and doing so safely, just to give you a sense of the key steps to go there. As we know from the accident, investigations today have been publicly announced through the preliminary reports. Both accidents were a chain of events. We know there was one common link in that chain of events, and that was the activation of the MCAS system with erroneous angle of attack data. That's been well published. And as we said, we understand how to address that link. That's our responsibility. We own that, and that's what that software update does. We have great confidence in that software update with the more than 200 flights that occurred -- or excuse me, 135 flights that have occurred. I personally had the chance to fly on two of those flights, test and demonstration flights, and have seen the confidence in that software solution. We have tested it out and completed our engineering flight test last week. The next step in that process will be the certification flight under the FAA's authority, and we are working with the FAA right now to prepare for that in the near term. Subsequent steps will include again bringing all of the global regulators together with the FAA's leadership to approve the return to service. So that path is a well-understood set of steps, things that are being actively worked on a daily and hourly basis, and we're going to continue to pursue that and make sure we take the time to do it right. That's the most important thing here, is to make sure we have a safe return to flight.  Once we accomplish that, then we'll have the opportunity to look at our production profiles, our delivery sequencing for our customers. As you might guess, we are in daily multiple-times-a-day conversations with our customers as well, and we regret the impact this has had to their operations. We know our customers are eager to get the MAX back into service. And we are eager, when we're ready, to get production ramp back up and provide those airplanes. So we'll be working that in a coordinated, integrated fashion. We have teams that are ready, positioned by tail number with the 737 MAXs that are already out in the fleet to get those airplanes ready and back up and flying for our customers, and we also have an integrated introduction plan including our supply chain that will allow us to pivot and move forward. So these are actions that we are taking daily, again hourly, all in a coordinated fashion. And across those three areas that you mentioned, Doug, I'm very confident that we have an integrated plan. All of this will be paced by the safe return to service of the MAX. That is our first focus. Operator : And our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ronald Epstein : To the extent that you can answer this, how does this happen right? I mean, this sort of seemingly sort of came out of nowhere. I mean, is there any way you can kind of give us a feeling for how did this slip through the engineering organization? How did it slip through the FAA? Can you give us a feel for that? Like I guess, that's the part that befuddles me most about all this because it doesn't seem like there was a lot of new science going on here, right? I mean 787 had been a lot of new science. This seem to be applications of existing technology to an existing platform. Dennis Muilenburg : Yes, Ron, there is no technical slip or gap here, right? Again as I mentioned, we know that both accidents were a series of events, and that is very common to all accidents that we've seen in history. And in -- what we know is that in this case, there was erroneous angle of attack information that came into the airplane from multiple causes. We know that at some point during the flight, that activated the MCAS control loss. And we know that ultimately, there were actions or actions not taken that contributed to the final outcome.  I can't really get into the details of that deep accident investigation because this is all governed by the ICAO Annex 13 process, which I know you know well, and that is a disciplined, rigorous process that examines these accidents from every dimension to ensure that we understand them, and it's ultimately that disciplined process that has made this industry so safe. So we have been very purposeful about supporting that process, very purposeful about supporting the investigation, staying focused on safety and not speculation.  But I can tell you with confidence that we understand our airplane. We understand how the design was accomplished, how the certification was accomplished and remain fully confident in the product that we put in the field. But we also know there are areas where we can improve, and that is the source of the software update here. But there was no surprise or gap or unknown here or something that somehow slipped through a certification process. Quite the opposite. We know exactly how the airplane was designed. We know exactly how it was certified. We have taken the time to understand that. That has led to the software update that we've been implementing and testing, and we're very confident that when the fleet comes back up, the MAX will be one of the safest airplanes ever to fly. Operator : Next, we go to the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Peter Arment : Dennis, just maybe circling back to a few of Doug's question. When you're thinking about the best way you could describe kind of the regulatory discussions, are they running all at the same pace or should investors expect kind of a different path with each regulatory body? And we're thinking about the FAA or EASA or [indiscernible] in Asia? Dennis Muilenburg : Yes, Peter, we are working with the FAA and regulatory authorities around the world. And as you might guess, there are different paces and different processes in each country, but these are all running in parallel. We're working with those authorities to try to align schedules, both from a regulatory government standpoint as well as the customers that are operating in these countries around the world. As we said, we have more than 50 MAX operators today around the world, and they're all very interested in getting the airplane back up and flying. So we are coordinating across that entire network of global regulators and customers. And we're seeing the schedules, I'll say, beginning to align. There is still clearly a lot of work to go as we get through the certification. Another pacing item for us will be training and training deployment worldwide, and then alignment of all the regulatory agencies on approval to get the airplane back up and service and back to flying. So we have a support role across all of that.  I want to complement the FAA, in particular, for their leadership and the work that they're doing across the global enterprise. As you might have seen, the FAA leader, Dan Elwell, hosted an international session with the counterparts from other regulatory agencies a couple of weeks ago. We were supportive to that meeting as well. So the FAA has been working hard to coordinate across all of the international regulators, drive alignment, answer questions and ensure that we're all in the same page going forward. It is fundamentally important here that we have an integrated plan and that we understand any questions or concerns that might be out around the world that we address those. And that, again, we focus on a safe return to service of the MAX, and I'm confident that, that coordination is happening. And I think it's fair to say we still have some work to do, but we're making progress. Operator : Next question is from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : Can you talk about the $1 billion of cost that you added to the 737 block? I'm kind of curious to -- for you, Greg, to maybe elaborate a little more what's included in that. But maybe more importantly, what was not included in that? Gregory Smith : Yes, yes. So the cost to develop and test the software, its period expense was not in there as well as the related training materials associated with that. They're booked in the quarter but not in program margin. As I said, the period expense. Within the $1 billion, really, what's taken into account there is the lower production rate. That's ultimately what's driving it, and now we'll take a little bit longer than what we originally had in the cost base, so you've got fixed cost that will be associated with that lower production rate.  But we also are holding on to headcount. Remember, we were at 52, going down to 42. We've held that headcount in factory, and what we've been doing with that is really working the jobs behind schedule and any jobs that are out of position in getting things back into position in the factory. At the same time, been working with the supply chain. So those that weren't on master schedule at 52, we are -- even though we came down, we have some of those suppliers staying at 52 in order to get healthy, get back on schedule. So when we do come back up and ramp, we're going to do it in a very steady fashion with stability in each step along the way to ensure that we have a predictable, I'll say, production system, a healthier production system and one that we can support our customers as we go up in rate. The other things that are within that fixed cost escalation, obviously, again, facilities, tooling and also support -- additional support for deliveries as well as pulling the airplanes out of storage that we currently have within our facility. So those are, I'd say, the bigger buckets of costs that are within there. But like Dennis said, this is day-to-day management on all aspects. So all with -- what we've been talking about is feeding into our production scenarios. And key in all of this obviously is keep all the stakeholders informed, realizing we don't have answers to some of the questions. But we've got scenarios, and we're trying to be proactive in how we address those so -- and be strategic. So again, going into the supply chain, rather than pulling everybody down to 42, let's go through and understand liquidity within each of those suppliers, where -- who needs help, who doesn't, who is on schedule, who can we use to get this opportunity to get back on schedule.  So again, being very, I'll say, specific, but it's day-to-day management. And we talked about our operating rhythm being daily. Our head of the program reports on -- daily on production health to all of us, and we've got the full enterprise support in this. I know there's a question earlier on 777X. People that are part of this process are from the company. So we're bringing people in that are experts in anywhere area that we need to support, we're bringing them in from across the whole enterprise, and we'll continue to do that until we get the airplane safely back up in the air and get our production rates back to where they were. Operator : Our next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Sheila Kahyaoglu : I guess how do we think about the broader customer reaction to the MAX? There's been a lot of back and forth in the media. And then how do you think about a potential risk to the backlog and maybe production scenarios and risks you're thinking about there? Dennis Muilenburg : Yes, Sheila, to that point, let me take a long-term view here. We don't see any change. As you well know, we are continuously engaged with our customers. We have a ton of respect for them and how they operate. We have deep regret for the impact that this has had on their operations to date, and we're very, very sensitive to that. And we're doing everything we can to get the airplane back up and flying and do that safely. Our customers are eager to do that as well.  I can tell you, I've personally talked to many, many of our customers. Our team, Commercial Airplanes team, Kevin McAllister, Ihssane, their teams are deployed daily, hourly, talking to customers. Our support teams are working around the world, helping them with the fleet that is currently grounded to maintain that fleet in good condition so that when we're ready, we can quickly bring the fleet back up to operating status. So we're deeply engaged with our customers. We understand their operational model. We're having discussions with them on how to best get them ramped back up and to help them during this intermediate period. And I think the collaboration, the communication, it's just been very strong. And I'm thankful to our customers. They've been working with us through this period. It's been difficult. It's been challenging for all of us, but we have a mutual respect based on the health of this industry and the important work that we do around the world. And we want to make sure we can get back up and flying safely, and we know we have some work to do to earn and reearn the trust of our customers and the flying public in particular. And so we're working with our customers in the airlines on how we can best rebuild that public trust, working with them. And engaging their pilots, for example, as they're involved in the process and our airline pilot customers who can express their views to the flying public. I think that's a big source of confidence for the future. So we're working together on that standpoint.  And then as we think about production re-ramp going forward, when we're ready, the skyline management, the delivery sequencing, how we can support our customers, get them airplanes as rapidly as we can and in the right order and sequence, that's all part of our daily integrated planning as well. And longer term, we're also deploying training packages and additional educational materials. I would call those above-and-beyond educational materials that are tailored for our various customers around the world. So that'll be a longer-term effort where we work with them on training, education as well as areas where we can help with the brand repair, if you will, in rebuilding the public confidence.  So we're working together across all of those fronts, and I'd say the relationship with our customers, the collaboration here is as strong as it's ever been. And perhaps, that's what we see in difficult times like this. We see those fundamental relationships coming to the surface, and the strength of those relationships is clear. Operator : Next, we go to Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Rajeev Lalwani : Greg, a question for you. Can you just talk about the tools you're using to manage the tightness on cash flow over the coming quarters in regard to paying suppliers and the inventory build? And then also, what's the status of advances coming from customers? Have they stopped? Or is there any sort of requirement to return them given what's happening? Gregory Smith : Yes. No, I'd say the advances, for the most part, are coming in per schedule. And I think the thing to keep in mind there, Rajeev, is that the advances that are coming in today are really for delivery slots out in 1.5 years, 2 years from now. But it's obviously something that we're monitoring daily and working with each of our customers on. Like I said, there's daily engagement going on here on multiple fronts.  As far as what tools, again, leveraging the enterprise. So this is a One Boeing effort in what levers we have and in front of us, in what different parts of the business and recognize in short-term and long-term trade-offs here. But obviously, the company is in a very different position than it was 10 years ago. Obviously, we're a lot larger but a lot healthier in generating in the other parts of the business, outside of 737, a lot more cash. And that certainly helps us navigate this very challenging situation that we're faced with, but it's a very big difference. And remember, too, back then, we didn't have a share repurchase program. And so that is a lever for us today that we can utilize to help navigate through this, but again, not losing sight in our long-term commitment around repo.  So my point here, we've got a lot of levers. I think as we're managing this, clearly, the operating rhythm of the rest of the company remains intact. So this is -- as Dennis said, this is the priority. But the fact is meeting our commitments to all of our stakeholders and the rest of the business is also -- continue to be a big focus, and I think you've seen it in the first quarter. So we've got -- we're making decisions on a day-to-day basis, and we're running scenarios, as we talked about. We're running scenarios. So we're clear-eyed about what we know and what we don't know and the range of possibilities or outcomes and how would we manage it and how do we get ahead of it. And we're very much in a mindset of getting ahead of it and frankly playing on the side of being conservative at this point, and we will continue to do that. But again, it's a One Boeing effort and multiple points of input here but critical to making the right decisions around cash and liquidity. Operator : Our next question is from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Carter Copeland : Just a couple of just quick cleanups, Greg, on the commentary you already had on the 37. Does the $1 billion include any contractual remedies for delivery movements in there? And I guess just broader understanding of what you're talking about. It sounds like when you say fixed cost, you mean you've got the total internal cost to the company of keeping the 737 program resources, at least what they were, if not a little bit higher. Despite the fact that there are lower delivery, then that excess cost is really the biggest driver of the $1 billion? Is that correct? Gregory Smith : Yes, you've got it. You've got it. And like I said, too, we are holding that headcount, which is obviously a big factor in that. And you heard me earlier talk about how we're utilizing those skills near term but also obviously thinking long term that when we go up in rate, those resources are resources that are skilled and trained in those positions within the line, so they'll go back into position and allow for a smoother rate increase with more stability. And so that's that, I'll say, investment that we're making today to ensure that we have that smooth rate increase going forward and doing that at each point of stability. So that is obviously is also a part of the additional costs that are in the block. Carter Copeland : And contractual remedies, is there anything -- any assumption for that of significance? Gregory Smith : No. Carter Copeland : Okay. And then just one quick one if I may. The -- you mentioned you had a sort of series of waypoints to evaluate. Can you give us some -- a sense of where the nearest one of those is? You start evaluating any other changes to production or anything else? Is this a sort of two, three month kind of time line? Or is it shorter, longer? Any color would be helpful. Gregory Smith : Well, look, I'd say there's waypoints daily so -- but there's some more significant ones around what Dennis talked about as return to service. That's fundamentally the biggest waypoint we have there and how that could play out, as Dennis articulated, and whether it happens at once or staggered. All of that is being considered and brought into our model and then looking at production rates, looking at the amount of aircraft that we would be parking. And we obviously want to minimize that and keep that to a minimum and obviously fully within our control. At the same time, factor the supply chain, making strategic decisions within the supply chain and not a one-size-fits-all with, again, the whole idea to keep them healthy and help support them through this period but get back on schedule for those that weren't. And we're again -- we're working hand-in-hand with each one of them, again, on a daily basis. So lots of, I'll say, small waypoints within there, but the most significant one being the return-to-service. Dennis Muilenburg : Yes. And Carter, as you look for progress points there, near term will be the certification flight. Next in line will be the actual final certification of the software and the FAA's approval and then bringing the regulatory authorities together to gain approval of return to service. So there's some interim milestones here that'll be visible that we are aiming to complete in the near term, and then that will subsequently cause the next set of activities to occur, which Greg outlined, in terms of production system and supply chain ramp-up. So this is an integrated sequence of events. Operator : And we'll go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Cai von Rumohr : So 787, you had a pretty spectacular $1 billion-plus decline in deferred costs and tooling costs. How did you achieve it? And you mentioned higher 787 margins, was that a function of an increase in the block size? Dennis Muilenburg : Let me comment first and, Greg, jump in on the second part there. Cai, what you're seeing here is the investment that we've made in the 787 product and manufacturing system and our team performing successfully. So while not a lot of fan here over the last quarter, we did seamlessly transition from 12 per month to 14 per month, and I want to compliment our team and our supply chain for doing that effectively. And you see that continuing to be reflected in the program's performance -- financial performance as well as the high-quality deliveries to our customers. And I think what you also see is the effectiveness of that product in the field with the orders volume continuing to come in from our customers. So that program is performing well in the factories, and it's performing well for our customers in the field. Greg, do you want to... Gregory Smith : Yes. I mean outside of that, which frankly very much complements what Dennis said, the mix, right? I mean we're -- we've got more favorable mix. But that smooth introduction of that mix, combined with the rate increases, the supplier step-down as we move through the blocks, sky, as I talked about before, continue to play into that as well. But we didn't have any block extension in the quarter, so it's really a combination of all the efforts that Dennis and I had mentioned. Dennis Muilenburg : Performance, yes. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that completes the analyst question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I will now return you to the Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Ms. Anne Toulouse, Senior Vice President of Communications. Ms. Toulouse, please go ahead. Anne Toulouse : Thank you, and good morning. Now we will continue with the media portion of today's call. For the members of the press, if you have questions after the session ends, please call our team at 312-544-2002. John, we're ready for that first question. [Operator Instructions]. Operator : And first in line, we have Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg. Julie Johnsson : Dennis, can you just dig in a little deeper into what you're expecting the Board -- or the mission of the Board Committee and when you expect them to report on the certification process? And just to play devil's advocate, I am just wondering how meaningful this will all be if it comes -- deepen as a recertification effort for the 737. And the Board members involved are really respected leaders, but they don't have a deep aerospace background. Dennis Muilenburg : Yes. Well, Julie, let me just take a half step back first and remind everyone again of the incredible importance of safety to us in our culture of driving safety and continuous improvement. That is -- that culture is what has made this industry the safest form of transportation, and that is a fundamental that we are committed to. And any time an accident like this happens, it's a very difficult situation. We have great sorrow for the families that are affected. This weighs heavily on us. This gets right to the core of who we are as a company and our focus on safety. And so what we're doing here is looking at every dimension of what we've learned and making sure that we, as part of that effort, focus on any potential process improvements that we can make. That is our duty and responsibility. So not only do we look at product and service improvements, but also, are there any process improvements that we can make?  And there's really a twofold effort here. One, the U.S. government is bringing together a joint authority review with international regulators around the world. That's been previously announced. That will take a look at certification processes. We'll support that with technical expertise, and any learnings from that, we'll incorporate. And then internally, I've also asked our Board to set up a committee that you referenced. And let me give you a little more context on that. That committee will be focused on looking at our design, development, certification processes not only for the MAX but, more broadly, for our airplane programs. It will be headed up by Edmund Giambastiani, and he does have a great deal of expertise in the aerospace sector and the defense sector, as you well know. So we're bringing sector knowledge to the table. He will be joined by Board Members who also bring expertise from other sectors who are very safety-focused and have significant government regulatory dimensions. And I think that will actually make us better because we can do cross-sector learnings, so I would argue that that's bringing in an external view that's even more helpful. In addition, that committee has authorized to bring in outside technical support, deep support in the areas where it's required, and they will also leverage the depth of our technical resources across Boeing. So they will have a depth of capacity to do their work. And based on the outcome of their analysis and assessment, we'll determine how we roll these results into our processes. That could be a report. It could be set of actions. Rather than stating upfront what that will be, what we want to do is see what the committee learns and see the outcome of their work and then we'll decide how to implement that. But we are committed to doing a deep and rigorous evaluation and making improvements where we can. That is part of how we operate as a company. We are always looking for opportunities to improve. Operator : Next question from Phil LeBeau with CNBC. Phil Lebeau : Dennis, my question is this. What is your plan or what plans are in place to reassure airlines and the traveling public that the 737 MAX will be safe to fly again once it is cleared to get back in the air? And what's your reaction when you see these reports, and you've seen them over the last couple months, where -- whether it's airline passengers or airline executives who are saying, \"I'm just not sure people are going to want to fly this plane again.\"? Dennis Muilenburg : Yes. Phil, I think that's a great question and certainly an area where we're very focused on. And this is an area where collaboration with our airline customers is extremely important, and we're working this on a daily basis. And we certainly have deep regret for the impact that this has had on our airline customers and their operations and the impact it's had on the flying public. We've got 100-plus years of history as a company on providing safe transportation, and that is a commitment that we treasure, something that we place high value on. And the respect of the flying public, the confidence of the flying public is very, very important to us. So we regret the impact that's happened here, and we're very focused on addressing that going forward.  The game plan that we've laid out with our airline customers is tailored by customer. We're talking with each of them in terms of what they're hearing from their passengers. We think a key voice in all of this will be the pilots for our airlines, and their voice is very important. That bond between the passenger and the pilot is one that's critical, and so we're working with our airline customers and those pilot voices to ensure that we can build on that going forward. To that end, we hosted multiple sessions around the world. More than 90% of our 50-plus MAX operators to-date have had pilots in our simulator sessions with the new software, experiencing that, building confidence. I can tell you with those series of sessions that we've had around the world, the pilot feedback from the simulator sessions has been excellent, and I think it's been a big part of building confidence and how we talk about this going forward. So we're planning to leverage that pilot voice. We'll be working closely on branding and talking about training and education activities going forward. This is a place where Boeing is going to make an investment. We know it's important to earn and reearn the trust, and this will be done jointly with our airline customers, the pilots, the flight crews, the flight attendants, everybody that supports these airplanes. And we know it'll take time. We have to earn and reearn the trust of the flying public, and that's work ahead of us, and we take that very seriously. Operator : That will be from Eric Johnson with Reuters. Eric Johnson : Dennis, there's been some calls for you to divide up your role as Chairman and CEO. As the grounding continues, would you say that your future in both roles or either role is tied specifically to the duration and outcome of the crisis and your ability to restore public trust in Boeing? Dennis Muilenburg : Eric, I think it's important to look at this, again, from a long-term standpoint. As we've said in the past, as we continue to say, it's important that our company has the flexibility to have the leadership structure that works best for our company. That's been our position for years and continues to be our position, and we remain consistent on that front. And we have a great, engaged Board on this topic. The working relationships are strong. Our Lead Director, Dave Calhoun, is very engaged in the work that we're doing. The Board Committee that I talked about is just another example of a very engaged Board. I have daily communications with the Board both in my Chairman role and in my CEO role. We think that is the right, most effective structure for our company. And I think that's, again, showing it to be the case even in the midst of this challenging situation. And I also want to reiterate the fact that our Board does have a very strong, independent Lead Director and that we respect and understand those rules, and the structure that we have in place today is one that I think is healthy for our company and healthy for all of our stakeholders. Anne Toulouse : Okay. That concludes our call today. Again, for members of the media, if you have further questions, please call our team at 312-544-2002. Thank you.",

Before we begin I need to remind you that any projections, estimates and goals we include in our discussion this morning are likely to involve risks, which are detailed in our news release and our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook. Now, I will turn the call over to Dennis Muilenburg. Dennis Muilenburg : Thank you, Maurita, and good morning. Let me start with the 737 MAX. The accidents that occurred in Indonesia and Ethiopia continue to weigh heavily on us. We will always be sorry for the lives that have been lost and the families that have been impacted. These accidents affect all of us personally and reinforce the importance of the work that we do. We know lives depend on it and nothing is more important to us than the safety of the flight crews and passengers who fly on our airplanes. We're also committed to supporting the families and communities affected by the Lion Air and Ethiopian accidents. Earlier this month we pledged $100 million in funds to help support those families and communities. And last week we announced that $50 million from this pledge would be dedicated to providing near-term financial assistance to families of the victims. And we have partnered with renowned experts Kenneth Feinberg and Camille Biros on disposition of these funds. Now let me turn to the latest on the MAX technical updates. Last month the FAA directed us to address a specific condition of flight unrelated to MCAS that the planned software update did not previously address. We agreed with the FAA's decision and we are currently working on the software changes to address this requirement. In addition, we are working with the FAA and other regulators to complete as many elements of the certification process as possible in parallel with the development of the software update. We will submit our final certification package to the FAA once we have satisfied all of their requirements, which we currently estimate will be in the September time frame. However, as we have consistently emphasized, it is the FAA and other global aviation regulators that will determine when the 737 MAX returns to service and we are working tirelessly to meet their requirements. The process is dynamic and involves constant dialogue on outstanding questions and open issues that will continue in the days and weeks ahead. We are committed to working with these regulators to satisfy all of the requirements and to ensure the 737 MAX's safe return to service. As I mentioned last quarter, as part of our commitment to continually improve safety as we have always done, we've established a new Board committee to review Boeing's policies and processes for the design and development of airplanes. The committee has sought input from outside experts, from both industry and government and is working expeditiously to conduct its review and provide any recommendations it deems appropriate. In preparation for the safe return of the 737 MAX to service, we've conducted a dozen customer conferences with MAX operators around the world and nearly 225 simulator sessions to develop test and demonstrate the software. In addition, we conduct weekly technical calls with our customers worldwide to ensure that all the appropriate steps are being taken so that the fleet is fully prepared to return to service when the grounding is lifted. This involves having the necessary technical kits and expertise on hand while adopting a new airplane entry-into-service mindset in partnership with our customers. This also includes a comprehensive package of training and educational resources. In April, we reduced the 737 production rate to 42 per month to accommodate the pause in MAX deliveries. Both within Boeing and our supply chain, we are using this time to improve the production system health and stability. As we said in our pre-release last week, our best current estimate is a return to service for the MAX that begins early in the fourth quarter. Based upon this estimate and other factors, we expect to be able to maintain our current production rate of 42 deliveries per month to be followed by incremental rate increases that would bring our production rate to 57 during 2020. As our efforts to support the 737 MAX's safe return to service continue, we will continue to assess our production plans. Should our estimate of the anticipated return to service change, we might need to consider possible further rate reductions or other options, including a temporary shutdown of the MAX production. The grounding has also impacted our customers and their flight schedules. The production rate adjustment to 42 per month will also cause associated airplane delivery delays in the future. We've been in constant contact with our customers to support them during this difficult time and we'll continue to work closely with all of our customers around the world and deal with the impact individually customer by customer. As we announced last week, we are recognizing impact to our second quarter results from both the longer-than-expected lower production rate and also estimated potential concessions and other considerations to customers. I want to personally thank everyone who continues to be our partner in this journey, from our airline customers and their pilots, flight attendants and others who have been impacted by these groundings, representatives from all levels of government who share our commitment to safety, to the flying public and everyone in the aviation community impacted by these events. We are grateful for your support and we will continue striving to earn and re-earn your trust. Now let me turn to an overview of our second quarter operating performance, followed by an update on the business environment and our expectations going forward. After that Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and how we are maintaining financial discipline and prudently managing liquidity as we work through the safe return to service of the MAX. With that let's move to slide 2. During the quarter, we recorded revenues of $15.8 billion and core earnings per share of negative $5.82, reflecting the MAX charge as well as lower volume of 737 deliveries partially offset by higher defense and services volume. We recorded negative $0.6 billion of operating cash and paid $1.2 billion in dividends reflecting a 20% increase in dividends per share from last year. Now let's look at the second quarter operating performance for our businesses. For the quarter, Commercial Airplanes generated revenue of $4.7 billion reflecting 90 deliveries and the $5.6 billion pre-tax MAX charge. We saw solid widebody activities in the quarter and our backlog remains healthy at more than 5,500 airplanes worth $390 billion. Also earlier this month, we launched our latest round of flight testing through our ecoDemonstrator program to assess new technologies from enhancing safety and environmental performance to improving the flying experience. We debut a Boeing 777 that will serve as the 2019 flying testbed for 50 projects. The majority of the test flights will fly on sustainable aviation fuel to reduce emissions and demonstrate the fuel's viability. Now over to Defense, Space & Security. BDS reported second quarter revenue of $6.6 billion and booked $4 billion of new orders demonstrating the continued value we bring to our customers across our defense space and security portfolio. Those orders included contracts for a second lot of MH-47G Block II Chinooks for the U.S. Army; service life modification for the U.S. Navy's F-18 fleet; Wideband Global Satellite Communications for the U.S. Air Force; and a 5-year extension of Joint Direct Attack Munition tail kits spares repairs and technical services for the U.S. Air Force. Key milestones for BDS included the first T-X trainer program flight test on contract with U.S. Air Force and successful completion of the Starliner's final parachute test in preparation for upcoming launches. We delivered five KC-46 Tankers to the U.S. Air Force in the quarter. Year-to-date, we've delivered a total of 13 tankers. We look forward to continuing to work with our customer during their initial operational test and evaluation of KC-46 and we are committed to delivering the highest-quality product to our customers. Turning to Global Services. BGS reported revenue of $4.5 billion representing 11% growth year-on-year. BGS continues to win new business highlighting the value we bring to our broad range of commercial and government customers and the strength of our One Boeing offerings. During the quarter BGS won new business totaling approximately $4 billion, which included Performance-Based Logistics contracts for AH-64 Apache for the U.S. Army and KC-767 Tanker for the Italian Air Force. BGS also received commitments from ASL Aviation Holding and GECAS for up to 45, 737-800 converted freighters. And as announced at the Paris Air Show, we're excited about Boeing's first off-platform component service program with British Airways for the airline's A320 and A320neo aircraft. Also in the quarter, aligned with our targeted vertical integration strategy to strengthen internal capabilities increase innovation and provide greater end-to-end value for our airline customers, we entered into an agreement to acquire EnCore Group an aerospace interiors company. Additionally, through Boeing NeXt which leads our future mobility efforts, we announced the strategic partnership with Kitty Hawk Corporation to collaborate on future efforts to advance safe urban mobility. Progress also continues with the Embraer transaction as we work through regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. We still expect to complete the transaction by the end of the year. In summary, our priority continues to be the safe return to service of the 737 MAX and we've continued to prioritize additional resources and focus on this effort. At the same time, we are maintaining our focus on keeping the business strong and healthy. As we demonstrated in the second quarter, our team continues to execute on operating performance and capture noteworthy additions to our large and diverse backlog. With that let's turn to the business environment on slide 3. We continue to see healthy global demand for our offerings in commercial, defense, space and services. These are sizable sectors that are growing and backed by strong fundamentals with a combined market opportunity of $8.7 trillion over the next 10 years. That's up from $8.1 trillion in our previous forecast. The increase was driven by strong commercial aviation fundamentals, airline productivity, widebody replacement demand and large stable defense and space markets as well as the need for life cycle services solutions. As a global company with customers in 150 countries, we are always mindful of the potential impact of geopolitical and macroeconomic forces. We continue to track a host of near-term issues including the U.S.-China trade discussions. We believe in the mutual economic benefits of a strong and prosperous aerospace industry. In commercial aviation, while we have seen moderation of traffic in the first half of this year, global passenger traffic continues to grow faster than GDP and near long-term trends. In 2018, we saw the ninth straight year of above-trend growth for passenger traffic. So far in 2019 passenger traffic has grown at a solid 4.6% through May. On the air cargo market, we saw a contraction in the year-to-date traffic. While we expect cargo traffic headwinds to linger in the near-term, we anticipate an improvement in the latter part of the year. Our view of the demand fundamentals remains robust. We are highly confident in our industry outlook which now forecasts the demand for approximately 44,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years. That's up from approximately 43,000 in our previous forecast, doubling the size of the global fleet and requiring a sizable ecosystem of life cycle solutions to maintain and support it. We continue to see sustainable long-term growth in commercial aviation, powered by mature and emerging economies, a growing middle class, and continued innovation in business models and products. The changing nature of travel has fundamentally expanded traffic patterns with improved accessibility and affordability. At the same time, airlines are maintaining capacity discipline and keeping supply and demand in balance. They are also more balanced between airplanes purchased for fleet growth and replacement. Of the 44,000 new airplane demand, 44% will go towards replacing aging aircraft leading to more stable purchasing patterns. We believe the evolution in these key market dynamics in aggregate continues to drive less cyclicality for our industry. These long-term demand fundamentals provide a solid foundation for our commercial business. We are well-positioned in this market with a strong portfolio of airplanes, a large and diverse order backlog and a strong One Boeing team. Additionally, we are forecasting demand for around 800,000 new civil aviation pilots and 770,000 new maintenance technicians over the next 20 years. About 80% of them will be for commercial aviation. Meeting this strong demand will require a collective effort from across the global aviation industry. The aviation industry will need to adopt innovative training solutions to enable optimum learning and knowledge retention. The narrowbody segment will command the largest share of new deliveries. We expect airlines to need more than 32,000 single-aisle airplanes in the next 20 years. These new airplanes will continue to stimulate growth and provide requirement -- and provide required replacements for older, less efficient airplanes. Our 737 program has a backlog of more than 4,400 aircraft and a production skyline that is sold out into early next decade. Last month International Airlines Group, one of the world's largest airline groups, signed a letter of intent to purchase 200 737 MAX jets. We are honored by their trust and confidence that IAG is placing in the 737 MAX and ultimately in the people of Boeing and our deep commitment to quality and safety above all else. In the widebody segment, we have seen steady order activities for the 787 and the 777 and have high confidence in a meaningful increase in widebody replacement demand early next decade. In the near-term, we continue to monitor and inform the U.S.-China trade discussions. China is an important part of the global aircraft market and progress on this front will help support our widebody production rates. The current-generation 777 continued its steady sales momentum with two new orders from DHL in the quarter and 12 new commitments and letters of intent from Qatar Airways which we firmed up earlier this month and also from China Airlines and Turkmenistan Airlines. These provide further support for the 777 bridge. Turning to 777X, orders and commitments of 364 aircraft provide a strong foundation that supports our plan for ramping up production and delivery of this new aircraft. We continue to focus on further bolstering the 777X skyline. On 777X development, our first two flight test airplanes are now in preflight testing. Overall the airplane is performing well in preflight tests with intermediate gauntlet and initial taxi tests completed during the quarter. Our teams are currently focused on final systems, propulsion, and airplane level tests. However, the GE9X engine remains the pacing item as we work towards first flight. As we previously mentioned, GE, our engine supplier is working through some challenges with the engine that are putting risk on the overall test schedule. Based on GE's latest assessment on what it will take to address these challenges, we are currently projecting that first flight will occur in early 2020 rather than in 2019 as we have previously mentioned. This scheduled flight is obviously disappointing given how well the aircraft has been performing in preflight tests and that we are on track on non-engine activities. While we continue to target 2020 for first delivery of the 777-9 the engine issue has added significant risk to the schedule. We continue to work closely with GE as well as explore opportunities to improve the schedule such as leveraging our system integration labs and additional airplane ground testing as we strive to meet this delivery target in a manner consistent with our commitment to safety. We continue to expect 777 delivery rates to be approximately 3.5 aircraft per month in 2019. Given the pressure around 777X first delivery timeline, we are reassessing the 2020 skyline. In light of the strong demand for our freighter line, we intend to mitigate some of the impact by producing more 777 current-generation freighters in 2020. Turning to the 787 Dreamliner, in the quarter we saw Air New Zealand, Korean Airlines, and Air Lease Corporation announce their commitments to purchase a total of 33 787-9 and 787-10s. Korean Airlines firmed up their orders last week. Our 787 backlog stands at more than 550 airplanes. Similar to the 777X, we will continue to focus on further bolstering the 787 skyline. On our 767 program, we added six new 767 freighter orders in the quarter and as previously announced, we plan to increase the 767 production rate from 2.5 per month to three per month in 2020. At Defense Space & Security, we continue see solid demand for our major platforms and programs. Looking at the defense and space market for the next 10 years, we see a $2.5 trillion market of opportunities for our business. About 60% of that is in the U.S., so there's tremendous opportunity around the world. Our strategy of global reach with local presence is key to our success. You see that across Europe, Australia, India, and the Middle East to name a few. The BDS portfolio is well-positioned with mature world-class platforms to address current needs and innovative capable and affordable new franchise programs to build the future. We continue to see broad support for our products from the Pentagon, NASA, and Congress including for procurement of the Boeing F-15EX and F-18 fighter jets, Apache and V-22 Osprey rotorcraft, JDAM weapons, satellite programs, the Space Launch System, and key derivative programs like the KC-46 Tanker and the P-8. We have also seen robust support for our future franchise programs. We are maintaining a clear focus on these future franchises, including the ongoing MQ-25 and T-X development programs and our NASA Commercial Crew and Space Launch System programs at the leading edge of space exploration. Additionally, we're focused on leveraging our work to date on GBSD to help deliver this essential national security capability. Turning to the services sector. We see the $3.1 trillion services market over the next 10 years as a significant growth opportunity for our company. This is a very dynamic and exciting marketplace, one that is driven by new technology and a relentless drive for greater efficiency, reliability and safety. BGS provides agile cost-competitive services to our customers worldwide. The future of commercial and government aircraft and services will be increasingly centered on technology and data services to drive smarter business decisions in commercial aviation and improve the commercial passenger experience and to enhance war fighter safety effectiveness and mission readiness. We aim to continue growing faster than the average services market growth rate of 3.5% as we further expand our broad portfolio of services offerings and continue to gain market share. Strong orders of $4 billion in the quarter reflect our customers' recognition of our value proposition in helping them optimize the performance of their fleets and reduce operational costs through the life cycle. The market continues to recognize our broad and deep portfolio of digital solutions, which harness the power of big data to significantly expand fleet capability and cost savings for commercial and government customers. During the quarter, we expanded our global rosters of customers, including announcements at the Paris Air Show by Delta Airlines and JetBlue Airways. We signed up for our crew navigation analytics and other solutions to help optimize their operations. In summary, with growing markets and opportunities ahead, our team remains committed to growth, innovation and accelerating productivity improvements to fuel our investments in the future. Our One Boeing strategy and offerings across our three businesses are key differentiators that strengthen our position as the world's leading aerospace company. With that, Greg over to you for our financial results. Greg Smith : Thanks, Dennis, and good morning everyone. Before we discuss the second quarter results let me also touch on the 737 MAX and explain how the grounding has impacted our financials to date and what we're doing to focus on today and going forward. Let's move to slide 4 please. As previously announced, BCA revenue and earnings were reduced by $5.6 billion of pretax charge related to our estimate of potential concessions and other considerations to customers or disruptions related to the 737 MAX grounding and associated delivery delays. As Dennis mentioned, we will deal with the impact individually, customer by customer and we will look at various forms of economic value that we can provide. While the entire estimated amount has been recognized as a charge in the second quarter, we will expect any concessions or other considerations to be provided over a number of years. Therefore, you can expect the impact on our cash flow to affect 2019 and beyond. We currently see this impact to be more front end-loaded in the first few years, but of course it will depend on individual discussions with our customers on considerations. We also booked an additional $1.7 billion of program costs on the 737 in the second quarter. This increase is primarily due to higher costs associated with the longer-than-expected reduction in the production rate. These include additional fixed costs and other items such as labor escalation support, parts and material. These costs will be spread across the undelivered aircraft in the accounting block of approximately 3,100 units and therefore reduce the 737 program margin. As you know, when the program margin is adjusted it will affect the current quarter and the booking margin for subsequent periods. Also as Dennis said, we continue to work with the civil aviation authorities to ensure the 737 MAX's safe return to service and these authorities will determine the timing and condition of return to service. For the purpose of our second quarter financial results we have assumed that the regulatory approval in the U.S. and other jurisdictions begin early in fourth quarter 2019. While this assumption reflects our best estimate at this time, I just want to reiterate that the actual timing and condition of return to service will be determined by the regulatory authorities and could differ from this assumption and our estimate. Our current second quarter results also assume a gradual increase in the 737 production rate from the current 42 per month to 57 per month in 2020. We will also assume airplanes produced during the grounding, which are stored and included in our inventory will be delivered over several quarters following return to service. Any changes to these assumptions could require us to recognize additional financial impact. With regards to cash, lower cash receipts due to fewer 737 deliveries and lower production rate combined with building and storing 737 aircraft adversely impacted operating cash in the quarter. Looking forward, the key drivers of our financial impact related to the 737 continue to be the return-to-service time line and conditions. The delivery ramp-up which will be dependent on how fast we can deliver the aircraft once the fleet returns to service and how fast our customers can accept the aircraft, but also the 737 production rate profile I discussed going forward; and discussions with customers regarding potential concessions and other considerations. We expect our financial results to continue to be adversely impacted until we safely return the 737 MAX to service, ramp up production rates and resume deliveries to customers. We continue to perform detailed scenario planning around return to service and production rates, including analyzing the implications on our supply chain, customer fleet and deliveries to fully understand the range of financial outcomes. We will continue to assess our current production plans and incorporate any new insights such as return-to-service time line, storage capacity and supply chain in our analysis to help inform us on whether further rate reduction or other options including a temporary shutdown of the MAX production are needed. As discussed last quarter, we've taken steps amid current challenges to preserve the future value and growth of this important franchise program for our company and for our customers. The production rate adjustment to 42 per month we instituted starting in April has helped our factory health and also supply our progress to getting back to master schedule and improving consistency and stability. We've also taken actions to prudently manage our liquidity and increase our balance sheet flexibility including raising additional debt. These actions also include even sharper focus on productivity and strategic prioritization of spending. We will continue to diligently review all levers available to minimize the financial impact. As discussed last quarter given the dynamic 737 MAX return-to-service time line and activities we're not in the position today to provide forecast of the impact of the 737 MAX grounding on our full year 2019 financials. We will provide you with an updated full year 2019 financial forecast when we have returned to service the MAX fleet our production plans and delivery ramp-up profile and corresponding financial impacts. Returning MAX safely to flight continues to be priority one for us. It has been a team effort that leverages the best talent from across Boeing and also outside experts. The operating rhythm and the momentum of our cross-functional team has not let up since day 1. The team continues to meet daily with our Executive Council fully engaged. We will continue to apply whatever resources are required to return the 737 MAX safely into the fleet and take the time necessary to do so working hand-in-hand with our customers. At the same time we'll also remain focused on our priorities delivering results with excellence. So with that let's move to slide 5 and I'll discuss our second quarter results. Revenue for the quarter was $15.8 billion with core earnings per share of negative $5.82 reflecting lower 737 deliveries and the MAX charge partially offset by higher defense and services volume. Now let's discuss Commercial Airplanes on slide 6. Our Commercial Airplane business revenue decreased to $4.7 billion during the quarter reflecting the 737 MAX charge and lower 737 deliveries partially offset by favorable mix. BCA booked negative operating margins in the quarter due to the 737 MAX impact partially offset by higher 787 margins. BCA backlog continues to remain strong at $390 billion and more than 5500 aircraft creating more than six years or production. Let's now turn to Defense Space & Security results on slide 7. Second quarter revenue increased to $6.6 billion reflecting higher volume across derivative aircraft, government satellites, weapons and new franchise programs. It was partially offset by lower F/A-18 volume. Our margins of 14.7% in the quarter include continued focus on productivity and a $200 million gain on a sale of property. Similar to what we saw last quarter the sale of this excess property is the result of the team's continued market based affordability efforts to optimize our footprint and productivity. During the quarter BDS won key contract awards worth $4 billion and our backlog stands at $64 billion with 31% from outside the U.S. Let's now turn to Boeing Global Service results on slide 8. In the second quarter Global Services revenue increased to $4.5 billion reflecting the acquisition of KLX and higher international government services volume. Year-over-year growth of 11% for the quarter continues to outpace the average annual service market growth rate of 3.5%. BGS booked operating margins of 15.1% and as I mentioned before BGS margins quarter to quarter are subject to fluctuations due to factors such as mix of products and services as well as performance on individual contracts. During the quarter BGS won key contract awards worth approximately $4 billion bringing its backlog now to $20 billion. Let's now turn to cash flow on slide 9. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was negative $590 million driven by lower 737 deliveries and production rate offset by solid underlying performance and timing of receipts and expenditures. As mentioned earlier, we expect continued working capital pressure to adversely affect cash flow until MAX deliveries resume. Strong operating cash flow from other parts of the business a strong balance sheet and future balance sheet levers will help provide adequate liquidity during this period. In the second quarter we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and as I previously mentioned until we have clarity on the 737 return to service, we have temporarily paused our share repurchase program. However our long-term balanced cash deployment strategy and commitment remains unchanged. Let's now move to cash and debt balances on slide 10. We ended the quarter with $9.6 billion of cash and marketable securities. As I mentioned earlier, we raised additional debt in the quarter increasing the balance by $4.5 billion to help shore up the liquidity position as we work through the current MAX challenges. Our strategy of maintaining a strong balance sheet provides us with substantial borrowing capacity through capital markets access and unused credit facility of $6.6 billion. Our long-term goals and strategic objectives remain unchanged. We will continue to use our three business unit strategy as a key differentiator in the marketplace, make prudent investments and leverage talent and innovation across the company. So in summary, while focusing on the very important priority of a safe 737 MAX return to service and minimizing the significant impact on our customers and the flying public, our team keeps the core operating management, strong delivering results and meeting customer commitments. We recognize that we have a lot of work and not insignificant challenges in front of us in the weeks and months to come, but we're confident we have the right focus, team and resources to navigate through them. We're committed to providing you with additional updates on the MAX return-to-service progress and production plans as we have more information. We'll strive to continue to keep all of our stakeholders informed through public statements and information posted on our website. Once we have further clarity, we will schedule a follow-up investor and media call to discuss the financial impacts and provide revised guidance. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for closing comments. Dennis Muilenburg : All right. Thank you, Greg. These are challenging times, first and foremost for the families and loved ones affected by these recent events, and also for our dedicated people who work tirelessly to deliver on our mission to connect, protect, explore and inspire the world all with a relentless focus on quality and safety and doing so with the utmost integrity. This is a defining moment for Boeing, and we're committed to coming through this challenging time better and stronger as a company. We'll stay true to our enduring values, while driving operational excellence across the enterprise. The safe return to service of the 737 MAX is our company's top priority. I want to thank my Boeing teammates, who are delivering on this priority and on our other commitments of executing on our key priorities for our customers driving growth and operational excellence across the business in close partnership with our customers and suppliers and returning value to our shareholders. From engineers to analysts, to our factory teams and field service reps, to designers and planners, and to everyone at Boeing who has worked tirelessly to apply our culture of continuous improvement and learn from these events to innovate, to challenge, and to improve you have my sincerest thanks. I'm humbled and inspired by the response of the people of Boeing and our many partners. The shared responsibility of safety binds us together and reinforces our purpose and mission as an aerospace leader. The long-term fundamentals for our businesses remain strong and our key priorities are unchanged. Our One Boeing advantage has never been clearer, and we will leverage this unique strength to deliver and improve on our commitments to our customers and our partners around the world. With that, we'll take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Carter Copeland : Hey, good morning gentlemen. Dennis Muilenburg : Good morning. Greg Smith : Hi, Carter. Carter Copeland : Hi. Greg, can you help us understand the relative degree of confidence you had or used to reach the financial impacts you announced last week and maybe how you thought about the variability in outcomes there, especially, I guess in the context of a temporary line stoppage that you both mentioned in your prepared remarks. And then I guess related you said the phasing of those impacts would be front end-loaded, but can you maybe help us understand how you're thinking about that impact on the kind of higher-level multi-year cash flow trend you've talked about in the past? Thanks. Greg Smith : Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, look obviously our booking position for the second quarter is our best estimate. And that's our best estimate based on a variety of inputs that we take into consideration and our engagement with the regulators, our software schedule, and our production plans the storage that you brought up all of that coming together in the second quarter. And again, that's our best estimate at this time. Now, as I said and Dennis said, obviously, some of those assumptions could change from here and if they do, they could have financial impact further than what we've booked in the second quarter and we'll keep you up-to-date if that's the case. But again, based on all that information, that's the best estimate we've got right now. And as far as the path forward on the customer concessions as we've said, we're working and will continue to work with each of our customers and talk about how we can help through this period around the grounding of the aircraft, but also as we move deliveries out. And those will be individual conversations customer by customer, but likely be multiyear-type I'll say financial outcomes and particularly around cash. As we see it today, it\u2019d probably be a little more front-loaded into 2019 and some of the early years, but then phase out over that period. But again, this will be based on individual conversations and we'll pull that together as those conversations become more mature. As you look at the cash profile going forward, I maybe step back a little bit and take the MAX out of the equation for a second, and tell you that the balance of the company and I'd say the key puts and takes that we saw pre-MAX remain intact. So, all those fundamentals are still intact. The real obviously outlier here is the MAX. And if the MAX returns to service based on the estimate that we have right now, then you'll obviously see significant cash in 2020 that will really be driven by those airplanes being delivered off the ramp at a higher rate, but as well as the production rate increases that we've talked about. But until we have complete clarity on exactly that return-to-service date, and then the associated deliveries and production plan it's obviously TBD at this point. But again, the fundamentals remain intact and the objective certainly remains intact as well of having this year-over-year long-term cash flow objective. And like I said, the operating engine outside of MAX continues to achieve the results we expect. And again lots of puts and takes as we move into the future years, but those are bounded very similar to the way they were pre-MAX. So it really is dependent on MAX return to service, and then that ramp-up from there. And as I said, we'll continue to keep you posted on that. Carter Copeland : So it basically just sounds like the working capital reversal and the phasing of the settlements are the two big moving items for 2020? Greg Smith : Yeah. Certainly, yeah as you think about 2020 like I said delivering off the ramp and not only our ability to deliver off the ramp at a higher rate, but as I said the customers ability to take those; the concessions and considerations as you said; obviously lower advances at this lower production rate that you're seeing currently and you'll continue to see; and then the 777, 777X schedule that Dennis talked about. So yeah, there's lots of moving pieces within there, but we're clear-eyed on all of those and we're running various scenarios around those and taking a lot of action as we indicated on the prior call to try to mitigate some of that risk. So all this effort in the factory, and all this effort in the supply chain to get stable to get folks back on schedule and get productivity initiatives that we had planned for the year and using these additional resources to get those mature and ready, so when we do go up in rate and we do start delivering off the ramp, we're doing that in a most efficient way possible. So that's kind of the investment, I'd say, we're making currently to ensure and minimize that risk as we get return to service and start to put the airplanes back into the hands of our customer. Carter Copeland : Great. Thanks. Greg Smith : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr : Yes. Thank you very much. So the 777X schedule slip, what is the financial impact both in terms of \u2013 what does your skyline for next year look like? Can you hold the Classic at three and half per month? And what does it mean in terms of when the cash outlay for the 777X will peak? Thank you. Dennis Muilenburg : Yeah. Hey, Cai let me jump in on that first and then I'll ask Greg to add on. First of all, just to give you a little additional context on 777X schedule on the airplane side of the effort, we've been very pleased with the progress. And over the last quarter, as we mentioned we did the final gauntlet test, so think of those as the airplane-level system integration tests in the factory. And we also did our initial low-speed and high-speed taxi tests under power. All of that was very effective. We're very pleased with the results. So the airplane side of the equation here is progressing on plan and one of the cleanest development programs that we've seen. We're disappointed by the slip in the engine schedule and GE is steadily working through that challenge and getting their arms around the precise schedule for recovering. We'll be proceeding through engine testing as that solution becomes clear, but that does push our first flight out into early 2020, as we're currently projecting. We still expect this year to be our peak expenditure level on the 777X development program, but you're going to see the cash profile where we had hoped to get into the tailwind part of the program next year. You're going to see that extend out as first flight is extended out. Greg, do you want to add some additional color on that as well? Greg Smith : Yeah. No, I think \u2013 I think Dennis framed that perfectly. And obviously looking at 777 opportunities and obviously we're seeing continued demand for that product and particularly around the freight market, and so we're feathering that in with this current revised schedule Cai. And really that's an opportunity to meet the demands of our customer, but minimize the financial impact to us. So lots of moving pieces in there, but we're continuing to work it. And like I said, the 777 continues to remain strong. It's certainly helping us through this period. And then the 777X skyline we talked about our priorities when it comes to widebodies in the market and certainly 777X and 787 continue to be high priority of filling in that skyline. So like Dennis said, we're disappointed considering the progress that's been made on the program. And these investments, we made to de-risk the development phase of the program, we're seeing the benefit of that today, but we're disappointed by where we are with that \u2013 with this engine. So we're trying to get ahead of this Cai and putting mitigating actions in place and really again minimize the impact on us, and ultimately on our customers. Dennis Muilenburg : And as Greg said, the encouraging thing is the current 777 continues to do well in the marketplace. So we still expect our factory to be running a five per month production rate next year as we said our delivery rate of about three and half per month this year and we'll be looking at the exact delivery mix next year within that production rate the exact delivery mix of 777 to 777X. And so that's work that's still underway. We've got some work to do. Cai von Rumohr : Thanks so much. Dennis Muilenburg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And next we go to Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hunter Keay : Thank you everybody. Good morning. Dennis Muilenburg : Good morning, Hunter. Hunter Keay : Regarding the comment around potentially suspending the MAX line, when will you need to make a decision on that? What are some of the gating factors? And then \u2013 and once you resume deliveries what's the bigger concern between the customer's ability to accept and your ability to deliver it? Thanks. Dennis Muilenburg : Yeah, Hunter first of all, when we take a look at the overall MAX plan and return-to-service plan as we said, our current best estimate is that, we return to service early in the fourth quarter. And as long as we remained solid on that assumption, we believe we can maintain our current 42 per month production rate, and as we said incrementally step back up to 57 a month as we go into 2020. Now, if that estimate of return to service substantially changes then we'll have to consider alternatives. And every day, we are doing scenario planning, working through every dimension of this program. We're looking at the ongoing software update development, the regulatory approvals, the certification process, the return-to-service process, working hand-in-hand with our customers, supply chain health, production system health every dimension of the program. And we have that knit together. We understand it. We understand the ripple effects of any changes to the schedule, and we're going to continue to monitor that on a day-to-day basis. Currently, and as I said daily, we're working with the FAA, EASA and other regulators as we step through the certification process headed back to ungrounding the fleet. We have a clear understanding of the work that has to be done, but there is still uncertainty in the time line. And we do have to go through a multi-regulator approval process and it's a complex process and one that will take time to get done. The important thing here is everything is based on safety of the airplane. We are confident that when the 737 MAX returns to service, it will be one of the safest airplanes ever to fly. That is the most important thing here. We're going to take the time necessary to ensure its safe. And as I said if any of the time line assumptions change significantly from a start of the fourth quarter return to service, then we'll have to evaluate alternatives. And those alternatives could include different production rates. They could include a temporary shutdown of the line, not something we want to do, but an alternative that we have to prepare for, I think it's a smart part of our thorough and disciplined process here to make sure we're covering all scenarios. Hunter Keay : Thank you. Operator : Next, we go to David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So Dennis, you talked about a software fix for this latest issue that the FAA identified. Are you sure it's a software fix at this point and not also potentially a hardware fix? And then, it's also being reported that EASA has five mutual requirements before it'll lift the MAX grounding. Is that in fact accurate? It seems to be more encompassing of what the FAA is talking about. And if so, is that accurate, they have these five requirements? And if so, is meeting those lineup what the September time frame that you've outlined? Thanks. Dennis Muilenburg : Yes. David, let me give you a little context there. So, first of all, on the software update that's going on, we are confident that is a software update not a hardware update. Our process here as we step through certification is, we have the regulators come in and fly in our simulator and we test out a number of different conditions that are all part of the final certification. And during those simulator sessions, we identified this additional scenario that with the FAA, we decided that we would make this software update to mitigate a potential risk. And this was a simulated failure in our -- in the microprocessor of the airplane as previously reported. That is a software update to address that risk area. It's an understood update and we're in the middle of working our way through that. The time line for approving that update and finishing up the certification is still uncertain as we're working through the details with the regulators. The FAA has also convened a number of multi-regulator boards and reviews and venues to bring in EASA, Transport Canada, Brazil, other regulators from around the world. And those convening sessions are bringing all of the questions to the table that any of the regulars have. So the reports that you mentioned about the five questions from EASA, all of the questions from all of the regulators around the world are being brought together, convened and integrated with the FAA's leadership. So all of those inputs have been considered in our current timeline analysis and are all consistent with the time line that we've laid out here for submitting our certification package in the September time frame and a return to service in the October time frame. Now again, that's a time line that we base-lined for the moment, but there's still uncertainty in the exact process that the regulators will step through. Operator : Our next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much and good morning. Follow-up on a couple of questions that have been asked already and hopefully not be too repetitive. But just in terms of how you think about the rate and where the line should be? I appreciate the fact that you guys have to be very disciplined and thorough in your planning. But as we've seen over the past few months, it's not surprising to see the dates move around here and there. And when you balance some of the risks of continuing to producing 42 without delivering versus the risk that would emerge on the supply chain if you were to cut the rate significantly, I mean, is it safe to say that the type of slips that we've seen already which is a couple of months here and a couple of months there don't necessarily affect the rate? Dennis Muilenburg : Yes. Seth, I guess the way to think about that is, we're continually assessing all of these different pressure points in the system and supply chain health is certainly one of the key considerations for us as we think about the production rate. We're also taking a look at storage capacity and our ability to take care of the airplane from the field, our return-to-service time line and the effect that will have on our customers and the work that needs to be done on preparing the airplanes. So we're taking a look through all dimensions of these pressure points around the schedule. And no one item is going to drive the schedule. This is balancing all of the inputs in perspective. So, I won't make any dramatic assumptions around any one parameter. It's more of a balancing act as we continue to look at all of these dimensions. Seth Seifman : Thank you. Operator : Next, we go to Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Rob Spingarn : Good morning. Dennis Muilenburg : Good morning. Greg Smith : Hey Rob. Rob Spingarn : Dennis, you've said it a couple of times on the call now that you'd have the fix-in you think by September and hopefully recertification in October. Given that the FAA is in the building and working with you on this, what are the mechanics of what happens in that one month? Is the idea here that they will have already vetted most of this before they even receive the official submission? And then the other part of the question is, are you -- is discovery over here and we are just implementing and testing? Or is discovery -- new discovery still ongoing? Thanks. Dennis Muilenburg : Yes. Rob, I would characterize this as an iterative process. So we are in daily communication with the FAA and other regulators. Our teams are daily working on software updates, running through simulator sessions. There's a great deal of certification -- documentation that needs to be completed. So all of that engineering work is underway. As we complete that work and complete the documentation of what's called the system safety assessment that will lead into the final formal certification process, which will include a certification flight test. And then subsequent to that flight test we'll submit the final documentation that will go through the FAA's normal approval process. In parallel to that we have a number of pilot evaluations that will be done. There's a joint operational evaluation board that will look at the training dimension of bringing the MAX back up and flying. So all of these are parallel activities that we're working jointly with the regulators but it is an iterative process. And as we go through those iterations it's possible that we will discover new items. So our goal is over time to close out uncertainty, answer questions that are coming in from the regulators. We're making good, steady progress on that. We see convergence, so we know we're making progress. But until we complete all of the certification activities there's always some risk of new items opening up. And so that's why we try to be very disciplined about the engineering process here but also our scenario planning to account for any of these potential uncertainties. And until we get through the final certification step and we all confirm that the airplane is safe, we won't return to service. So that's really the pacing item here. Rob Spingarn : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Jon Raviv : Thanks, everyone. Dennis, can you give us some perspective on the widebody market please, some thoughts on why you're not over supplying as some of your competitors might have suggested and also how you're achieving what some have suggested are very aggressive prices? And then just a little bit also on the near-term versus long-term dynamics in that market, including China. Why is that a near-term driver and then more of a replacement dynamic in the 2020s? Thank you. Dennis Muilenburg : Yeah. You bet Jon. Well, a couple of things. One, as you look at our current market outlook as I mentioned in my comments, we continue to see strong overall growth. And if you look at the next 20 years, the world needs about 44,000 new commercial airplanes, up from about 43,000 in our previous forecast. So directionally the market continues to expand. The fundamentals are solid and passenger traffic in particular continues to expand. A key part of that future demand is the widebody marketplace. We continue to see a significant wave of replacement demand early in the next decade as we've said before. And we believe our 787 and 777X families are perfectly positioned for that replacement wave that's coming. And you can see that our products are winning in the marketplace. Despite a fairly tough marketplace in terms of overall orders, so far this year our widebody segment has been doing well. And we've been winning in the marketplace with both the 787 and the 777X and I think that speaks to the value that we're providing customers. So I can't comment on our competitors' comments that you mentioned but I can comment on the fact that our customers see value in the 787 Dreamliner and 777X. That's showing up in orders. And while we still have work to do on the skyline as we noted for both 777X and 787, we feel confident in the production rates that we've laid out. And you've seen that with the 787 currently running at 14 a month, we're continuing to gain efficiency on that line and that's allowing us to be even more competitive in the marketplace. So we're going to be mindful about filling the future skyline. We're mindful of those risks and we'll continue to pay attention to that. But the long-term marketplace for widebodies is solid and our family of products is well-positioned to compete and win. Jon Raviv : Thanks. I\u2019ll stick to one. Operator : Next we go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Ron Epstein : Yeah, hey good morning guys. Dennis Muilenburg : Good morning Ron. Ron Epstein : So one thing that really hasn't come up too much in the call is where do we stand on NMA. And on NMA when we kind of stand back and look at it, given the difficulties that we run into on the MAX and the difficulties on 78 and the difficulties on 74-8 and the difficulties on KC-46, how do we get comfortable around NMA? And can you just talk about that? Dennis Muilenburg : Yeah Ron. First of all to put it in context, we continue to have a dedicated team that's working on NMA, working through our business case. Our assessment of the market opportunity hasn't changed. We see a potential market there for 4,000 to 5,000 aircraft and we continue to see significant customer interest in that marketplace. But in terms of relative priorities, it's clear that our top priority is getting the 737 MAX return to service safely and so we have prioritized that in terms of resourcing and focus for our company. And that will be first and that is ahead of our NMA work. That said, we're continuing to progress on building our business case and when and if that business case closes, we would make a launch decision. We still see it as a two-step decision process as we've described previously. And we're not going to run to any artificial time line. We're going to make decisions based on disciplined data and as the business case close. Part of that business case is addressing development program risk as you noted and we are investing significantly in improving development program performance. We know it's an area that needs continued improvement going forward. This gets in all the work we're doing on things like model based engineering, our digital transformation, production system of the future. These are all important elements of reducing development cost and also de-risking development programs for the future. That's all part of what goes into the business case for NMA and our confidence in the maturity of those new tools and the ability to implement them at scale on our development program will be part of the decision process. Ron Epstein : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Doug Harned : Thank you, good morning. Dennis Muilenburg : Good morning, Doug. Doug Harned : On the MAX, as you look toward presumably the September time frame, one of the issues that's been out there has been training requirements. And if you look across a number of aviation authorities there, appear to be very different views also across airlines. When you consider different scenarios for what training requirements will be whether they're full simulator computer-based, how could that affect your ability to deliver even if we get certification in the time frame that you're hoping it will occur? Dennis Muilenburg : Yeah, Doug. That's another area that we're paying close attention to and working daily. So as part of our ongoing work, not only the software update on the MAX, we've also made a comprehensive update to the training materials and expanded educational resources. And that is being done in concert again with regulatory authorities and with our customers around the world. In fact, we've conducted, as I mentioned earlier, hundreds of simulator sessions with customer pilots around the world to get their inputs on the training packages and some of the updates that we're making. So that work is going on in parallel. The next significant waypoint in that process is something that's called the Joint Operational Evaluation Board. That is a convening of regulators and government pilots that will fly the airplane with the updated software. They will evaluate the training curriculum and will make final recommendations on the overall training requirements. And we have prepared a comprehensive set of computer-based training modules that we're confident will address the training needs for the MAX. But in addition to that, we've also prepared options and are continuing to work through options for simulator-based training for airlines that may want that or regulatory agencies that may require it. And we do expect in the end that we'll have a consistent set of computer-based training that all airline customers will use and there will likely be some selective use of simulator-based training. It depends on the maturity of the fleets and whether they already have MAX aircraft or whether MAXes are new to their fleet. It depends on their pilot training curriculum. Some airlines will use simulator training as part of their normal recurrent training. Some may want training upfront before they fully return the fleet to service. So that can be a pacing item, Doug, as you noted and it's another one of those uncertainty elements that we're working our way through. That's why when we say return to service early in the fourth quarter we have to work through all of these uncertainties : the software update and the certification of the airplane itself as well as the training curriculum as well as preparation for all of our customers to get the fleet back up and running. And we have good understanding of each of those workflows. We know the work that has to be done. We are on it on a daily basis. But the exact time line for completing all of that and getting regulatory approval across the board is still uncertain, and that's why we keep saying we've made our best estimate of that time line, but we're also protecting for uncertainty of that time line with our scenario planning. Doug Harned : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Next we go to Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning. Dennis Muilenburg : Good morning. Myles Walton : I was hoping that you could comment on -- with the new updated time line if you have made changes to those suppliers you're maintaining at a higher than 42 a month rate. And then, also if you can maybe talk about the logic between a temporary shutdown versus just a more significant leg down in your production rate of 42. Thanks. Dennis Muilenburg : Yeah. Myles, a couple of things. One is our solution on the supply chain plans and the scenario planning we're doing varies by supplier. So we have some that are supplying at our production rate, others that are continuing to run at higher than our 42 a month production rate. It's really tailored supplier-by-supplier. In some cases, we had suppliers who were behind schedule, and we'd use the opportunity here to catch up to master schedule as Greg mentioned. Obviously CFM with the engine, Spirit on the fuselage as examples there where we've been able to increase -- improve our production's health and stability by having them run at a higher than 42 a month production rate. With CFM, for example, we're also working to sustain that higher production rate to make sure we have sufficient engine spares available when we return to service. So each of these are tailored plans, and it's all part of the supply chain health that we're thinking our way through with more than 600 suppliers on the MAX program. Regarding your latter questions, we think through production system planning, it depends on the time line and our understanding of the time line. If we are able to maintain our early fourth quarter return to service again we hold it at 42 a month production rate, if we have a significant change we would consider alternatives. Stepping down to a lower production rate below 42 a month, presents some challenges more broadly to our supply chain synchronization of our workforce as well, learning how you would consider ramping back up later and the impact of that. So in some cases, depending on time line, a temporary shutdown of production line could be more efficient than a sustained lower production rate. And that's what we're thinking our way through. If you had a temporary shutdown if it was necessary that is one way to reduce the outflow of airplanes and the storage requirements while to a degree maintaining supply chain health and workforce learning for consistency in the production system. So we're thinking through all of those parameters and making sure we have all those scenarios available. Maurita Sutedja : Operator, we have time for one more analyst question. Operator : And we'll go to Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you. Good morning. Dennis Muilenburg : Good morning, Sheila. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Just to elaborate on the global demand environment a little bit more, what are your thoughts on air traffic decelerating close to the 4% to 5% long-term rate? What are watch items there? And as it relates to that, how do you think about the service business and implication from the MAX to that segment? Thank you. Dennis Muilenburg : Yes, Sheila, on the overall market, the fact that we've been operating at a 4.6% passenger traffic growth through May, is not surprising to us. We expected some slowdown in the early part of the year. Some of this has been driven by local effects. The MAX, to a degree, has played into this. Local airport shutdowns in a couple of key locations have impacted it. But we don't really see a macro driver behind the passenger traffic numbers year-to-date and it is consistent with the longer-term trend of continuing to grow it faster than GDP. So our overall confidence in the market and our 20-year growth outlook, our current market outlook, remains solid. And I wouldn't read anything more than that into the passenger traffic stats that we've seen so far this year. And the second half of your question was? Greg Smith : Service business. Dennis Muilenburg : On the services business. Greg Smith : The MAX, yes. Dennis Muilenburg : So, on the MAX impact, we have seen some impact of the MAX grounding on our services business. Things like engine overhauls, for example, have been pulled back a bit as we have customers who are keeping existing airplanes in service longer, because of the less capacity in their fleets. They're deferring some engine overhaul work, so some ripple effect into our services business. I wouldn't say it's extensive, but some impact that we've seen. And again, we expect that to be localized and temporary, nothing that we're seeing as a long-term trend change. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that completes the analyst question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now return you to The Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Ms. Anne Toulouse, Senior Vice President of Communications. Ms. Toulouse, please go ahead. Anne Toulouse : Thanks, John. Good morning. We'll continue with questions for Dennis and Greg. For those in media, if you have additional queries following this session please call our team at (312) 544-2002. Operator, we're ready for that first question. And in interest of time, we ask that you limit everyone to just one question. Operator : And first we go to Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg. Please go ahead. Julie Johnsson : Hi. Dennis, you've talked in the past about how the MAX experience has been. The last few months have been gearing for your personally, but just an enormous challenge for Boeing. And there's been some discussion of lessons learned and I think a lot of people would like to actually hear a little bit more about what those are. And what's changed in terms of how Boeing operates and how it approaches designing and certifying aircraft? Dennis Muilenburg : Yes, Julie, let me make a few comments on that note. I appreciate the question. Certainly, it's been a challenging time for us as a company, but more broadly across the aviation industry. And one, I think, this whole situation has certainly reinforced the importance that we place on safety and quality and reminded us of the importance of the work we do. And we know that lives depend on the work we do and this is just further reinforcing that and reinforcing our commitment to safety and quality. And in the end, that's going to make us a better, stronger company. We are taking a look at all of our airplane design and certification processes end-to-end. As you know, we have a Board Committee that we've stood up and they're doing a lot of hard work right now, looking through all of our processes. We also have a number of external government reviews that are ongoing, looking at certification processes. Any learnings from that we will certainly incorporate going forward. And then, we're also taking a look at things around communications and integration and how we can make sure safety issues if found or recognized, those quickly come to the surface, can be dealt with, that we have effective communications with our customers and all the constituencies that are involved. And those are changes that we'll be making as well for any lessons learned. This is all about ensuring that we have the right safety and quality culture for the future. We have a very solid foundation of that today, but we also know we can always get better and that's our focus. Operator : Our next question is from Eric Johnson with Reuters. Please go ahead. Eric Johnson : Hi. Thank you. Dennis, so do I understand it correctly that you have to sell more 777 freighters to avoid a slowdown in 777 output due to the 777X delays? And how easy is that at a time of global trade tensions? Dennis Muilenburg : Yes, Eric, as I said, we look at the skyline mix through 2020. With the delay in first flight of the 777X, it's obviously going to put pressure on entry-into-service timing. We're still holding 2020 for first delivery. But we know there's clear pressure on that, given the delays in first flight. So we are taking a look at production skyline mix in 2020. And as we mentioned earlier, we anticipate that means we'll probably build more current-generation 777s, 777 freighters in that time frame. The good thing is the market signals are positive there. We've made progress on continuing to sell 777 freighters including during this last quarter. We continue to see strong demand signals there. And so our ability to maintain the production system at five a month and alter the delivery mix between 777s and 777X. We're confident we can do that. We have work to do to fill out the specific orders and delivery slots. But the good news is that the 777 bridge is strong and we continue to see a lot of demand for the 777 freighter. Operator : Next we go to Dominic Gates with The Seattle Times. Please go ahead. Dominic Gates : Good morning. The news you've delivered today, gives us two very different scenarios for production in Renton. The one scenario there's a possible shutdown. And the other scenario, you're ramping up from 42 to 57 a month in a year basically. I just want you to address, how -- they look like there are some optimistic assumptions in there. You're going to fly the plane in September is your hope. But usually after a flight test it takes weeks for the FAA to process the documentation. And analyze all the data from the flight test. So it does seem optimistic that you would then enter service in October. And then, it seems equally optimistic that you could ramp up from 42 to 57 in a year. You normally take a lot of incremental pieces that takes half a year to get from 42 up to 57. So, what is the trigger for which scenario happens in Renton? If you slip into next year for entry into service, does that mean a shutdown? Dennis Muilenburg : Yeah, Dominic there's no one specific trigger. Again, as I said, we're laying out a multitude of scenarios given all the variables in the schedule here. Our current best estimate, as we said is to deliver our certification package, including the certification flight in that September time frame. And then return to service in the -- early in the fourth quarter. And you're right, post certification flight it's typically a process that's measured in a number of weeks with the regulators including the FAA to evaluate all of that data, to confirm it, and to give us approval to unground the fleet and return to service. We have taken our best estimate at that and factored that into the analysis and numbers that we shared with you today. And we are assessing that on a daily basis and working hand-in-hand with the FAA in this process. And we are dependent on the FAA and other regulators for achieving that time line. And we're going to work very closely with them to do that. If that time line changes significantly, we will have to evaluate these other scenarios. And, there's no one specific trigger, but know that we're going to continually look at this as, what is the optimum solution for our customers, to ensure first of all safety of flight and to help them return to service in a healthy way. And while we do that maintain production system health, both within our own factory in Renton as well as our supply chain health. That includes a very close focus on our workforce, the health of our workforce, stability of our workforce as well as all these other parameters around storage and other factors that play into the schedule. Now we're going to continue to balance all of those. To your point about our ability to ramp up later, I will remind you that, we have been at higher production rates previously. So we have experienced, not only up to 57 a month, but at 52 a month. And that experience, that learning, that understanding, gives us confidence in how we can rate back up. And we've factored that into our analysis as well. And I think you've also noted that, even though we have stepped down to 42 a month on our production rate, we have held our workforce in Renton. And we place incredible value on our teammates there. And the incredible work that they do. And we're working every dimension we can to preserve that workforce and maintain that learning for future production system ramp-up, so all of these things are factoring into our decision process. Anne Toulouse : That's going to conclude our earnings call. So again if you're a member of the media, and you have additional question, please call our media relations team at 312-544-2002. Thanks.",

The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analysts and media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcast live over the Internet. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Ms. Maurita Sutedja, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Ms. Sutedja, please go ahead. Maurita Sutedja : Thank you, John and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's third quarter 2019 earnings call. I'm Maurita Sutedja and with me today is Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's President and Chief Executive officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Enterprise Performance & Strategy. After management comments, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. And as a reminder you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com. Before we begin I need to remind you that any projections estimates and goals we include in our discussion this morning are likely to involve risks which are detailed in our news release, in our various SEC filings, and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. In addition we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook. Now, I will turn over to Dennis Muilenburg. Dennis Muilenburg : Thank you, Maurita and good morning. This month marks the one year anniversary of the Lion Air Flight 610 accident. It's been roughly seven months since the Ethiopian Airlines' Flight 302 accident. Not a day goes by where my team and I don't think about these accidents. They weigh heavily on us and we will never forget the lives lost aboard those flights. We are sorry and we continue to extend the deepest sympathies to the families and loved ones. These accidents affect all of us personally and reinforce the importance of the work we do. We know lives depend on it and nothing is more important to us than the safety of all those who fly on our airplanes. Let me walk you through the latest developments regarding the 737 MAX on the next slide. Our priority remains supporting the safe return to service of the MAX and assisting our airline customers and operators through this difficult time. We are working daily with the FAA and global regulators on the process they have laid out for certifying the 737 MAX software and training updates and ungrounding the global fleet. Again, I want to express our regret for the difficulties that the release of an instant message document on Friday has presented to the FAA and other regulators and we understand entirely the scrutiny it's receiving. We are committed to working with the investigative authorities and the U.S. Congress as they continue their investigations. We are focused on going forward. As we have shared, we completed the MCAS software update earlier this year which addresses concerns found following the two MAX accidents and provides three additional layers of protection to prevent accident like these from ever happening again. To-date we have conducted more than 800 tests and production flights totaling more than 1,500 hours with the updated software which incorporates feedback from across global regulators and MAX operators. We are making steady progress on the second software update announced in June for additional flight control computer redundancy to eliminate the possibility of even extremely unlikely risks that are unrelated to the accidents. In the upcoming days, Boeing will complete additional testing of this software update and conduct multiple simulator evaluations and reviews leading up to a certification flight with the FAA onboard. Just last week, the company successfully conducted a dry run of the certification flight test. We're making daily progress on these important certification steps. We have brought the very best of Boeing to this effort dedicating all resources necessary to ensure that the improvements to the 737 MAX are comprehensive and thoroughly tested, that includes spending over 100,000 engineering and test hours on their development. Looking forward, we target regulatory approval for the 737 MAX return to service to begin this quarter. As we've said before, however, it's the FAA and other regulatory authorities who will ultimately determine the timing and conditions of return to service in each relevant jurisdiction. This may include a phased approach and timing may vary by jurisdiction. During this process, we have been working closely with the FAA and other regulators. We'll provide the documentation, have them fly the simulators, and help them understand our logic and the design for the new software. All of their questions are being answered. The process is dynamic and involves constant dialogue with government agencies that will continue in the days and weeks ahead. In preparation for the safe return of the 737 MAX to service, we have worked to build the trust and confidence of our customers and regulators. We have partnered with customers and pilots from around the world as we've developed our solutions. We have welcomed and encouraged their questions and giving them opportunities to test those solutions first-hand in our simulators. We have hosted 545 participants for more than 140 customers and regulators around the globe to experience the software updates in our simulator sessions. We have also conducted 20 global conferences with more than 1,100 participants from more than 250 organizations to help operators and financiers prepare for return to service and provide them the opportunity to ask questions for our teams. In addition, we're conducting weekly technical calls with our customers worldwide to deliver the highest quality support and fully prepare the fleet to safely return to service when the grounding is lifted. This involves an entry-into-service approach augmented with advanced analytics. This also includes the proposed comprehensive package of training and educational resources. With our first and foremost priority the safe return to the service of the MAX, we announced a change earlier this month that separates the Chairman and CEO roles to further enable me to center my attention on running the company as Boeing's President and CEO. Dave Calhoun, our Board's Independent Lead Director is now serving as our Non-Executive Chairman. I'm fully supportive of this division of labor and look forward to continuing my close partnership with Dave, who has a deep knowledge of the aerospace industry and has been a strong and independent leader on Boeing's Board since 2009. Together, we can be a force multiplier for this important work underway across the company and with our external stakeholders. This move is just the latest of several actions by our Board and senior company leaders to strengthen Boeing's governance and safety management processes, which I will discuss next. Let's turn to slide 3. As part of our long-standing commitment to safety, last month I announced several actions we're taking to continuously improve. The actions followed recommendations from our Boeing Board of Directors that was a result of the five-month Independent Board Committee review that I've requested of our policies and processes for the design and development of our airplanes. Members of the committee on airplane policies and processes rigorously explored these aspect of our business and made several recommendations focused on further improving safety throughout the company and the broader aerospace ecosystem. My team and I fully embraced our Board's recommendations and took immediate steps to implement them across the company. With the committee's input, we established a new product and services safety organization that will review all aspects of product safety and maintain oversight of our accident investigation team and the company's safety review boards. Additionally, we're strengthening and elevating our engineering function through a direct reporting line to Boeing's Chief Engineer, who reports to me. We're also establishing a formal design requirements program, enhancing our continued operation safety program, partnering with our airline customers on flight deck designs that continue to anticipate the needs of future pilot populations, and we're expanding the reach of our Boeing safety promotion center. These actions are on top of the steps our Board already has taken to reaffirm its commitment to and oversight of safety, including establishing a permanent aerospace safety committee and adding safety-related experience as one of the criteria for future directors. In addition to implementing the Board's recommendations, we are committed to reaching even higher. We're concurrently expanding our efforts to strengthen the way we manage safety across Boeing and our supply chain, for example, by broadening the use of a comprehensive safety management system and safety review boards. We're already driving a company-wide approach to safety, quality and integrity that strengthens our vision and serves to reinforce and improve our operational performance. Additionally, investments in enhanced flight simulation and computing capabilities have increased our company's ability to proactively test a wide range of scenarios resulting in improved product safety. Advanced research and development efforts in future flight decks are also underway, leveraging leading-edge work in human factors, science and design. Safety is our continual focus. Looking to the future, we'll be exploring ways we can strengthen global aviation safety in partnership with stakeholders across the aerospace community. We also continue to invest in talent for the future. At this defining moment, Boeing has taken expanded leadership role with a heightened focus on safety. We'll keep learning from these recent accidents, we'll stay true to our values and we will come through this together as a company and industry. As we keep safety at the forefront, we also remain focused on stability across our production systems and supply chain, as well as mitigating impacts to our customers. As I mentioned earlier, our best current estimate is return to service of the MAX that begins this quarter. Based upon this estimate and other factors, we expect to maintain our current production rate of 42 deliveries per month with a focus on supply chain and production systems stability. This will be followed by incremental rate increases that would bring our production rate to 57 by late 2020. After return to service, we expect the 737 MAX airplanes produced during the grounding and included within inventory will be delivered over several quarters with the majority of them delivering in the first year. We will continue to assess our production plans as part of our scenario planning process. As mentioned before, the FAA and other regulatory authorities will ultimately determine the timing and conditions of return to service in each relevant jurisdiction. Should our estimate of the anticipated return to service change, we might need to consider possible further rate reductions or other options including a temporary shutdown of the MAX production line. I want to reiterate my personal thanks to everyone who continues to be our partner in this journey. We are mindful these are challenging times for many and we remain grateful for your support. Now let me turn to an overview of our third quarter operating performance, followed by an update on the business environment and our expectations going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and how we are maintaining financial discipline and prudently managing our liquidity as we work through the safe return to service of the MAX. With that, let's move to slide 4. During the quarter, we generated revenue of $20 billion and core earnings per share of $1.45, reflecting lower 737 deliveries partially offset by higher defense and services volume. We recorded negative $2.4 billion of operating cash due to the 737 impact. We paid $1.2 billion of dividends in the quarter. Now let's look at the third quarter operating performance for our businesses. Commercial Airplanes generated revenue of $8.2 billion reflecting 62 deliveries. BCA ended the quarter with our backlog of nearly 5,500 airplanes worth $387 billion. As we discussed before, global trade tension is putting near-term pressure on our widebody production rates, especially the 787. I will discuss that in more detail later. Now over to Defense Space & Security, BDS reported third quarter revenue of $7 billion and booked $5 billion of new orders, demonstrating the continued value we bring to our customers across our Defense Space & Security portfolio. Those orders included contracts for our fifth KC-46 Tanker production lot for the U.S. Air Force and nine AH-64E Apaches for the U.S. Army. Key milestones for BDS included the MQ-25 unmanned aerial refueler first test flight. Also T-X trainer, now renamed the T-7A Red Hawk performed its 100th test flight. Other accomplishments in the quarter included the first flight of the inaugural P-8A Poseidon for the UK Royal Air Force, and final assembly of the Space Launch System core stage structure. Also noteworthy is the satellite launch services award received by our United Launch Alliance joint venture from the U.S. Air Force. Moving on to tanker. As mentioned, Boeing received a $2.6 billion contract for production lot five covering 15 KC-46 aircraft spares and support equipment. We delivered nine tankers to the U.S. Air Force in the quarter and 23 year-to-date. Turning to Global Services. BGS reported revenue of $4.7 billion, representing 14% growth year-on-year. BGS continues to win new business, highlighting the value we bring to our commercial and government customers and the strength of our One Boeing offerings. In the quarter, BGS booked contracts for commercial modification, component and training services as well as contracts with the U.S. Air Force for F-15 training to Qatar, A-10 Thunderbolt II re-winging and KC-46 Tanker lot five services. Also in the quarter, India-based carrier SpiceXpress took delivery of the first 737-800 Boeing-converted freighter to expand its air cargo operation. Progress continues towards our planned strategic partnership with Embraer. We're actively engaged with authorities and relevant jurisdictions and have obtained a number of regulatory approvals including clearance to close in the U.S. and Japan. The European Commission earlier this month opened a Phase 2 assessment in its review of the transaction. We remain convinced that both the Commercial Aviation and the KC-390 joint ventures will increase competition in the market and create value for our customers and the traveling public as well as drive innovation in products and services. We now expect the transaction to close in early 2020. In summary, our priority continues to be the safe return to service of the 737 MAX and we've continued to allocate additional resources and attention on this effort. At the same time, we are maintaining our focus on keeping the business strong and healthy, while focusing on operational performance. As we announced yesterday, we made several leadership changes that will further strengthen our company during a challenging time. Stan Deal has succeeded Kevin McAllister as President and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes and Ted Colbert has succeeded Stan Deal as President and CEO of Boeing Global Services effective immediately. Stan brings extensive operational experience in commercial airplanes and trusted relationships with our airline customers and industry partners; and Ted brings to our Global Services business, an enterprise approach to customers and strong digital business expertise, a key component of our long-term growth plans. We are also grateful to Kevin for his dedicated and tireless service to Boeing, our customers and our communities during a challenging time and for his commitment to support this transition. With that let's turn to the business environment on Slide 5. We continue to see healthy global demand for our offerings in Commercial Defense Space & Services. These are sizable sectors that are growing and backed by strong fundamentals with a combined market opportunity of $8.7 trillion over the next 10 years. In commercial aviation, while we have seen some moderation of traffic growth, global passenger volume continues to be resilient, building on nine straight years of above-trend growth. Passenger traffic this year is growing at a solid 4.5% through August, again outpacing global GDP and tracking with long-term growth rates. Meanwhile, the air cargo sector is facing more headwinds, as overall volumes have contracted year-to-date amid a challenging trade environment. That said, we continue to see steady utilization of the global freighter fleet while carriers are placing incremental orders to support their fleet replacement needs. Additionally, traffic data points to solid growth in air cargo intensive sectors, such as pharma, technology and express shipments. Improvements in industrial production and global trade will be key to a rebound in air cargo in 2020. With an industry outlook for approximately 44,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years and an ecosystem of life cycle solutions needed to maintain and supported, we continue to see sustainable, long-term growth in commercial aviation. This is powered by mature and emerging economies, the growing middle class and continued innovations in business models and products. We believe the evolution in key market dynamics in aggregate, continues to drive less cyclicality for our industry. These long-term demand fundamentals provide a solid foundation for our commercial business. We are well positioned in this market with a strong portfolio of airplanes, a large and diverse order backlog and a strong One Boeing team. The narrowbody segment will command a larger share of new deliveries with expected demand for more than 32,000 single-aisle airplanes in the next 20 years. These new airplanes will continue to stimulate growth and provide required replacements for older, less-efficient airplanes. Our 737 program has a backlog of more than 4400 aircraft. In the widebody segment, we have seen solid order activity this year for our market-leading 787 and 777 families. In the quarter, Korean Air and Air New Zealand placed follow-on orders for the 787 to replace aging aircraft, reflecting the start of the widebody replacement cycle that we expect to accelerate early next decade. We see the need for more than 1000 small to medium widebody aircraft to be replaced over the next decade. In the near term, as we have shared, the U.S.-China trade situation has presented challenges for our widebody production plans, in particular for the 787 program. As part of our practice for a significant market such as China, we have forecasted orders from operators based on the country as part of our skyline assumptions. The lack of orders from China in the past couple of years has put pressure on the production rate. We are in the planning window on the rate decision due to the production lead times. Therefore, as part of our disciplined rate management process, we believe it is appropriate to make a production rate adjustment to balance the supply and demand. So beginning in late 2020, we plan to transition the 787 production rate from 14 per month to 12 per month, for approximately two years. We will maintain this disciplined rate management process going forward, taking into account a host of risks and opportunities. We will continue to assess the demand environment and make adjustments as appropriate in the future. We'll also continue to monitor and inform the U.S.-China trade discussions. We value and maintain strong relationships with our customers and government stakeholders around the world, reinforcing the mutual economic benefits of a strong and prosperous aerospace industry. And we remain hopeful that airplanes will ultimately be part of the trade solution. At our planned rates, our 787 backlog of nearly 530 orders, provides a solid foundation and represents more than 3.5 years of production. Moving to the 777 program. The current generation 777 continued its steady sales momentum with 14 new orders in the quarter. These provide further support for the 777 bridge. On 777X development, we continue to progress in our preflight testing, focusing on final systems propulsion and airplane-level test. On the static airplane test results, our detailed analysis of the data is progressing well. What we've seen to-date reinforces our prior assessment that this will not have a significant impact on the design or on the preparations for first flight. The GE9X engine remains the pacing item, as we work towards first flight of the 777X. GE our engine supplier has made good progress to address the durability challenges. GE has installed retrofit components in the certification test engines and testing has restarted. Once the engines become available, GE and Boeing will need to successfully complete additional testing before we are ready to fly. We still expect first flight to take place in early 2020. We continue to explore opportunities to improve the time line, such as leveraging our system integration labs and additional airplane ground testing consistent with our commitment to safety. That said, as we further assess the impact to the GE9X engine and associated risk, we now expect first delivery of the 777-9 to be in early 2021. The combined 777, 777X production rate is five per month. We continue to expect the 777 delivery rate to be approximately 3.5 aircraft per month in 2019. The delivery rate is expected to be at approximately three per month in 2020, as we mitigate some of the impact of the slide in 777X time line by producing more 777 current generation aircraft. We are focused on further bolstering the 777X skyline. The 777X orders and commitments of 364 aircraft, provide a strong foundation that supports our plan for ramping up production and delivery of this new aircraft. On the 767 program, we added 16 new orders in the quarter including 15 for the KC-46 production lot 5. As previously announced, we plan to increase the 767 production rate from 2.5 to three per month in 2020. In Defense Space & Security, we continue to see solid demand for our major platforms and programs. Looking at the defense and space market for the next 10 years, we see $2.5 trillion of opportunities for our business with 40% of that from outside the U.S. The BDS portfolio remains well positioned with proven world-class platforms to address current needs and innovative capable and affordable new franchise programs to build the future. We continue to see broad support for our products from the Pentagon, NASA and Congress including for procurement of Boeing F-15Ex and F-18 fighter jets, Apache and V-22 Osprey rotorcraft, JDAM weapons, satellite programs, the Space Launch System and key derivative programs like the KC-46 Tanker and the P-8. We also see robust support for our future franchise programs. We are maintaining a sharp focus on these future franchises. The MQ-25 recently began test flights and we are humbled to honor the legacy of the Tuskegee Airmen with the T-7A Red Hawk. We also remain absolutely dedicated to Commercial Crew and the Space Launch System, which will maintain our nation's position as the leading edge of space exploration. Turning to the services sector. We see the $3.1 trillion services market over the next 10 years as a significant opportunity for our company. We continue to see growth with expanded service offerings, across the supply chain portfolio and our global digital solutions. New business in the quarter reflects our superior products both on and off platform with new digital agreements signed with Air Canada for our manpower planning software and with IndiGo for ops control and tail assignment digital solutions. In summary, with growing markets and opportunities ahead, our team remains committed to growth, innovation and accelerating productivity improvements to fuel our investments in the future. So, with that, Greg over to you for our financial results. Greg Smith : Thanks, Dennis. Good morning everyone. Let's move to slide 6 and we'll discuss our third quarter results. Revenue for the quarter was $20 billion with core earnings per share of $1.45 reflecting lower 737 deliveries, partially offset by higher defense and services volume. Before we discuss the segment performance, let me also touch on the 737 MAX and explain how the grounding has impacted our financials, what we've done to mitigate some of that impact and what we're focused on today and going forward. For the purpose of our third quarter financial results, we have assumed the regulatory approval for the MAX return to service begins in the fourth quarter this year. While this assumption reflects our best estimate at this time, I just want to reiterate that the actual timing and condition of return to service will be determined by the regulatory authorities and could differ from this assumption and our estimate. Our third quarter financial results also assume a gradual increase in the 737 production rate from the current 42 per month to 57 per month by late 2020. We also assume that after return to service of the MAX airplanes produced during the grounding and including within inventory will be delivered over several quarters with the majority of them being delivered within the first year. Any changes to these assumptions could require us to recognize additional financial impact. We added $872 million of program costs on the 737 in the third quarter. This is primarily to reflect current assumptions regarding timing of return to service and the timing of planned production rate increases. These additional costs will be spread across the undelivered aircraft in the accounting block of approximately 3,100 units and therefore reduce the 737 program margin. During the quarter, we reassessed our estimate of potential considerations and other in concessions for customers for disruptions related to the 737 MAX grounding and associated delivery delays. This reassessment included updated -- updating estimates to reflect revised return to service and production rate assumptions as well as latest information based on engagements with 737 MAX customers. We have made no significant adjustments to the recorded liability in the quarter. As we've mentioned, we're also addressing the impact individually customer-by-customer and we will look at various forms of economic value that we can provide. We expect any concessions or other considerations to be provided over a number of years. And therefore, you can expect the impact to our cash flow to affect 2019 and beyond. We continue to see this impact to be more front-end loaded in the first few years but of course will be dependent upon individual conversations with customers. Looking forward, the key drivers of the financial impact related to the 737 continue to be the return-to-service time line and conditions; the delivery ramp-up, which is dependent on how fast we can deliver aircraft once the fleet returns to service and how fast our customers can accept the aircraft; also includes 737 production rate profile; and as discussed customers regarding potential concessions and considerations. We expect our financial results to continue to be adversely impacted until we safely return the 737 MAX to service, resume deliveries to our customers and ramp-up production rates. We continue to perform detailed scenario planning around return to service and production rates, including analyzing the implications on our supply chain, customer fleet and deliveries to fully understand the range of financial outcomes. We will continue to assess our current production plans and incorporate any new insights, such as return-to-service time line, storage capacity, and supply chain all in our analysis to help inform us on whether further rate reductions or other options including a temporary shutdown of the MAX production are needed. We've also taken actions to prudently manage our liquidity, increasing our balance sheet flexibility in managing our spending and laser-focused on productivity. We will continue to diligently review all levers available to minimize the financial impact It's important to note that everything we do are focused on quality and safety are and always have been our highest priority. We do not compromise these values for cost or schedule. Returning the MAX safely to flight continues to be priority one for us. It's a team effort that leverages the best talent from across Boeing and outside experts. We will continue to apply whatever resources are required to return the 737 MAX safely into the fleet and take the time necessary to do so working hand in hand with our customers. Let's now move to Commercial Airplanes on slide 7. Our Commercial Airplanes business revenue decreased to $8.2 billion during the quarter reflecting lower 737 deliveries. BCA operating margin declined to negative 0.5%, reflecting lower 737 delivery partially offset by higher 787 margin. BCA backlog includes nearly 5,500 airplanes valued at $387 billion equating to more than six years of production. Let's now turn to Defense Space & Security results on slide 8. Third quarter revenue increased to $7 billion reflecting higher volume on satellites, weapons and new franchise programs T-7A in particular, partially offset by lower F-15 volume. BDS booked operating margin of 10.7% in the quarter reflecting improved performance. During the quarter BDS won key contract awards worth $5 billion and our backlog stands at $62 billion with 30% from outside the U.S. Let's now turn to Boeing Global Services results on slide 9. In the third quarter, Global Services revenue increased to $4.7 billion reflecting the acquisition of KLX and higher government services volume. Year-over-year growth of 14% for the quarter continues to outpace the average services market growth rate of 3.5%. BGS booked operating margins of 14.4%. And as I mentioned before BGS margins quarter-to-quarter are subject to fluctuations due to factors such as mix, products and services as well as performance on individual contracts. During the quarter BGS won key contract awards worth approximately $6 billion bringing its backlog now to $21 billion. Let's now turn to cash flow on slide 10. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was negative $2.4 billion driven by lower 737 deliveries, lower advance payments and timing of receipts and expenditures. We expect continued working capital pressure to adversely affect cash flow until MAX deliveries resume. Strong operating cash from other parts of the business, a strong balance sheet and further balance sheet levers will help provide adequate liquidity during this period. In the third quarter we paid $1.2 billion in dividends. And as I previously mentioned, we have temporarily paused our share repurchase program. Our long-term balanced cash deployment strategy and commitment to returning cash to shareholders remains unchanged. However in the near term managing our liquidity and balance sheet leverage are top priorities and will continue to be so until the 737 MAX deliveries resume we execute the 737 production rate increases and see stability in the production system. Let's move now took cash and debt balance on slide 11. We ended the quarter with $10.9 billion of cash and marketable securities. We raised additional debt in the quarter increasing the balance by $5.5 billion, primarily to fund the Embraer acquisition and also to help shore up liquidity position as we work through the current MAX challenges. Our strategy of maintaining a strong balance sheet provides us with substantial borrowing capacity through capital markets access and unused credit facility of $6.6 billion. Our long-term goal and strategic objectives remain unchanged and we will continue to use our three business unit strategy as a key differentiator in the marketplace, make prudent investments and leverage talent and innovation from across the company. As always we'll continue to keep a close eye on the geopolitical and macroeconomic developments prudently managing risk. As Dennis said, we maintain our disciplined rate management and continue to monitor the environment and make rate adjustments as appropriate in the future. As a reminder in addition to the MAX, our financials particularly cash flow will also be impacted by the decrease in the 787 production rate and timing of 777X entry into service. Reduction in future deliveries create cash headwind due to lower cash from pre-delivery and delivery payments. So in summary, while focusing on a very important priority of safe 737 MAX return to service and minimizing the significant impact on our customers and the flying public, our team keeps the core operating engine strong, delivering results and meeting customer commitments. While we still have a lot of work in front of us, we're confident that we have the right focus, team and resources to navigate through. We're committed to providing you with additional updates on the MAX return to service, progress, production rate plans as we have more information. We'll strive to continue to keep all of our stakeholders informed with the utmost transparency through our public statements and information posted on our website. Once we have further clarity, we will schedule a follow-up investor and media conference call to discuss financial impacts, provide financial guidance which will capture the puts and takes including the impacts from the recent widebody changes. With that I'll turn it back over to Dennis for closing comments. Dennis Muilenburg : All right. Thank you, Greg. These are challenging times first and foremost for the families and loved ones affected by these recent accidents. They will always be on our thoughts. This is also a defining moment for Boeing, and I can assure you that we have learned from this and we'll continue learning. We have changed from this and we will continue changing. And we're committed to coming through this challenging time better and stronger as a company. We'll stay true to our enduring values of safety, quality and integrity while driving operational excellence across the enterprise. We will never waver in our commitment the importance of our work demands it. Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our customers and the flying public. The safe return to service of the 737 MAX is our company's top priority. I want to thank my Boeing teammates who are delivering on this priority and on our other commitments of executing on our key priorities, driving growth and operational excellence across the business in close partnership with our customers, suppliers and regulatory agencies while returning value to our shareholders. With the changes we're making to the MAX software and training, we're confident that the MAX will be one of the safest airplanes ever to fly. The long-term fundamentals of our businesses remain strong and our key priorities are unchanged. Our One Boeing advantage has never been more clear and we will leverage this unique strength to deliver and improve on our commitments to our customers and partners around the world. With that we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thanks. Good morning, Dennis and Greg. Greg Smith : Good morning, Sheila. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Greg, perhaps a question for you on cash. Given MAX production and changes in working capital associated with the aircraft as well as the recent widebody cut on the 87s, how are you thinking about the free cash flow profile of the company over the next few years? Greg Smith : Yes. Yes. Well, look, considering the circumstances of where we are obviously the cash profile is more challenging than it was. But I'd say the long-term objective that we had in place continues to be in place. I'd say outside of MAX in the service and defense business we continue to see opportunities there. But as you mentioned between getting the 737 MAX back up that will be the single biggest driver safely return that back to service, deliver on our aircraft off the ramp and meeting those rate breaks that we talked about and maintaining stability will be the key driver in the cash flow profile going forward. We've got more 777X inventory build as a result of the scheduled change so we see that use of cash now peeking in 2020. And obviously with the 787 rate decisions that we announced today and the associate advances that also will have an impact within that time frame. So lots of puts and takes but 737 MAX being the biggest driver through that period. So when we have better clarity on that path forward and the stability we'll give you a further update of where we think we are over the long-term profile. But again that remains our objective and the underlying engine continues to perform well, but we've got to continue to execute. And like I said those key elements are really going to be the big drivers of cash going forward. Sheila Kahyaoglu : All right. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Doug Harned : Good morning. Thank you. Greg Smith : Good morning, Doug. Dennis Muilenburg : Good morning, Doug. Doug Harned : If we go back a little ways you had previously said that you'd expected to have a completed fix for the MAX to the FAA by the end of September. So we're in mid-October now that appears to have slipped. But yesterday, Steve Dickson made - at the FAA made some statements that sounded fairly positive regarding software and documentation that Boeing has provided to the FAA. So I'm trying to understand where we stand now. Is there -- what constitutes the delivery of a final fix? And is there a milestone that we should be looking for ahead of an FAA certification flight? Dennis Muilenburg : Yeah. Doug good question. And as you know we've been working this at a very detailed level, basically every hour, every day in close coordination with the FAA. And we are in the process of delivering those certification items and that includes the final software, the training products, the system description documents. And that has been an iterative process. We did start that incremental process in September. The review cycles have taken a little longer than originally planned. But I think that's a good representation of the fact that we're diving deep into the documents, we're answering all the questions. And the FAA has taken the time to make sure we get it right. So I think that level of scrutiny is good. We have -- now have the final software in our regression testing labs. As you heard from Administrator Dickson, yesterday the FAA has been involved in that final software delivery. You also heard from Administrator Dickson that we've now delivered the final system description document of the changes to the MAX. That's another important milestone. So there are tangible milestones being achieved, but we still have more work to do. Last week we did complete an initial dry run of the certification test flight. We anticipate doing a couple more dry run kind of flights. But to a next big milestone that you might look forward Doug to your question when we get to the certification flight that will be a key weigh point on the way to the airworthiness directive. And again that final decision around the airworthiness directed to un-ground the fleet and bring the MAX back up that will be the regulator's decision, that will be the FAA's decision. But we're going to lean forward and provide every piece of data we can. We're going to make sure the depth of analysis is complete. We're going to answer every single question. And I can tell you we are making steady daily progress. We have a well-defined plan and we're performing against that plan. And the preeminent focus here is on safety. We're going to take the time to get it right, make sure it's safe. And we'll continue to share the milestone progress as we go. Doug Harned : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead. Peter Arment : Yes, good morning Dennis, Greg. Dennis Muilenburg : Hey Peter. Peter Arment : Dennis, maybe you could just talk about 787 decision. This is really, obviously, the first production cut for that program. It's been so successful. Maybe just on holding that rate at 12 a month kind of confidence levels around that just thoughts about in general the longer-term production profile for the 787? Thanks. Dennis Muilenburg : Yeah. Peter it's a good question. Obviously not a decision that we take lightly. As Greg mentioned and as we've talked about before production rate discipline is one of our key management principles, something that will drive stable, long-term growth. Our prospects for the long-term widebody market haven't changed. We still see that as positive. As I mentioned in my comments, we see a market for roughly 1,000 new small to medium-sized widebodies over the next decade. So that replacement wave cycle early in the next decade that we've talked about previously we still see that coming. But in the near-term, our skyline has been dependent on orders from China. And now that we're within lead time on our production system and those orders from China have not materialized, we need to make a decision. And so that's what you see reflected here. We think the decision to take the rate down to 12 for approximately two months is a good -- or excuse me for two years is a good disciplined decision and fits with the market signals that we're seeing. We're going to continue to monitor the U.S.-China trade policy discussions and then we'll continue to make our plans going forward. We have a very disciplined process for looking at the market, our supply chain health, all of the other parameters that might affect our customers' decision making process. And the decision we're announcing today is something that's consistent with that disciplined approach. So bottom line here is our long-term prospects have not changed, but we need to make prudent decisions here in the near-term that match with the economic realities. Operator : Next we'll go to Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning. Dennis, you've had a mid-teen BCA margin target out there a while. I'm just curious with all the changes, I guess the 37s now 400 basis points maybe lowering the block program, looking forward the 87 rates and the 777, are we now looking more in the 10% to 12% range? And then Greg just a clarification on share repurchase. I was interpreting from your comments you mean you don't anticipate share repurchase until 2021 after everything is back up? Is that accurate? Dennis Muilenburg : Greg you want to take the second question first? Greg Smith : Sure. I think -- don't anticipate share repo until we've got return to service. We're executing on the production rates and reaching the stability that we expect. And once we get to that level then we'll reassess our cash deployment efforts. And, of course, as I mentioned we've got additional debt on the balance sheet and we plan to address that as well. So we'll keep you up to speed, but those are the key milestones to watch for. And until we're satisfied with where we are and we're generating the cash that we would expect as a result of reaching those milestones, we'll re-execute on our cash deployment strategies. But as I said our long-term objective is certainly what it was, but we've got to get through that -- those milestones before we'll readdress repo. Dennis Muilenburg : And Myles to your first question, similar thing on the operating margin side. Our long-term objectives and targets have not changed. We're still driving towards a mid-teen margins business. We haven't altered our plans for that. But again in the near-term, our laser focus is on the safe return to service of the MAX. That is the most important thing we can do and we're going to invest all of our resource and focus in making that happen. The fundamentals of the business, the investments we're making in digitizing our enterprise, lean principles in our factories, a lot of these production rate discipline and efficiency we're continuing to drive during this interim time period. While we have had to make production rate reductions on the 737 line for good reasons, we're also using this as an opportunity to continue to invest in the line and maturing some of our advanced manufacturing processes. And that will make for a healthier production system for the long run and keep us on track for those long-term targets. But in the near term, no question, our focus is on the safe return to service of the MAX. And I can tell you without any question our preeminent focus every day going forward is on safety and quality. Myles Walton : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Carter Copeland : Hey, good morning, gentlemen. Dennis Muilenburg : Good morning, Carter. Carter Copeland : Greg, just a clarification on the cash. Are you no longer receiving MAX PPs and advances? I just -- I didn't quite catch that out on your earlier comment. And then on the 87 margin increase, I mean you've had several steps upward in that margin in the last several quarters. Are we to assume that this is similar in scale in terms of the increase? Or should it be significantly less because of the rate decision? Just wanted to dive in there just because you have good deferred production numbers there and so it looked like that might have been better? Greg Smith : The team continues to do a great job in executing on their plans across not only the two sites, but within the supply chain with the partners as well in integrating the mix between 9s, 10s and 8s. The team has done a great job and you're seeing the results of that in the margin. The profile that you've seen, you should expect that to continue as we work through these blocks. As we talked about there are some key levers within those blocks our own productivity, supplier step-down as well as mix. That will be favorable to the margin as we work through the block. So that's all about executing on those fundamentals. And if we do that and do that as planned, you'll continue to see margin expansion associated with the program. On advances, obviously the profile of advances in particular on the 737 has changed dramatically and appropriately so. So we are still getting some advances. But with the shutdown all of those have been rescheduled. And that profile again is very different than it would have been clearly if we were at full rate. So we continue to work with each of our customers on this. But again as we talk about cash flow going forward as we execute on the rates going up and do that and maintain stability through that period and the efficiencies, we'll start to see that advance stream picking up and associated back with a higher delivery. So obviously a key enabler for cash flow going forward. But as we're at this period right now, as I said, you're going to see continued pressure on cash -- on operating cash until we get back to service. Carter Copeland : And so just to be clear on that 87 margin, the step-up was similar to what you've seen in some of the recent quarters? Greg Smith : Yes. It varies from quarter-to-quarter Carter just depending on -- again depending on mix and delivery profile and just overall kind of again model mix plays into that pretty significantly as well. Carter Copeland : Okay. Thanks, Greg. Greg Smith : Okay. You're welcome. Operator : Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Ron Epstein : Hey, good morning guys. Greg Smith : Hey, Ron. Dennis Muilenburg : Hey, Ron. Ron Epstein : How do we think about -- in the backdrop with the change in leadership with Boeing commercial, how do we think about where NMA stands now, right? I mean the broader margin keeps moving right along, right? So how are you guys thinking about NMA? And how should we think about NMA? And is that still a project you guys are interested in so on and so forth? Dennis Muilenburg : Yes. Ron first of all let me be really clear on our priorities. Our priority is safe return to service for the MAX and that's been clear to our team, clear to all of our suppliers, clear to all of our constituencies. And we've applied additional resources there. We put additional talent there. That is our focus. Now with that in mind, we are continuing to drive forward with our efforts evaluating NMA. We still are not at a decision point nor are we ready to be at a decision point yet. We're continuing to mature the business case. We're continuing to invest in risk reduction around the production system of the future and that continues to be a productive effort for us. So we'll continue to leverage those investments. And when we're ready to make a decision we will. So still a project of interest. We're still looking at a middle of the next decade entry-into-service time frame as we talk to our customers. And we'll make a good prudent decision when we're ready. But let there be no question, our focus is on safe return to service for MAX. Ron Epstein : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr : Yes. Thank you very much. So maybe you can walk us through the milestones required to achieve your FAA airworthiness directive, the sequence of those milestones and then the milestones between receiving the AD and resumption of U.S. service, because most of your customers in the U.S. are talking about flying again in February not at year-end. Thanks so much. Dennis Muilenburg : You bet. Cai, good question. Let me just walk you through that at the top level. And again, this is a very detailed plan that we've laid out with all of our teams and stakeholders and one that we're working together with the FAA and our regulators. In the near term, we're marching through the technical steps if you will and that includes finalizing the software. That will go into a series of simulation -- evaluations. There's a near-term milestone that we referred to as the line pilot evaluation that will take that final software and with external line pilots from airlines come in and evaluate the handling quality of the airplane. We'll also have a external set of pilots coming in, again authorized by the regulators that will conduct what we call a Joint Operation Evaluation Board. And that set of pilots will evaluate the training materials. So over the near term those are two key milestones for us. One that evaluates the software update to the airplane; and the second that evaluates the training products. In that same time frame, as those two milestones are completed, we'll roll into the certification flight that I mentioned earlier. That will be another key milestone for us. And then after all of the assessments are completed, those evaluations are done, that will roll into the Airworthiness Directive decision that the FAA will make and that other regulators will make. Subsequent to the issuance of the Airworthiness Directive and the ungrounding of the airplane, then we would move into the phase of ungrounding the aircraft and incrementally bringing up fleet operations for our airline customers. And the reference points that you're seeing out there from our customers are perfectly aligned with the detailed technical plan that I just walked you through. So they're very aware of that plan. And there is a time period between the airworthiness directive and when they can resume full operations, revenue-bearing operations. And that includes bringing each individual airplane up, making sure that each airplane is safe and ready to perform. We've been working, as we've been storing airplanes to ensure the health of those vehicles, but we'll be working tail number by tail number with our customers to ensure they can bring the fleet up back successfully and then get back to full revenue-bearing operations. And that's why you see a bit of a time lag between the Airworthiness Directive and what our customers are now quoting as going operational dates. So, hopefully that gives you a feel for the time phasing of the plan. And ultimately, bringing all of those grounded airplanes back up and all of those stored airplanes back up to fleet operations will be a multi-quarter operation. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Rajeev Lalwani : Hi. Good morning. Dennis, Greg, staying on the 737, maybe moving at a slightly different direction. In terms of the backlog, it's obviously remained stable here over the last couple of quarters. But with the easing backdrop in some of the MAX issues, have you not seen a wave of interest in cancellations? Maybe just talk more about that dialogue with customers. I mean, at a minimum, it seems like advances are pushing out. Obviously, the orders aren't there, et cetera. So want some color. Dennis Muilenburg : You bet, Rajeev. We've been having a good productive conversations with our customers around the world. We're engaged with them daily, keeping them abreast of the progress we're making on the safe return to service. We've seen continued strength in our backlog, stability in that backlog. Our customers still, around the world, see the value of the 737 MAX and they know what it will ultimately bring to their operations. So that backlog of roughly 4,400 aircraft has remained solid and stable. We have had discussions with customers who, given time lines and fleet needs, may want to move skyline positions. In some cases, model differences or model trades are options. So as we think through customer compensation models, as you know, we're having those discussions with our customers. There is some trade space around delivery profiles in skyline positions. But all of that within the context of what I think, overall, is a very stable backlog position and we continue to see strong customer commitment around the globe. Rajeev Lalwani : Thank you. Operator : Next we'll go to Rob Spingarn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead. Rob Spingarn : Hi. Good morning. Dennis Muilenburg : Hi. Rob. Rob Spingarn : Greg, with regard to the concessions not changing ,no material change there, it does seem, and to the prior couple of questions, that we have slipped to the right for RTS, at least from October to likely December. So I wanted to see why we wouldn't see a change there, because it certainly adds a couple hundred delayed airplanes. And then the other part of it is, how aligned are the customers on this concession figure? If I understood correctly last time, they had not necessarily endorsed the figures that were in the 5.9 billion. Greg Smith : Yes. Rob Spingarn : Those weren't necessarily based on agreements with them has that changed? Greg Smith : Yes. No. So, Rob, I would say, there's a lot that goes in that. So multiple data points, obviously, going into that and we assess it on a regular basis and obviously go through that quarter-by-quarter. So that could change, obviously, with time. So our discussions with our customers, the methodology, their expectations and kind of working through customer-by-customer the impact on them and then ultimately a form of settlement continues to be a regular dialogue and it will be. So we did not see a change in what we have for a liability this quarter. That does not mean that we won't -- could not see a change going forward. This is part of our regular, I'll say, closing process that we will go through every one of those in what's outstanding and assess what we believe is the liability, again, based on multiple data points including conversations and overall, I'll say, kind of impact that they have experienced. But we don't, again, expect significant change in that. But, again, we assess it every quarter. Rob Spingarn : Thank you, Greg. Greg Smith : You're welcome. Operator : And next we'll go to Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much and good morning. Dennis Muilenburg : Hi, Seth. Seth Seifman : Greg, sorry, I definitely appreciate that you guys aren't giving guidance right now. But just in terms of thinking about the cash trajectory going forward, nearly $3 billion of cash burn in the quarter, plus $1 billion for the dividend. Do we think about something similar in Q4? And I would assume that Q1 will still have some challenges in it. There's some cash on the balance sheet, but some of that is earmarked for Embraer. You talked about the potential maybe to still have additional balance sheet levers. Can you talk a little bit more, maybe even just in broad numbers, about the near-term liquidity and balance sheet profile and what you expect to do? Greg Smith : Yes. Well, look, over the short term, as you know, on a quarterly basis, just through timing of expenditures and just through advances, that varies significantly or can vary significantly. So I would not take necessarily one quarter and apply it to the next, as you know. So we've got key milestones in the fourth quarter around advances, around deliveries and of course within our defense business as well. So there's a lot of puts and takes in there Seth. But that RTS assumption and then that production rate increase in delivering those units, again off of our ramp, are real key drivers to cash going forward. So, if those assumptions and our estimates change, that profile obviously will change resulting in that. So that's the near term, I'd say movements. Beyond that, if you went outside of MAX again, the services business, defense business is doing a nice job on their working capital. We're reprioritizing spending as we navigate through this. And as I said, we do have additional balance sheet levers. If we need to pull additional levers, we'll do that. We don't see that over the short term. But we're again managing this prudently, best we can and running various scenarios to really kind of understand our banding around liquidity and taking some proactive actions internally as well as in the debt markets. And we'll continue to do that, again, until we have final RTS and then start delivering airplanes. Seth Seifman : Operator : Next we'll go to Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hunter Keay : Thanks for taking me on. Good morning guys. I'd like to talk a little bit about 777X certification process. If you decide -- I don't think you've said whether you're going to go derivative or new type yet, but how does that decision impact the -- not only the process itself, but the operating economics for the airline customers when they consider the benefit; like training costs and things like that of a derivative versus a new type? Thanks. Dennis Muilenburg : Yes. Hunter on that point, we're continuing to work through the certification and development process and -- with the FAA. The key is going to be any process updates that we might learn from the 737 MAX, any revisions to the certification timelines or procedures, we're thinking through that and any lessons learned that we might have, any applications we might want to make to the 777X. As I said we're continuing to march towards our first flight early in the coming year and then EIS now we're looking at first delivery early in 2021. And we'll be thinking through all the details of that certification plan with the regulators over the next many months. And again, if there are any updates to the plan or any of the requirements, we'll be sure to discuss those and factor those into the planning going forward. Maurita Sutedja : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : That will be from Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead. Jon Raviv : Thank you. On that topic Dennis, again, bigger picture it's been a while with the MAX grounding. You've seen what it takes to certify and we've seen some of the shortfalls in your previous processes. So just -- over the long term beyond 777X to what extent could the future aircraft development just essentially cost more whether it's engineering testing certification? And in the context and if there's some uncertainty around that, why does it make sense to maintain the current capital allocation priorities? Dennis Muilenburg : Yes. Jon once again as we take a look at our development processes, we're always continuously learning and applying any lessons learned we might have from the previous programs. And certainly through the process of the MAX development and flight testing and everything that we're proceeding with right now to get to safe return to service, anything we're learning from that process is factoring into all of our development programs going forward. We're taking a hard look at our safety review board processes our certification processes. We're going to take a look at flight deck designs for the future. All of those things will factor into our future development programs. But in terms of our priorities for capital allocation, those priorities haven't changed. As we've always said, our number one use of cash is investment in organic growth and that continues to be the case. We think that is the best use of our capital. It's the way that we build our future. And we haven't seen anything here that would turn us in a different direction, so we're going to continue to invest in organic growth for the future. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that completes the analyst question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now return you to the Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Ms. Anne Toulouse, Senior Vice President of Communications. Ms. Toulouse please go ahead. Anne Toulouse : Good morning. We will continue the call with media questions for Dennis and Greg. And John we're ready for that first question. [Operator Instructions]. Operator : And first we'll go to Eric Johnson with Reuters News. Please go ahead. Eric Johnson : Hi Dennis, hi Greg. Thank you very much. Dennis Muilenburg : Hi Eric. Eric Johnson : And so the comments you've made is focused on FAA approval, but I wonder how you see the risk of surprise and delays from overseas regulators as they take longer to or ask for more changes. And then separately, I wanted to get some details as you can on why -- on the decision to fire Kevin McAllister? Thank you. Dennis Muilenburg : All right. Eric on your first question regarding international regulators, we've been working hand-in-hand with the FAA on those interfaces throughout this entire process. The FAA has convened something that they call the certification management team which includes Transport Canada, ANAC out of Brazil, and EASA out of Europe. We've been engaged with the regulators in China and -- frankly several dozen regulators around the world. So this is all a highly coordinated process with the FAA's lead regulator role. We've taken some of the same deliverables that I mentioned earlier things like the system description document, things like other certification deliverables and with the FAA's approval have shared those with the international regulators. Those are also undergoing review. So all of this work is being done, concurrently. Now until the reviews are complete, we may have additional actions additional questions from some of these international regulators. As I mentioned earlier, while the coordination is ongoing it could well be that approvals will vary by jurisdiction. And again the regulators will make that decision. Ultimately it will be their time line. But we are and will continue to share the data consistently and transparently with all of the regulators. Our interest here is on the safe return to service of the MAX. That is our focus. And we're working that hand-in-hand with the FAA. And we'll continue to support the other regulators, as well. To your second question on our leadership changes, again, our focus here is on ensuring that we continue to field the strongest team we can. And these are decisions that we've made as a company, that are aligned with our leadership plans, our plans to have a strong and growing company for the future. And these changes are aligned with that plan. Our focus is on safety and quality, and performance, and delivering operational excellence. Operator : Our next question is from Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg. Please go ahead. Julie Johnsson : Hi. Good morning. Dennis Muilenburg : Good morning. Hi, Julie. Julie Johnsson : Hi. Hey, would you mind walking us through your expectations for trade ceasefire, between the U.S. and China? President Trump a few weeks ago, hinted at a mega-potential Boeing deal coming with a Phase one agreement. We've been puzzling as to what he was referring to, when he mentioned $16 billion to $20 billion in orders. And I'm also wondering, how we should square that up with the 787 rate cut today. Dennis Muilenburg : Yeah. Julie, good question and as I mentioned, we're continuing to engage with the constituencies in both the U.S. and China on the trade discussions. We've been continuing to inform those discussions. We continue to see, benefit to both countries with a healthy aerospace ecosystem. Here in the U.S., as you know the aerospace industry is the largest exporter. We contribute about $80 billion of trade surplus per year to the U.S. economy. And we are a heavy manufacturing industry. We generate strong manufacturing jobs here in the U.S. China, clearly needs the airlift capacity. Of those 44,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years, that I've mentioned about 7,700 of those are in China. And so there's mutual interest in both countries that we continue to see. I think the recent trade discussions have been productive. They're moving in a good direction. But given the time line, and the fact that we don't have firm orders from China at this point, we're within production lead times. And so we have to make the decision on the 787 line which is what you see reflected in our announcement today. We're going to continue to monitor and support the China trade discussions. Those are still very important for the future. But for purposes of our company, we have to be, very disciplined in our production rate management. And we're going to continue to do that. And the decision that we're announcing today is consistent with that discipline. Anne Toulouse : Hey, John, we have time for one last question please. Operator : And that will be from David Koenig with The Associated Press. Please go ahead. David Koenig : Yeah. Thank you very much. Mr. Muilenburg, looking ahead to your congressional testimony next week, I'm curious, how are you preparing for that? What kind of reception do you expect? And will you meet with any families of the passengers from the accident flights, who say they are going to be there? Dennis Muilenburg : Yeah. David, we are preparing for those hearings. Of course, we've been supporting the document requests from the committees both the Senate and House. And we're going to continue to do that. We welcome the discussion and the questions. And I'm looking forward to participating in those hearings. I anticipate there will be tough questions, challenging questions, a lot of scrutiny. And frankly, we support the scrutiny on the work that we're doing. I think everybody here is aligned on, the objective of a safe aviation system for our country. And I know that's the interest of the committees. That is clearly the interest of our company. And I look forward to participating in those hearings and talk about what we're doing, all again with a focus on safety. And that's our culture. That's what our company is about. And I hope to represent that, represent it well, at the hearings next week. And as I mentioned earlier, our sympathies continue to go out to the families and loved ones of those that have been affected by these accidents. That will never go away. And I anticipate that some of those families will be represented next week. And I hope to be able to express my sympathies to them, as we're at the hearings. Anne Toulouse : Okay. That concludes our earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. For members of the media, if you have further questions, please call our team at 312-544-2002. Thank you again.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst question-and-answer session, are being broadcast live over the Internet. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I am turning the call over to Ms. Maurita Sutedja, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Ms. Sutedja, please go ahead. Maurita Sutedja : Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. I'm Maurita Sutedja, and with me today are David Calhoun, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Enterprise Performance and Strategy. Dave will start with some opening comments and hand it over to Greg to address the business environment and our financial results. After management comments, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. And as a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com. Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections, estimates and goals we have included in our discussion today are likely to involve risks, which are detailed in our news release and our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures. Now I will turn over the call to Dave Calhoun. David Calhoun : Thank you, Maurita. Good morning to everyone. I'll state the obvious. I've been here 2.5 weeks, and this is my first earnings call as the President and CEO of the company. While I'm new to the CEO role, I am certainly not new to the company and have long admired the business, the products that we build and the people that serve the company. It's a very challenging moment for Boeing. We got a lot of work to do. But I'm confident that we'll manage this situation in the right way, and I'm optimistic about the company's future, both in terms of the markets that we serve and maybe more importantly, the engineering and technical capabilities we bring. Before we proceed, let me just say to the families and the loved ones of those who perished in the Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accidents, we -- I am truly and deeply sorry for your loss. I will repeat this many, many times in the years ahead. Their memories will drive me personally to do everything I can to make our airplanes and our industry safer, and I know I speak for all of my Boeing associates accordingly. I've been spending a lot of my first weeks meeting, connecting with, listening to my Boeing teammates across the country. What I'm seeing and hearing is that our employees are incredibly proud to work at Boeing, but they're also hurt and disappointed that we've let our stakeholders down. Together, we're committed to getting back on our front foot, learning with humility and building on the powerful legacy they and their predecessors have created over the last century. This includes engaging with one another and our stakeholders with greater transparency, holding ourselves accountable to the highest standards of safety and quality and incorporating an outside-in perspective on what we do and how we do it. To that end, I've also been reaching out to important external stakeholders, I know you know that, including our customers of our 3 businesses; our supply base, our supply chain, which is under stress; business partners; and finally, maybe most importantly, regulators. I look forward to engaging with many others with whom I have not yet had the opportunity to meet with in the weeks and months to come. All of these conversations that I have had and I am certain the ones I will have are laced with support for our company, the important work that we do and the importance of what we do for the country. We will be transparent in everything that we do as we move forward. I want to express my personal thanks to everyone who has been our partner in this journey. We're mindful that these are challenging times for many, and we remain grateful for your support. Before going through my initial priorities for 2020, let me share a brief history of my interactions with Boeing. I've known Boeing since the year 2000 when I started with GE's aircraft engine business. And we are engaged in the development of a new centerline engine for the long-range 777, capable of delivering 115,000 pounds of thrust to the airframe. That was the first of its kind. When you're on the wing, you are on the team. Given this history, the 777X first flight on Saturday not only was a major milestone and a proud moment for the company, but also has a significant meaning for me. I've watched the development of the 777 series from the very first engine to the new wing tip on the 777X and see it as a proof point of Boeing's engineering and technology prowess. Shortly after leaving GE, I returned to Boeing when Jim McNerney invited me to join the Board in 2009. As a Board member of Boeing with institutional knowledge of the business, I was able to develop my initial priorities right away in my first week. We can turn to the second slide, please. First and foremost, our primary focus continues to be returning the 737 MAX to service safely. This includes following the lead of our regulators and working with them to ensure they're satisfied completely with the airplane and our work. The FAA and the global regulatory authorities will determine the timeline for certification and return to service, and we remain fully committed to supporting this process. Our job is to ensure that every requirement is fulfilled, every question from the regulators answered. We'll get it done, and we'll get it done the right way. As you well know, over the last year, the entire Boeing Board has been actively engaged in helping to resolve our current challenges and enhancing our governance and safety oversight. These actions included establishing a Board Safety Committee and realigning and elevating safety management and engineering organizations across the company. These organization design changes will shine bright lights on the safety process and the engineering disciplines that underlie them. As previously announced, we've also decided to temporarily suspend the 737 production beginning this month. We believe this decision is least disruptive to maintaining long-term production system and supply chain health. We will work closely with our supply chain to ensure we are ready to safely and smartly return to production. Similarly, public, customer and stakeholder confidence in the 737 MAX is critically important to us. And with that focus, we've decided to recommend simulator training combined with computer-based training for all pilots prior to return to service. Our singular priority is safety, and every decision, every action, every step we take as we move forward will be guided by it. As we mentioned last week, we're currently estimating that the ungrounding of the 737 MAX will begin mid-2020. This estimate is informed by our experience to date with the certification process. It is subject to our ongoing attempts to address known schedule risks and further developments that may arise in connection with the certification process. It also accounts for the rigorous scrutiny that regulatory authorities are rightly applying at every step of their review of the 737 MAX's flight control system and the Joint Operations Evaluation Board process, which determines pilot training requirements. It is important to emphasize that this estimate should not be interpreted as an attempt to influence or interfere with the FAA and other regulators' absolute authority to determine the timing and conditions of return to service. Very simply, accurate financial reporting requires that we provide our latest and most informed schedule. Similarly, our supply chain, in the name of transparency, requires a schedule to perform up to its standard. Moving on to rebuilding trust, which I briefly touched on earlier. We recognize that many of our stakeholders are rightly disappointed in us, and it's our job to repair these vital relationships. We'll do so through a commitment to transparency in everything we do and by meeting or exceeding expectations. We will listen, we will seek feedback and respond appropriately, urgently and respectfully. Our culture is centered around strong shared value, safety, quality and integrity. Every day, we will recommit to these and foster an inclusive environment that embraces oversight and accountability and puts these 3 core principles above all else. We will listen and resolve real-time any all employee concerns pertaining to safety or other of our shared values. We will also focus on operating with excellence. We must get back to basics : delivering safe products and services to our customers while continuously improving our quality. We will complete our work in station wherever we are and whatever we do, and we will do it to the highest standards. We are committed to do it across our Commercial, Defense, Space & Security and Services businesses. This is not relegated to just the MAX or the 737. This requires a focused approach and simplification in everything we do to ensure we deliver on what matters most with accountability. We will restore production health, both within the Boeing's 4 walls and the industry at large. We'll keep taking steps to manage our supply chain health and maintain workforce expertise across the enterprise so that, in particular, with respect to the 737 MAX, we'll be ready to restart production, increase rate safely, smartly, disciplined and with the highest standards of quality. While doing all of these, we will not lose sight of the importance of investing in our future. Our markets are growing. Customer demand is evolving. The competition is increasing, and technology is advancing at a pace we've never seen before. Boeing must keep innovating to succeed. We'll continue to invest in our global workforce and new processes, new technologies that will help us become safer, more efficient as we define the future of aerospace. This work includes preparing for the first Starliner crewed mission, continuing to progress the 777X and the 737 MAX 10 and further growth of our global services business and full implementation of our Embraer partnership. That said, there are always some investment reprioritizing and streamlining that we can do, and we will. We'll take the time to reassess our product development strategy in a fairly methodical way. I think that's a natural course for any new incoming leader to take. We'll return to this topic in future discussions. This is not intended to delay, simply to refresh. By focusing on these priorities and unleashing our talent, I'm confident we have the right foundation to keep the business strong, to keep it healthy while navigating this very difficult moment. Before I turn it over to Greg for an update on the business environment and our performance, I want to pause and thank him for the leadership he has provided throughout this challenging time and for so ably filling the CEO role during the transition. Everybody here knows we've had a number of leadership changes over the past few months, including me. The strong teams we have supporting our leaders have provided the stability we need and paved the way for seamless transitions. But Greg has set in motion some of the changes we need to see, and he has led it with real skill. He will continue to be my partner, and we will lead the company together. I'm excited now to be working alongside him and the rest of our senior leaders. And now I'll turn it over to Greg. Gregory Smith : Great. Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everybody. As many of you know, I've had the distinct pleasure of knowing Dave for a long time. And we're extremely lucky to have him in the chair, helping us navigate through these challenging times and the path forward. I have a lot of respect for Dave and look forward to the continued partnership. And I can tell you, we are completely 100% aligned on our priorities and the path forward for our company. Let's now move to Slide 3, and we'll discuss our overall business environment. We continue to be operating in sizable sectors that are growing and backed by strong fundamentals with a combined market opportunity of $8.7 trillion over the next 10 years. We continue to see healthy global demand for our offerings in Commercial, Defense, Space and Services. However, we are starting to see some pressure, such as in the cargo market, that we will continue to monitor going forward. In Commercial Aviation, although we've seen some moderation in passenger traffic this year, we saw growth of a solid 4.2% through November. The fundamentals remain intact. However, the impact of the coronavirus on near-term traffic growth is clearly a watch item this year. On the air cargo side, volumes have contracted due to challenging trade environment, and improvements in industrial production and global trade will be key to rebound the air traffic cargo market in 2020. We will continue to see steady utilization of global freighters while carriers are placing incremental orders to support their fleet replacement needs, but this is definitely something we're keeping a close eye on. In the narrowbody segment, although the MAX grounding has presented us with near-term challenges, the depth and breadth of our backlog affords us the time to assess and mitigate the longer-term implications. Our 737 program has a backlog of approximately 4,400 aircraft, and we continue to see these new airplanes creating capacity for growth and provide required replacement for older, less efficient aircraft. Clearly, our narrowbody delivery market share has been and will continue to be impacted by the MAX. Although we've not seen a direct impact on the value proposition of the 737 MAX in the marketplace, we will continue to monitor the market dynamics this creates. The limited production slot availability of aircraft from both Boeing and our competitor affords us ample time to double down on improving operating efficiency in order to mitigate some of these challenges the program is facing in the near term. With regards to the middle of the market aircraft, as Dave noted, we are reprioritizing and streamline some of our investments. We've asked the team to step back and reassess our commercial product development strategy to determine what family of airplanes will be needed in the future. The team will build on the work we have done as part of the NMA design and production system analysis as we move forward. In the widebody segment, we saw solid order activity in 2019 for the 787 and 777 families. However, as we mentioned before, in the near term, the global trade environment has presented challenges for our widebody production plans, in particular, the 787 program. As part of our process, we're continually assessing the environment to determine if any further rate adjustments are required. We previously announced that we will transition the 787 production rate from 14 per month to 12 per month in late '20. As we're in the planning window of a rate decision and to reduce risk in the '21 and 2022 skyline, we've decided to further reduce the rate to 10 per month in early '21 before returning to 12 per month in 2023. We're pleased with the recent announcement of a Phase 1 deal between the U.S. and China, and we're proud that Boeing airplanes will continue to be part of this valued relationship. Progress on the trade deal is obviously very encouraging, and we will continue to work closely with our customer and awaiting details of access to the implementation of our backlog and how this will fit into our skyline given production lead times. In the meantime, we think it's prudent to take a more measured approach to our 787 future production rates. We will continue to maintain this disciplined rate management process going forward, taking into account a host of risks and opportunities. We will also continue to assess the demand environment and make adjustments as appropriate in the future. Turning to 777X. We successfully completed the 777X first flight last week. The test fleet, which began ground testing at Everett last year, will continue its rigorous test program over the months -- over the coming months to demonstrate safety and reliability. This is a comprehensive series of tests and conditions on the ground and in the air to evaluate flight controls, aerodynamic performance and cabin environmental controls, among many others. We're currently expecting first delivery of the 777-9 to be in 2021. We continue to expect the 777 delivery rate to be approximately 3 per month in 2020. Progress on the 777X will be the primary driver of future delivery rate for the combined 777, 777X program. We will take a measured approach to the 777X rate ramp, and we will look to minimize the amount of change in corporation work by managing the number of aircraft produced prior to entry into service. On the 777, as I discussed earlier, we will continually closely monitor the cargo market and carefully manage our skyline. Finally, as we previously announced, we are in the process of starting to transition the 767 production rate from 2.5 to 3 per month. At Defense, Space & Security, we continue to see solid global demand for major platforms and programs. In addition, the FY '20 enacted budget provide support for a broad range of products, including procurement of the F-15EX. Our portfolio remains well positioned with proven world-class platforms to address current needs and innovative, capable and affordable new franchises to build the future. We are maintaining a sharp focus on our future franchise programs such as the MQ-25, the T-7A Red Hawk and the MH-139A Grey Wolf, while working to ensure strong performance on existing platforms, especially our U.S. Air Force KC-46 program and our space programs, including Commercial Crew and Space Launch Systems. Last month marked a significant milestone for the Commercial Crew program with an uncrewed orbital flight test of the CTE -- or CST-100 Starliner. However, as reported, this test was abbreviated due to anomalies experienced during the mission for venting the docking with the International Space Station. NASA is in the process of reviewing the data from our December 2019 mission, and the uncrewed mission, including docking to the space station, became part of the company's contract with NASA. And NASA's approval is required to proceed with a flight test with astronauts on board. Given this obligation, we are provisioned for another uncrewed mission, and you'll see this crew impact reflected in BDS financial results. Turning to the Services sector. The $3.1 trillion services market over the next 10 years is a significant opportunity for our company. We continue to see growth with expanded service offerings of our supply chain portfolio and our global digital solutions. The MAX grounding has had impact on BGS growth in 2019 by pushing back the timing of some service demand from our airline customers who have been impacted by the grounding. We expect much of this to be resolved over time. Given the backdrop of demand, the healthy supply chain ecosystem is critical to sustain production system stability. Some of the suppliers have had challenges with production rate changes in the past. And therefore, we are extremely engaged and especially as we navigate the current MAX grounding and production rate outlook. Suppliers' health and rate readiness will be critical as we assess production rates going forward. Let's now turn to Slide 4 for our full year results. Our financial results continue to be impacted by the 737 MAX grounding. Revenue, earnings per share and operating cash were materially reduced. Our revenue of $76.6 billion reflects the 737 MAX impacts, partially offset by higher service volume. Core earnings per share was negative $3.47 for the full year, and operating cash was a negative $2.4 billion, again, primarily due to the 737 MAX impacts. Let's now move to our quarterly results on Slide 5. During the quarter, we recorded revenue of $17.9 billion, core operating -- core earnings per share of negative $2.33 and negative $2.2 billion of operating cash. Before we discuss segment performance, let me go over 737 MAX financials in more detail. Turning now to Slide 6. In preparation for our fourth quarter financial statements, we made certain assumptions, including timing of resumption of delivery, production rate and ramp-up profiles. Again, let me reiterate, it is the FAA and the global regulators who will determine the timing and the conditions of return to service. We've assumed that the regulatory approval for the 737 MAX will enable deliveries to begin in mid-2020. We've also assumed that as a condition of return to service, regulators will require 737 MAX pilots to undergo combination of computer and simulator training. We've assumed that we will resume 737 MAX aircraft production at low rates in 2020 as timing and conditions of return to service are better understood. And then we expect to gradually increase previously planned production rates over the next few years. We're also assuming that the 737 MAX airplanes produced and stored during the grounding will be delivered over several quarters, with the majority of them delivered during the first year after resumption of deliveries. Any changes to these assumptions will require us to recognize additional financial impacts. In the fourth quarter, we added $2.6 billion of program costs to the 737 program. This is primarily to reflect current assumptions regarding timing of return to service and the timing of planned production rates and reflect the additional time required to produce and complete undelivered aircraft in the accounting quantity. These additional costs will be spread across the undelivered aircraft in the accounting block of approximately 3,100 units and, therefore, reduce the 737 program margin. Adding these to the program costs brings the total cumulative program impact to $6.3 billion. In addition, the suspension of the 737 MAX production means that some costs must be recorded as abnormal production costs under U.S. GAAP. This includes costs related to our decision to maintain the 737 production infrastructure, including labor during the suspension and low rate production. As you may recall, this decision is part of our efforts to sustain the gains in the production system and supply chain quality and health made over the last several months. We currently estimate these abnormal costs to be approximately $4 billion. These costs will be expensed as incurred, primarily in 2020, and you'll see these flow through earnings as period expense starting in the first quarter. Since the portion of these costs deemed abnormal will be the largest when the production rate is 0 and the rates are low, we expect expense to be front-end loaded. During the quarter, we also reassessed our estimate of potential concessions and other considerations to customers for disruptions related to the 737 MAX grounding and associated delivery delays. This reassessment included updating estimates to reflect our most recent assumptions as well as latest information based on engagement with 737 customers. Based on our assessment, we added $2.6 billion to the recorded liability in the quarter. This brings the total cumulative impacts to $8.3 billion net of insurance. As we've mentioned, we're addressing the impact individually customer by customer. We expect any concessions or other considerations to be revised over a number of years, and we continue to see the cash impact to be more front-end loaded in the first few years but, of course, will be dependent upon individual conversations with customers. In 2019, we reduced the liability balance by $1.4 billion through cash payments but also other in-kind considerations. Looking forward, the key drivers of financial impact related to the 737 will continue to be the return to service time line and conditions; the delivery ramp-up, which will be dependent on how fast we can deliver the aircraft once the fleet returns to service and how fast our customers can accept aircraft; and the duration of the 737 production suspension and rate ramp profile; and discussions with customers regarding potential concessions and other considerations. We expect our financial results to continue to be adversely impacted until we safely return the 737 MAX to service, resume deliveries to customers and ramp up production rates. We continue to perform detailed scenario planning around return to service and production rates, including analyzing the implications on our supply chain, customer fleet and deliveries to fully understand the range of financial outcomes. We're also taking actions to prudently manage our liquidity, increase our balance sheet flexibility, manage our spending and stay laser-focused on productivity. I'll talk more about that a little later. Let's now move to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 7. Our Commercial Airplane business revenue decreased to $7.5 billion during the quarter and operating margin declined to negative 38%, both reflecting 737 deliveries and additional $2.6 billion of estimated potential concession -- customer concessions and other considerations. BCA backlog includes 5,400 aircraft valued at $377 billion, equating to more than 6 years of production. Let's now move to Defense, Space & Security on Slide 8. Fourth quarter revenue decreased to $6 billion, reflecting lower volume across the portfolio as well as the impact of previously mentioned Commercial Crew charge, which affected revenue recognition on the program. BDS operating margin of 0.5% reflected a $410 million pretax charge to provision for the additional uncrewed mission for the Commercial Crew program as well as several performance items and the mix within the portfolio in the quarter. During the quarter, BDS won key contract awards worth $8 billion, and our backlog now stands at $64 billion with 29% from outside the U.S. Let's now turn to Boeing Global Services results on Slide 9. In the fourth quarter, Global Services revenue decreased to $4.6 billion, reflecting lower commercial service volume. Year-over-year growth of 8% is lower than we expected partially due to the impact of the 737 MAX grounding, which affected the timing of demand of some of our service offerings. BGS operating margin of 14.7% reflect a noncash charge related to retirement of the Aviall brand as we consolidate our distribution businesses under the Boeing brand as well as mix of products and services in the quarter. We were partially offset by a onetime gain on a divestiture. During the quarter, BGS won key contract awards worth approximately $6 billion, which brings its backlog now to $23 billion. Let's now turn to cash flow on Slide 10. As I mentioned, operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was a negative $2.2 billion driven by lower 737 deliveries, lower advanced payments, higher inventories and timing of receipts and expenditures. We expect continued cash flow pressure from the MAX impacting until production stabilizes. Strong operating cash flow from other parts of the business and further balance sheet levers will help provide adequate liquidity during this time. We also continue to look at all aspects of spending to ensure we have the right prioritization and sharpen our focus on operational excellence, including closely assessing the timing of noncritical expenditures. Additionally, we're accelerating key working capital initiatives to help navigate this difficult period. During the fourth quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividend, and our share repurchase program remains on pause. Near term, managing our liquidity and balance sheet leverage are top priorities and will continue to be until the MAX deliveries resume, we execute the 737 production rate increases and see stability in the production system. But as Dave mentioned, we will also continue to make necessary investments in the business, in our people, new technology and better processes and tools. Our debt level has been elevated during the grounding, and we are planning to immediately reduce it once our cash flow generation returns to a more normalized level. Again, we will continue to evaluate all available liquidity levers as we navigate the current challenges. Investing in our business and repaying debt will remain our cash deployment priority for the next few years. Let's now move to cash and debt balances on Slide 11. We ended the quarter with $10 billion of cash and marketable securities. We raised additional commercial paper in the quarter, increasing the debt balance to $2.6 billion and helping shore up our liquidity position as we work through the current MAX challenges. Our strategy of maintaining a strong balance sheet and providing us with substantial borrowing capacity through capital markets access of our credit facility of $9.6 billion. Additionally, we've received commitment from a syndicate of banks sufficient to entry into $12 billion term loan facility. Based on the strong demand, the size of the facility could exceed this amount when the transaction closes in February. We are mindful of the impacts the additional debt has on our credit ratings. Currently at A-, A3, but confident we have the sufficient balance sheet flexibility and operational levers to navigate this challenging time. Our financials this year will continue to be negatively impacted by the MAX. Cash flow, in particular, will be more significantly impacted in 2020 than 2019. We expect the use of cash flow in 2020 to be greater than '19, primarily due to 737 MAX advanced payments will be lower in 2019 based on our latest 737 delivery assumptions. As I mentioned previously, we're increasing our customer consideration liability and expect the cash impact to be higher this year. Also, due to the additional 787 production rate reduction, as I discussed, as well as our current 777X entry into service assumptions, widebody receipts will be a headwind in 2020. Keep in mind, we'll continue to see expenditures on the 737 program despite the production suspension as we invest in the production system health to derisk our future production rate. And these investment decisions, including keeping our workforce in place and continuing to make payments to our supply chain for inventory, are examples of our focus on long-term stability but will require cash in the near term. Given these headwinds and our current assumptions on 737 MAX return to service as well as future production and delivery rates, cash flow recovery is now expected to start until 2021. We are committed to providing you with additional updates on the MAX return to service progress and production rate plans as we have more information. Once we have further clarity, we will schedule a follow-up investor and media conference call to discuss the financial implications and provide financial guidance, which will capture the puts and takes, including the impact of the most recent widebody changes. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dave for some closing comments. David Calhoun : Greg, thanks. Thanks to everyone on the other end of this line. I want you to know I'm as excited as I can be about taking on this challenge. I wish the moment was different, but we can get through this moment and we will get through this moment. I'm confident in this airplane. The MAX is a sound airplane. We believe we're going to deliver the safest airplane in the sky, and we're committed to do just that and I know our regulator is as well. So with that, and again, open this line up to questions. And I want to thank Greg for the last time since now we're partners. But at any rate, he has really stood tall in this big transition process, and I appreciate it. Gregory Smith : Thanks, Dave. David Calhoun : Thanks. Gregory Smith : I appreciate it. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Melius Research. Carter Copeland : Thanks gentlemen. Can you hear me? Gregory Smith : Yes, we can, Carter. David Calhoun : We can. Carter Copeland : Okay. I wondered if you might expand a little bit on the short comment you made about monitoring the market dynamic for the MAX and not having the value proposition change there. I mean, I guess, are you -- are we referring to sold aircraft or unsold aircraft? And I guess, more broadly, what's your level of confidence that longer term, MAX pricing won't be materially impacted by what you've seen? Or just can you expand on that comment for us? Gregory Smith : Yes. No, Carter, look, I think first go to the backlog. And we've got 4,400 aircraft in backlog, and this has been a very challenging time obviously for our customers, but folks want the airplane. And the value proposition the airplane brings into the market is unchanged. So look, we're in a grounded period, and we realized the strain that's put on the customers. So we're monitoring that closely. But the value proposition of the franchise still remains intact. And like I said, Dave said, the focus right now, safely get this thing back in the air, and we're going to do it one airplane at a time, as Dave has said, and ensure that we have this production system stable as we move up and delivering on our commitments to our customers. David Calhoun : Yes. In the first couple of weeks, when I've talked with most of our large customers, they get to tell me whatever they want. They do still believe in the value prop of this airplane. They believe in everything about the airplane, and it means a lot, but I've heard it firsthand. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from UBS. Myles Walton : Dave, you're coming to the table with a decade of experience seeing the company from the inside. And I just wonder how you've been able to step outside of that familiarity, take an orthogonal view, kind of a different view of what went wrong and reorient everything so that this isn't maybe just changing tone and/or repairing relationships. But maybe it is, or if there's something more needed, how you've been able to step out of that familiarity role. David Calhoun : Well, let me maybe answer that question a little differently because I get a lot of media attention around the idea that I'm somehow an insider. What if I change that a little bit? What if I told you I simply had a front row seat to everything you saw? And so all the things I read and see and hear, make no mistake, they all have an impact, they have an effect, and I get a front row seat. And ultimately, our Board took action as a result of it. And now I'm the one sitting in the operating seat. So I don't want it to be lost on anybody. I know we've got things to work on and changes to make. I treasure my relationship across the industry with customers and with regulators and others. And when they tell me something, I believe them. I always fault to believing them. And so the work we have to do internally to restore all those confidences and, yes, modify our culture, you can bet I'm working on it. I don't think I see it any differently than you probably do. I might put a nuance here and there, but I think I know the job at hand and that's exactly what I'm going to do. I got to restore trust, confidence and faith in The Boeing Company. Myles Walton : And from that orthogonal view, do you think there is a deficiency in competitive narrowbody offering in the market? David Calhoun : Say that again? Myles Walton : Do you think there's a deficiency in your competitive narrowbody offering in the market today? David Calhoun : Yes. No, I don't. I know that in airplane type by type, sometimes you got to lead, sometimes you don't. But in the family and ultimately the performance of this MAX and the feedback I get from our customers, I'm not actually worried about that. All that said, we're in the airplane development business, and we're going to stay in the airplane development business. So we're going to keep looking at what the next one needs to be. I want to make sure everyone understands that me not immediately signing up to the NMA is not -- is me not wanting to do new airplanes. We'll do one. And I don't want to even suggest or convey to you that it's anywhere near the narrowbody fleet we have today. I don't see big deficiencies there. On the other hand, I'm going to -- I'm just simply going to listen to customers and markets. It's been over 2 years since we started that whole discussion. I'm going to refresh it every way I can think of, along with my new commercial airplane leader, and then we'll get out with new news. But honestly, right now, it's all about the MAX, getting it up. And yes, I believe in the product. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Ronald Epstein : Maybe a big picture question for you. You've mentioned a couple of times in -- when you talked to the press before that you're focusing on the culture of the company, right? And so my question is how do you change the culture, it's a big organization? And particularly when you've got a workforce in some places, it might be a bit demoralized given some of the texts and things that went around. I mean that's something we can infer. And since you had this front row seat on the Board of what happened, and this is a question I asked your predecessor that he never really answered, how did we get here? David Calhoun : That's a big question. Yes. So first of all, let's go back to what happened. So the MCAS design failed to deal with a boundary condition in an environment we should have known something about. The regulators made the same mistake. There are engineering disciplines that you can and should apply to that question that I think can get fixed relatively quickly. I don't think culture contributed to that miss. I think simply disciplines did. The question with respect to training recommendations and the horrible IMs that people would like to think all of Boeing writes, really was relegated to a relatively small group of folks, but it wasn't detected. The system didn't apparently listen or watch for things like that, and it didn't react appropriately. And I have to do everything in my power to make sure going forward that it does. Listening starts with leadership, and it starts with me. And I think we need to do more of it. And then slowly, steadily, you change culture. People want to believe in that, and they will. They are all good engineers. They are all -- they all follow disciplined processes. And let's not mistake, this plane, this 777X, tested more technology, tested our patience, tested our disciplines in every way you can think of. And we did it successfully on that first flight, and we will move it through a certification process that will be more rigorous than history has ever seen. And we'll get to that finish line, and we'll fly it. And if you looked at that product and sat near or in or flew in it, you'd be impressed with everything about Boeing, I promise you. So this thing isn't entirely broken. Leaders have a massive role to play in setting culture, setting the stage for how to fix a culture. And I have to demonstrate that one step at a time, every inch of the way. I don't have to convince anybody that safety is in the best interest of every stakeholder and including investors. It is. It's perfectly obvious to everyone. So I have no convincing to do on that front. I will have no competing priorities as we step forward. And so I hate to reduce it to things that's simple, but I think that's what it's all about. Operator : We have a question from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Sheila Kahyaoglu : We talked about clearly a lot of challenges with the MAX grounding, the 787 rate cut and 777 potential delays. I guess how do we think about the longer-term implications of what the Commercial Airplane segment looks like in 2022, whether that's market dynamics, touching on Carter's question, impact of charges and some of that offset by manufacturing processes at Boeing? If you could maybe talk about what 2022 looks like. Gregory Smith : Yes. Yes. Well, I think on the widebody side, we talked about kind of where we see the rate profiles today. And I think, as we said, we think it's prudent, considering the outlook and some of the global, I'll say, trade dynamics and the timing associated with taking a trade deal to a point of actually a delivery in a skyline, we still got some steps to work our way through. So I think we're being prudent here and looking at the marketplace in that time and moderating those rates. Now having said all that, there's still great demand for the widebody franchises, and you see that in the backlog and you see that in the market outlook. So I think the potential there going forward continues to be strong. On the narrowbody, in 2022 under these assumptions we talked about, you're certainly getting back up in rate, but all these investments we've been making during this time of grounding, Sheila, and I think if you saw the line today versus what you saw even a year ago, there's been tremendous activity put in place in tools and processes to have stability for the long term. That ultimately is going to help the overall franchise, our predictability on delivering to our customers on time and a healthier supply chain as a result of it. So that's been a huge level of effort today. But let's face it, that's a long-term play, but it's a really critical one to get in place during this time. So we have that stability and predictability, again, on our delivery profile and then ultimately on our financials. And then during this, we mentioned, we're still making investments. And we're making investments in the productivity as well as on the R&D side. So we're being prudent about it, and we're being -- we're sharpening the pencils. But that, again, is really focusing on the long-term franchise that we have and the potential franchises to come. David Calhoun : I'd like to follow on. I like everything about the portfolio of products that we field, widebody and narrowbody. The trade deal matters a lot. And I believe if it is what I think it is and our Chinese customers come back and we rebuild the relationship we've always had and enjoyed with them, I think that is a major stimulus. Secondly, this industry has been supply chain limited and constrained. And I believe that some of the actions have been taken on Boeing's side of that process. During this pause, some of the readiness questions that we -- I believe, are being fixed. I think that supply chain will begin to alleviate itself, and I don't think we'll be as supply-constrained going forward as we have been to date. And now I'm trying to speak for the industry, not just for us. So I am optimistic from lots of angles, but I think those are the big ones. Operator : Our next question then will come from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein. Douglas Harned : The one thing I'm certain, Dave, is that a decade ago, we could not have predicted we'd be having this conversation. The thing I'd like to look at is the challenges you're looking at BCA. And in the short term, as you said, you're spending time with regulators and customers to support MAX certification. And then over the course of the year, you've also got to deliver on the restart operationally of the MAX, improve efficiency on the 787 as rate comes down, progress on the 777X, and then as you talked about, decide on how Boeing is going to look at what it does next. And I would think you wouldn't want to wait too long to see how you want to compete against Airbus in the back half of the decade. So with all of this on your plate, new leaders across BCA, so how are you prioritizing your time? And when we get to the end of the year, what would you consider a successful outcome on sort of short-, medium- and long-term issues there? David Calhoun : Well, one, Doug -- so thanks for the question. As you said, I remember looking at this chessboard all the way back in 2000. Didn't turn out actually as different with the exception of the MAX pickup, as you might think. We are on a very long cycle world. Getting decisions right is way more important than getting them fast. So I make no mistake about that. The MAX itself has to be my priority over the course of this year. It's important from a lot of points of view. One, the economics of our institution rely in a significant way on it. Rebuilding the relationships with our customers and our regulator in the process of getting the MAX back up is also critically important. We will always be dependent on those relationships. And then finally, with respect to new airplane development, I don't think anybody will enjoy working on that more than I will. I just want to get exactly the right airplane for the market that's out there. And I want to refresh our view as to what it is. The last 2.5 years have been tumultuous. It has tested some of the -- in my view, some of the edges of demand on all types of airplanes. And so we had to learn from that. But I will not hesitate to move forward on it. And I think creating competitive advantage in that next airplane, I think I have more tools to work with than I've ever had in my previous life. So at any rate, I have confidence in all of that. But I don't want to -- going back to your original question, I don't want to confuse anybody in the process. The fact that I will be focused on the MAX, the fact that I will talk about that almost exclusively across Boeing over the course of this coming year is not an indication that I'm going to start anything going forward. It is simply a necessity for us. We got to get it out there, and we have to get our confidence back and get on the front of our feet. And so, again, that's mostly what you'll hear from me, but don't get confused by it, please. Douglas Harned : And if I can, when you look at this year, certainly, financially, this will be a rough year. But when you put all this together, do you have goals you're thinking of and how this should translate into financial goals in 2021 or 2022? Or is it too early to think that way? How do you treat that? David Calhoun : Yes, it's too early to think that way. While I might conjure up a notion here in my head, I'm going to listen to an awful lot of people before I do. And I'm also going to be certain that all the investments that are required to stand up our engineering function, have everybody regain their confidence and, again, simply believe in the safety of every airplane that The Boeing Company puts forward, I don't want to -- I'm not going to jump to that conclusion now. I'm simply going to get through this moment, restore our confidence and then projections will follow. Operator : Our next question then will come from the line of David Strauss from Barclays. David Strauss : I wanted to discuss the supply chain and how you're approaching the supply chain during this call. Greg, you mentioned some of this $4 billion, I guess, is to support the supply chain during the halt. How overall are you approaching -- it doesn't sound like you're telling everyone to halt. Who are you not telling to halt? How much financial support are you going to provide to the supply chain or do you think is needed for the supply chain during this? Gregory Smith : Yes. No, David, I would tell you, it's a one-on-one engagement, and not just them but their suppliers. And so I'll say kind of tiered-down suppliers and understanding the impact that this is having on them and then what levers do we all have in order to help get them through this. And again, with the objective that we're playing a long game, and we want them to come out of this healthier, quite frankly. So each one of them is a little bit different about how we're working and how we're engaging and what type of assistance is needed. Everybody, as you know, has been at a little bit of a different level of production through this. So there's different levels of inventory. So I would tell you, if you went around supplier by supplier, you're going to get a variation of what their build rate is or where they are in inventory. But the engagement with them, I would say, has been very good by our supply chain folks and keeping them informed and trying to get ahead of this, and again, making smart decisions and assisting where we can assist. So, yes, we've got some provisioning in here to help them, and we'll continue to do that, again, with the long-term objective. We need them to be healthy. We want them to be healthy, and we're playing this for the long term. So even some of these productivity things that we've we talked about on the 37, the supply chain team has taken those into the supply chain that, again, ultimately will make them healthier, more stable, more predictable, which is going to be key to our production rates going forward. David Calhoun : I might just add, the -- their rate in return in these early months will be ahead of ours, and that's by design simply because we want the protection in our factories so that we never travel work. That's actually an important discipline that we will reinstall with our MAX line. And they will be the beneficiary to that as they, as I said, accelerated at a faster rate. David Strauss : Can I ask one clarifying question, Dave? I think you mentioned that you see certification -- or for planning purposes, accounting purposes, certification and deliveries resuming in the middle of the year. Or is it cert and then I assume some sort of lag between cert and then deliveries resuming? Gregory Smith : Yes. We've got a kind of time in the midyear time frame, Dave. But like we said, it's going to be a very moderated, slow, I'll say, prudent ramp-up. And as we talked about, priority 1, once the grounding is lifted, will be to start getting those airplanes off the tarmac, the inventoried aircraft, and then slowly bringing that line up in a very methodical way and monitoring stability each step of the way. And when we reach our objectives of stability, then we'll make the next move. But that will kind of be the priority and the time frame associated with that. Now we will -- currently, we're looking at starting the line earlier than the actual lifting of the grounding. But again, think of that as a risk mitigator. We'll look at that during that period of time and our confidence level of getting the grounding lifted, and then we'll start to slowly bring resources back onto the program, keeping in mind that these lines are empty. They're going to be empty. They're empty right now. And so we'll start in position 1, but again, very methodical, start bringing the crews over, get stability and then slowly bring them back into play. But we'll make that decision as we get closer to return to service, but that's the game plan that we see it today. David Calhoun : And if the question relates to this certificates by airplane, which, of course, is going to be a new and very, I think, tightly run process, of course, that involves us and the FAA. And I think we've provided for plenty of room for that process to unfold methodically and not with too much pressure on it. So that's important in the way we've laid out our time line. Operator : We have a question from the line of Jon Raviv from Citi. Jonathan Raviv : In the context of cash being a bigger use in '20 versus '19, certainly understand the moving pieces in BCA, can you talk about perhaps some of the cash generation and the state of the businesses outside of Boeing Commercial, which I think is still a relevant topic here? Gregory Smith : Yes, yes. On BDS, slightly lower than last year. And I'd say a lot of that is timing. It's just around receipt timing and award timing. But outside of that, from an operating -- core operating performance, pretty much on par. But we'll see a little bit of headwind this year. And on BGS, a little bit of headwind but less than BDS, and again, a lot of that is just timing. It's nothing more than that. The core performance-wise or the conversion to earnings to cash, it remains pretty consistent with 2019. But again, the bulk of the variance in cash will be at BCA. Operator : We have a question from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Noah Poponak : I wanted to ask about 787 supply and demand and then also the margins given the changes there. Do you have visibility into the order pace stepping up into the kind of mid-100s per year for a while there? Because even at the 12 a month or the 10 a month and you're still building over 100, but the order rate has been below 100. So I know China is an input but not -- I don't know if China is planning to order that many widebodies that would fill that gap sustainably. And then, Greg, on the margin, on the cash margin, you've talked about being able to continue to increase it just at a slower pace at 12 versus 14. Is that still true or not at 10? Gregory Smith : Yes, yes. Obviously, not at the same, I'll say, slope as it was, but we still continue to see improved cash margin over the profile for all the reasons we've discussed before between supply chain, mix and our own productivity. That story is unchanged. But again, the amount of growth over that period has moderated obviously under these lower rates. On the supply-demand, China is a big deal. Don't mistake it. It's a big deal, and that's a big play in these production rates. Outside of that, as you've seen, when we've been going head-to-head with the 787, we've been winning the marketplace. The airplane continues to bring great economics into the field. And the long-term market outlook continues. When you look at the 20-year forecast, there's still a lot of widebodies and more replacement in there. And the 787 family, I think, is extremely well suited to address that market. And I'd say the one that is probably underserved at this point is the 787-10. I think as we see that replacement market, I'll say coming more within our skyline, I think we're going to continue to see more demand for the -10. It's just an incredible value proposition and machine for our customers, especially considering what is going to be replacing in the market. So China, big watch item. Outside of that, do we have work to do on the skyline? Absolutely. And we're going to play that out one campaign at a time. And we'll continue to monitor, again, our lead times and make whatever adjustments are needed. But as we see it today, we think this is a prudent thing to do, and we have good confidence in the 10 to go into 12 a month. Noah Poponak : Do you expect the China 787 order to come out of Phase 1 specifically? Or do we need to get past Phase 1? Gregory Smith : I don't know at this point. No. I know -- we know that airplanes are a part of the -- certainly, a big part of the trade deal with China. And we'll get into those details when -- between the government and our customers, but we're actually engaged with them. And when we get more clarity on that, then we'll provide it. But at this point, we're -- we don't have model clarity. David Calhoun : There's no reason to believe it has to wait for Phase 2. Operator : We have a question from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : So I realize, obviously, FAA is the decider here. You've made that very clear. But would you care to -- in the spirit of transparency, would you care to share your accounting assumptions for the MAX rate ramp 6 and 12 months after recertification? And then the second part of the question is how can you get comfortable potentially resuming production before certification given all the head fakes that we've had over the last few months or so? Gregory Smith : Yes. Well, maybe on that one, I'll just, again, put a finer point on what the game plan is as we see it. Don't think of that as just turning the line back on. We're going to slowly bring crews back, but we're going to have to have a confidence level -- a higher confidence level in that exact time frame on return to service because, obviously, we don't want to build more airplanes and store them. So that's the game plan as it sits today. But again, remember, the line is empty. So it's going to be in the first position, and that's going to take some time to slowly bring that up. But obviously, we'll have cert flight behind us, which is a big milestone, and that will give us more confidence in our, I'll say, kind of slow introduction of the production line. So that's the game plan on that. As far as rate increases going forward, Hunter, I would just say, look, we got to get this thing back. We got to start delivering on the -- off the ramp and think of the rate increases one step at a time, or as Dave has said to many of us, one airplane at a time. We're going to keep work in position, and we're going to ensure we have stability and equally, if maybe not more important, the supply chain has stability. We'll make the next rate increase. So we've certainly made some assumptions in there, but we are going to do this one at a time. And again, really playing the long game here to ensure we've got stability that is, I'll say, institutionalized, not just with us but all suppliers, and then that will ultimately have a much more predictable production, I'll say, cadence to it and predictability and delivering to our customers. So we'll keep you posted on our rate plans going forward. But at this time, that's kind of the game plan, and we'll give you more clarity once we -- like I said, once we provide guidance and I'll say the moving pieces that will support that guidance. David Calhoun : I just will reiterate because I think it does matter. That philosophy, one at a time, is reflected in what we have built into this set of financials and our expectations. So I hope we can go one at a time at a rate that exceeds those expectations, but we're not going to think about it that way. We're simply going to get to every next airplane. Operator : Please go ahead. Maurita Sutedja : That concludes our question-and-answer session. Thank you for joining the call. Operator : Thank you.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst question-and-answer session, are being broadcast live over the Internet. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I am turning the call over to Ms. Maurita Sutedja, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Ms. Sutedja, please go ahead. Maurita Sutedja : Thank you, John, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's first quarter 2020 earnings call. I'm Maurita Sutedja, and with me today are David Calhoun, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Executive Vice President Enterprise Operation and Chief Financial Officer. After management comments, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question.  As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. And as a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com. Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections, estimates and goals we include in our discussion this morning are likely to involve risks, which are detailed in our news release and our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures. Now, I will turn over the call to Dave Calhoun. David Calhoun : Thank you, Maurita, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by saying I hope you\u2019re all staying safe and healthy during this global crisis. I also want to thank my Boeing colleagues around the globe for everything they are doing to support each other, our business, and our customers during these intensely challenging times. On behalf of Boeing, I'd like to recognize all of the public servants out there from federal, state, and local authorities to frontline healthcare professionals and first responders for the difficult decisions and the personal risks they are making to protect and care for all of us. Let\u2019s turn to the second slide please. The COVID-19 pandemic is a global crisis like no other. This hits home for us personally and professionally. Across Boeing, we\u2019re focused on keeping our people and our communities safe. We\u2019re battling to stop the virus by taking every measure possible including early implementation of virtual work, deep cleaning our work areas, adjusting work patterns, adding visual indicators to increase social distancing and temperature screening stations with no touch thermal scanners, providing access to medical information around the clock, quarantining anyone potentially exposed to the virus, suspending operations where necessary and more. We have doubled our paid leave policy for those who cannot work remotely when their sites are suspended. At sites where we\u2019ve had to temporarily suspend operations, we\u2019ve worked closely with our customers to ensure we maintain critical support for them. And before bringing our teams back to work, we\u2019ve implemented objectives and rigorous steps aligned with federal and state guidance to ensure safe and orderly restart of operations. Earlier this week, we announced that we will resume operations at our Boeing South Carolina site beginning on May 3. This move brings back our final production site that was temporarily suspended as a result of COVID-19. We\u2019re also doing everything we can to support our global supply chain health. A number of our suppliers have suspended or reduced their operations resulting in some supply shortages for our own operations. In some cases, this contributed to our site suspension decisions. We\u2019ve taken mitigating actions where we can, but supply disruption remains a key watch item for us. At the other end of our value chain, we continue to support our commercial airplanes and services customers as their own business slows to a trickle. We\u2019ve also focused on meeting the commitments to our defense and space customers. Given the swift and severe nature of this COVID-19 shock, to preserve the long-term competitiveness of our company as well as our industry, we are intensely focused on ensuring liquidity through the immediate crisis. We welcome that some 26 countries, including the United States, have announced economic support packages worth more than $100 billion specifically targeting the aerospace and airline sectors. The aerospace industry relies on a global shared supply chain, and the aviation sector supports 3.6% of the global GDP, generating more than 65 million jobs worldwide. In the U.S., we applaud the administration and Congress for working together to pass the CARES Act, which will be critical to supporting the nation\u2019s entire aerospace manufacturing sector, which comprises 2.5 million jobs and 17,000 suppliers. We expect that programs coming out of the bill and funding options the government is putting in place will provide support to help the credit markets function again, providing the liquidity that is vital to our industry\u2019s ability to bridge recovery. The $25 billion support package agreed to by the U.S. airlines and the government is a pivotal step toward maintaining the aviation pillar of the U.S. economy. Even a full recovery will take years, not months. Knowing that the U.S. airline industry has critical financial support through the pandemic, allows us to plan our production and services system for the medium and long-term impact on air travel. Greg will go through our liquidity situation in more detail a bit later, but let me just say, we believe that government support will be critical to ensuring our industry\u2019s access to liquidity. We continue to evaluate options in the capital markets as well as funding options from the U.S. government via the U.S. Treasury and various Federal Reserve programs. We\u2019ve also taken other aggressive liquidity steps, including drawing down on a term loan, reducing operating costs, suspending dividend payments, terminating share repurchase authorization, reducing or deferring non-critical spend, and accelerating some progress payment receipts with the help from our defense customers. Additionally, we are working to resize and reshape our business, starting at the top with our leadership structure. We are consolidating roles, simplifying processes, and focusing accountabilities. As part of this reorganization, I\u2019ve asked Greg Smith, who most of you know well to take additional responsibilities leading our enterprise, manufacturing, supply chain, and services functions, in addition to his CFO and strategy roles. Before I turn to our longer-term business environment and the steps we\u2019re taking to prepare for it, I want to call out the selfless contributions Boeing employees have made to the broader fight against the coronavirus. They\u2019ve been producing protective face shields for distribution to healthcare professionals, have flown our aircraft on missions to transport critical healthcare supplies around the world, donated masks, gloves and other equipment, and contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to food centers for people in need and that\u2019s just a partial list. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the attention to the outlook for our industry highlighted on Slide 3. The air travel industry has never seen anything quite like this. The latest IATA forecast projects full-year passenger traffic to be down 48% this year compared to 2019, as global economic activity slows down due to the COVID-19 and the governments severely restricting travel to contain the spread of that virus. Here in the U.S., passenger traffic at this moment in time is down 95% compared to a year ago. Airlines are cutting back operations dramatically. As they assess their businesses, they\u2019re making difficult decisions that result in grounding fleets, deferring airplane orders, postponing acceptance of completed orders, and slowing down or stopping payments. They are also accelerating aircraft retirements and requiring fewer services. The fundamentals that have driven air travel for the past five decades and doubled air traffic over the past two decades remain intact. We believe this industry will recover, but it will take two to three years for travel to return to 2019 levels and it will be a few years beyond that for the industry to return to long-term growth trends. Our outlook is informed by decades of analysis and insights on customer behavior including how the industry has reacted to prior market shocks. We incorporated assumptions related to a prolonged recession and potential consolidation within the industry in our assessment. The picture is dynamic and subject to many unknowns, but as we see it today, narrow-body airplanes will lead the way to recovery trailed by wide-body fleets as airlines progressively bring their networks back online. Therefore, wide-body passenger fleets will likely be more significantly impacted than narrow-body airplanes in the near term. A key driver in both segments will be the rate of retirements of older fleets. We expect our customers to look at their fleet planning strategies differently in light of these dynamics. More than 2,500 aircraft with 20-plus years of service were in active service prior to the crisis. Replacements will not be uniform as airlines will focus on the oldest and least efficient to retire. Some airlines have already made announcements to this effect. Airplanes that we plan to deliver this year will be 25% to 40% more fuel efficient than airplanes that they\u2019re replacing. Our position is helped by the value proposition of our family of airplanes and the diversity of our backlog. This includes our market-leading 787 Dreamliner family, our unmatched cargo line up, the world\u2019s largest and most efficient twin-engine jet 777X and the versatile 737 family. To balance the supply and demand given the COVID-19 shock and to preserve our long-term potential and competitiveness, we have decided to reduce the production rates of several of our commercial airplane programs. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 4. In the narrow-body segment, we have assumed that we will resume 737 MAX aircraft production at low rates in 2020 as timing and conditions of return to service are better understood. We expect to gradually increase the production rate to 31 during 2021 with further gradual increases that correspond with market demand. The slower production rate ramp up reflects commercial airline industry uncertainty due to the impact of COVID-19, and the production rate ramp profile is also affected by the pace of delivery of our stored aircraft. We continue to see our new MAX airplanes creating capacity for growth and providing required replacements for older, less efficient airplanes. We will continue to work closely with our customers to review their fleet plans and make adjustments where appropriate to adapt to lower than planned 737 MAX production in the near term, provide more flexibility to deliver MAX airplanes in our backlog and protect the value of the MAX family. Moving to the wide-body segment. We now plan to reduce the 787 production rate to 10 per month in 2020 and then gradually reduce to 7 per month by 2022. We will continue to evaluate the rate beyond 2022 to balance supply and demand. Our 787 Dreamliner family has a compelling value proposition, offering unparalleled fuel efficiency and range flexibility, enabling carriers to optimize fleet and network performance as well as profitability -- as well as profitably expanding to new markets. Turning to the 777X. We\u2019ve made progress on the 777X certification requirements and have resumed flight testing with the restart of our operations in the Puget Sound. We currently expect first delivery of the 777-9 to be in 2021 and will continue to manage the risks inherent in any development program, especially ones around certification in the post-MAX environment and COVID-19-related impacts. We now expect to deliver 777 at an average rate of approximately 2.5 per month in 2020. And due to the market uncertainties driven primarily by the impacts of COVID-19, we plan to reduce the combined 777/777X production rate to three per month in 2021. We will take a measured approach to the 777X rate ramp as we will look to minimize the amount of change in corporation work by managing the number of aircraft produced prior to entry into service. On the 777, as I discussed earlier, we will continue to closely monitor the cargo market and carefully manage our skyline. Finally, we\u2019ll make no change to the 767 and 747 production rates at this time. These programs are targeted for the cargo market and approximately half of the 767 production line is dedicated to the tanker program. These rate decisions are based on our current assessment of the demand environment, taking into account a host of risks and opportunities. We will closely monitor the key factors that affect our skyline including the wide-body replacement cycle and the cargo market. We will maintain a discipline rate management process and make adjustments as appropriate in the future. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 5. The diversity of our portfolio is unmatched and our government services, defense and space programs will provide critical stability for us moving forward. In fact our work in these areas accounted for 45% of our overall revenue in 2019 that will obviously increase in the year ahead. At Defense, Space & Security, we continue to see a healthy market with solid demand for our major platforms and programs, both domestically and internationally. Despite some near-term production impacts associated with our temporary suspension of operations at various locations, our portfolio of programs and technologies remains well aligned to our customers\u2019 missions. We are also well-positioned with proven world-class platforms to address current needs, and innovative capable and affordable new franchise programs for the future. For example, the President\u2019s budget request for fiscal year \u201921 supports key Boeing programs, including the V-22 and Apache, 12 F-15EX aircraft and 15 KC-46A Tankers. It also requests funding in line with the expected development profile of future franchise programs, the MQ-25, the T-7A Red Hawk and the MH-139A Grey Wolf, and our extra large unmanned undersea vehicle. We have received broad support from the Pentagon for programs and products across the BDS portfolio. We are continuously improving performance of our existing platforms, including the KC-46A Tanker and our space programs. While the tanker program has had delays and other challenges, with this month\u2019s agreement with the U.S. Air Force to develop and integrate a new Remote Vision System, we will ensure that KC-46 becomes the standard by which all future refueling aircraft are measured. Given its 2020 design update, no other tanker will have the technological capabilities of the KC-46. The men and women of the US Air Force have our full commitment, and our investment in tanker reinforces that dedication. Our space teams completed the core stage of NASA\u2019s Space Launch System and learned key lessons from the CST-100 Starliner\u2019s Orbital Flight Test. We will refly this test to demonstrate the quality of the Starliner system, paving the way for future crude flights. It is the right thing to do for our NASA customer and the astronauts who ultimately fly on it. As you may recall, we provisioned for another uncrewed mission in our financials last quarter. On the services side, we are seeing a direct impact on our commercial supply chain business as fewer flights result in a decreased demand for our parts and logistics offerings. Our commercial customers are curtailing discretionary spend such as modifications and upgrades and focusing on required maintenance. We anticipate accelerated retirement of older airplanes, which will result in a newer fleet when air travel resumes to previous levels, which will prolong the period of decreased demand for our commercial services offerings. Similar to Commercial Airplanes, we expect a multi-year recovery period for the commercial services business. The demand outlook for our government services business, which in 2019 accounted for just under half of the BGS revenue, it remains stable. The strength of government services provides a strong foundation for our overall services business. We see growth in a number of government services areas including ramp-ups to support international customers with training, logistics and supply chain offerings as well as growth on key U.S. programs. In summary, our industry is going to look very different as a result of this pandemic and the economic impact it has had on airlines and schedules around the world. The resulting reductions in the BCA production rates I outlined will require us to make similar adjustment in our infrastructure, our spending and our workforce. We will be a smaller company for a while. We\u2019ve worked hard to maintain the stability of our workforce avoiding layoffs even through the suspension of MAX production, doubling the length of time we pay employees impacted by the COVID-induced shutdown of Puget Sound, Charleston and other sites, bringing people back to work at those sites as soon as we safely could. But the sharp reduction in demand for our airplanes that we see out over the next several years won\u2019t support the size of the workforce we have today. At this time, we are taking action to reduce our workforce by approximately 10% of our roughly 160,000 employees by end of this year, through the combination of voluntary layoffs, attrition and involuntary layoffs as necessary. This is 10% of the total for our enterprise. We\u2019ll have to make even deeper reductions in areas that are most exposed to the condition of our commercial customers, more than 15% across commercial airplanes and services businesses, as well as our corporate functions. At the same time, the ongoing stability of our defense, space and related services businesses will help us limit the overall depth of the cut. Of course, we will continue to monitor market conditions closely in light of the unpredictable factors currently driving it and we will make ongoing adjustments as appropriate. We will continuously work to shape our business to compete and what we think the market will look like over the next five years. I shared this news with our employees this morning and I committed to implementing these reductions as fairly respectfully and transparently as possible and to providing as much support for our employees as we can through the duration of the global health emergency we are facing. Before I turn this over to Greg, I want to update you on a couple of other important topics. First, our progress on safely returning the 737 MAX to service. We\u2019re continuing our work on the safe return of the MAX to service working closely with the FAA and other global regulators. Right now, we are focused on completing the software validation and required technical documentation that will precede a certification flight. Some of this documentation work has taken longer than we anticipated and the coronavirus situation has also required some changes to how we do things including working remotely and virtual meetings with our regulators. With that said, we\u2019ve continued to make very solid progress and we currently expect that the necessary regulatory approvals will be obtained in time to support resumption of 737 MAX deliveries during the third quarter. Of course, the actual timing will ultimately be determined by our regulators. In the meantime, we have approximately 450 737 MAX aircraft built and stored and our MAX backlog has remained strong throughout this process at approximately 4,000 aircraft. They are the most fuel-efficient narrow-body planes in the market with useful lives well over 25 years. We have been working proactively with our customers to maintain the health of this backlog, while responding to their needs. Turning to Embraer, we announced Saturday that we have terminated the agreement to establish a strategic partnership between our two companies, covering both the planned commercial and defense joint ventures. We worked diligently for two years to finalize the transaction, but ultimately we could not come to resolution around critical unsatisfied conditions for the deal under our Master Transaction Agreement. It is deeply disappointing but we have had reached a point where continued negotiation was no longer helpful and so we exercised the rights set out in the MTA to terminate the agreement. Looking ahead, we will continue to concentrate on what is most important across Boeing. To that end, I established six company priorities in January. They included returning to the 737 MAX safely to service and earning back trust with our stakeholders. We are also committed to delivering excellence across our businesses and restoring our production health, and we are determined to invest in our future while always living our values. We will not lose sight of the importance of making investments that are critical to our future, such as the continued -- such as continuing to progress on our development programs such as the 777X and the 737 MAX 10.With that, let me turn it over to Greg for an update on our financial performance. Greg? Greg Smith : Great. Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s please turn to Slide 6 for our first quarter results. Our first quarter results were primarily driven by the COVID-19 impacts and the 737 MAX grounding. Revenue, earnings per share and operating cash flow materially reduced. Prior to experiencing COVID-19 impacts, we were tracking well to meeting our original internal first quarter forecast. Our revenue of $16.9 billion, reflects lower 737 MAX deliveries versus first quarter of last year, as well as fewer deliveries in the quarter due to COVID-19. Core earnings per share was negative $1.70 and earnings in the quarter were also impacted by a charge on the KC-46A Tanker program. Before we discuss the segment performance, let me touch on 737 MAX. As Dave mentioned, we\u2019re currently -- have approximately 450 737 MAX aircraft built and stored in inventory. We continue to monitor and maintain these aircraft in a regular basis, including completing more than 1,000 flights over the past year. Also, as mentioned, primarily due to COVID-19 impacts, we\u2019ve revised our assumptions on timing and the profile deliveries from storage and the production rate ramp. Delivery from storage will continue to be priority one, post assisting our customers with their return to service. These aircraft in storage will convert to significant operating cash over the period of time it takes to deliver these aircraft out of inventory. In preparation for our first quarter financial statements, we made certain assumptions, including timing of initial deliveries, production and rate ramp profile. We\u2019ve assumed that we will begin 737 MAX aircraft production at low rates during the second quarter 2020 as timing and conditions of return to service and COVID-19 impacts are better understood. We expect to gradually increase the production rate to 31 during 2021 and expect further gradual increases to correspond with market demand. We\u2019ve assumed that the timing of regulatory approvals will enable the 737 MAX deliveries to resume during the third quarter of 2020. We\u2019ve also assumed that a majority of the 737 MAX aircraft produced during the grounding and included within inventory will be delivered during the first year after the resumption of deliveries, although again at a slower pace than we previously assumed. Again, the slower production and delivery rate ramp reflects commercial airline industry impacts as a result of COVID-19. In the first quarter, we reduced the number of aircraft in the 737 accounting quantity by 400 units as a result of the reduction to plan production rates due to COVID-19. The reduction to the planned production rates will result in further increases in cost to produce undelivered aircraft, primarily due to additional fixed cost absorption. This reduces program margins after deliveries resume. In addition, abnormally low production rates will extend for a longer period once production resumes and as expected to result in around $1 billion of additional abnormal production cost, increasing the total from approximately $4 billion to $5 billion. These will be expensed as incurred, and we expect the majority of these abnormal production costs to be expensed this year. During the first quarter, we expensed $797 million of abnormal production costs. Any changes to these assumptions could require us to recognize additional financial impacts. There is no material change to our estimate of potential concessions and other considerations to customers for disruption related to the MAX grounding and associated delivery delays. In the first quarter, we reduced the liability balance by approximately $700 million, primarily through cash payments. We continue to address the impact individually customer-by-customer, including assessing the impacts of the MAX disruption is having on their operations in light of COVID-19 pandemic. We also continue to expect any concessions or other consideration to be provided over a number of years with the cash impact to be more front-loaded in the first few years. Let\u2019s now move to the Commercial Airplanes on Slide 7. Our Commercial Airplane business revenue decreased to $6.2 billion during the quarter reflecting lower deliveries, primarily by the 737 MAX grounding as well as impacts of COVID-19. Operating margins declined to negative 33.3% due to the following :  Lower delivery volume; $797 million of abnormal costs from the temporary suspension of the MAX program mentioned earlier; a $336 million charge related to the 737 Next Generation frame fitting component also known as the pickle fork and the repair cost associated with that; lower 787 margins primarily due to rate reductions related to COVID-19; and a $137 million of abnormal production costs from the temporary suspension of Puget Sound operations in response to COVID-19. We saw approximately one week impact of these costs in the quarter. We expect to see additional abnormal costs in the second quarter related to suspension of our Puget Sound and also our Charleston sites due to COVID-19 through April and early May. The 787 program margin decreased in the quarter, primarily due to lower planned production rates, which drove additional fixed cost absorption, higher disruption costs, and 100-unit contraction of the accounting quantity requiring us to recognize the remaining deferred balance over fewer aircraft. BCA backlog includes over 5,000 airplanes valued at $352 billion. As Dave mentioned earlier, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted aircraft demand, we\u2019re taking actions as a result of these new realities by adjusting production rates and our infrastructure, which will position us for the future and help us bridge to recovery. These rate decisions are based on current assessment of our demand environment and we will continue to closely monitor these factors that affect our skyline and make rate adjustments as appropriate in the future. Let\u2019s now move to Defense, Space & Security on Slide 8. First quarter revenue decreased to $6 billion, primarily driven by the charge on the KC-46A Tanker, BDS operating margins of negative 3.2%, primarily due to pre-tax charge of $827 million for the KC-46A Tanker, of which $551 million was driven by the cost associated with the agreement signed in April with the U.S. Air Force to develop and integrate our new Remote Vision System, while the remaining costs reflect productivity inefficiencies and COVID-19 related factory disruption. A number of other programs, including the VC-25B, were also impacted by COVID-19 further reducing margin in the quarter. There are provisions of the Care Act in our contracts that may provide an opportunity to recover some of these costs related to COVID-19 over time, and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate them. During the quarter, BDS won key contracts worth $6 billion and our backlog now stands at $64 billion with 28% from outside the United States. Let\u2019s turn to Boeing Global Services results on Slide 9. In the first quarter, Global Services revenue was flat at $4.6 billion, reflecting higher government services volume, largely offset by lower commercial service volume due to the COVID-19. BGS operating margin increased to 15.3% primarily due to favorable government service performance. During the quarter, BGS won key contract awards worth approximately $4 billion, which brings its backlog now to approximately $23 billion. We only saw the beginning of the impact of COVID-19 on our commercial services demand for the first quarter and we expect COVID-19 to have significantly larger impact on the BGS business in future periods. To respond to this changing market dynamic, we are taking a number of proactive steps to right-size and ultimately better position our business for these new market realities, these include employment actions as well as proactively taking steps to right-size our inventory and tailor our portfolio to ensure that we\u2019re positioned to serve our customers both through this challenging time and when the industry begins to recover. Let\u2019s turn now to cash flow on Slide 10. During our last earnings call, we shared that the use of cash flow this year is expected to be greater than 2019. Clearly, COVID-19 has made our cash flow situation even more challenging in 2020. The shift and severe impact it has had on the airlines in the global economy has added significant pressure on our cash receipts. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was negative $4.3 billion driven by the lower commercial airplane delivery volume, advanced payments and impact of COVID-19, and timing of receipts and expenditures. And as discussed, COVID-19 also caused delivery and production disruption in the quarter. Also in the quarter, we spent $428 million on capital expenditures, paid $1.2 billion in dividends which were declared last December, and paid $2.2 billion of debt maturity. COVID-19 pandemic clearly presenting unprecedented challenges for our industry and our company. We\u2019re taking a number of actions to accelerate and conserve cash. In March 2020, we suspended payment of our dividend until further notice. Since April 2019, we\u2019ve suspended our share repurchase program, and in March 2020, our Board of Directors terminated its prior authorization to repurchase shares of the company\u2019s common stock. And as previously mentioned, we have taken actions to reduce production rates in our commercial business, and we have furloughed certain employees, and as Dave discussed, will be taking workforce actions through a combination of voluntary layoffs, attrition and involuntary layoffs as necessary. We have and we will continue to reduce discretionary spending. Also reducing or deferring research and development, and capital expenditures, but we will continue spending in key priorities and technologies that will be critical to our future into our customers\u2019 success. We\u2019re working with our government customers to assess and mitigate any impacts associated with COVID-19 pandemic. We appreciate the steps that the Department of Defense has taken to work with its industry partners to improve near-term liquidity in the forms of increased progress payment rates and reductions in withholds among other initiatives. In pursuit of the CARES Act, we\u2019re also deferring certain tax payments. We are working with our supply chain partners to carefully manage liquidity, but at the same time doing everything we can do to manage the stability and health of our supply chain, as we manage through this demand shock to protect the long-term health of the US aerospace industry. We are focused on the best ways to keep liquidity flowing through our business and to our supply chain with this period. The most important source of liquidity for our suppliers is good credit of the OEM and Tier 1 suppliers. As I mentioned, prior to COVID-19, we were tracking our internal first quarter and full-year forecast. Also as mentioned, COVID-19 is clearly putting additional pressure on 2020 cash flow and we expect operating cash to be more negative in 2020. We also expect a slower cash flow recovery going forward due to the revised 737 MAX delivery profile and the new wide-body production rates. Outside Commercial Airplanes, in commercial services, we expect cash flow generation to be solid and in line with earnings on the government side of our business. Let\u2019s now move to Slide 11 and we\u2019ll discuss liquidity position and finance planning. As previously discussed, we drew down the $13.8 billion delayed draw term loan early to help shore-up our liquidity position as we work through the current challenges. Also in the quarter, we paid down $2.2 billion of debt maturity, resulting in an $11.6 billion increase, bringing the total debt balance now to $38.9 billion. We ended the quarter with $15.5 billion of cash and marketable securities. Again due to COVID-19, our daily use of cash has continued to reduce this balance. We continue to have access to our $9.6 billion revolving credit facility, which to date has not been drawn upon. Given the significant impact of COVID-19 on our operating cash, we are proactively managing our cash position and working to access additional liquidity. We believe the government support will be critical to ensuring our industry\u2019s access to liquidity and we continue to evaluate options in the capital markets as well as funding options from U.S. government via the U.S. Treasury and various Federal Reserve programs. We will continue to review all available access and select the best options for our company. We believe through a combination of our actions and our ability to access additional liquidity, we will be able to obtain sufficient cash to fund our operations. Managing our liquidity and balance sheet leverage are top priorities as we navigate this challenging environment. We plan to immediately reduce our debt levels once our cash flow generation returns to more normal levels. Again, we will not lose sight of making necessary investments in our business, our people, new technology and better processes and tools that are critical to our future. This includes recent organizational change, as Dave mentioned, to simplify and streamline roles and responsibilities and prepare now for the post-pandemic industry footprint. As part of that, I\u2019m excited to take on a new role and work closely with our teams across the business units to drive operational excellence and restore production and supply chain health as we and the broader aerospace industry recover from COVID-19 pandemic and rebuild stronger. The current environment is obviously very challenging and extremely dynamic. We\u2019re staying fully engaged with our customers, continually assessing the changing environment to ensure we have the right-minded about the near and longer-term demand. And as we discussed, we\u2019re taking and will continue to take appropriate action to bridge to recovery. But our company and the U.S. aerospace industry, and the 17,000 suppliers supporting it, can remain healthy and be well-positioned to capture future opportunities when we all emerge on the other side of this crisis. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Dave for some closing comments. David Calhoun : Thanks, Greg. We\u2019re in an unprecedented period for the industry and the world, and I am humbled and privileged to lead the talented people of Boeing. We are and will be taking the right action to navigate through this pandemic, support our workforce, maintain supply chain continuity and stability and position for a changing market. We continue to support our defense customers in their critical national security mission. We are progressing toward the safe return to service of the 737 MAX and we are driving safety, quality and operational excellence into all that we do every day. And through it all, we are keeping the health of our employees, their families and our communities top of mind. We believe the long-term industry fundamentals remain strong and air travel will recover. Our portfolio of products and technology is well-positioned and we\u2019re confident we will emerge from this crisis and thrive again as a leader of our industry. History has proven Boeing is a company that rises to these challenges. With that, Greg and I will be happy to take your questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead. Peter Arment : Good morning Dave, Greg, thanks. Thanks for your time. I don't know whether this question is for Dave or Greg, but maybe just Dave, the pace of deliveries for the stored fleet over once you get back to certification in Q3 over I guess the majority you're going to be looking to deliver over kind of a 12-month period, and then squaring that against the warming up of the production line and trying to get to a target of 31 aircraft, it just seems like a lot of deliveries. Maybe you could just kind of walk us through kind of how you're arriving at that? I know that that's just given the backdrop of what we're seeing in air travel right now. Thanks. David Calhoun : Yes, thank you. Number one, as you probably know and has been reported on widely, we have been having conversations, intense ones for the better part of a month with our MAX customers about delivery and when to take them. And it's -- I would call it a wide variation with respect to what they ask for, some want them right away, some of them want to defer for quite a while. Our assessment is reflected in these numbers based on those interactions. And yes, there's more to be had. But we think it sort of accurately reflects that. And if anything in light of that, now all of the government resources that have been provided to many of the airlines, which a month ago were still in doubt, some of that has settled down. So, now with respect to priorities, our priority will be to deliver the finished goods inventory that we have. And as a result, production rate is the one that we will sort of change based on what happens in the marketplace. Marketplace gets more robust for any reason, we'll increase that rate sooner rather than later. And if it defers and/or gets any worse, we will do the opposite.  So the variable in this is going to be the production rate, and a rate we've chosen now is 31 number, and a slow pace to get to 31 reflects everything we know about the conversations with all of our MAX customers. Operator : And the next question is from Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Rob Spingarn : This one is for you, Greg. Let's say that in the 787 -- seven 787s per month and 31 MAXs in 2022, and I guess three 777s is the new normal. What kind of free cash flow profile would you have with that assuming stable BDS and a reasonable recovery at BGS? I am talking about 2022 now? Greg Smith : Yes, yes. Well, clearly Rob, to Peter's question, today that is the -- I would say the single biggest driver. To your point, we've kind of laid out at least currently how we're thinking about production rates in that timeframe, but the single biggest driver of that will be MAX. And not only priority one delivering off that ramp is being the first step, but then that production rate increased from there. And so, obviously the market\u2019s going to inform us how we can -- if we have the right profile that we've established today based on the numerous discussions we've had with the customer, but that will be the single biggest driver within that period. And then, I'd say outside of that is the 777 to 777X. As you know, 777x\u2019s use of cash this year will peak this year. We expect it to be a use of cash next year, but then it's cash flow positive in the following year. So that transition, that will take place will be key to 2022 cash flow. Obviously, we expect 2022 to be much better than what we're experiencing this year and next, but those will be the real I\u2019ll say key operational drivers that will allow us to get there. Robert Spingarn : But Greg, is there any way to quantify what cash flow looks like with 787 at 7 a month, half of what the peak rate has been, and with the 737 just a little over half, what that targeted mature rate would be? How do we think about what cash flow looks like in that environment? Greg Smith : Yes, Rob, I don't want to get into specifics on that timeframe, because obviously as we sit here today, 2022 feels like a long way away considering what we're navigating, but it'll be -- obviously it'll be positive cash flow in that period from those key drivers. How positive? It will really obviously depend on rates even further going out, and not delivery rates as much it is, but production rates and advances that could impact 2022 positively or negatively depending on where rates go from there, but those would be the big drivers.  And like I said, now with these production rates we've established, that's our best assessment at this time. And that could change, it will size accordingly to do that. But 2022 starts to feel like a more normal year certainly than what we've experienced in \u201819 and what we're going to experience in \u201820. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman : A couple of questions about liquidity and capital structure. I mean you\u2019ve got about 15 billion of cash on the balance sheet, but also about 5 billion of short-term debt and burning cash. Can you talk about the timeline? Can you talk about maybe the $60-billion-plus number for the industry that you guys put out there several weeks ago and kind of what was in that and how you think about it now? And can you talk about whether Boeing needs to be an investment grade rated company? Greg Smith : Yes. Maybe, I'll let Dave address the industry and then I'll follow up. David Calhoun : The $60 billion number of course was put together early in this process, and credit markets were as tight as they could be, and we were trying to assess the fragility of mostly the supply chain frankly, and we do have some weak or soft spots in that supply chain. But with respect to Boeing's role in the health of the supply chain, I think everybody here knows that the real leverage for us is when we are sound and our credit is good and we place orders against all of our supply chains, then in fact that provides the liquidity that they need ultimately to make the adjustments that they're going to make in response to our production rates.  So that in and of itself, whatever ultimately we do and the liquidity we provide to our suppliers is most important. But our number was meant to represent sort of the whole, all of the supply chain, 17,000 suppliers, the tier 1s and the support that the tier 1s might need, and I can't speak to that. And so, again, $60 billion number was in fact an industry number, not a Boeing specific number. Greg Smith : Yes. And then Seth, just on your second part of your question around being investment grade, certainly we would like to maintain being investment grade. And I think as you've heard and seen that we're doing everything possible to do that. But look, the market's probably going to impact that more than anything. Fortunately as we now -- we started that position of strength with our balance sheet, that's allowed us to navigate it. And as Dave and I outlined, we're taking all the right steps to manage liquidity day in and day out and prepare for a recovery on the other side.  But at the end of the day, it's going to be what it\u2019s going to be on the investment grade. But certainly we'd prefer to stay investment grade. And again, I think we're doing all the -- taking all the right actions to try to maintain that. Operator : And our next question is from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Carter Copeland : Just -- Greg, just quickly on the 87, I just want to make sure I heard you right on the block reduction. I think you said 100 units. I wondered if you could just give some color on why to reduce that or there's a lack of visibility around unsold pricing? And then just with respect to that, what that did to the deferred production, I mean it looks like a $2 billion number in the quarter. That would kind of imply that you've shaved that program margin down to a pretty razor thin level. Am I missing something in the math there? Greg Smith : No, I think you got it right. I mean the contraction in the cost base was driven by time. So, it's staying within the five year period that we have on cost basis. So, as a result of producing fewer units that caused us to contract that cost base by a 100 units. I would say even with that contraction, when you look at margin going forward on the 787, even with the lower production rates, net-net on a unit basis, it holds up pretty well. And the real key drivers, that even with the lower volume, like I said, we're going to be impacted by the fixed costs. But you kind of come back to the fundamentals on the backlog and the profile, the program going forward, when you look at model mix, you look at supplier step down and even with our own productivity, it is impacted, like I said, but the not impacted as much as I think some would expect. So I think those fundamentals -- we would ask, don't lose sight of those because there's still a key driver to cash margin on the program. David Calhoun : Maybe one other comment with respect to the market backdrop on the 787, the demand for the 87 is pretty strong. Our issue is, in our assumptions and we think we're right is that the international route structures are going to come back much slower than the domestic ones. And as a result, the 87 suffers for that. But otherwise the airplane's performance, its utilization right now in the marketplace is pretty amazing. So we feel good about the airplane, but this pushover, based on the assumptions we've made, it is what it is. Operator : And next we will go to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Noah Poponak : I wanted to try if at all possible to get precise or more precise on -- it's clearly challenging out there, but just how many of your customers are attempting to revise their position in the delivery skyline? Because the traffic gross numbers and just the way it feels, it looks and feels like you could imagine literally every single one of your customers having a conversation with you about deferring or canceling, but you are maintaining 10 a month on the 87 for the year, which would suggest that's not happening. I'm pretty surprised by that.  You're telling us your conversations with your MAX customers suggest, they still want the airplane, something -- for a decent amount of them, somewhere close to where they originally wanted them. So I don't know if there's any way to quantify, what percentage of your customers are asking to move or just what percentage of your customers are just sticking to what they had previously, what percentage of backlog you expect to be canceled. I'm just trying to get some kind of sense for the degree of turmoil in the immediate term with your customers\u2019 ability to take airplanes? David Calhoun : So let me take a swing at that. First of all, I'm going to assume if we haven't heard from literally all of our customers by now, we will, with respect to what they would like to do. And these discussions are constructive and we do everything in our power to defer when we can swap where we can, et cetera. And remember, a lot of our customers, all of them are invested with respected PDPs that of course we have retained.  So each of these discussions, believe it or not, have been quite constructive and productive. And everything we know about their initial requests are reflected in our new production rates. And it's not to suggest that there isn't risk remaining on the demand side. But we're not looking for rose colored glasses, we're actually doing quite the opposite, which is to meet as many of these requests as we can, negotiate outcomes where we can and we have a whole bunch of them. And then reflect that accurately in the production rates in the forward view and that is exactly where we sit.  So anyway, it's surprising. But the one thing that's probably surprised me a bit is the extent to which this will accelerate fleet rationalization in the customer base. You know this scenario, we went from a robust growth environment, where even if they had plans to retire a portion of their fleet, they couldn\u2019t do it simply because the market wasn\u2019t robust as it was, and they've now gone to the polar opposite. And so this is that moment where rationalization efforts get big. And believe it or not, in some cases, it even requires that maybe new airplanes they ordered, simply to rationalize the fleet that they're trying to put out of business. So this is a very interesting set of dynamics. The fleet planning efforts are in full swing for everybody. And again, I think we've reflected everything we know. Noah Poponak : Dave, when I went to look up how much of the market is sale leaseback, I reminded myself -- I was surprised to remind myself how large that is. A lot of the large publicly traded leasing companies have raised capital recently. You have state-owned customers, and you just have customers that have a good financial position coming into this. Is it reasonable to assume that, that set of customers that I just described can hold -- as challenging as things are, can hold it together through 2020 until things are normalized and they\u2019re growing again in 2021? David Calhoun : In my experience and I\u2019ve lived through it in my life at GECAS back in the post 9/11 world. It turns out that is exactly what holds up. And we believe that in fact it will hold up again. And a lot of the discussions we\u2019ve had been with financial markets and lessors, as you would imagine. So I think your assumption is correct and part of our assumptions in this process reflect the discussions we\u2019ve had with financial sources. So I guess, yes, is the answer, I can\u2019t put an absolute number on it for you but it\u2019s clearly reflected in our numbers. Operator : Our next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Doug Harned : On liquidity. This morning, Airbus management described a lot of the same liquidity issues that you're describing today, with the focus on the supply chain\u2019s health. And it appears that the biggest cash risk that you're facing is also with the supply chain, you have the discussion around the $60 billion before. But when you look at the responsibility for the cash needs of suppliers, it crosses Boeing, it crosses Airbus with a lot of overlaps. You've got support potentially from governments and then the suppliers themselves. So it looks like there are a wide range of potential scenarios here for what the cash outcome could be for Boeing related to the supply chain. Can you talk about how you work with the different constituencies to try and address this? And can you give us a sense as to what the range of outcomes could be here as you look over the next year? David Calhoun : Well, let me take a crack at this first. The right order of business is the one that is going on right before our eyes. And the first is to get the airlines from the pre-COVID moment into the post-COVID moment and for them to be warm when they get there so that they can begin that recovery process. That in and of itself puts some stability out there in the marketplace and it allows us, Boeing, to now look at medium term demand long-term demand and make the adjustments in accordance with that. We believe we have a balance sheet and we believe we have tools available to us and credit markets that are open enough to us to be able to get from here to there and get there with room to spare.  As we do that, our good credit then extends into the supply chain and the supply chain then has to make a whole bunch of adjustments on their own to reflect the new production requirements at both Airbus and Boeing. So again the airlines, bridging that moment, Boeing-Airbus, access to credit and their ability to finance from here to that medium term moment and then the supply chain\u2019s ability to now restructure themselves to meet that new demand, but always relying on our credit and always relying on our factories being open, that's a real advantage. And then the tools that the CARES Act has put in place and we do work closely with the administration on trying to get them to understand where the soft spots might be in that overall supply chain and direct those tools to that supply chain.  And that's the process that\u2019s unfolding before our eyes. Believe it or not, I think it's robust and it's working. And so I'm not anticipating at least at this moment in time any big or serious repercussions from supply chain issues in some ways. Just in the last two or three weeks as governments have stepped up with their tools, et cetera, there's been a little more stability than there was just prior. Doug Harned : So is it fair to say, as you and Greg look at the range of possible outcomes here, with respect to the suppliers, when you're talking about feeling fairly confident in this now, you're able to say you can take off some worst case scenarios that perhaps were there back when you mentioned that $60 billion. So that even under the sort of current worst case here, you're fairly confident you're in solid shape for this year. David Calhoun : We are. And I know you would imagine, but we have a lot of folks who help us with this and we have stress tests the case that we're putting forward in many, many ways that are much more difficult than what we believe we're going to do. And we do get through it. And we do ultimately when we do take on more debt, we also believe strongly that we're going to start paying it down. Now at what rate we pay it down is the real question, but when we get to some form of stability at these production rates, and I believe we'll be in good shape to begin that process of returning money to our lenders. Operator : Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ron Epstein : Maybe changing the focus a little bit to product strategy, with the Embraer deal not playing out and then NMA being off the table, how do you think about competing against Airbus who has a product at the lower end of the market and a product at the higher end of the narrow-body market where it seems like the MAX is -- it\u2019s fine, but it's -- how can I say, it\u2019s sandwiched between aircraft that are optimized on both ends of the market by your competitors. So, particularly in an environment where you're constrained on your R&D spend and your development spend? David Calhoun : Well, with respect to MAX, I have a lot more confidence in the MAX and its place in the market than maybe the question implies. We have a value prop that actually is still pretty good. In some ways, if airplane loads want to get smaller as a result of maybe a smaller set of passengers flying on them in the next several years, it might actually play to us. We have a robust backlog with it and we are not out of the product development business. We're definitely in it. We are invested in capabilities with respect to manufacturing and engineering that we believe will offer a very differentiated product in whatever strategy we choose. And we're fast at work at that stuff and we continue to be at work on it. It will probably not be applied to an NMA. And I think we've conveyed that to the marketplace. But this time actually in some of these market changes, and then those important technologies we're investing and I actually -- I have a lot of faith in the product that we currently serve it with; and then secondly, the capabilities we'll bring to whatever we eventually develop as a next gen. And in the meantime, on a wide-body world and particularly in the freighter world, we like our strategies, we're going to continue to invest in it. And I believe at a moment that's our -- probably our biggest priority. So -- and then at the low end, Embraer is not going away, they're going to fight tooth and nail to win at that low end of the marketplace and they'll battle Airbus, the former Bombardier and doing so, and I don't think that's going to move the market in any significant way and/or affect the future of Boeing in any significant way. So anyway, that's probably in a nutshell. Operator : Our next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Hi, good morning, Dave. And Greg, thank you for the time. Dave, you mentioned on wide-bodies. I'm just following up on this. You seem pretty comfortable that the bottom of demand is in. Given this is largely a replacement market and granted not uniform, what type of retirement rates are you thinking for the industry? David Calhoun : Well, I don't have a retirement number on the tip of my tongue. Sufficed to say, there are going to -- retirements are going to accelerate in my view considerably and airplanes are going to get put down permanently at a faster rate. That's the most important part of this. They get put down permanently, not that they just get part. And so I do think that actually is going to play to our favor. I love where our product line is. I think it's fundamentally advantage. Unfortunately, this international route structure I just think it's going to take longer to recover. And as a result, we'll suffer with respect to ramp. But I do feel very good about it. And I do think retirements are going to fuel a fair amount of our demand. Greg Smith : Yes. And I\u2019d just add to it, Sheila, you know very well, when you look at the number of airplanes that are 20 plus years old and it's a significant amount. And then to Dave\u2019s point, at least we are picking up on the customer side, they'll be put down and won't be coming back up. And when you look at what we have in the pipeline or in the backlog to some of those customers from an efficiency point of view, obviously there's significant improvements and it crosses the entire product line. So, we'll see how it goes. But I think across the globe we're hearing a lot more commitment to retiring that age fleet, and to Dave\u2019s point, retiring for good and not bringing it back and we'll continue to monitor that. Obviously we\u2019ll take that into account as we think about our production schedules going forward. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Greg, just on that point, should we think about production in line with deliveries. So production equates to deliveries for wide-bodies in 2020 and \u201821 and beyond? Greg Smith : Yes, I think the only one that may be a little off is that the transition from the 777 to 777X through that period as we're building the balance of the flight test airplanes. But outside of that, pretty good correlation, production rate to delivery rate. Of course MAX being unique as we talked earlier. Yes. Operator : Our next question is from Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead. Jon Raviv : Want to just ask a question about the 45% of the business that is a defense right now. I think on the last call you mentioned that defense cash flow might be a little bit down year-on-year this year due to timing mostly. But how do you see that playing out on going forward? And I ask that in the context also of a lot of the gross items in your defense portfolio being related to very new programs. We've taken on some risk on the front end in terms of investments. How do see those dynamics playing out over the next few years as a way to plug some of the hole being created by aero clearly being down here? David Calhoun : Greg, do you want to take that one or do you want me to? Greg Smith : I'm sorry. I missed part of it. I apologize. It cut out on me. David Calhoun : This is with respect to our defense business and I'll start with it. You are in fact correct. 2019, where we did have some balance, the defense business was 45%. This year of course the defense business will probably be bigger than the commercial business and that will probably hold for a little while, of course, with these new rates and deliveries. So, that's an important part of our company that I'm not sure a lot of people reflect. The risk elements associated with our defense portfolio now -- I'm not going to knock on wood while I say it, but I believe we've de-risked much of our portfolio largely as a result of the significant issues we had on tanker and of course the continuous write-offs that we had to experience. I do believe that, that program now is exactly where it needs to be. We're going to finish well. Importantly, our customers are going to feel like we have finished well and we've delivered a product that is second to none. So I do believe that even the tanker future is significantly brighter than the one we've experienced up until now. And then our fighter aircraft, we will continue to supplement or attempt to supplement our order stream and production build. And largely with the help of a Defense Department whose posture is to want to do those kinds of things, particularly in this moment in time. So again, feel good about that.  And on the development front, our development programs at the early stages are all looking quite good. We're really not off plan on anything. And usually by now we have a sniff that we might be. So again I feel pretty good about the risk profile of our defense business, despite the difficulties that we've attempted to overcome in just the last couple of years, Greg, if you want to add anything to that. Greg Smith : Yes, no, I agree with everything you said, Dave. And obviously, when you look at the portfolio mix, Jon, that MAX ramp up, that's where it'll start to differentiate, go back to a richer mix on the commercial side. But outside of that I think it\u2019s pretty much the way Dave outlined it. And on the development program, as Dave said, we\u2019ve tried to derisk a lot of these upfront, especially some of those wins that we had most recently. And outside of that the portfolio is actually performing well as is the BGS government services side of the business. So we got to keep that engine running smoothly as well. Maurita Sutedja : Okay. Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : And that will be from Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead. Myles Walton : In a prior question, I think you talked about 2022 cash flow -- free cash flow as being kind of the pointing north for us to look at. I'm just curious in \u201821, is there any reason we shouldn't expect that to be a sizable positive cash flow year given the liquidation you're talking about the MAX or are the advances headwinds enough for \u201821 to also be negative? Greg Smith : Yes. No, definitely \u201821 is -- at least as we have a forecast to be a much better than \u201820, a lot of key elements in that is certainly the MAX again, the profile, the MAX deliveries coming off the ramp and the production. There is more impact on the progress payment side. But again, as I\u2019ve talked about, operationally on the 787 we're still seeing good cash conversion on the program. And then -- and like I said, 777X has improved from a cash burn in \u201821 as well. So lots of moving pieces as there always is. But the single biggest driver in there is MAX, the right ramp on MAX and that's what will contribute to a much more improved 2021 versus 2020. Myles Walton : Sorry, Greg, just to underline, that though improved, is it positive? Do you kind of feel comfortable enough to say that? Greg Smith : Yes. Our current forecast based on all the rate discussions we just had today is a positive 2021 cash flow. Maurita Sutedja : Alright. So that completes Boeing Company\u2019s first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Thank you all for joining. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst question-and-answer sessions are being broadcast live over the Internet. [Operator Instructions] At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Ms. Maurita Sutedja, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Ms. Sutedja, please go ahead. Maurita Sutedja : Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's second quarter 2020 earnings call. I'm Maurita Sutedja and with me today are David Calhoun, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Executive Vice President of Enterprise Operations, Chief Financial Officer and Interim leader of Communications. After management comments, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. And as a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com. Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections, estimates and goals we include in our discussion this morning are likely to involve risks which are detailed in our news release, in our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures. Now I will turn the call over to Dave Calhoun. David Calhoun : Thank you, Maurita. Good morning, everyone. I hope you are all continuing to stay safe and healthy during this crazy global pandemic that we're all living through. Before getting started, I want to recognize all of the health care professionals, the public servants, the frontline workers who are dedicated to keeping us safe and healthy day-in and day-out. On behalf of all of our Boeing Associates, thank you. I also want to thank my Boeing team-mates around the globe for everything they are doing to support each other, our business, our communities and our customers during these intensely challenging times. With that, let's turn to business and Slide 2, please. The current challenges we have are of unprecedented proportions. I think we all know that. This is true for our company, true for our industry and our society at large. In times of uncertainty, it is important, we focus first on our people and that is where I'll start today. We're working hard to strengthen our culture, support our workforce and to help our communities. The racial equity and social justice movement reminds us that we must do more to confront racism head-on. I'm proud of our Boeing team's commitment to this and the progress we've made over the years. But I recognize, we recognize, we have more work to do. We're raising the bar on our key measures of equity, diversity and inclusion and over the next four years, we will double the $25 million we've invested in partnerships and organizations that support marginalized communities. Our commitments in this area will be an even more permanent and visible aspect of our engagement going forward. Turning to the COVID-19 pandemic. As cases rise in certain areas, we are focused on keeping our people and our communities safe. As you know, during March and April, we temporarily suspended some of our operations due to cover COVID-19. We resumed operations and brought our teams back to work only after implementing objective and rigorous steps aligned with federal and state guidance, to ensure the health and safety of our workforce. We are taking all responsible measures across our facilities, including requiring face coverings, enhancing facility cleaning, adding visual indicators. We are modifying work areas and adjusting work patterns to allow for physical distancing, providing access to medical information around the clock, quarantining anyone potentially exposed to the virus, and conducting contact tracing and much more. For all of our employees whose jobs can be done effectively from home, we continue to implement virtual working arrangements. We believe we've put effective processes in place that enable our facilities to be as safe or safer than their respective communities. Nevertheless, we will remain vigilant and follow the advice of our health care professionals and adhere to the government guidelines as we monitor the virus. As our employees focus on their own health, they are also stepping up to help their communities through the crisis. I couldn't be more proud of their efforts and I'll highlight just a few of their contributions. To-date, we've printed more than 40,000 face shields and completed 12 airlift missions, delivering 4 million units of personal protective equipment to health-care workers in need. And combined with our Gift Matching Program, our employees have donated $1.5 million to support COVID-19 response efforts in their local communities. COVID has also dealt a heavy blow to the commercial aerospace sector and our business. Airlines have cut back operations dramatically. As they assess their business, they are making difficult decisions that result in grounding fleets, deferring airplane orders, postponing acceptance of completing orders and slowing down or stopping payments. They are also accelerating aircraft retirements, deferring elective maintenance, and requiring fewer service. That is why we are working closely with our customers and suppliers to navigate through this uncertainty. We continue to monitor the commercial marketplace by staying very engaged with our customers around the globe to fully understand their short-term, medium-term and long-term requirements. We have and we will continue to work with our customers on specific timing and adjustments to their deliveries. We will discuss this further in the business environment part of this discussion. As air travel resumes and restrictions ease around the globe, aircraft crew and passenger health and safety are always our top priority. Through our Confident Travel initiative, Boeing is supporting our customers and working with industry stakeholders to support multiple layers of protection aimed at minimizing health risks for passengers and crew throughout the travel journey. Layered with protection is a system-wide approach with customers, airports, regulatory authorities and industry associations all having a role to play. First layer is having measures in place to prevent anyone with the virus from boarding the airplane. The second layer is assisting airlines on cleaning and disinfecting practices. The third layer is to minimize contaminants from spreading in the cabin itself through to the design of cabin air flows, the use of HEPA filters and encouraging passengers if not requiring passengers to wear face coverings. In-cabin technology, enhanced cleanliness standards, airflow systems and other preventative measures are helping protect the health and safety of every person who steps on-board Boeing airplanes. These have to be combined with personal responsibility of passengers and crews, including wearing face masks and taking other precautions, which is a critical part of creating a safe travel experience. Another important aspect of bridging to recovery is ensuring the health of our supply chain. We're doing everything we can to support our global suppliers and their stability remains a key watch item for us in the aerospace - as our aerospace industry weathers these unprecedented challenges. We're monitoring our supplier status around the world to assess risks and to address any potential disruption. We've been continuing payments to our more than 12,000 suppliers supporting about 1.5 million jobs. As we discussed last quarter, given the severe nature of this virus and the shock, to preserve the long-term competitiveness of our industry as well as our company, we are intensely focused on ensuring the liquidity through the intermediate crisis. We've taken aggressive liquidity steps over the past few months, including raising $25 billion in the capital markets in May. While we've addressed the immediate liquidity issue, we still must continue taking action to improve our performance and transform our business for the future. In the second quarter, we completed the realignment of our Engineering Organization and the integration of our new Enterprise Operations Finance and Strategy Group. These moves our foundational steps in our effort to strengthen engineering, to elevate the company's focus on safety and quality, improve operational, factory and supply chain performance and streamline our processes. And lastly, despite the challenges we face, we've not lost sight of our commitment and our need to deliver on our priorities, which have not changed. We're continuing to make steady progress toward the safe return of the 737 to service, working closely with the FAA and other global regulators. While we still have a lot of work in front of us, we are encouraged with the completion of the FAA certification flight test earlier this month and the FAA's announcement to move forward with the notice of proposed rulemaking to safely return the 737 to service. Both are important milestones in the certification process as we collectively focus on ensuring transparency at all stages. We are working now on completing the remaining key tasks, coordinating with and following the lead of our global regulators. As you would expect the pandemic has required some changes to how we do things, including working remotely and virtual meetings with our regulators. For activities that cannot be completed remotely, we're making appropriate and safe arrangements to enable effective cross-border collaboration with the global regulators, but the overall environment presents real logistical challenges for the necessary international travel and the in-person meetings which are required and that we are working through. Based on our latest assessment, we now expect the necessary regulatory approvals will be obtained in time to support resumption of deliveries during the fourth quarter. Of course, the actual timing will ultimately be determined by the global regulators. After an approximately four months suspension of production operations, in May, we resumed early stages of our 737 production line. During the suspension, we implemented more than a dozen initiatives focused on workplace safety, product quality and they have strength in the production system and helped optimize the build environment allowing for more predictability and stability for future rate increases. In addition to the 737, we're focused on meeting our commitments to our commercial, defense and space customers. In fact, within defense, we delivered 44 aircraft in the quarter, completed the critical design review for T-7A advanced trainer and achieved our first flight of both the F-15 Qatar Advanced and the F-18 Block 3 Super Hornet for the US Navy. Now let's turn to the next slide to discuss the business environment for our industry. At Defense, Space & Security, we continue to see a healthy market with solid demand for our major platforms and programs, both domestically and internationally. Our portfolio of programs and technologies remains well aligned to our customers' missions. We are also well-positioned with proven world-class platforms to address current needs and innovative, capable and affordable new franchise programs for the future. The $7 billion of orders that BDS booked in the quarter and some recent awards including the historic contract for the F-15EX from the US Air Force, combined with the contract extension from NASA to support the International Space Station underscore the strength of our offerings. The demand outlook for our Government Services business remained stable. The strength of Government Services provides a strong foundation for our overall Services business. We see growth in a number of government services areas including ramp-ups to support international customers with training, logistics and supply chain offerings as well as growth on key US programs. Our Government Services, Defense and Space programs continues to provide critical stability for us as we move forward. On the commercial side, our industry and our company are weathering challenges like none we have ever experienced in our lifetimes, and many of those challenges are still unfolding. IATA projects passenger traffic will drop by more than half this year compared to 2019, as global economic activity slows down due to COVID and governments severely restrict travel to contain the spread of the virus. After a short 94% drop in passenger traffic in April, we've seen tangible signs of recoveries in key markets such as China and Europe with operations increasing into July. The US has also improved from the April lowest point. However, the recent uptick in COVID cases has slowed its recovery. So while we were encouraged by the early signs of recovery, the past few weeks demonstrate the trajectory may be uneven. On the cargo side, the reduction of belly cargo capacity has led operators to utilize essentially all available freighters. Significant use of passenger aircraft as freighters continue, though yields are starting to return to normal as more belly cargo capacity comes back online. We've also seen improvement in global fleet utilization. Around 65% of the fleet is now back in service with hundreds of aircraft reactivated weekly. Utilization metrics are improving as airlines resume more of their network and schedules. June, passenger operations reached approximately 30% of last year's levels, with acceleration in July, bringing them to nearly 50% at last year's level. Passenger load factor has improved from the April levels but remains low. In June, the load factor was 58% versus 84% a year ago. As I alluded to earlier, we're seeing different paces of recovery for different regions. Some countries reopen their air travel improved along with it. This is the case in Europe, with many airlines resuming operations as borders open. The US recovery has sustained weekly 20% traffic growth momentum until about July 4, and since then with rising cases in key leisure markets, we've seen signs of flattening or slight declines as the airlines have noted. Continued growth in cases and corresponding travel restrictions or quarantine policies may dampen the near-term recovery. The way forward will depend on the development with respect to the pandemic and the scope of government travel restrictions. We continue to see volatility on the recovery path ahead. Given the amount of uncertainty that is still in front of us, managing liquidity continues to be vital to our industry's ability to bridge to recovery and to navigate the challenges. As we previously discussed, we continue to believe that the fundamentals that have driven air travel for the past five decades and double the air traffic over the past two decades remain intact. And we believe this industry will in fact recover, but we currently estimate it will take around three years for travel to return to 2019 levels. And it will be a few years beyond that for the industry to return to long-term growth trends. The picture is obviously dynamic and subject to many unknowns. As we see it today, narrow-body airplanes will lead the way to recovery as airlines bringing their networks back online focusing first on domestic routes. Meanwhile border closures and travel restrictions significantly dampen international travel demand, which in turn impacts the utilization of wide-body passenger fleets in the near-term. A key driver in both segments will be the rate of retirements of older fleets. We expect our customers to look at their fleet planning strategies differently in light of these dynamics. More than 2,500 aircraft with 20 plus years of service were in active service prior to the crisis. So far, we have tracked retirements of close to 1,000 of these aircraft across the global fleet. Replacements will not be uniform, as airlines will focus on the oldest and least efficient airplanes to retire. Some airlines have already made announcements to this effect. Thousands of more fuel-efficient airplanes that we and our competitors have in backlog will make future flying even more environmentally sustainable and help us reach our industry's emission reduction targets. Airplanes that we plan to deliver this year will be 25% to 40% more fuel-efficient than the airplanes they're replacing. The urgency and value of fleet versatility is accelerated by this crisis. And our position is helped by the value proposition of our family of airplanes and the diversity of our backlog. This includes our market-leading 787, our unmatched cargo line up, the world's largest and most efficient twin-engine jet the 777X, and of course, the versatile 737 family. On the Services side, we are seeing a direct impact on our Commercial Supply Chain business as fewer flights result in the decreased demand for our parts and logistics offerings. Our commercial customers are curtailing discretionary spend such as modifications and upgrades, and focusing on required maintenance only. We anticipate accelerated retirement of older aircraft, which will result in a newer fleet when air travel resumes to previous levels. This will prolong the period of decreased demand for our commercial services offerings. Similar to commercial airplanes, we expect a multi-year recovery period for the Commercial Services business. You'll see the significant impact of COVID is reflected in our Commercial Services financial results this quarter, which Greg will go through a little bit later. We closely monitor the Commercial marketplace by staying very engaged with our customers all around the world to fully understand short and long-term requirements. We regularly incorporate additional insight to inform current and future production rates. Based on our latest assessment, we have decided to refine our commercial airplane production rates to better calibrate near to medium-term supply and demand balance. Let's turn to slide 4. In the narrow-body segment, we expect to continue to produce the 737 at low rates for the remainder of 2020, and gradually increase the rate to 31 by the beginning of 2022, with further gradual increases that correspond with market demand. The production ramp profile is also affected by the pace of delivery of our stored aircraft. We have moderated, the production rate ramp-up from our prior assumption to reflect commercial airline industry uncertainty due to the impact of COVID. We continue to see our 737 family of airplanes creating capacity for growth and providing required replacements for older, less efficient airplanes. We have and will continue to work closely with our customers review their fleet plans and make adjustments where appropriate to adapt to lower-than-planned 737 production in the near-term, provide more flexibility to deliver our backlog and protect the value of the 737 family. Moving to the wide-body segment, we previously planned to reduce the 787 production rate to 10 per month in 2020 and gradually reduce to 7 per month by 2022. In light of the ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic and the impact on our airline customers, we now plan to reduce the 787 production rate from the current 10 per month to 6 per month in 2021 to further de-risk our skyline, taking into account the financial condition of our customers and the geopolitical environment. Given the lower rate profile, we will prudently evaluate the most efficient way to produce the 787 to include studying the feasibility of consolidating our 787 production into one location. We will continue to evaluate the rate beyond 2021 to balance supply and demand. Our 787 family has a compelling value proposition, offering unparalleled fuel efficiency and range flexibility, enabling carriers to optimize fleet and network performance as well as profitably expanding into new markets. Turning to the 777X. We continue to execute the flight-testing phase of our rigorous test program. As we look toward entry into service, we've adjusted the timing of the first 777-9 deliveries in 2022 versus our prior forecast of 2021. This reflects our assessment of the development and test timeline, feedback from our customers and projected impacts from COVID-19. We are also incorporating lessons learned from the 737 certification process. We will continue to manage the risks inherent in any development program. We continue to expect to deliver 777s at an average rate of approximately 2.5 per month in 2020. We will take a measured approach to the 777X rate ramp as we look to minimize the amount of change incorporation work by managing the number of the aircraft produced prior to entry into service. Due to market uncertainties driven primarily by the impacts of COVID-19 and moving the 777X delivery to 2022, we now plan to reduce the combined 777-777X production rate to 2 per month in 2021 versus our previous plan of 3 per month in 2021. Finally, we'll make no change to the 767 and 747 production rates at this time. These programs are targeted for the cargo market and approximately half of the 767 production is dedicated for the tanker program. On the 747, we will continue building 747s at the current rate, as we deliver on our commitments to key customers. In light of the current market dynamics and the outlook, we anticipate completing production of the iconic 737 in 2022. Our commitment to our customers does not end at delivery. These airplanes will be flying for decades to come, and we'll continue to support the 747 franchise, its operations and sustainment well into the future. These rate decisions are based on our current assessment of the demand environment. Taking into account a host of risks and opportunities, we will closely monitor the key factors that affect our skyline, including the wide-body replacement cycle and the cargo market. We will maintain a disciplined rate management process and maintain - and make adjustments as appropriate into the future. As I mentioned last quarter, the sharp reductions in demand for our airplanes and services that we see over the next several years won't support the size of the workforce that we had prior to the start of the pandemic. As previously announced, we started implementing a reduction of our global staffing by approximately 10% by end of this year, from where we ended the year last year, through the combination of voluntary layoffs, attrition and where necessary involuntary layoffs. These are difficult actions, we're taking along with infrastructure and spending reductions to better position us for the future. We're taking a thoughtful and - the thoughtful approach carefully managing required skills and talent. In some areas and most notably defense, we continue hiring to meet our customer commitments and to fill critical skill positions. We are implementing these reductions as fairly, respectively and transparently as possible and providing as much support for our employees as we can through the duration of the global health emergency that we're facing. Unfortunately, the prolonged impact of COVID-19, the further reductions in our production rates, and the lower demand for commercial services means we'll have to further assess the size of our workforce and ensure we're aligning with the smaller market. More of hard decisions are likely ahead of us, as we try to limit the impact on our people as much as we possibly can. We will be communicating with our team-mates openly, honestly and transparently. The assessment will be aligned with our ongoing efforts to simplify and improve, how we do our work, driving agility and positioning us for when the industry recovers. In summary, our industry is changing, our customers' needs are shifting and we're adapting. We believe over the next several years air travel demand will gradually recover to the growth trends. Protecting long-term flexibility while adjusting capacity in the interim, to balance near to medium-term supply and the demand will be critical to preserve our long-term prospects. There is no question that this is a historically dynamic and challenging time for our industry. We'll work closely and transparently with our customers, our suppliers and our employees as we navigate through and rebuild stronger on the other side. We will take decisive action to transform the business, focused investments, preserve liquidity, streamline and size our operations to become a better more sustainable Boeing, And with that, let me turn it over to Greg for an update on our financial performance. Greg? Greg Smith : Great. Thanks Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 5 for our second-quarter results. Our financial results continue to be significantly impacted by COVID and the 737 MAX grounding. Second-quarter revenue of $11.8 billion, reflects lower Commercial Airplane deliveries and Commercial Service volume and an additional 737 MAX customer consideration charge of $551 million in the quarter. Earnings in the quarter were also impacted by over $2 billion of charges comprised of the BCA abnormal costs, BGS charges as a result of the COVID-19 market environment and severance costs for approximately 19,000 employees leaving the company, of which around 6,000 have left as of June 30. These reductions combined with additional hiring that continues in key areas like BDS and critical skill areas will result in approximately 10% net workforce reduction this year. These charges were partially offset by income tax benefit related to the NOL carry-back provision in the CARES Act, as well as the impact of pre-tax losses. I'll cover these charges in more detail on the subsequent slides. Let's now move to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 6. Revenue was $1.6 billion, reflecting lower Commercial Airplane deliveries due to the significant impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our customers and on our operations, including the shutdown of our commercial airplane production for several weeks in April and May. Also impacting revenue in the quarter was the $551 million increase in estimated 737 MAX customer considerations. This is compared to a $5.6 billion charge we booked in the second quarter of last year to establish the customer consideration liability. BCA second-quarter operating margins declined due to the following : lower delivery volume, $712 million of abnormal production costs related to the 737 MAX program, $468 million of severance expense and $131 million of abnormal production costs for the temporary suspension of our Puget Sound and Charleston production sites due to COVID-19 through again the April and early May time frame. Similar to a prior period in preparation for our second-quarter financial statements, we made certain assumptions on the 737 MAX including delivery and production rate ramp-up profiles. As Dave mentioned, we've moderated the production rate ramp-up from our prior assumption to reflect detailed ongoing discussions with our customers as they assess the environment and their fleet requirements. We've also revised our assumptions on timing and the profile deliveries from storage. Delivery from storage will continue to be priority-one after assisting our customers with their return to service. We currently have approximately 450 737 MAX aircraft built and stored in inventory. We expect to continue to produce the 737 at very low rates for the remainder of 2020, and gradually increase the rate 31 by the end of 2002 and expect further gradual rate increases to correspond with market demand. We've assumed that the timing of regulatory approvals will enable the 737 MAX deliveries to resume during the fourth quarter of 2020. We have also assumed that the majority of the 737 MAX aircraft in storage will be delivered during the first year after resumption of deliveries. There is no material change in our estimate total abnormally costs of $5 billion. We expect these costs will be expensed and incurred over this year and the next year. During the second quarter, we expensed $712 million of abnormal production costs, which brought the cumulative abnormal cost expense to-date to $1.5 billion. As reflected in the second-quarter revenue, we've updated our assessment of the liability for estimated potential concessions and other considerations to customers for disruptions related to the 737 MAX grounding and associated delivery delays. This reassessment up - includes updated estimates to reflect revisions to return to service, delivery and production rate assumptions driven by timing of regulatory approvals, as well as latest information based on engagement with our customers. Cumulatively, we've accrued a $9.6 billion liability for the estimated potential concessions and other considerations. To-date, we've made $2.6 billion of payments to customers in cash and other forms of compensation, including $600 million we paid this quarter. We have settlement agreements covering approximately $3 billion of the remaining liability balance of $6.7 billion. We continue to address the impact individually customer-by-customer, including assessing the effects of MAX disruption is having on their operations in light of the COVID pandemic. We also continue to expect any concessions or other considerations to be provided over a number of years with the cash impact to be more front-loaded in the first few years. Any changes to these assumptions could require us to recognize additional financial impacts. Commercial Airplanes backlog includes more than 4,500 aircraft valued at $326 billion. The decline in backlog in the second quarter reflected aircraft order cancellations and removal of aircraft orders from our backlog, due to ASC 606 accounting standard. The ASC 606 imposes additional criteria for recognizing an aircraft order in Boeing's backlog, even though the customers continue to have binding contracts with our company we have - when an order is deemed to not meet the criteria that we adjust the backlog accordingly. The ASC 606 adjustment removes aircraft in backlog if the customer has a contractual right to cancel and incorporates our assessment of a customer's liquidity position and commitment to take the delivery. As Dave mentioned earlier, we are taking action to adjust our production rates and our infrastructure to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic impact on aircraft demand. These rate decisions are based on our current assessment of our demand environment, and we will continue to closely monitor these factors that affect our skyline and make rate adjustments as appropriate in the future. We strive to adjust our production rates as timely as possible. In some cases, we would have liked to bring production rate down sooner to match near-term demand. However, there is a number of key factors that need to take into consideration, including orderly supply chain transition and production system stability. Therefore, we expect production to continue to outpace delivery rate in the near-term, resulting in higher finished goods inventory. Let's now move to Defense, Space & Security on Slide 7. Second-quarter revenue was stable at $6.6 billion, reflecting COVID-19 impact on derivative aircraft programs, partially offset by higher volume across the remainder of the portfolio. Second quarter operating margin decreased to 9.1% largely due to $151 million, KC-46A Tanker charge primarily driven by additional fixed cost allocation resulting from lower Commercial Airplane production volume due to COVID-19. BDS operating margin in the second quarter of 2019 benefited from a gain on the sale of property. During the quarter BDS won key contract awards worth $7 billion and our backlog stands at $64 billion with 31% from outside of the United States. Let's now turn to Global - Boeing Global Services results on Slide 8. In the second quarter, Global Services revenue declined to $3.5 billion due to lower Commercial Services volume due to COVID-19 partially offset by higher Government Services volume. Operating margin in the quarter reflected lower Commercial Service volume, less favorable mix of products and services and a $923 million of an earnings charge. The charges are due to significant impacts COVID has had on our customers' liquidity, and demand for certain products as customers' fleet plans adapt to sharp reductions in air travel. The charges include the following reserve for higher expected credit losses primarily due to customer liquidity issues, inventory write-downs and impairments of distribution rights, primarily driven by airlines' decision to retire certain aircraft, and contract termination and facilities impairment charges and finally severance costs. BGS backlog declined to $18 billion, primarily due to the reduction for commercial orders that in our assessment no longer meet the accounting requirements of ASC 606 for inclusion in our backlog. Our remaining backlog is primarily made up of government contracts, which continue to be stable. To respond to the challenging market dynamics, we have taken significant action and proactive steps to right-size and ultimately better position our Services business for these new market realities. These include employment actions as well as proactively taking steps to right-size our inventory, and tailor our portfolio to ensure that we are positioned to serve our customers both through this challenging time and when the industry begins to recover. Let's now turn to cash flow on Slide 9. The historic market downturn caused by the impact of COVID-19 our airlines and the global economy continues to put significant pressure on our cash receipts. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was negative $5.3 billion driven by lower commercial airplane delivery volume, advanced payment timing, commercial service volume and as discussed COVID-19 caused delivery and production disruption in the quarter. In the quarter, we also saw increased cash receipts from the release of with withholds on tanker deliveries and the Department of Defense initiative to increase progress payment rate. We appreciate the Pentagon's leadership in supporting the National Security Industry base and we continue to do our part to keeping cash flow to our supply chain. We continue to expect cash flow generation on the government side of the business to be solid and in line with earnings. Clearly, the additional reductions in our commercial production rates as well as the updated 777X schedule have made our cash profile even more challenging. However, based on what we know today and our actions, we still see a path to positive cash flow in 2021. We'll continue to work opportunities diligently and monitor risk factors given the dynamic nature of the current environment. Let's move now to Slide 10 and we'll discuss our liquidity position. As discussed last quarter, due to the significant impact COVID-19 on our operating cash, we've been proactively managing our cash position and assessing additional liquidity. In May, we completed a $25 billion bond issuance and the strong investor response on the bond validates the confidence we have in our future. Also in the quarter, we paid down $2.4 billion of commercial paper, bringing our total debt to $61.4 billion. We appreciate the administration, Congress, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Departments for their swift actions in stabilizing the market at the onset of this crisis, which helped the credit markets function again and pave the way for our successful bond offering. We ended the second quarter with $32.4 billion of cash and marketable securities. We also continue to have access to our $9.6 billion revolving credit facility, which to-date has not been drawn upon. We expect our current - we expect our use of cash due to COVID-19 to continue for the remainder of the year and into part of '21. Given the dynamic environment, we continue to carefully monitor our cash flow position and perform scenario planning to understand the range of outcome and assess what future actions we may need to take to ensure that we continue to have sufficient liquidity. Managing our liquidity and balance sheet leverage are top priorities as we navigate this challenging environment. Reduce our debt levels once cash flow generation returns to normal levels will continue to be a top priority. Let's now turn to Slide 11. Clearly, COVID-19 pandemic is continuing to present significant challenges for our industry and for our company. We're managing these challenges daily and taking swift action to bridge to recovery and emerge stronger on the other side. To bolster our near-term liquidity, we've taken a number of actions since early this year. We suspended our dividend and terminated our prior share repurchase authorization. We proactively drawn down on our $13.8 billion term loan in mid-March and raise $25 billion of new debt, cut discretionary spending and reduced or deferred R&D and capital expenditures. As discussed, to align to the new commercial aerospace realities, we are also lowering commercial production rates and taking difficult workforce actions. As we look to the future, we're focused not just on adapting and recovering but on emerging stronger and more resilient for the long-term. That includes prudently and proactively reviewing every aspect of our company to identify opportunities to improve performance on our - and our focus on safety, position for new market realities and ensure we're sharper, and leaner and more competitive for the long-term. This is a true business transformation effort and addressing holistically five key areas. We are reassessing all aspects of our infrastructure, facilities, sites and enterprise footprint in light of the reduced demand and also taking into account new remote working opportunities. We're looking critically at our organizational cost structure and how we operate. We're re-evaluating our portfolio and investments to ensure we're focused in our spend on where we see market opportunities and areas more critical to our future, like safety, quality and innovation. We're managing our supply chain stability carefully while calibrating to lower demand, and we're driving operational excellence into every corner of our company, so we can improve performance, enhance quality, workplace safety and reduce rework. As we transform our enterprise across these five pillars, we will continuously assess the size of our workforce to ensure we're adapting to market realities, while limiting the impact on our people as much as possible. The goal is to improve cash flow profile, restore our balance sheet strength as quickly as possible and these actions will help get us there. The financial objectives we've established are measured in billions of dollars and will be executed over a multi-year period. Again this effort is about ensuring we're well-positioned for the future. Even as we reduce our spend, we will continue investing in areas critical to our future, including safety, quality, operational excellence and innovation in key technologies and products. We're also working with our supply chain partners to carefully manage liquidity and do all we can to maintain stability through this demand shock, so that we can protect the long-term health of the US aerospace industry. Again approximately $0.70 on every dollar we spend goes to the supply chain and we are focused on the best ways to keep liquidity flowing through our business and to our supply chain through this period. We are also staying and fully engaged with our customers, assessing the challenging environment to ensure we are right-minded about near-term and long-term demand so that we can always be prepared to meet our customers' needs. We work hard to de-risk the past decade by addressing a number of different areas including pension funding risk, labor stability, product development, sequencing and raising the bar on productivity, safety cash management discipline. Our teams know how to do this and I'm confident that we're taking the right actions to ensure long-term sustainable future. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dave for closing comments. David Calhoun : Thanks Greg. We're definitely in an unprecedented period and a tough moment for the industry and the world. Every day I'm inspired by the resilience and the hard work of our Boeing associates, our customers and our business partners. We are and we will continue taking the right actions to navigate through this together, while maintaining focus on our priorities, living our values and driving safety, quality, operational excellence in everything we do. We're focused not just on adopting and recovering but on emerging stronger and more resilient than ever before. We believe that long-term industry fundamentals remain strong and air travel will recover. Our portfolio of products and technology is well-positioned for that recovery. Much hard work remains ahead of us, but what I've seen the Boeing team do gives me great confidence that we will adapt, we will lead and we will thrive as our industry recovers. With that, Greg and I will be happy to take your questions. And I'll turn it back to Maurita. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Myles Walton with UBS. Your line is open. Myles Walton with UBS, your line is open. And our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Hunter Keay : Can you please give us some color on that path to positive free cash flow in 2021 kind of curious to know? Obviously, know your assumptions on rate, but beyond that, what are the primary drivers you need to achieve it? Thank you. Greg Smith : Yes, yes, absolutely. Well look, I'd say, first and foremost 737 return to service and driving the production and then the delivery ramp as we deliver those aircraft out of inventory that is the primary driver. Outside of that 777X getting closer to EIS and the financials associated with that. The 737 - 787 I'm sorry, cash profile does improve due to inventory unwind, and really that the deliveries are outpacing production. So we'll see the benefit of that. And then just continue to take actions on liquidity and rightsizing the company and productivity. But essentially, those are really the four biggest buckets to get you to 2021, but the single biggest driver being the 737 MAX profile. Operator : And next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Your line is open, please go ahead. Carter Copeland : Just a quick clarification and question. Greg, because of the rate changes did you have material program margin revisions downward on the 787 and the 737 and how comfortable are you about for loss - staying away from a for loss in the 787? And then just on the 606 revisions, and what you're seeing there? Can you give us a better sense of the backlog change and how much of that is related to the liquidity assessments you outlined and some of these planes returnable at this point? Greg Smith : Yes, yes let me start with on the margin front. Yes, we obviously we had adjustments on margins, program margins across the board, with the rate reductions and the revised delivery profile. Look, when you step back and look at 787 in particular at these lower rates and look at it on a unit basis. The margins obviously, don't increase, the way we had in prior with the higher rates. But they maintain to be pretty strong on a unit basis, and I would say that continues to be the fundamentals we've talked about, again, even with the lower rate, the improvement of mix and the step down by block. So - and then of course, the continued productivity. And as Dave mentioned, we're initiating the study on multiple sites. So more to come on that, but we'll continue to work. Obviously, all areas of productivity on the program and particularly with these lower rates. But again on a cash basis, on a unit basis, margins are actually hanging in there pretty well, even at these low rates. And that's really, I think a credit to the lot of work that's behind us that got done to get the program more efficient. And so, we're certainly seeing the benefits of that even at these low rates. On the 606 in the second quarter, so I think if you look at it, there was about 480 odd cancellations that were noted. About 300 of those were associated with 606. So there is a disciplined process that is outlined that we go through every quarter and assess the entire backlog by customer that the team goes through and makes that assessment. And we do that, like I said, every quarter and we'll continue to do that. And I suspect with time, at least in the near-term, we will have more adjustments on - related to 606. But again, that doesn't mean that they may not take the airplane over time. It just has to get through that criteria even though there's contracts in place, but again there are steps that we take and a thorough assessment and we adjust the backlog accordingly at that time, but it could change quarter-over-quarter. Some folks could move into the 606 and move out of it, but again we'll true it up every quarter. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Myles Walton with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Myles Walton : Greg in the second half of 2020 should we expect the cash flow burn to be materially improved from the first half or is that excess inventory build, is going to be a continued headwind? And then just considering everything else you obviously solved the liquidity problem with the debt offering. But do you think about accelerating the balancing of the capital structure here to ensuring investment-grade ratings? Greg Smith : Yes, I think if you look at the second half, right now Myles, it's a little bit better. That's at least what we got in the forecast. As you can imagine it's dynamic, and will remain dynamic through the balance of the year. But as we look at it right now in our latest forecast, we see it being slightly better and - we\u2019ll continue to be burning cash into early 2021. And like I said, as with the production rates that we laid out and the assumptions we made around those in our actions that will take, we can see a path to positive cash flow in 2021. And we'll continue to keep you up-to-date on that, but you should continue to expect to see negative cash flow through the balance of the year and into early 2021. On the liquidity front, I think, again, getting the $25 billion was critical and I think the fact that the market has got opened up and allowed us to get in there at the right time. And as you know, we were well oversubscribed, which I think just goes to the confidence that the market has in the long-term fundamentals of the marketplace. We don't see a need to raise any additional capital at this time. And - but we'll continue to monitor it and keep all of our options open. But as I said in my opening remarks on deployment, if we see opportunities to pay down that debt sooner or restructure that in any way, we will absolutely be doing that and we will be laser-focused on bringing that debt down and getting the balance sheet back in order. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Seth Seifman : Greg, I wonder if you could give us a little more color on the 737. I mean, the change in the rate from a kind of 31 by the end of 2021 to beginning of 2022 sounds like - seems like a fairly small change. It seems like your suppliers are experiencing something a little bit bigger? And so maybe what does that say about the cadence of that ramp during 2021 and how much risk is there still around that number? And maybe finally what opportunities are there may be for you to make more deals with some of your top customers to get more planes out of inventory and allow you to raise that rate? Greg Smith : Yes well, look I mean, like Dave mentioned and I think I echoed, the rate profile that we put in, and the delivery profile is really based on detailed discussions with each of our customers. That certainly has better clarity this quarter than they did last quarter, so we adjusted that accordingly. But we're in discussions with them daily and we'll continue to do that and make adjustments. When you look at the supply chain, as you know Seth, everybody is in a different state. I'll say inventory and rate based on where they were before the pandemic, in particular where we had suppliers that were not - did not have appropriate inventory levels or weren't making our master schedule. So some of those have been accelerated so, I would just tell you that each one of them is that a bit of a different place depending on how much built inventory they have, so you're going to see variation supplier-by-supplier. And we're, again, staying really engage with them daily on our plans and assumptions, and then helping them as they manage through their inventory or their ramp-up. But you're not going to see, I'll say, everybody is going to have a similar profile to what we have really due to the, like I said, the fact that everybody is sitting at a little bit different inventory level. And, of course, we're going to, as we said, priority one for us help our customers get the fleet back up, and then it's clearing the ramp, delivering the inventoried aircraft that are, as you know, built and ready to go all that taking into consideration, again, and informing the production rates that will happen in conjunction, but really predominantly follow after we deliver off the ramp. So lots of lots of moving pieces in there, but I think the most important thing is we got to stay engaged with the supplier and really get them clear line of sight and help them manage through the transition period as we get return to service and get the airplane back in the air. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Noah Poponak : Greg, maybe just following up on those fluid conversations with your customers, I mean it's a very dynamic situation, obviously, but you guys have talked about having spoken to every customer and you've identified the categories of customers that would want to take deliveries right now. I mean there was an airline this morning actually talking about accelerating because it's an opportunity to counter-cyclically invest. So I mean I guess how close are we to the whole ecosystem of you, the supply chain, your customers being on the same page? What inning are you in of revision until we feel like we aren't going to get production rate cuts anymore moving forward? Greg Smith : Yes. Well, look, I think we're on the same page. However, like we said it's dynamic, especially in the near-term. So it's really important that you know our engagements happen frequently, we have a clear line of sight and understanding. So then we can make appropriate changes to delivery profiles, rates, and then in the supply chain. So what we laid out today is our best estimate based on all that input and feedback from customers. Again, in and around the globe and then managing the risk within our factories, combined with the supply chain. As both Dave and I have articulated several times, we've spent a lot of time and effort stabilizing the 737 production facility and enhancing it. And with a keen eye towards as we move up and move back into higher production rates it's going to be very smooth and methodical and we're going to certainly have the advantage of all the hard work we put in place to drive stability and not have traveled work and just ensure that, again, we have a smooth rate ramp-up that combined with informed customers - being informed by our customers. So all of that has been taken into consideration on the profile that we just laid out. And obviously, if we see that changing, we'll adjust accordingly. I think the one moving pieces in there, Noah, that certainly does have flexibility is delivery off the ramp. Those aircraft are finished, they're ready to go. We've got flexibility and the team actually has done some great work getting ahead of that and essentially modeling out and really practicing how we're going to deliver those aircraft and recognizing there is going to be some movement from tail to tail and customer to customer. So we've got that flexibility it out there that I suspect that we'll have to utilize as we deliver those finished planes. That will, in turn, inform the production rate ramp-up. So we'll continue to kind of keep both of those in mind in. And like I said, one will inform the other and we'll continue to stay engaged with the customers. Noah Poponak : Just as a quick follow-up to that, the discussion around 2021 free cash flow, it looked like you're going to have MAX inventory unwind, and then airplanes you're producing but not delivering this year also unwind next year, and those could be pretty sizable numbers were even if their aircraft business otherwise was just breakeven plus defense, plus services, you'd actually maybe have nicely positive cash flow. Is the missing piece there just - it sounds like from your earlier comments you might plan to be producing ahead of deliveries the rest of this year and then even into the beginning of next year? Greg Smith : Yes, I think that's definitely - that is going to be the case and, on the MAX, again, customer by customer, it varies. So it's not kind of a one size fits all when it comes to cash and the delivery profile of those airplanes that are going to come off the ramp. So, again, lots of moving pieces in there, but as we kind of pull it all together, just again, based on what we see today, we can see that path to positive cash flow. And like I said it - we'll continue to keep you up-to-date on that, but I think we've got between the rates in our game plan around how we're going to execute between now and then I think we have a good line of sight on that right now. David Calhoun : Greg, if I might just add something, since I've been part of most of these calls with our customers, I want to acknowledge what you said is actually a fact. We do have many calls that are on the forward-looking I want to take a big position kind of discussion. And then we have the others, of course, who are in the opposite. So that's a true story. I think from Boeing's vantage point and our posture at the moment, we're still trying to de-risk the skyline. That has been our motive. And to emphasize to everyone including our own people that we're going to move the finished goods first. That is going to be - that's our intent. If we can move it faster, great. We're still going to hold our production rates as conservative as we can, so that we can get that inventory on the move. And then when I think this virus, ever looks like it's in the rearview mirror, I think all those discussions that, of course, we do have about the forward upside point of view, I think they'll come faster rather than slower. And I'm - honestly, I think as much about the recovery and the pace up as I do sort of retrenchment and to deal with today's liquidity because I think actually that ramp-up is going to be the more important part of this puzzle going forward. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is open. Sheila Kahyaoglu : I wanted to ask about normalized margins in BCA in 2022 at these lower rates. Based on these rates you'll produce about 510 aircraft in 2022. The last time you were around those levels was 2011. Your commercial margins back then were closer to 10% and granted that included some service and free cash flow if we adjust for 787 was around $10 billion. So I guess I'm asking how do we think about normalized margins and free cash flow sometime in 2022? Greg Smith : Well Sheila, as I said, right now it's the pass to that point, right? And so the focus that we talked about around rightsizing the company and taking the actions are going to - they're going to feed right into that. When you look at kind of unit margin over that period by program, again, as I mentioned on one of the prior questions, we're certainly under more pressure because of the lower production rates. But as we ramp-up, and particularly on the MAX we'll see that gross margin on a unit basis come up. And then again, we'll just have to continue to manage our spend on all of our discretionary but the actions that Dave - and I'll let Dave comment here, but the actions that we're putting in place now are really focused out in that time frame to make sure we come out of this stronger, and healthier and positioned to compete and get us through this window, this period we're all faced with the pandemic and really just not leave a rock unturned as far as our cost structures in our inter-site consolidations and so on, to ensure that we preserve cash flow out in that period and then, therefore, margin. But I'll let Dave comment as well. David Calhoun : Well, I'm not sure there is much I can add to that. We're going to have these volume impacts on our program accounting et cetera, over this near-term unit margins, cash margins is our focus. We feel good about where they are. We think we can make them better, and then as volume and orders come along and we can begin to look out further. I think everything gets - not only gets back to where it was, but maybe gets better. So not much I can add to sort of the dynamics of next year's margins other than to tell you our focus is on unit cash margins and just continue to manage that as closely as we can for liquidity purposes. And then as order books fill out, we can - you'll see that impact in the accounting side of the puzzle. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is open. Doug Harned : Greg, you were talking about the flexibility and basically with the airplanes roughly 450 MAXs that you have parked, but given a lot of the pressures that you had from customers for deferrals and cancellations. As we look at this, it probably does mean that a large number of those airplanes will go to different customers than were originally planned. So operationally, how do you go about re-configuration of these airplanes? Particularly, you've got a supply chain that would be involved here that sort of - it's in a very difficult situation. And have you assumed costs associated with re-configuration and re-marketing of these airplanes in the BCA provisions you've taken so far? Greg Smith : Yes, the short answer is, yes. We have Doug. So we've assessed all 450 and put a risk assessment against all of those aircraft. And then took a provision for that we believe we will have to either re-market or re-configure some of those aircraft. And that's something obviously, that we'll continue to monitor and update on. But we've assumed that that will take place with some of those aircraft, just again, by the discussions we've been having with our customers. Doug Harned : But just physically this could be - I mean this is different than anything that I've ever seen you had to deal with in the past in terms of scale. I mean operationally how do you think about doing that? Greg Smith : Yes well, the team - like I said, we're trying to stay ahead of these things, so anticipating this as a possibility, quite frankly some time ago. The team has gone through and got clear understanding about how would you go about doing this systematically, where would we do it, how much configuration would take place. Obviously, with the MAX as you know, it's fairly limited. You're not dealing with the wide-body so impact on the supply chain, quite frankly I don't really see it much. It's going to be more basic re-configuration and, in some cases, possibly customers take them configured as is and they reconfigure them. So I think, you're going to see a variety in how this plays out. But again, we're anticipating, we're going to do some of it and we're trying to get ahead of it. And I think getting those plans in place today, and if it's better than that great. If it isn't, we'll be ready and facilitized to be able to do it. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Robert Stallard : Greg, I was wondering if you could give us some more clarity on what's in your plan with regard to these 737 MAX deliveries. You said you expected to deliver most of them in the first year after re-certification or re-entry into service. But could you give us some idea of exactly what that number is and what the sort of cash impact of that would be? Thank you. Greg Smith : Yes, no like I think we've been consistent to say, hey look, we want to get those airplanes delivered and that's the majority of them in the first year. So there'll be airplanes that are outside that first year, but the majority will take place in the first year. Rob, this is just based on discussions we're having with customers in sequencing those airplanes out. And we'll continue to focus on again, relieving the inventory off the ramp, which then again, that informs the production rate. So we got to focus there, first and then ramp up production and clear the ramp. So we can complete the airplanes coming out of production. So it moves around certainly, month-to-month quarter-to-quarter, but again, majority will remain in the first year, and then we'll see some of that trailing off over time, just again, based on customer preference. Robert Stallard : Just a quick follow-up because that would seem to imply a very large number of aircraft deliveries in the next almost 12 months when obviously airline conditions are very weak, are most of these going to replacement is that the best way to look at this? Greg Smith : Yes, certainly I mean, they've got the fleet plans in place. And so again, what informs it is our discussions with them around quantity, and around timing and sequencing. So it - all of that's informing kind of how we front-load this thing. But look, Robbie, could it move here and there from month-to-month and from quantity of airplane outside this profile. Sure it could, but as we see it today, we see the majority of those, again, informed by the customer. We certainly have the ability and we're capacitized to deliver them, and as you know they are completed aircraft. So, the cycle time from turn that airplane on and getting into the hands of the customer is pretty short. So we've got that, again that flexibility in our favor here and we'll adapt accordingly based on the needs of the customer. Maurita Sutedja : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : And our last question will come from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Cai von Rumohr : So a follow-up to Rob's question so, if you're going to ramp to 31 a month going until 2022, you've got to be building close to 200 planes or more in 2021. And if you deliver 400 plus planes the inventory goes down by 200, but you still have 250, 300 of lot of planes. And we're only seeing it makes sense to go to 31 if you felt your skyline called for delivering more 737s in 2022 than in 2021, is that correct? Greg Smith : Well Cai, I'd say look, the production rate increases, Dave said it, I said it, it's going to be slow and gradual on the production side building up to 31 in that timeframe. In conjunction with that will be the delivery again off the ramp, and that will really inform the production rate, but it's a very gradual slow rate build-up to that 31 and that could adjust based on how we deliver off the ramp or any further information we gather from the customers. Again, the supply chain, we have the inventory clearly on hand, as you've seen. And so, if we could go up quicker, we certainly assess that, but - and I'll let Dave weigh in here, but stability is going to be job one. It's ensuring that we move up methodically and stabilized, not have travel work, first-time quality. We'll do an assessment then we'll move up to the next rate. And then, again, we'll be informed of how quickly we are clearing the inventory off the ramp. I don't know, Dave, if you had any more to add on the production side. David Calhoun : Yes, I don't really have anything more to add, other than again, think about our posture in the middle of next year if in fact, things are beginning to return, customers are beginning to see the virus in the rearview mirror, vaccines are being discussed and described. I really believe that the toughest part of our puzzle as I said, going forward is going to be then returning to rates that satisfy what I think will be a reasonably robust return to the market. So that's part of our math here, but what Greg said holds, for most of the year, next year, the governor on rate is going to be the pace at which we sell that finished goods inventory. Cai von Rumohr : But as you look today, does it look 2022 you will deliver more than 2021 without getting into the numbers? Greg Smith : Yes. David Calhoun : I sure hope so. Cai von Rumohr : Okay. Thank you. David Calhoun : That's the plan, Cai. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Maurita Sutedja : Thank you. So that completes The Boeing Company's second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Thank you all for joining.",

The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst question-and-answer session, are being broadcast live over the Internet. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I am turning the call over to Ms. Maurita Sutedja, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Boeing Company. Ms. Sutedja, please go ahead. Maurita Sutedja : Thank you, John, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. I'm Maurita Sutedja, and with me today are Dave Calhoun, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Executive Vice President of Enterprise Operations and Chief Financial Officer. After management comments, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. And as a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com.  Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections, estimates and goals we include in our discussion this morning are likely to involve risks, which are detailed in our news release, in our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures. Now I will turn the call over to Dave Calhoun. David Calhoun : Thank you, Maurita, and good morning, everyone. Before I get started today, I want to take a moment to remember those who lost their lives on Lion Air flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines flight 302. Tomorrow will mark the 2-year anniversary of the Lion Air accident. Not a day goes by that we don't remember, reflect, rededicate ourselves to ensuring accidents like these never happen again. Our deepest sympathies are with the family members and their loved ones today and every day.  It's been about 9 months since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. I hope you are all continuing to stay safe and healthy during these very challenging times. Let's turn to our business update on Slide 2. The pandemic is having broad and deep impacts across the globe on health, on the economy, on global trade and, of course, our travel industry. We're focused on the health and safety of our employees and our communities, while close -- while working closely with our customers and suppliers to navigate through this global pandemic to rebuild stronger on the other side. There's no doubt that this moment is among the most difficult in our more than 100-year history. Through it all, I remain confident in Boeing's long-term future. Let me start today by providing some key updates from across the business. As you know, the COVID-19 impacts on our commercial customers continue to be devastating, and airlines have cut back operations dramatically. We are engaged with our customers every day to understand their short-term, their medium-term and their long-term fleet needs so that we can align our supply and demand. We're also working together across the industry to enhance the safety and well-being of passengers and crews during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through our Confident Travel initiative, we are collaborating industry-wide to develop multiple layers of protection to minimize health risks for passengers and crew throughout the travel journey. Boeing aircraft are designed to maximize cabin air quality using high-efficiency particulate air or HEPA filters that trap 99.9% of particulates. And the air in an airplane is exchanged a minimum of 20 to 30 times per hour. That compares to 2 to 5 times per hour in a typical building environment.  As we further enhance health measures, we have also entered into patent and technology licenses with partners in this field to manufacture an ultraviolet, or UV wand, to better sanitize airplane interiors. Of course, in-cabin technologies like the HEPA filter and this UV wand also have to be combined with personal responsibility of passengers and crews, including wearing face masks and taking other precautions, all of which are critical to creating a safe travel experience.  We're seeing encouraging industry data validating the safety of air travel. Recently, IATA published data outlining that of the over 1 billion people who have traveled by air this year, there have been fewer than 50 documented cases of transmission. This research was reinforced by a recent study by the U.S. Transportation Command and United Airlines that found the risk of contracting COVID-19 while flying is very low. We know this will be top of mind for anyone traveling, and we're here to support our customers every step of the way.  This period of reduced air travel underscores how fundamentally the aerospace industry is to the global economy, to global trade and to global cooperation. Our airline customers and suppliers not only employ millions of workers, they also serve as a connecting and driving force to the entire global economy. That's why we fully support our airline customers in their continued discussions with the U.S. and global governments on potential additional support during this pandemic. I'm certain leaders at every level of government understand the important role airlines serve in our country.  We're also doing everything we can to support our global suppliers, and their stability remains a very key watch item. It only takes one part of our -- one part to delay production of an aircraft or delay service delivery, so we have to work together as an industry to get through these difficult times.  Internally, we're also taking tough but necessary action to adapt to the new market reality and transform our business to be sharper and more resilient for the long term. As we shared last quarter, we continue to resize and reshape our business to align with our smaller market. COVID-19's continued impacts have had a more prolonged and deeper impact on our industry, and we'll have to further reduce our workforce. Each of our business units and functions will carefully make staffing decisions that prioritize natural attrition and stability in order to limit the impact on our people and our business. With this approach, we expect additional voluntary and involuntary reductions. Combined with natural attrition, these reductions will bring the size of our workforce to around 130,000 employees by the end of next year. We will continue to assess our market and adjust our plans as appropriate. These decisions are not easy. They represent critical actions to ensure we're able to navigate through this global pandemic and be in a position to deliver for our customers on the other side. As we work through these challenging times, our focus on our values and our priorities has not and will not waver. We are working tirelessly to strengthen our culture, to improve our transparency, rebuild trust and ensure we are always delivering the highest safety and quality standard.  We continue to implement a series of meaningful changes announced 1 year ago to strengthen the safety practices and culture of our company. As we've shared, we stood up our new product and services safety organization and brought together over 50,000 teammates into a single engineering organization. We're also making significant progress on our enhanced enterprise safety management system, with an initial focus on our Commercial Airplanes business. We are working to ensure our system meets the regulators' tougher standards and reflects industry best practices as well as lessons learned from a number of independent reviews that have taken place over the past 18 months. We've also developed a racial equity and inclusion action plan. This will raise the bar for progress on key measures of equity and inclusion for our people and hold us accountable for clearing that bar. We also remain focused on sustaining critical investments in our business, innovating and operating to help make the world a better place for future generations. This quarter, we appointed a Chief Sustainability Officer, a leadership position dedicated to galvanizing and advancing our environmental, social and our governance priorities. This is an important step as we continue to elevate our focus on sustainability in partnership with our customers, our suppliers and our communities.  In the face of tremendous challenges we are all confronting, I am incredibly proud of how our teams have remained focused on meeting our customers' commitments. Working closely with the FAA and other global regulators, we're continuing to make steady progress toward the safe return to service of our 737. Over the past 1.5 years, there have been around 1,400 test and check flights, over 3,000 flight hours completed on the airplane. While we still have work ahead of us, we're encouraged by the rigorous certification and validation flights conducted by the FAA, by Transport Canada and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, EASA. The joint operational evaluation board featuring civil aviation authorities from the United States, from Canada, Brazil and the European Union also conducted its evaluations of updating [indiscernible]. We also continue to work closely with other global regulators, including the Civil Aviation Administration of China, among others.  These are important milestones in the certification process as our global regulators progress through a comprehensive, robust and transparent process, and we will continue to follow their lead in the steps ahead. Our assumption has not changed from last quarter. We continue to expect the necessary regulatory approvals to be obtained in time to support resumption of deliveries during the fourth quarter of this year. Of course, the actual time will ultimately be determined by the global regulators.  In addition to the 737, we're making progress across our commercial, defense, space and services businesses, and I'll highlight a few. Our 777-9 flight test program progressed through this quarter as the final test airplane joined the fleet. The U.S. Air Force and Boeing team were awarded the Collier Trophy for aerospace excellence for the X-37B autonomous spaceplane. Our Boeing defense systems team secured an important contract for 8 F-15EX advanced fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force. And also in the quarter, our T-7A Red Hawk advanced trainer earned the first eSeries designator from the U.S. Air Force, given to an aircraft that is designed, engineered, built and tested along a digital thread. And our Global Services signed -- team signed an agreement with GE Capital Aviation Services for 11 Boeing converted freighters and secured a 6-year support contract for Australian P-8As.  On the 777X, we continue to work with the regulators on certification work scope, including reflecting the learnings from the 737 cert process. As with any development program, these are -- there are inherent risks that can affect schedule. While we continue to drive towards entry into service in 2022, this timing will ultimately be influenced by certification requirements defined by the regulators. In addition to making progress across our programs, we're also taking action across the enterprise to transform our business and create additional competitive advantage. Greg will provide more details in his remarks. With that update in mind, let's turn to the next slide to discuss the industry environment. Earlier this month, we released our 2020 Boeing market outlook, which forecasts a total market value of $8.5 trillion over the next decade, down from $8.7 trillion a year ago due to the impact of the pandemic, most of the adjustment in the near term. Overall, the defense and space market remains significant and relatively stable, and we continue to see solid, global demand for our major programs. Nonetheless, the scale of government spending on COVID-19 response has the potential to add pressure on global defense spending in the future. Broad support for our defense portfolio was underscored by the $5 billion of orders that BDS booked in the third quarter across key franchise programs.  The market outlook for our government services business also remains stable, driven by both domestic and international military aircraft fleet expansions. Our global -- our government services, defense and space programs will help provide critical stability for us moving forward.  Turning to the commercial market. While many of our key long-term fundamentals remain intact, we project near-term market pressure with COVID-19. Airlines globally have begun to recover from the trough of greater than 90% decline in passenger traffic and revenue earlier this year. In fact, earlier this month, the TSA screened over 1 million passengers for the first time since mid-March. However, the overall recovery has been at a slower pace than we originally anticipated.  As the domestic market recovery continues, the international markets remain at all-time lows. August domestic passenger traffic was 49% of 2019 levels, a 51% decline, whereas international passenger traffic was only 12% of the prior year, an 88% decline.  International passenger traffic recovery remains challenged by the absence of a coordinated global policy on cross-border entry protocols. IATA recently lowered its 2020 passenger traffic forecast to a 66% decline versus prior forecast of 63% based on lower fourth quarter expectations and less international traffic.  Regional dynamics continue to evolve with bright spots in China, where domestic traffic has returned to around 2019 levels, while recovery in other regions has pulled back as COVID cases reemerge and government travel restrictions remain fluid. Airlines are incrementally returning their parked fleet to service, with approximately 3/4 of their pre-crisis fleet now active. At the same time, the active fleets are only seeing about 60% to 70% of their normal utilization rates, keeping global operations around half of pre-crisis levels. These mix trends will continue to drive an uneven recovery. The path ahead will be heavily dependent upon not only the virus but also wide-scale progress on rapid testing, coordinated policies to alleviate travel restrictions and timing and availability of a vaccine. As we look to the medium and long term, we see our original prognosis, more or less, still holds. Consistent with IATA and other industry groups, we still expect it will take around 3 years for travel to return to 2019 levels and a few years beyond that to return to long-term growth trends. Demand for narrow-body aircraft is expected to recover faster than wide-body demand as domestic and regional markets will outpace longer-haul international routes. Availability and wide distribution of a vaccine may help accelerate the demand improvement. However, in the near term, we expect continued uncertainties as the situation remains very dynamic with many variables.  Our 10-year commercial airplane market outlook is approximately 11% lower than what we assumed a year ago, with wide-bodies more significantly impacted than narrow bodies. From a 20-year perspective, we still see the impact of COVID, but to a lesser extent as traffic reverts to long-term trends over time. Near term, we also anticipate accelerated retirements, driving replacement demand up to approximately 48% of deliveries over the next 28 years -- 20 years. That compares to 44% as previously projected. As our customers focus on retiring their oldest and least efficient airplanes, new airplanes will allow the industry to reduce emissions and make future flying even more environmentally sustainable. Airplanes that we plan to deliver this year will be as much as 25% to 40% more fuel-efficient than the airplanes they're replacing.  As we see airlines adapt to these market realities, price differentiation and versatility will be key. Our market-leading product line remains well positioned to meet our customers' needs and supports airline plans to gain efficiencies as they reach for their emission goals. Our attractive portfolio and the diversity of our backlog provides a strong foundation for long-term success.  In the commercial services market, although we believe we've seen the low watermark in terms of demand, the recovery has been slow, and we continue to anticipate will take multiple years to reach previous demand levels. Accelerated retirements will also result in a newer fleet as we emerge from the pandemic impacts, which will reduce services demand and prolong its market recovery. Digital solutions are emerging as a critical enabler as customers focus on leaner operations. Life cycle services and support will help customers scale their operations to meet efficiency and cost objectives aligned to market recovery trends. Our broad services portfolio and deep customer knowledge position us well to support these customer needs.  Now let's turn to commercial airplane production rates on Slide 4. We've maintained our prior assumptions regarding our production rate plans across all commercial airplane programs. However, the market continues to be dynamic, and we will monitor as we prudently balance supply and demand. We're closely watching the international passenger traffic recovery, which, so far, has been weak, to assess downside risks to our wide-body program production rates, in particular, the 787. We still expect to produce the 737 at very low rates for the remainder of 2020 and gradually increase the rate to 31 by the beginning of 2022, and expect further gradual increases to correspond with market demand. We will continue to assess the delivery profile for 2021 as it will help inform if we need to adjust our 737 production rate ramp up. We will continue to keep our supply chain apprised of our plan.  At the end of the third quarter, we have 3,400 aircraft in our 737 backlog. Although this remains an unprecedented and uncertain time, we are confident air travel will return. And when it does, we will be positioned to support our customers.  And with that, let me turn it over to Greg. Gregory Smith : Great. Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's please turn to Slide 5. As Dave mentioned, this moment is among the most difficult in our company's 100-plus year history.  Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken prudent and decisive action in attempt to get ahead of this to preserve cash so that we can navigate this crisis and also reshape our business so that we can merge as a sharper, more resilient and more competitive company. We are being and will continue to be proactive and look around corners to assess risk factors and take appropriate action. We've been focused on derisking our business and a disciplined cash management for some time, and COVID-19 has accelerated these efforts further. I'll go through a quick time line of our early actions we've taken in 2020 and then provide you with an update of our transformation efforts.  Starting back in the middle of March, as the potential risk of the virus escalated, we took a proactive step to fully draw down on our $13.8 billion delayed draw term loan. Given the uncertainty of the markets at that time, we understood that this was a prudent step to bring that cash on our balance sheet. Almost immediately thereafter, we suspended our dividend and terminated our share repurchase authorization. Even then, at the early stage, it was clear to us that liquidity would be critical through this pandemic. These early decisive actions were critical and important. Next, in early April, we rolled out our first voluntary layoff program. We recognized the need to reduce our staffing levels, given the sharp reduction in commercial aircraft demand. And we took action to limit the impact on our teams as much as possible through voluntary opportunities first. This was followed by involuntary layoff programs. By the first quarter earnings, we announced additional actions, including reducing our commercial production rates, limiting discretionary spending and lower overall staffing levels by about 10%. While difficult, all these steps were critical in the early days of this global crisis. Shortly thereafter, we went to the bond market and raised $25 billion, which has proven to be instrumental to helping us navigate this crisis. The strong investor response reflected the confidence the overall market has in our future as well as the shift -- swift action that the U.S. government took to support the credit markets. Throughout the spring and summer, we stayed very closely engaged with our customers and suppliers, working to understand the impacts of the pandemic so that we could recalibrate our industry while maintaining as much stability as possible. And by the second quarter earnings, with a deeper understanding of the prolonged impact, we further reduced our commercial production rates and announced that we would further reduce our staffing levels. As you'll also recall at that point, we formally rolled out our business transformation efforts to assess every aspect of our business across 5 key pillars of infrastructure, overhead and organization, portfolio and investments, supply chain health and operational excellence. I'll share more updates on these shortly.  In August, we moved forward with our second voluntary layoff program, which was much broader than our initial program and included our executives, which are then followed by another involuntary layoff program. We managed this process very closely to ensure continuity where necessary, and to maintain confidence in our ability to deliver on our commitments to our customers.  Next, we rolled out a series of organizational realignments to streamline and simplify how we operate. Also, through our 787 study, it became evident that the consolidation to a single production location in South Carolina will make us more efficient and lower production and better positioned for the future. As a result, earlier this month, we made the decision to consolidate the 787 production in South Carolina by mid-'21. We are approaching these business transformation efforts with rigor and thoughtful evaluation at each step. We have made notable progress across all 5 pillars of our business transformation efforts. We will utilize this time when we are at the lower production rate environment to reinvent and to improve our business processes. First, regarding our infrastructure pillar. We're assessing our overall facility and site footprint in light of the reduced demand. The consolidation of the 787 production is an example of this. At the same time, we're also taking into account new flexible and virtual work opportunities. If you asked us 8 to 9 months ago if we thought a large portion of our workforce could work virtually while still being productive, you might have heard skepticism. But these last several months have shown us that we can be more flexible. Building on the lessons of our experiences, we're studying an enterprise footprint optimization effort, utilizing flexible and virtual workplace planning. We're starting with a few pilot programs over the coming months, which will help determine our best path forward. At the same time, we're also looking to make more efficient use of our square footage, and in some cases, reduce the overall footprint. Through staffing reductions and our flexible workplace program, we anticipate a reduction of approximately 30% in office space needs compared to our current capacity. We're reviewing every piece of real estate, every building, every lease, every warehouse, every site to look at how we can be more efficient, and we'll share our decisions as we make them. Turning to our overhead and organizational pillar. This is where we've been looking critically at our cost structure, at how Boeing operates and how we're organized, benchmarked to top-quartile standards so we can simplify, reduce layers, reduce bureaucracy, while ensuring we strengthen connections vital to safety, quality and performance. As an example, we're studying how we organize our production and development programs better by reducing the layers between program leadership and the factory floor, increasing our management spans and control, and improving direct and indirect ratios. These actions are aimed at enhancing communication, empowering our teams and creating lasting efficiencies in how we do our work.  Moving to our portfolio and investment pillar. We're shaping our portfolio and aligning our investments to focus on the core business, market opportunities and sustainability efforts. In addition to the impact in demand near term -- on near term, COVID-19 will also impact the timing of new market opportunities. Prior to the pandemic, we were investing for -- in growth markets and growing business. But as the market conditions have changed, have -- we have made swift decisions to adapt. You've seen us start to reprioritize our investments, and we will continue to do so and make prudent decisions going forward. We originally plan to invest over $6 billion this year. Through prioritization, we have pared back these investments by approximately $2 billion. That said, we have and we will continue to invest in all lines of our business. In fact, we've invested more than $60 billion over the last 10 years in key strategic areas of our business.  As we take action in this pillar, we will not lose sight of our future and the exciting technologies that will reshape the future of air travel. Our guiding principle here is that every decision we make must help us navigate through this difficult period while also not diminishing our future competitiveness.  Moving to supply chain pillars, Dave mentioned our suppliers are experiencing the same pressure that we are. Many of them are small businesses without our portfolio of diversity and scale. Our teams are actively talking to our suppliers every day. We have to work together as an industry to get through this difficult time so that we can come out of this healthy on the other side. We have made enhancements of our supply chain risk assessments and are closely monitoring each supplier, mitigating issues, exploring financing solutions and getting creative and supporting them in the best way we can.  The reality is that our industry as a whole will simply build less over the coming years. And we have to help our industry partners recalibrate to that lower demand in the near term, while maintaining stability as much as possible and positioning to return to growth in the medium to long term.  We're also transforming our transportation, warehouse and logistics approach to streamline our warehousing network, set enterprise standards and improve efficiencies. We're targeting a greater than 20% improvement to our internal material management costs while driving down our freight transportation spend and optimizing our warehousing operations. And we're also reducing our indirect and overhead spending on things like capital equipment, facility support and enterprise services. We have an opportunity to significantly reduce our overall indirect spending, and we will be closely managing this process to ensure we continue to drive the highest levels of safety and quality. Lastly, we're working diligently to accelerate operational excellence across the enterprise so that we can improve performance, enhance quality, safety, reduce rework and associated costs. The enterprise operations team successfully launched the formation of 4 company-wide process councils around supply chain, program management, quality and manufacturing. These councils are already driving integration and accelerating efforts to enhance program performance. We have simplified our structure to allow the process councils to lead on driving accountability and decision-making closer to the work that's being performed.  When and where we identify issues at a program level, we're implementing thorough corrections, transparency, sharing information with our customers and strengthening processes across the enterprise to enhance first-time quality in every program. These are just a few underway across the business. And over the coming weeks, months and years, we'll keep you up-to-date on the transformation journey.  Our focus here is clear. We're taking comprehensive action to preserve liquidity, navigate the pandemic, adapt to our new markets, improve performance and position our company for the future. As we take these actions, we're ensuring that every step only furthers our drive key efforts in safety, quality and delivering on our commitments. These efforts are meant to create meaningful and lasting change to how we operate and our cost structure.  The financial objectives we've established are measured in billions of dollars, and we expect them to be executed over a multiyear period. In the current environment, we must take these actions to adapt to lower demand. What we're trying to achieve here are sustainable, structural, lasting improvements in our performance that lay the foundation for future margin expansion and cash flow generation as the market recovers.  So with that, let's turn to Slide 6 for our third quarter results. Our financial results continue to be significantly impacted by COVID-19 and the 737 MAX grounding. Third quarter revenue of $14.1 billion reflects lower Commercial Airplane deliveries and commercial services volume, primarily, again, due to COVID-19.  Earnings in the quarter were also impacted by charges for BCA abnormal costs related to the 737 program and severance costs for the additional approximate 7,000 employees leaving the company through the end of '21. These impacts were partially offset by an income tax benefit related to the NOL carryback provision in the CARES Act as well as the impact of pretax losses.  Let's now move to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 7. Revenue was $3.6 billion, reflecting lower Commercial Airplane deliveries due to the significant impacts of the pandemic, as well as 787 quality issues and associated rework. BCA third quarter operating margins declined primarily due to lower delivery volume and a $590 million of abnormal costs related to the 737 program.  Similar to prior period, in preparation for our third quarter financial statements, we have made certain assumptions on production rates across all programs as well as the 737 MAX delivery profile. As Dave mentioned, we've assumed that the timing of the regulatory approvals will enable 737 deliveries to resume during the fourth quarter of 2020.  We currently have approximately 450 737 MAX aircraft built and stored in inventory. We expect to have to remarket some of these aircraft and potentially reconfigure them, which will extend the delivery time frame. We now expect delivery of about half of the aircraft currently in storage by the end of next year and the majority of the remaining in the following year. Delivery from storage will continue to be our priority after assisting our customers with their return to service. We expect the 737 MAX delivery timing, along with the production rate ramp-up profile to continue to be dynamic as they will ultimately be dictated by the pace of the commercial market recovery, which has been slow and remains uncertain. There is no material change in the estimate for the total abnormal cost of $5 billion, and we expect these costs will be expenses incurred over this year and next year. During the third quarter, we expensed $590 million of abnormal production costs, which brought the cumulative abnormal cost expense to date to $2.1 billion.  Our assessment of the liability for the estimated potential concessions and other considerations to customers for disruptions related to the 737 MAX grounding and associated delivery delays did not change significantly in the third quarter. Cumulatively, we've accrued a $9.1 billion liability for the estimated potential concessions and other considerations. To date, we've made $3.1 billion of payments to customers in cash and other forms of compensation, including $500 million we paid this quarter. We have settlement agreements covering approximately $2.6 billion of the remaining liability balance of $6 billion. We continue to address the impact individually customer by customer, including assessing the efforts that the MAX disruption is having on their operations in light of the COVID impact. We also continue to expect any concessions or other considerations to be provided over a number of years with the cash impact to be more front-end loaded in the first few years. Any changes to these assumptions could require us to recognize additional financial impacts. Commercial Airplanes backlog includes more than 4,300 aircraft valued at $313 billion. The decline in backlog in the third quarter reflected the aircraft order cancellations and the removal of aircraft orders from our backlog due to ASC 606 accounting standards. As you saw in the second and third quarter, our production has outpaced our delivery rate. And we expect this to continue in the near term, resulting in higher finished goods inventory. We have a large number of undelivered 787 aircraft in inventory, and we are working with our customers to facilitate their deliveries. The burn down of 787 inventory over the next few months will largely be influenced by the pace of delivery activities, which has been and expected to remain relatively slow due to the additional time we're taking to inspect and ensure each of our 787s are delivered to our highest quality standards.  We're also closely watching the international passenger traffic recovery, which so far has been weak and is more challenging than what we anticipated last quarter. The trend going forward is heavily dependent on the virus, testing, coordinated policies to alleviate travel restrictions and timing and availability of a vaccine. We will continue to assess the downside risk of our production rates going forward. Let's now move to Defense, Space & Security on Slide 8. Third quarter revenue decreased slightly to $6.8 billion, reflecting derivative aircraft award timing, partially offset by higher fighter volume. Third quarter operating margin decreased to 9.2%, primarily reflecting less favorable performance, including a $67 million KC-46A tanker charge due to continued COVID-19 disruptions and productivity inefficiencies. During the quarter, BDS won key contract awards worth $5 billion, including a contract extension for the International Space Station for NASA and a contract for 9 additional Chinook Block II helicopters for the United States Army Special Ops. Our backlog now stands at $62 billion, with 30% from outside of the United States.  Let's now turn to Boeing Global Services results on Slide 9. In the third quarter, Global Services revenue declined to $3.7 billion, driven by lower commercial services volume due to COVID-19. This was partially offset by higher government service volume. Operating margin in the quarter reflected lower commercial services volume and an additional 7 truck costs.  During the quarter, BGS won key contracts worth approximately $3 billion, which brings its backlog now to $17 billion. Although we saw a slight uptick in service demand in the third quarter, we predict the recovery would take multiple years, and we continue to take action to position our services business for the future. This includes not only employment actions and inventory rightsizing, but also making sure we have the right product, right service solutions to help our customers and industry navigate the downturn and scale their operations as near-term demand trends upward. Let's now turn to cash flow on Slide 10. The disruption caused by COVID-19 on our airlines and the global economy continues to put significant pressure on our cash receipts. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was negative $4.8 billion driven by commercial -- lower Commercial Airplane delivery volume, advanced payment timing and commercial services volume. We achieved solid cash generation from our government programs and continue to expect future cash flow to be roughly in line with earnings from our government side of the business. The continued slow and uneven commercial market recovery is significantly impacting our cash flow and increasing pressure in the near term. We currently expect 2021 cash flow to be much improved from 2020, driven mainly by deliveries and inventory burn down associated with 737 and 787 programs. And we anticipate the cash profile to continue to improve further from '21 to 2022. While we're still aiming to turn cash positive in late '21, the recovery and the continued elevated virus cases make the path much more challenging. Based on what we know today, it's looking more likely that we will be cash flow-positive in the 2022 time frame.  Our cash flow trajectory will clearly be dependent on the pace of commercial market recovery and how customer deliveries progress moving forward. Progress on testing protocols, government travel restrictions and vaccine will be the pacing items. And we will continue to diligently work opportunities and monitor risk factors, given the dynamic nature of this current environment.  Let's move now to Slide 11, and we'll discuss our liquidity position. We continue to proactively manage our cash and assess our liquidity daily through this challenging time. We ended the third quarter with strong liquidity, including $27.1 billion of cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet and access to our $9.5 billion bank credit facility, which remains undrawn as well as continuing to assess the capital markets. Our debt balance at the end of the quarter was $61 billion. And through the end of the year, we have just under $4 billion of debt maturing. To further bolster our liquidity as we work through the impacts of this pandemic, we may seek to refinance that maturing debt in the fourth quarter this year.  In addition, we've decided to use Boeing's stock rather than cash to fund our company contribution to employees' 401(k) plans for the foreseeable future. This will preserve approximately $1 billion of cash gradually over the next 12 months. We also plan to make a discretionary contribution to our defined benefit pension plan in the fourth quarter, totaling $3 billion, which will also be funded by Boeing's stock. This move will further strengthen the funded status of our retirement plans to benefit our employees and retirees while improving our balance sheet position and minimizing future cash outflows. As we mentioned previously, we expect our use of cash due to COVID-19 to continue for the remainder of this year and into '21. Therefore, proactively managing our liquidity and balance sheet leverage will continue to be top priorities as we navigate this challenging environment. Once cash flow generation returns to more normal levels, reducing our debt levels will be our key focus area. These actions reflect our continued derisking strategy and as part of our balanced approach to ensuring we proactively meet future obligations. We worked hard in the past to maintain disciplined cash management while seeking opportunities to strengthen our balance sheet, and we will continue these efforts.  Let's just now turn to the last slide to summarize. We covered a lot today, but I want to provide you further clarity on our approach and our actions in addressing the profound impact the pandemic has had on our company and our industry. Through this tough time, we have focused on the health and safety of our employees and communities while working closely with our customers and suppliers to navigate this global pandemic and rebuild stronger on the other side. We also remain focused on achieving our priorities in transforming our business to adapt to this new market reality. As we've outlined today, we took decisive early actions to adapt, and we will continue to do so going forward. We've got the right team in place. They are focused. And we will continue to transform our business across the 5 pillars.  As challenging as this situation has been and currently is, we continue to be confident in our long-term market outlook. The mission today is clear : Stay laser-focused on the market dynamics, take proactive action across all aspects of our business with all eyes on liquidity, and emerge stronger and more resilient. We're committed to executing on actions that position our company and our industry for the future.  So with that, I'll turn it over to Dave for some closing comments. David Calhoun : Yes. Greg, thanks. This has been a year unlike any other, and we're facing unprecedented challenges in our company, our industry and our communities. I'm proud of our team, and I thank them for the tremendous work they've done through these difficult circumstances. The long-term industry fundamentals remain strong. Air travel will recover. Our portfolio of products and technology is well positioned, and I'm confident in our future. With that, Greg and I will be happy to take your questions, and I'll turn it back to Maurita. Thank you. Maurita Sutedja : John, we're ready for the analyst question now. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Douglas Harned : I'd like to understand more about the path back on MAX deliveries once we've got ungrounding, which hopefully will not be in too long. And as we look at it, you've got some number, about 450 airplanes parked, with production on a slow ramp. So -- but there are a number of issues. Like modifications will be needed for -- to these airplanes for recertification. You have an FAA inspection process that we think would affect delivery timing. And many of these parked airplanes will need to be reconfigured for other customers. So how do you think about the start-up of deliveries once ungrounding happens given these issues?  And then lastly, given the demand challenges out there due to COVID, what will ultimately be the governing factors for the timing of your ramp in deliveries over the next year or so? David Calhoun : Yes. So there's a lot embedded, of course, in answering that question. But remember, this RTS, return to service, we've been working on this for a very, very long time. So we're confident airplanes are ready, and they will be delivered. And the cert process itself, as in ticketing each airplane, while that's somewhat new, that's a process that has been rehearsed and rehearsed and rehearsed between us and our regulator. It doesn't mean it's going to fly through.  On the other hand, I don't actually expect much delay in that process. I think we've provisioned for that. And our guess about how quickly we return these deliveries here in December, I think it's going to be fairly conservatively planned. And I think we can do better than that.  But with respect to midterm, all of the early deliveries of 737s will be, of course, to the customers who are on contract and where we will not have to do mods, et cetera. And then as we begin to think about the longer -- or the end of that stream of inventoried airplanes which do not yet have homes, we think we're going to be able to do, within cycle times, all of the reconfigurations that are going to be required. And we have to be ready for that, and our teams have positioned themselves to be ready for that.  And then the final thing I would just suggest is that what will be hostage to the movement of those airplanes will be our production rate. We're determined not to create a bigger problem than we started with. And so that production rate will stay low until the movement of those airplanes and then those that need mods are scheduled and work scope is in place such that we can predict their delivery and then, therefore, begin to inch up our production rates again.  So that's going to be pretty fluid. Your question suggests that, and my answer suggests that. But I am confident that, that all happens. And then there is a moment, honestly, somewhere in the middle of next year when maybe we're over the second wave, and maybe there's a vaccine, and maybe it's being distributed. And then all of a sudden, everyone's waking up to renewed schedules, and the psychology will lend itself, in my opinion, to a little bit of a run on the bank with respect to narrow-body airplanes. And we'll see about that. I may be dead wrong. But frankly, that's as much of my worry as just moving the airplanes we've got; it's going to be the response when the recovery really does come. I want to make sure we're stable and ready for that. Operator : Our next question's from David Strauss with Barclays. David Strauss : I wanted to ask, I guess, first of all, on the MAX, the 450 or so that you have in storage, what proportion of your customers have actually reaffirmed that they want to take aircraft in either '21 or '22? Because it seems like pretty much everyone's come out and said that they want very few airplane.  And then on the 87, why not take the rate down earlier, given how much inventory you've already built on that aircraft? I think you have somewhere around 50 airplanes in storage. Gregory Smith : Yes. Look, on the 787, David, most of the inventory that we have is the result of the quality assessment that we've been doing and the rework associated with it. It's more heavily weighted there than it is customers not able to take the aircraft.  So as I mentioned, we're going to have a big fourth quarter on deliveries here, and again, paced by our inspections and quality effort. And then that will pick up in '21.  But as Dave said and I think I reiterated, that we're continuing to assess the wide-body market on a day-to-day basis and particularly linked to how we're seeing international coming back. So we're being, I think, very clear-eyed around who we've got in the backlog, the probability of delivery, the time frame, the potential movements of aircraft. And then where we've got unsold positions, what's the real probability there and risk assessing that.  So that's going to continue to be our discipline, but we're, again, very diligently focused on it. And if we have to make further adjustments down, then we certainly will to match the demand.  And maybe I'll just jump on the 37 and then hand it back to Dave. But look, on the profile around the 37s that we've got parked, really, 3 major kind of, I'd say, kind of ways we look at it. Obviously, you've seen the cancellations and contractual changes, and sometimes, those contractual changes are recontracting the airplanes to move out to further time frames. We're assessing the financial conditions of every customer and assessing that health, and then just other, I'll say, potential delivery risks, which is really tied to the recovery and the challenges across the globe with the pandemic.  So all those taken into account, we go through a pretty thorough risk assessment over that profile, including, obviously, day-to-day contact with our customers and their ability to take the aircraft in certain time frames.  But look, I'll tell you, it's dynamic. It moves around. We've got a team that's dedicated to that skyline and engaging with those customers, and we're making adjustments real time. But at the same time, doing our own risk assessment. And that is a clear eye towards liquidity. If we see more risk, how do we bolster our liquidity? If that risk does not materialize, then it's upside for us. But we're doing that to really kind of understand, I'll say, the band of risk from the baseline plan that we have in place. I don't know, Dave, if you had anything you want to add. David Calhoun : Yes. No. I mean, it's as fluid as anything you could imagine. So again, I'm not -- I don't want to suggest that we know everything about everything. I will suggest, in light of what we have to do through -- for the accountants and for ourselves, we tend to be more conservative than our customers are with respect to their intentions. So yes, probably more than half are, in fact, planned for customers have already been through adjustments, and we're ready to go do what we're going to do. But we tend to be more conservative than they are on this front because we have to be.  Anyway, it's not a perfect world. We'll continue to update it each and every week and month, and we'll keep you informed. But we are where we are now. Operator : Our next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Greg, I think you mentioned you're unlikely to be cash positive in 2021. Can you help us square that, especially in light of some of the MAX production comments on 31 a month in 2022, which would lead us to believe some inventory unwind. And you haven't really changed production rates quarter-over-quarter. So what are the biggest drags on 2021 cash, whether it's BCA profitability, inventory or PDPs or concessions? Gregory Smith : Yes. Probably a little bit of everything, Sheila, around that. I mean, certainly, it's become more challenging just as we've seen continued elevations of the virus, and then, therefore, the customer dialogues around the specific timing around, in particular, delivery. So all of that backdrop has made '21 more challenging. I'd say key drivers from '20 to '21, which we expect, again, '21 to be better than '20, it's the same elements. It's certainly the 737 return to service and that ramp up, in particular, near-term focus on the parked fleet. And then the 787 inventory build, as you mentioned, that timing of the transition between this year and next year will give us some cash headwind. But overall, it's just gotten a little more challenging, specifically around whether it's PPs or actually delivery slots that's made '21 -- again, we're still shooting for it.  But having said that, based on everything we know today, it really is looking more likely that cash flow positive is going to be in the '22 time frame. But like I said, we'll continue to work it, but that's how we see it today. Operator : And next, we'll go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Ronald Epstein : Maybe a bigger picture question for both of you. It really does seem in the narrow-body market like Boeing is, I think it's been [indiscernible] fact at this point, is losing share to Airbus. I guess my question for both of you is, one, do you see it as a problem? And if you do, how can you address it given all the constraints that confront the company today? David Calhoun : Yes. So let me take this one. Market share, without a doubt, we've lost some share. When you don't produce an airplane for a year and the other guy does, by definition, you take a big hit with respect to share.  With respect to future competitions and our airplane competing against their airplane, I don't -- I'm not going to give up any ground, and I don't believe we will. I don't think our airplane will. They have a particular part of their narrow-body fleet, the 321, that's got advantages for certain routes, without a doubt. Our airplane, in the middle part of that route, with respect to efficiency and environmental performance, frankly, and seat cost, gives us an advantage. And I'm not sure how the mix of the market is going to ultimately play out with respect to the number of routes in each. But I'm not worried about the 737 family competing against the A320 family.  And then with respect to wide-bodies, of course, I think we enjoy a big advantage, and I think we will continue that advantage despite the fact that the market's going to have a rough time. And it's going to take a while to get back.  So yes, no, I'm not sitting around, sucking my thumb that we're disadvantaged with respect to our product offering. And then the next product's going to come along. We have some incredible underlying technologies that are going to support the point design of that next airplane. We're going to assess this market based on everything that's happened in the last year and probably the next year. And I think we'll be able to call out that point design and pull these underlying technologies that we think will create a winning airplane.  So we're not out of the development business. We're still in it. This time -- or I will call it deferral of the NMA or whatever that slot was, this is actually going to advantage us in determining the point design based on what I think are some changing market conditions. But we never let up on the underlying technologies, and we will not let up. And our spending today covers those things. So yes, I'm -- I believe we've got a very competitive product line, and I'm not, in any way, going to give up any room with respect to our competitor on that front. Operator : Our next question is from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Carter Copeland : Greg, I wondered, could you speak to whether there were any changes in your program margin assumptions across the portfolio? Obviously, the big decision on the South Carolina consolidation, and that was a pretty low program margin for the last quarter Q. But just in general, all these cost-out actions and the impact of those and what that means for your assumptions around cost and profit, whatnot. Any color you could give us would be helpful. Gregory Smith : Yes. I'd say not significant change within the quarter on the booking rates, Carter. 777 was up a little bit. 87 was up a little bit. And then we were down slightly on 37 and 47 a little bit on 67. Some of that is, as you said, customer mix. Some of it's cost, and some of it's escalation. So not a lot of movement within the quarter on program. Carter Copeland : Okay. And with respect to the comments you had on the skyline and managing the skyline, are there any kind of broader observations or themes in how that skyline is settling out from a customer type or regional standpoint, where those planes are going or how that process is evolving? Gregory Smith : Yes. I can't sit here and say there's any specific themes. I know it's probably an overused term, but it's dynamic. So in each situation where the customer is different. It's different considering their own liquidity, access to liquidity, what their planned fleets are, what they were and what's happening within their region with regards to any government restrictions on travel. So it really varies by customer and then within time frames because some customers want to remain and have remained committed to taking deliveries but needed to move them out to the right for a variety of reasons.  So you can imagine, again, this is tail-by-tail, customer-by-customer weekly assessments by the teams that are engaging with customers. So we have a good line of sight, but recognizing we've got to be agile in it's dynamic. But then again, applying our own risk assessment to just look at it through a liquidity and cash lens to ensure that if we do see any risk building, how do we stay ahead of it? And that's the action, certainly, that we've been taking to date, and that relates to my comments around the debt maturing that we may seek to refinance in the fourth quarter as well as the actions we're taking with the pension and the 401(k).  So I can't say if there's anything specific that comes to mind as a common thread throughout other than, obviously, the significant impact the pandemic's is having on everybody. Operator : And next, we go to Jon Raviv with Citi. Jonathan Raviv : So just talking about defense for a moment, I think it's a pretty important part of the cash flow generation story here. But when you look at it, it doesn't seem to be growing much this year. The margins are a bit lumpy. Backlog's really kind of in the 1x, below 1x area. So what's going on there?  And maybe you can give us a full picture, including BGS government. And how do you see the future of the total defense enterprise developing over the next few years? Everyone's is seeing decelerating growth next year. Can you guys sort of change that dynamic? Gregory Smith : Maybe I'll take a shot on the top line and the margin, and then I'll hand it over to Dave. But this is a year, certainly, if you take the production programs, steady production across whether it's the fighter business or in the rotorcraft business. But this is a year of transition, in particular, for the development programs on the T-7A and the MQ-25 and residential aircraft. So obviously, once those get out of development and start to move their way into production, you'll see the, I'll say, the modest growth associated with that.  I think, Jon, domestically, we're continuing to see good support for our core programs. But at the same time, I mean, we're competing to win there. So we're -- all this transformation effort doesn't just apply to commercial, it's really coming off the heels of what a lot of the effort we do at BDS for some time. But that mix of portfolio, Jon, on the development side is certainly impacting the margin here near term. And then as we've seen, we've had COVID impact on the defense business, and it's been disruptive that we're experiencing on KC-46 and we've experienced on a couple of other programs this year. But outside of that, I think, again, once we move into production on the development programs, and there's no question that we've got to improve our performance on development -- overall development programs, we expect to see a more stable, growing margin there as well. I don't know, Dave, if you have anything to add. David Calhoun : Yes. The only thing I would comment on is, one, I feel great about the franchise broadly. In our services business broadly, government now is the majority of that business. And it continues to go quite well. So I do expect some growth in that.  Two, our resource planning has not, in any way, tried to strangle government. In fact, it's been the opposite. So almost all of the reductions net that we've described across the company have been applied against our commercial franchise, so that we're not starving something in our defense business as a result of the difficulties we're having in our commercial business.  And finally, the tanker. The tanker has been a drag on us for like 3 or 4 years in every way you can think of with respect to investors. But we are beginning to clear the hurdle with our customer with respect to its performance in their fleet and then their need for that tanker. So that whole relationship, I believe, will begin to transition next year. And as opposed to being a drag on our franchise it's been, I believe it will become a strength in our franchise.  So I just -- I think in combination with what Greg said, I think that's the situation. I will say, and I said it this morning, we're not planning on defense spending to go up in any appreciable way. In fact, we believe there will be pressure on defense spending as a result of all the COVID-related spending that's been -- that governments around the world have been experiencing. So I don't think we're looking at that world through rose-colored glasses. I expect real pressure on that market. Operator : Our next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Seth Seifman : Kind of a two part question on China, one kind of specific and one bigger picture. I mean, specifically, when you think about your production and delivery expectations for 737, what are you assuming in terms of when you get certification from Chinese authorities?  And then second of all, when we look at the 20-year forecast, and we see China is such a big market for new aircraft, and we think about increasingly explicit strategic competition between the two countries and their efforts over that 20-year time frame to break into the market, how do you plan for that over time? And how do you see it potentially eroding the market? David Calhoun : Yes. So there's a narrow question and a giant question together. So let me start with the narrow one with respect to our narrow-body deliveries. We attempted quite a while ago to derisk our delivery stream on the inventoried airplanes such that we pushed out the Chinese airplanes for later delivery. And at the same time, we've had a team on the field with the CAAC, the certification body in China, for probably a better part of 2 months. And they are working through that process just like the FAA and the EASA did here in Europe. And it's been going quite well and productively, and all the technical people are lined up, et cetera. So I'm confident that, that process will happen, and then ultimately, we can get back to deliveries. And as everyone knows, China is back in business. And the airlines need this kind of lift, and we happen to be 1 of 2 people in the world that can deliver it. And that will be that way for quite a while.  So we've had great relationships. We continue to have them. We're going to continue to manage it, and we know that there is going to be, over time, a competitive threat there. We're not afraid of it. We're going to continue to do what's right for our customers. When that threat shows up, what form it takes, ultimately, how it wants to compete around the world, we will -- we'll be up for that round of competition. I don't think that is for quite a while. And I've been around that discussion since the year 2000.  So anyway, I have great respect for China and what they want to accomplish here. But I'm -- the long view is still going to have to remain a constructive view with respect to Boeing and China, and that's where we're positioned. Operator : Next, we'll go to Rob Spingarn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Robert Spingarn : Greg, I wanted to ask you a little further on cost. You talked about reducing the footprint and is laser-focused on cost. I wanted to just explore how we think about the excess capacity that gets created in Everett with the 787 leaving and the 747 concluding. I mean, is it -- would you think about moving MAX up there at some point? Or does this next aircraft that Dave alluded to go there? How do we think about that? Gregory Smith : Yes. Just maybe just stepping back, as I mentioned in the remarks, I mean, we're looking at all of our space around the globe, Rob, and looking for ways to be more efficient. And that's certainly as we see it today with the work that's in there, but as Dave said in his response to some of the BDS question, we're not -- we're looking forward as well. So we're trying to take all of that into consideration and be strategic about it.  But the fact is that all of our facilities are not fully utilized, and we need to get them fully utilized. And we got to do that in a very methodical way and do it as a company and doing it together about how do we think about, strategically, how do we get our utilization improved and overall efficiency.  So it doesn't really just center around one site. I mean, that's certainly an important part of it. But it's every building, every lease, every office space, looking at current near-term demands, but also kind of future potential opportunities and so on. And every one of our decisions is going to be looking through all those lenses before we make it.  But make no mistake about it. It's all about being more efficient and having improved utilization. As I mentioned, just in office space alone, we're targeting something like a 30% reduction there, and we'll continue to do so. And like I said, it's across all aspects of real estate. So more to come on it. We're... Robert Spingarn : Right. So you're not ruling out big changes? David Calhoun : We're not ruling out -- no, we're not ruling out big changes. But just by way of how we think about it, that Everett space that's freed up, I mean, we're going to line it off for quite a while because I don't want to move lines from one place to another just because it's available. And for the most part, our reinvigoration of all things lean in Boeing, and this is really related to workflow and the use of the capacity that we have, will suggest that we can actually produce a lot more in the same or even smaller footprint than we do today. So we're going to stay on that program, and we're going to line off the things that get freed up as a result of decisions like the 787 and the 47, et cetera.  And we're not going to just try to fill it. We also need the market to return. We need to see where all the demands really ultimately play out and where that next footprint really needs to sit. We know we have some great skills in that area, there's no doubt. And that matters a lot, and that will factor. But we're not just going to try to fill empty space. That would be -- that would not be in our best interest. Operator : Our next question is from Myles Walton with UBS. Myles Walton : The question I had was really a clarification leading to a question. So the clarification on the $1 billion of equity sale stock towards the 401(k) sort of on an annual basis, I guess, on a go-forward basis, and then the $3 billion to the pension plan. Is that $3 billion prefund for a number of years, such that it's sort of a one-and-done for a few years? And then is the 401(k) more of an ongoing?  And then, Greg, is this open -- the question, obviously, to a broader equity issuance to rebalance the portfolio -- the balance sheet, rather, above and beyond what this is. What would make you consider that? Gregory Smith : Yes. No. I mean, well, first of all, the way you're thinking about the 401(k) and pension is right. So the pension will be -- really is, like I said, it's an attempt to really minimize the outflow over the next several years. So as we see it today, contributing the stock at an amount of $3 billion really takes that risk off the table. So ultimately, it should help our cash flow profile going forward.  And like I said, the 401(k) is, yes, it's more of kind of an annual approach to that. But the whole idea on the balance sheet between debt and equity and so on, I mean, we're, again, diligently focused on what levers we have, how do we derisk. Certainly, our credit rating is significantly important to us and our overall balance sheet health. So it's a balance. It's a continuous balance of the 2.  And we think between what we've done and what we are doing internally, combined with the debt and the bank drawdown, and now, with this, think of that, again, as just a continuous balanced approach of looking through each one of these areas and trying to find the right mix. As I did mention, too, we've got $4 billion of debt maturing over the next year. So we'll again look at that and look at potentially refinancing that.  So again, it's a very balanced approach in understanding the second, third order effect of each of them. But the objective here, again, is just to try to stay ahead and manage our liquidity as we have on a day-to-day basis. But again, looking beyond our baseline plan around the possibilities with some of the near-term challenges and pulling the appropriate levels at the appropriate time. And this 401(k) and pension, we believe, is -- fits right into that category. Operator : And next, we'll go to Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Kristine Liwag : With your decision to fund the pension with Boeing stock, I guess, I would have thought that free cash flow in 2021 would have been incrementally positive. So first, were you initially expecting to fund the pension in 2021, and were you expecting to do that with stock? And then also second, can you provide a little bit more color on the moving parts and operating cash flow in 2021 and any onetime items so we can bridge to your positive outlook in 2022? Gregory Smith : Yes. So Kristine, the pension funding or -- as you know, it all depends on the rates and the discount rate. But as we kind of modeled it, we started to see in the '22 time frame and beyond some incremental funding requirements. So we essentially, like I said, pulled that forward. We didn't see a significant amount of funding required in '21, but we did start to see some of it in the years beyond that. So this was again an opportunity to pull that forward and utilize our stock and improve the cash profile going forward. So net-net, as you know, we've done it before, and we know how to do it. And we think it was, again, a prudent thing to do. All part of just consistently reviewing the capital structure strategy and balancing the funding approach to the pension in particular.  As far as '20, I'll say, kind of '20 to '21, again, I'd say the key elements are very similar to what we talked last time, but the level of contribution is evolving and changing year-over-year. So as you bridge to an improved cash flow, which it will be, as we see it today in '21 over '20, 737 MAX is the single biggest contributor. So getting return to service, starting to deliver off the ramp, and then as Dave said, informing our production rates, and then ultimately, the marketplace and what the recovery looks like, that's going to be the single biggest driver.  Outside of that, the next one is the 787. As I said, we're building inventory, and we'll have that inventory and delivery profile aligned into '21, and that will be your second largest contributor to '20 over '21 as it sits today. Those are the two single biggest. If you look at year-over-year, as we see it today with services or defense, it's pretty much in line with how we think we're going to finish this year. So it really does narrow down to those 2 product lines, in particular, with the 737 being the biggest contributor. Maurita Sutedja : All right. John, we have time for one last question. Operator : Great. And that will be from Peter Arment with Baird. Peter Arment : Greg, just on the 787, the consolidation move final assembly to one facility in South Carolina, maybe just -- maybe you can just talk through how you're thinking about -- does that change any kind of outlook on the times of the profitability of the overall program? Or how you're thinking about the kind of the productivity gains that you'll be able to achieve with -- at one facility? Gregory Smith : Yes. I think, as you know, Peter, it really kind of starts with the market outlook that we had, and then looking at efficiencies, and then, ultimately, how do we become more competitive. And this is certainly a key contributor to that. As far as a program margin perspective, not a -- it won't have a significant impact on that certainly near term. But as Dave said earlier, we're looking beyond the current rate and looking at rates beyond where the marketplace is today. And that's ultimately where we'll see much more efficiencies, and particularly around logistics, going from the mid and half body right over into final assembly and not having the transportation logistics associated with that, and having the dedicated crews and the cycling, again, we'll see the efficiencies. But really, we'll capture it more at the higher production rates. Maurita Sutedja : All right. Thank you all. That completes the Boeing Company's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for joining. David Calhoun : Thank you, everyone.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Thank you for standing by. Good day everyone, and welcome to the Boeing Company's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst question-and-answer session, are being broadcast live over the Internet. [Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I am turning the call over to Ms. Maurita Sutedja, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Boeing Company. Ms. Sutedja, please go ahead. Maurita Sutedja : Thank you, John, good morning. Welcome to Boeing's fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. I'm Maurita Sutedja, and with me today are David Calhoun, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Executive Vice President of Enterprise Operations and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, you can follow today\u2019s broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com.  As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. Projections, estimates and goals we include in our discussion this morning are likely to involve risks, which are detailed in our news release, in our various SEC filings, and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures. Now, I will turn the call over to Dave Calhoun. David Calhoun : Yes, thank you, Maurita. Good morning, everyone. 2020 was a historically challenging year for our world, for our industry, for our business and our communities. I hope you are all staying safe. We are managing our operations each and every day the best that we can to minimize disruption, while always protecting the well-being of our associates. A lot has happened in the last few months. So, let me begin by sharing some of the highlights starting with the 737 MAX on the next chart. We made significant progress on the 737 program this quarter. The FAA in the United States, ANAC in Brazil, Transport Canada, and just this morning EASA in Europe have approved the resumption of 737 MAX operations, marking important milestones on our return to service journey. I would encourage all of you to read the various reports issued by our regulators regarding the intense scrutiny they put our airplanes through. This is the culmination of a comprehensive effort, including roughly 400,000 engineering hours, 1,400 test and check flights, and over 3,000 flight hours completed on the airplane. Following one of the most rigorous certification efforts in aviation history we're confident in the safety of our airplane. We continue to work with global regulators and our customers to safely return the airplane to service worldwide. We\u2019ve assumed that the remaining non-U.S. regulatory approvals will occur during the first half of 2021, and we will continue to follow their lead in the steps ahead. Our first priority is assisting our customers with return to service for their existing parked fleet. Every airline has different operational considerations for returning planes to revenue service, and timelines for training their pilots. We're supporting each of them as they go through their process. Next, we're focused on safely delivering our 737 MAX airplanes that are in inventory, which began in December of last year. Prior to the delivery teams are performing all the necessary tests and ensuring each airplane receives customized care and rolls into a delivery stall ready for customer acceptance and FAA review. Since the FAA\u2019s approval to return the operations on November 18, we\u2019ve delivered more than 40 737 MAX aircraft to our customers, and 5 airlines have safely returned their fleets to service, safely flying over 2,700 flights and approximately 5,500 flight hours as of January 25. Based on conversations with our customers, passenger load factors to date have been relatively consistent with the airline total fleet averages. We're encouraged by the progress to date and also pleased with the confidence our customers have placed in us and the airplane, highlighted most recently by Ryanair and Alaska air announcement. In addition to our 737 progress, we continue delivering for our Defense, Space & Services customers. Let me highlight a few of these accomplishments. Our defense security and space team achieved first flight of the MQ-25 unmanned aircraft with an aerial refueling store and completed engineering design review for Wideband Global SATCOM-11+ communications satellite Our Global Services team was awarded a performance based logistics contract for the Singapore F-15SG fleet and selected to provide P-8A training for the Royal New Zealand Air Force.  Now, let's turn to the next slide to discuss the industry environment. Overall, the government services and defense and space businesses remain significant and relatively stable. And we continue to see solid global demand for our major programs. Nevertheless, the scale of government spending on COVID-19 response has the potential to add pressure to global defense spending in the years ahead. Broad support for our defense portfolio is underscored by the $5 billion of orders BDS booked in the fourth quarter across key franchise platforms. Just this month, we also received the contract awards for lot six and a lot seven, which include 27 additional KC-46 tankers for the U.S. Air Force. Additionally, the fiscal year 2021 defense bill includes investments in products and services from across our defense, space and government services business. The diversity of our portfolio will continue to help provide critical stability for us as we move forward. In the commercial market, while many of our key long-term fundamentals remain intact, we continue to see near-term market pressures due to COVID-19. Despite solid progress on the vaccine front, the next 6 months to 9 months will remain very challenging for our airline customers and the entire industry. COVID-19 case rates continue to be high and travel restrictions remain in place putting significant pressure on passenger traffic. Similar to the trends we saw last quarter, the domestic market is leading the recovery, albeit a slow pace. Domestic traffic in November improved slightly to 41% below 2019. On the other hand, international operations continued to be depressed, with November traffic still 88% below the prior year. Recovery in the international segment has been weak due in large part to the absence of coordinated global policies on cross border entry protocols. The uncertainty in the international markets has meant that the active fleet is still around three quarters the size of its pre-crisis level, coupled with utilization rates that are below historical averages, airlines are flying just about half of their normal operations at the global level. Regionally, we're seeing case rates and government travel restrictions continue to evolve, resulting in different recovery trajectories. China's domestic passenger traffic, for example, has rebounded significantly, although it's not without risk. Europe is experiencing a pullback because of the resurgence of COVID-19 and related government restrictions. And then finally, in North America, traffic remains more than 60% below our 2019 levels. And these dynamics continue to drive a very uneven recovery. As anticipated, the number of aircraft being retired from the active fleet continues to grow, 1,300 and growing. We expect this trend to continue as our customers focus on retiring their oldest and least efficient airplanes and replacing them with new airplanes that will be as much as 25% to 40% more fuel efficient and better for the environment. The longer it takes to put COVID in the rearview mirror, the more retirements we will see. As to the freighter market, we're seeing an interesting dynamic with more freighters flying today than before the pandemic, due to the limited belly cargo capacity from passenger airplanes. While overall cargo traffic showed a year-on-year decline, yields have remained elevated. The dramatic growth of e-commerce in the past year has fueled express freighter expansion. This has supported the demand for our cargo aircraft as seen in recent orders, from DHL for eight 777 freighters and from Atlas Air for four 747 freighters. We also added incremental freighter conversion orders to our Global Services backlog and over the long run cargo demand will continue to be driven by global trade and GDP growth and recovery. We\u2019re encouraged by the speed of vaccine development and efficacy rates. These trends bolster our medium-term outlook and support our belief in the long-term strength of the market. Consistent with what we've shared previously, as well as IATA and other industry groups, we expect it will take around three years for travel to return to the 2019 levels, and a few years beyond that to return to our long-term growth trends. Again, we see the recovery in three phases. First, we're seeing domestic traffic improving in places like Brazil, the United States, India, and other large domestic markets. Next, regional markets should begin to recover such as intra Asia, intra Europe and intra America's flights. And then finally, long haul international routes, which require the most co-ordination will be the last to bounce back. Therefore, demand for narrowbody aircraft is expected to recover quite a bit faster, while widebody demand will remain challenged for a longer period. As we move forward, testing mechanisms progress on vaccine distribution, and coordinated government interactions will be key drivers of the recovery. We will continue working with the industry through our Confident Travel initiative. Industry and academic studies continue to demonstrate with multiple layers of protection, including HEPA filters, enhanced cleaning procedures, and the use of personal face coverings that the risk of transmission while flying is quite low. Collaboration between governments is an important element for implementing new screening protocols, which can even further reduce the risk of transmission. In the commercial services market, we saw modest incremental demand improvement in the fourth quarter. Although we are starting to see some stability, the recovery has been slow and we continue to anticipate will take multiple years to reach our previous demand levels. Accelerated retirements will also result in newer fleets when we emerge from the pandemic and that will reduce service demand and prolong their recovery. Given the challenging environment, managing liquidity continues to be vital for the aerospace industry, to bridge us to recovery. Despite the unprecedented situation, there generally continues to be liquidity in the market for our customers and for Boeing. Financiers and investors understand the long-term value proposition of aircraft and the fundamental need to connect the world. This has been demonstrated by the broad global interest in the space and the new entrants into the market over the past several years. We supported the COVID relief and stimulus packages passed by Congress last year and similar efforts underway globally. These relief programs, including access to financing, have been helpful to our customers, as well as number of our suppliers. And we believe that support will help enable a faster recovery for the industry as we're navigating the pandemic. As we see airlines adapt to these market realities, product differentiation and versatility will be key. A product lineup remains well-positioned to meet our customer needs and support airline plans to gain efficiencies and reach emission goals. For example, our digital solutions continue to provide important capabilities to our customers, as highlighted by Frontier Airlines recent decision to sign a 10-year digital services agreement with us for their fleet. Our attractive portfolio and the diversity of our backlog provide a strong foundation as we prepare to recover and grow in the future. Now, let's turn to commercial airplane production rates on Slide 4. We\u2019re closely coordinating with our customers to understand their fleet needs. While monitoring the broader market environment to ensure we're aligning supply with demand, let me provide some key updates across our programs. Starting with the 787 program, as we\u2019ve shared, we're conducting comprehensive inspections on undelivered airplanes, both in Everett and in South Carolina. Since last quarter, we've expanded the scope of those inspections, including work done at our supplier partners. Our assessment shows that none of the issues identified represent safety of flight concerns. Nevertheless, we remain committed to taking the time to ensure each airplane meet our rigorous engineering specifications. And although this work has a near-term impact for us, in terms of both schedule and cost, it is the right thing to do. And we continue to be in coordination with the FAA and our customers throughout the process. Transparency is clear. Through our analysis, we've been able to determine the resolution for the majority of previously identified areas, including our major joined sections. In some cases, this requires inspections and rework, while in other areas no further action is required. We've made good progress, and are now completing analysis on a few remaining areas to validate the next steps. As we see it today, this work may take a few more weeks, but we will provide our engineers the time they need to complete that analysis. We are implementing changes in the production process to ensure newly built airplanes meet our specifications, and do not require further inspection. This is consistent with our determination to eliminate rework from our production system to position us on stronger footing when the market recovers. We're looking forward to resuming 787 deliveries to our customers, but as I discussed, there's still work to be done. Based on what we know today, we expect 787 deliveries to resume later this quarter. However, it will be back-end loaded with no delivery this month and most likely very few, if any in February. Also based on what we know today, we still expect to deliver the vast majority of the 787 aircraft inventory by the end of the year. We will keep you updated on the progress. As we've previously shared, given the widebody market environment, we're in the process of transitioning to a rate of five per month in March, at which point 787 final assembly will be consolidated to Boeing South Carolina. On the 777 and 777X programs, we now anticipate that the first 777X delivery will occur in late 2023. This schedule and the financial impact to the program this quarter reflect a number of factors, including an updated assessment of global certification requirements, the latest assessment of COVID-19 impacts on market demand and discussions with our customers with respect to delivery timing. We're working closely with global regulators on all aspects of the 777X development. This involves listening to all their feedback and applying lessons learned from our experiences on the 737 MAX program recertification and applying to our 777X certification plan. It also involves making prudent design modifications as necessary to meet the various global regulators expectations. As part of our assessment, we've made the decision to implement certain modifications to the aircraft design. Our decision to make these modifications, which will involve firmware and hardware changes to the actuator control electronics, reflects our current judgment of global regulators compliance expectations. This decision has led to these revised schedule assumptions. COVID-19 has had a significant impact on passenger traffic, particularly international long-haul routes serviced by large widebodies such as the 777X, which has shifted the anticipated replacement wave and overall demand for widebody airplanes to the right. Additionally, the challenging business climate is impacting our 777X customers. These broader market factors coupled with our conversations with our customers about preferred delivery timing informed our current assumptions. As a result of these updated program assumptions, we\u2019ve booked a $6.5 billion pre-tax charge in the quarter, a significant component of which is driven by a reduction in the program's initial accounting quantity. Greg will go through the financial impact in greater detail a little later. Despite the challenges we in the industry are facing, we are confident in the 777X airplane and the unmatched capability it will offer our customers. With the most payload capacity and lowest operating cost per seat of any widebody, the 777X completes our market leading widebody family with a distinct competitive advantage. Across a total widebody market of more than 8000 projected deliveries over the next two decades, we see replacement demand for over 1,500 large widebody airplanes, which are well suited for the 777X. We also continue to see strong freighter demand and good delivery pace for our current 777 freighter. Our production rate expectations for the combined 777, 777X program remains at two per month in 2021. We continue to assess our production plans to efficiently transition to the 777X. Turning now to the 737 program, we're currently producing at a low rate and expect to gradually increase the rate to 31 per month in only 2022. And we expect further gradual increases to correspond with market demand. We will continue to assess the delivery profile for 2021 as it will help inform our 737 production ramp plan and we will continue to communicate transparently with our supply chain to ensure stability. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 3,300 aircraft in our 737 backlog. There's no change to our production rate plan for the 747 or the 767. The market continues to be dynamic, and we will monitor closely as we prudently balance supply and demand across all of our programs. Although this remains an unprecedented and uncertain time, we are confident air travel will return, and when it does, we will be ready to support our customers with a well-positioned family of airplanes. Now, let's quickly look at our 2021 priorities on Slide 5. As you'll see, our priorities remain consistent. Navigating through this global pandemic and rebuilding stronger on the other side continues to be a key focus along with safely returning the 737 to service worldwide, building on our efforts over the past two years. We remain committed to working closely with all of our stakeholders to rebuild trust, one day at a time, one airplane at a time. And we'll do that by living our values, demonstrating transparency every step of the way, and delivering on our commitments. As part of our continued commitment to safety, we recently announced our first Chief Aerospace Safety Officer. Consistent with these values is our focus on sustainability. We continue to make great strides in our efforts, innovating and operating to make the world better. We achieved net zero carbon emissions at our manufacturing and work sites in 2020 by expanding conservation and renewable energy use, while tapping into responsible offsets for the remaining greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, we've committed that our commercial airplanes will be capable and certified to fly on 100% sustainable aviation fuels by 2030. Operational excellence is about how we work to deliver safe products and services to our customers while continuously striving for first time quality. We're also taking steps to restore the health of our production system. As we calibrate our production rates to the market impacts of COVID-19, we're taking the opportunity to implement quality, workplace safety, and productivity improvement projects to bring stability to our factories. And as Greg will cover later, this also extends to our engagement with suppliers. And last but not least, we will not lose sight of our future and the innovations that will reshape air travel. We continue to invest in our carriers that are critical to our business, focusing on design practices and manufacturing technology that will position us for growth. We're also continuing to invest in our people. We recently announced that we will be providing most of our employees a one-time stock grant that will vest in three years as we recover and grow the business. To close, our guiding principle here is that every decision that we make must help us navigate through this difficult period while not diminishing our future competitiveness. We will take action to protect our business and our people by closely managing liquidity and driving lasting transformational change to make our business stronger and more resilient than ever.  And with that, let me turn it over to Greg. Greg? Greg Smith : Great. Thanks, Dave and good morning everyone. Let's turn now to Slide 6. Our revenue of 58.2 billion in core earnings per share of negative $23.25 reflected lower commercial delivery and service volume primarily due to COVID-19, as well as 787 production issues, partially offset by lower 737 MAX customer consideration charges when compared to 2019.  Full-year earnings were also impacted by the $6.5 billion pre-tax charge on the 777X program, additional tax valuation allowance, and abnormal production costs related to the 737 MAX program. Operating cash flow of negative 18.4 billion reflected lower commercial deliveries and service volume, as well as timing of receipts and expenditures. With that, let's turn to Slide 7 for our fourth quarter results. Consistent with the full-year results, revenue of 15.3 billion reflected lower commercial airplane deliveries and commercial service volume, partially offset by a lower 737 MAX customer consideration charge. Earnings in the quarter were also impacted by the charge on the 777X program, a $744 million charge related to the previously announced agreement between Boeing and the U.S. Department of Justice, and abnormal production costs. Income tax in the quarter reflected the impact of an additional valuation allowance on deferred income tax assets, partially offset by the five-year net operating loss carry back provision in the CARES Act. The 2.5 billion of non-cash valuation allowance booked in the quarter was based on the required accounting analysis to assess recoverability of our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income. This is an accounting assessment, which places a lot of weight on our recent losses, leading to the charge this quarter. Important to note, that this valuation allowance does not limit our ability to utilize deferred tax assets in the future periods. It does not change our outlook on future company results and has no impact on cash flows or future tax returns. When income generation returns to more normal levels, we can expect to see the allowance reverse and increase reported earnings.  Let's now move to commercial airplanes on Slide 8. Revenue was 4.7 billion, driven by a lower widebody delivery volume, partially offset by higher 737 deliveries and a lower 737 MAX customer consideration charge in the quarter compared to the same period last year. Operating margins declined driven by the charge on the 777X program, lower delivery volume and a $468 million of abnormal production costs related to the 737 program. Again, partially offset by lower 737 MAX customer consideration charge. As Dave mentioned, we began to receive regulatory approvals and resume 737 MAX operations in the fourth quarter, and we restarted 737 MAX deliveries in December last year. Last quarter, we shared with you that we had about 450 737 MAX aircraft built and stored in inventory. With deliveries of 27 aircraft in December and now 40 to date, this number has been reduced to approximately 410 aircraft in inventory. As we previously communicated, we expect to have to remarket some of these aircraft and potentially reconfigure them. Deliveries from storage will continue to be our priority after assisting our customers with their return to service as we continue to work closely with our customers based on their fleet needs. Our estimated timing of 737 deliveries from storage has not changed since last quarter. That said, we expect delivery timing and production rate ramp up profile to continue to be dynamic given the pandemic. There are no material change to our estimate total of abnormal costs of $5 billion. During the fourth quarter, we expensed 468 million of abnormal production costs, which brought the cumulative abnormal cost expense to date to 2.6 billion. We expect the remainder of these costs to be expensed as incurred largely in 2021. Our assessment of the liability for estimated 737 MAX potential concessions and other considerations to customers, and the expected cash impact timing did not change significantly in the fourth quarter from our previous assessment. Cumulatively, we've accrued a $9.6 billion liability for the estimated potential concessions and other considerations. To date, we've made 3.7 billion of payments to customers in cash, and other forms of compensation, including $600 million we paid this quarter. We have settlement agreements covering approximately $3 billion of the remaining liability balance of $5 billion. Turning now to 787, as we discussed, we continue to complete the inspections on our 787 program in our factories and in our supply chain. We have approximately 80 undelivered 787 aircraft in inventory. Based on what we know today, we anticipate that we will unwind the vast majority of these aircraft during 2001 and are working with our customers to facilitate this. But as Dave mentioned, we still have some work ahead of us on this and we will keep you posted on the progress. Our latest assessment of the financial impact of this effort and delivery delays have been included in our fourth quarter closing position. As we previously disclosed, the 787 program has near breakeven gross margins due to the previously announced reductions in production rates and program accounting quantity. If we are required to further reduce the accounting quantity and or production rates or experience other factors that could result in lower margin, the program could reach forward loss in future periods. However, on a cash basis, the 787 unit margin has held up relatively well even with these lower production rates, and many of the underlying productivity and profitability drivers remain in place. As Dave mentioned, we expect first delivery of the 777X to now occur in late 2023, and we recorded a $6.5 billion reach forward loss in the program. Our decision to implement certain modifications to the aircraft design is added time to the schedule and results in additional costs. In addition to that factor, other key elements contributing to the reach forward loss include the following : One, an updated assessment of the market demand and customers preferences on delivery timing, based on continued dialogue with our customers; Two, resulting adjustments to plan production rates and reduction in program accounting quantity to 350 aircraft. As a reminder, initial accounting quantity doesn't represent the long-term potential size of the program. We see replacements demand for over 1,500 larger widebody areas aircraft, which we well suited for the 777X. The approach we use to establish the accounting quantity is consistent with what we've used on other programs. And as part of our closing process, we always evaluate the initial accounting quantity on a quarterly basis, even in program development to test that the program is not in a reach forward loss position. And lastly, other cost elements include increased change incorporation costs, along with associated customer and supply chain impacts. The combination of these factors created significant pressure on the 777X programs revenue and cost estimates, resulting in the reach forward loss for the program. We still expect peak use of cash for the 777X program to be in 2020. The changes to the 777X program timeline can result in some cash flow headwinds in 2021 and 2022. But we expect cash flow to improve as we get closer to EIS, and begin deliveries in late 2023. We anticipate the program to turn cash flow positive, approximately one to two years after starting the initial deliveries. Commercial airplanes backlog included more than 4,000 aircraft valued at $282 billion. The decline in backlog in the fourth quarter reflected aircraft order cancellations and removal of aircraft orders from our backlog due to ASC 606 accounting standards, including our most recent assessment of 777X backlog due to the revised schedule. Given the significant headwinds that remain in the market, BCA margin progression will be highly dependent upon future production rates and will take time. However, we are taking action today to make foundational lasting change through our business transformation efforts in order to help offset those headwinds as much as possible. Let's now move to Defense, Space & Security on Slide 9. Fourth quarter revenue increased to 6.8 billion, primarily driven by higher volume, as well as a charge on the Commercial Crew program in the fourth quarter of 2019. Fourth quarter operating margins of 7.4% include $275 million pre-tax charge on the KC-46A Tanker program, primarily due to production efficiencies, including the impacts of COVID-19 disruption. We received [$5 billion] in orders in the quarter, including a contract for two KC-46A aircraft from Japan, AEW&C upgrades for the Republic of Korea Air Force, and key proprietary space programs bringing the backlog now to $61 billion. Let's now turn to Global Services results on Slide 10. In the fourth quarter, Global Services revenue declined 3.7 billion, driven by lower commercial services volume due to COVID-19. Operating margins decreased to 3.8% due to lower commercial service volume, and $290 million of pre-tax charges related to asset impairments, primarily to reflect the updated fleet retirement assumptions driven by COVID. During the quarter, BGS won key contracts worth approximately $7 billion, which brings its backlog now to $21 billion. Although we saw a slight uptick in commercial service demand in the fourth quarter, we continue to expect the recovery to take multiple years. We continue to position our services business for the future, taking actions to right size our operations. In addition, we are shaping our portfolio to ensure that we have the right solutions to help our customers and industry navigate the downturn and prepare for market recovery. The results of our efforts have already started to positively impact our operating margin performance. Let's now turn to cash flow on Slide 11. The disruption caused by COVID-19 on our airlines and global economy continues to put significant pressure on our cash receipts. Operating cash flow for the quarter was negative $4 billion, driven by lower commercial airplane delivery volume, advanced payment timing, and commercial service volume. Let's now move to Slide 12 to discuss our liquidity position. We continue to proactively manage our cash position and assess our liquidity throughout this pandemic. We ended the fourth quarter with strong liquidity, including 25.6 billion of cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet, and have access to our $9.5 billion bank credit facility, which remains undrawn as well continued access to capital markets. Our debt balance at the end of the quarter was 63.6 billion, reflecting our $4.9 billion bond issuance, as well as debt repayments in the quarter. As we discussed previously, we've been taking many actions to enhance liquidity, including suspending our dividend, reducing discretionary spending, matching 401(k) contributions and stock, pre-funding pension with stock, and most recently awarding most of our employees a one-time stock grant that will vest in three years in lieu of merit increases this year. These actions reflect our continued de-risking strategy and are part of our balanced approach to ensuring we're proactively meeting our obligations. We worked hard in the past to maintain disciplined cash management, while seeking opportunities to strengthen our balance sheet, and we will continue to do so. Once cash flow generation returns to more normal levels, reducing our debt levels will be a key focus area. We believe we currently have sufficient liquidity and are not planning to increase our debt levels. However, we will continue to actively manage our balance sheet, including refinancing debt maturities. Our investment grade credit rating is important to us and will continue to consider all aspects of our capital structure to strengthen our balance sheet. Let's turn to the next slide. As we look forward into 2021, I'd like to provide you with some insight into some of the key drivers, which are informed by the current market recovery expectations and customer discussions today. 2021 will continue to be a challenging year that said to expect upward trends from 2020. Based on what we [indiscernible] would expect to see 2021 revenue [improve from] 2020, this will be driven mainly [higher] 737 and 787 deliveries as we plan to unwind inventory and deliver from the production lines. We expect BDS to generate low-to-single-digit growth in 2021 revenue, compared to 2020. Excluding one-time events, we anticipate modest revenue growth. As for BGS, while we anticipate solid growth in our government services business in 2021, our commercial services will continue to be challenged due to COVID-19 impacts. [We expect BGS] revenue to be relatively stable in [2021] versus 2020. On the P&L side, we also expect [Technical Difficulty] higher commercial deliveries, absence of 2020 charges, improve performance [and benefits] from continued business transformation efforts. [These impacts were] primarily offset by higher interest expense. Also [Technical Difficulty] will continue to book significant abnormal production costs for the 737 program in 2021. Moving to cash flow, we continue to expect 2021 operating cash to be much improved from 2020, driven mainly by inventory burn down associated with 737 and 787 programs. While higher deliveries will be a tailwind, the timing of advanced payments and burn down of excess advanced payments along with 737 customer settlement payments and higher interest payments will continue to be headwinds. The revised 777X schedule also creates headwind to our current cash profile versus our prior assumptions. Bringing this all together based on what we know today, we continue to expect 2021 to still be a use of cash and to be cash flow positive in 2022. We expect cash improvements from 2021 to 2022 to be driven by continued improvement on the 737 program, due to lower customer considerations, and higher delivery payments, as well as commercial services. And as I just outlined, our commercial delivery volume is a key driver for improvements from 2020 to 2021. Therefore, the drivers clearly hinge on the pace of commercial market recovery. Given the dynamic environment, we will continue to diligently work opportunities and monitor risk factors and keep you posted on further developments. Now, let's move to the last slide. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken prudent and decisive action to get [Technical Difficulty] cash so that we can navigate this crisis and also reshape our business so that we can emerge as a sharper, resilient, leaner enterprise. In addition to taking action to de-risk our portfolio and bolster liquidity, we have also made operational changes to lower our production rates and adjust our workforce to align with the new market reality. We have taken production rates for the 787 and 777 programs down by proximately half due to COVID impact, and also moderated the ramp of the 737 production rate. We continue to take steps to reach our previously shared plan to bring our overall staffing levels to approximately 130,000 by the end of 2021. As you know, we are progressing through extensive business transformation efforts that introduced [Technical Difficulty]. The financial objectives we've established are measured in billions of dollars and we expect them to be executed over a multi-year period.  We expect the majority of our efforts will result in enduring lasting changes that will enable us to be more efficient in the long-term, laying the foundation for recovery, future margin expansion and cash flow generation as the market recovers. A combination of all of our actions in 2020 helped us generate more than $10 billion in liquidity, which was [Technical Difficulty] this very challenging environment. Approximately half of our transformation efforts are focused on reducing structural costs versus variable. We continue to make progress across all five pillars as we utilize at low production [Technical Difficulty] environment to transform and improve our business processes. Projects to improve operational stability, implement first time quality initiatives, shape our portfolio with [core markets], simplify our organizational structure, and reduce bureaucracy are all examples of efforts meant to create meaningful and lasting change to how we operate, as well as stock cost structure. Through our portfolio and investment prioritization we reduced [Technical Difficulty] from prior year. We also [Technical Difficulty] a billion dollars of [Technical Difficulty] reducing expenditures in areas such as freight logistics, purchase services [Technical Difficulty]. And as part of our footprint optimization, we sold or closed over [240,000 schools] [Technical Difficulty] over the next year. There are a number of other initiatives [Technical Difficulty] talk often about our transformation at the operational production level, every support organization or company is on this journey. Our team, the human resources, finance, IT, and more are all recalibrating their structures and operating models to simplify processes, eliminate unnecessary spending, reduce bureaucracy, and improve long-term performance and competitiveness. For example, with [Technical Difficulty] opportunities to form or expand strategic partnerships with vendors that allow us to simplify and optimize our [offered operations] and reduce overall costs. We're also evolving the way we work with our [Technical Difficulty] suppliers. This began with our Boeing [supply principles], which [Technical Difficulty] yield improvement in quality, affordability, performance on time delivery. These [principles] [Technical Difficulty] built on success, feedback and lessons learned [Technical Difficulty] throughout our supply chain. And as we take action, we're ensuring every step only further drives key [Technical Difficulty] efforts and safety, quality, and delivery on building on our commitments. We've got the right team in place, and we're confident that we have the right actions put together, all supporting our future and our competitiveness. With that, I'll turn it back over to Dave for some closing comments. David Calhoun : Yeah, thanks, Greg. Listen, 2020 was a year like no other. Our world, our industry, our business, and our communities were facing unprecedented challenges and we're still in the midst of it. In addition to navigating COVID-19, we also made important progress on the 737 as we engage transparently and comprehensively with regulators, government leaders, customers, suppliers, and our teams. Having done that, we\u2019ll be that much more prepared for airplane certification efforts going forward. The return to service of the 737 was a key step for us as we make fundamental changes to how we operate and rebuild trust one airplanes, one interaction, one day at a time. I\u2019m proud of our team and I thank them for the resilience and dedication that they've demonstrated as we've navigated through this really difficult moment together. 2021 is an inflection point for our industry and certainly for Boeing. We have been through tough times before. We know how to overcome challenges and to adapt, and we will stand by our customers throughout this process. Driven by our values and with a focus on quality, safety, integrity, and transparency, we will emerge from this moment stronger and more competitive for the long-term. And with that, Greg and I will be happy to take a few questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Carter Copeland : Hey, good morning, guys. David Calhoun : Good morning. Carter Copeland : Greg, I wondered if you could just give us some more color on the 6.5 billion on the 777X and how much of that was the accounting quantity? You mentioned 350 units, but I don't think you've mentioned, you know what that changed from, I don't know if that was 500 or, you know what that number was. So, just give us a sense of how big that was, and how it compares to the other pieces, be it change incorp and the modifications that you mentioned, or customer settlements? Thanks. Greg Smith : Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I kind of put it into four major categories. Certainly, you know the plant production rates associated with the schedule move. And as you said, the reduction in the accounting quantity. And as I, as I mentioned, you know, every quarter, we go through this assessment, but as a result of what we're seeing in the marketplace, and, you know with the current pandemic, as well as kind of how we're seeing the market shift in the near term, we reduced our assumptions around the accounting quantity for this quarter. But again, pretty consistent from certainly consistent process, but pretty consistent with what we've seen on some of the other programs when we've established an accounting quantity. And then, of course, we talked about, you know, change incorp costs for the aircraft that are currently built, as well as we'll have the rate much lower through this period between now and 2023, and the change incorp associated with those. And I'd say, you know last one would be, you know, customer and supply chain impacts, considering the delays. Single I say largest one in there Carter is around the accounting quantity. Carter Copeland : Okay, so those were in order \u2013 rank order, and then just, can you give us a sense of how much of a decrease in the accounting quantity that the move to 350 represented? Greg Smith : Yeah, from prior quarter, we had 50 additional units in there. So, we had a quantity of 400 we assumed. Carter Copeland : Okay, thanks. David Calhoun : The only other point is, it's really important to know that the 50 that move out are the ones at the tail-end, and those are where cash margins are significant. So, you end up with a little bit of a double-whammy there. Carter Copeland : Understood. Thank you. Greg Smith : Yeah. You're welcome. Operator : Our next question is from Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning. Hey, on the 787 Greg, I think in early December, you were looking for a restart of deliveries into year-end, and obviously, there must have been some incremental discoveries and re-checking, just curious, what's the level of confidence now versus then? And then also, is there any FAA requirement for sign off on what you're looking to do and improve prior to the restarted deliveries? Thanks. Greg Smith : Yeah, I mean, I\u2019d put it into a couple of categories, one of which is, you know, some of the inspections have taken longer, and they've also expanded, you know for complete thoroughness across not only our factors within the supply chain, so that's taken longer. Look, from day one, we've been engaged with the FAA and continue to be engaged as we work through this process and we'll continue to right up until we're ready to resume delivery. So, you know, complete transparency there, of course and clarity around what we're doing, how we're doing it, and the path to recovery again, when we resumed deliveries. I don\u2019t know Dave, if you had anything you want to add? David Calhoun : Well, there won't be a formal sign off in that regard. But without a doubt, we will make sure the FAA is comfortable with every act we've taken and I\u2019ll only add the comment that, you know, this expansion of inspection and quality assurance and all those things, you know, maybe I'll take a hit on that one, but this is a moment where we get to fix some things and do some things, you know, the way we would like to do them. And so, I have put very little pressure on the production and engineering team to resolve things too quickly. I'd want it to be thorough and done, and I want to prevent future re-work around this stuff. And I have to tell you, these specs are incredibly exacting. So, I'm proud of the design. The design principles that we've used in it, but anyway, we're just \u2013 probably take stepping it up a bit. Myles Walton : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Noah Poponak : Hi, good morning, everyone. David Calhoun : Good morning. Greg Smith : Good morning. Noah Poponak : Greg, there's a lot of debate out there about the aircraft unit margins. You know, a few years down the road when things are a little bit more normal. You know, the 777 is obviously in a unique situation, but you know, with the MAX and the 787 there are questions about, if you're having to give on price on the MAX, and then, you know, if these really impressive cash margins you had for a while, and each I think can hold it at the lower rate. So, I wondered if you could spend a little bit of time on that. I mean, how can we think about where those airplane margins can be a few years down the road at more normal rates, compared to, you know, pre-pandemic pre-grounding? Greg Smith : Yeah, I mean, you know, clearly, as you said, you know, volume is going to play \u2013 is going to be key in that. So, as we've talked about, as we see 737 increasing, you know, in production and delivery, that's going to play right into, clearly, you know, the unit cash margin, and that profile, you know, pretty much aligns with, you know, delivery profile and rate projections that we have.  On the 787, as I mentioned, you know, even at these low rates on a unit basis, cash is pretty good. And, you know, that's the efforts of the past for sure, and having a good product mix between 8s, 9s, and 10s. And again, that's going to go up with volume. And that obviously, not taking into consideration the advances that will come with that increased volume on both of those programs, but by far, those are the two, you know, single drivers to, you know, to the cash flow positive in particularly in 2022 and beyond. And then beyond that, it's the 777X as we talk about, you know, getting out of use of cash and into positive cash, as I just mentioned. Those three elements, again, are going to be key to the cash trajectory, you know, between now, and you know, 2023 and 2024 and beyond. Noah Poponak : So, I mean, if we're in 2023, and the MAX rate is, you know, hypothetically in the low 40s, a month and 87 hypothetically, you know, six a month, can those unit cash margins actually be fairly close to where they were pre-pandemic pre-grounding, based on all the cost action and keeping pricing pretty similar, or is that unrealistic? Greg Smith : Well, I mean, that's certainly the objective, and a lot of part of the transformation effort that we're doing is trying to, you know, lean ourselves in, and we'll work to that profile, but you know, volume is going to be key. So, you know, if you get to those rates, like I said, the cash is going to follow that and this, you know the environment we're in today, how that recovers and the assumptions that our customers have, and therefore [Technical Difficulty] that\u2019s got to stick, and if it sticks then you'll see the trajectory on cash go with those production rates by no question. But at the same time, these transformation efforts, as I said, they go over multiple years, and that's the objective. Certainly, you know, lean ourselves out, get ourselves even more competitive on the other side of this and really reduce the structural costs within our company. So, we can be more efficient. All that also is going to play out, you know, in the cash profile over that time period. David Calhoun : Maybe if I could just comment on the pricing question, which is an important question. I do anticipate us being through our inventory in 2022 on the MAX, I think we can stay disciplined every step of that way, and indications are that we can. And then when we get into 2023, which is where the question is, I see no reason why that competitive dynamics are any different. I really don't. The value with these two airplane competitors, the value of their airplanes is \u2013 not much has changed.  We will have demonstrated performance on the MAX that is very good for the applications that it competes for. And [there our plane] will have advantages on other applications. But I'm confident in that competitive dynamic and believe we'll get right back to where we were, if not something better in, I know Greg's, I'm not sure if his restructuring discussion broke up on you like it did for me when I was listening to it, but the structural changes that we're making and the cost advantages that we intend to get from it, you know, something in that $5 billion range, these were accrued to our airplanes. And anyway, I'm optimistic, I'm quite optimistic, and there's nothing about the market right now that [has been] switched off on that, but we are talking about 2023. You know, it's going to take that long for us to sort of work our way out of the COVID world. Noah Poponak : Yeah, thanks. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Cai Von Rumohr : Yes, thanks so much. So, you said 5 billion in that normal production cost, you've done [29 to date], and yet, sequentially, those abnormal costs came down throughout the year, I think they ended at [330] in the fourth quarter. I mean, if you have 2.1 billion to go, which is what the math suggests, it would suggest it moves up. So, can you give us some idea of the profile moving forward? And secondly, some idea in terms of the delivery cadence, I mean, I could understand that maybe you have a very strong MAX deliveries now because people haven't gotten them. And then maybe they fall off in 2022, 2023. Thanks. Greg Smith : Yeah. So, kind of on the abnormal cost Cai. Like I said, you know, it can be, you know, bumpy or lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, but like we said, we're on a profile to kind of wrap that up, as we increase rates. So, it's directly tied to the rate where we'll stop booking abnormal costs, and it'll move back into the program. I think on a delivery profile, you know, certainly we've got a delivery profile laid out in detail for the balance of the year, and going into 2022 and 2023. We don't see a reduction taking place there, as Dave indicated on the production rates, that we've established not only delivering out of inventory, which as you know, is our priority one, but also increasing those rates as we go forward.  So that profile continues in delivering off, like I said, the backlog, but also, you know, delivering off the inventory that we've got on the ramp, and I don't know whether it was picked up earlier or not, but all the deliveries, we've had to date, the 40 aircraft have all come out of inventory. So, again, it'll be a combination, but the priority will continue to be on those inventory to aircraft. So, received strong demand for the aircraft and again tied to the recovery, and team's position to deliver at that high rates, we've certainly got the capital and the capacity and the capability to do that. It'll really be informed by our customer\u2019s ability to take them in a specific time period. Cai Von Rumohr : Thank you. Greg Smith : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question is from Seth Seifman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman : Hey, thanks very much. Good morning. I wanted to ask about 787, and I think, Greg, you mentioned about 80 aircraft in inventory, what's sort of the normal level of aircraft in inventory? And as we think about, you know continuing to produce over 60 aircraft this year, and the state of the widebody market, you know, how do you not end the year with still having aircraft in inventory and going into 2022? Greg Smith : Yeah, you're right. So, we'll have some. That's what I was mentioning earlier that we expect to deliver the majority of that 80, you know, through the balance of 2021. And it'll be back loaded, as Dave indicated on our current assumptions of when we believe we can start delivery. So, there\u2019ll still be some burn-off in 2022, but like I said, the majority of that will be in 2021, and be back loaded associated with that. Seth Seifman : But does that mean all \u2013 does that mean the vast majority of the 80 plus all of what is produced? Greg Smith : Yes. Yeah. Operator : Our next question is from Peter Arment with Baird Armand. Please go ahead. Peter Arment : Yes. Good morning, Dave, Greg. Greg Smith : Hey, Peter. David Calhoun : Good morning. Peter Arment : Hey, Greg, maybe just if you could just highlight, you know, your assumptions, or at least trying to understand the dynamics of the use of cash in 2021, I mean, the cadence, should we expect it to kind of improve throughout the year or maybe just any color there and as we get into 2022? Thanks. Greg Smith : Yeah. Now, as you kind of look at it over a quarterly basis, you know Q1 will be, you know, the more challenging quarter, really again, you know, tied to the inventory burn off on the 787, in particular. And then just, I'll say the cadence of deliveries on the MAX, so Q1 will be the biggest use and little bit less in Q2 and then will start to moderate through Q3 and Q4. So, look for, you know, look for a big use of cash in Q1. But again, all tied, you know, to those two programs predominantly. So, [added resumed] deliveries on the 787 will start to burn that inventory down, you'll see the benefit of that in the second, third, and fourth quarter. Peter Arment : Appreciate it. Thanks. Greg Smith : You're welcome. Operator : And next we\u2019ll got to Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Doug Harned : Good morning, thanks. Greg Smith : Good morning, Doug. Doug Harned : If I go back a year ago, and this, you know, in this call, Dave, you talked about, that's when you put the NMA, kind of a side on hold, and where we\u2019re really looking at how to think about development, right now, you talked about the competitiveness of the MAX versus the competition, the a A320neo. And, you know, certainly can see that certainly at the MAX eight to look for transcon flights, you know, very competitive airplane, but Airbus has been very successful with the 321XLR, which can do a lot of the 757 missions and can't really see how the how the MAX can compete upon on those missions. So, when you look forward, are you ready to see that market now? How do you think of these, sort of narrow transatlantic routes, situations like that? How will you approach that over the long-term? David Calhoun : Well, over the near-term, it is what it is. And again, I think about a portfolio of airplanes, not just any one. And while we take all of those face offs that we go through, in order, and in those routes that you described, for the 321, I get it completely, so does our team. Broadly speaking, and on balance across the portfolio, we like where our portfolio plays with the MAX at the lower end, and at [787] at the higher end, and very, very successful airplanes. So that just said \u2013 all that means is, we're going to take our time. I'm pretty sure you're in the right space, although I'm not going to appoint design today, I think you're pretty much in the right space with respect to where next development efforts lean, but I don't want to call it out just yet.  And I'll go right back to the comment I made in the beginning, we are really progressing, really progressing well on our engineering and manufacturing forward technology development, so that we're ready when that moment comes to offer a really differentiated products. So, I'm sure it's, you know, it's not a lot of rocket science for you to add up and guess where things end up, but we're not going to call at that point design, this isn't the moment, we're going to take a little time and we don't feel significantly disadvantaged with our portfolio versus their portfolio. So, anyway, that's how we think about it. And we are thinking long-term, that's for sure. Doug Harned : Any timeframe you can suggest, I mean given the cash pressure now, you know, near-term seems hard, but what kind of timeframe in the future or how would engines play into that timing? David Calhoun : Yeah, well, engines always play into it. I don't think they're going to play into it anywhere near the extent to which they used to, simply because the demands on that propulsion system and then MAX go around, I don't think they're going to be as significant. And now I'm just, I'm going to \u2013 I think speak to the industry and what I know they're capable of doing or not. So therefore, differentiation at the airframe level itself is really, really important in next run, which means that these technologies that we are working with and try to demonstrate to ourselves at scale, with deterministic assembly, those are the things that will differentiate and believe it or not, that becomes the most important criteria for us, with respect to announcing that next airplane. It's got to depend on these advanced technologies, and it will. So, and I don't feel in any way, shape, or form that one-year or two-years more in the market to learn more is going to hold us back in any way shape, or form, or hurt The Boeing Company in any way, shape, or form. So, you know, that's the perspective I put on it. Right now, we're getting no pressure as you might imagine from airlines to run forward as fast as we can. And that's a bit of a luxury on his subject. But the most important thing for me and the Boeing team is to get these underlying technologies proven demonstrated at scale, so that when we call that point design we're ready and we'll deliver. Doug Harned : Okay, great. Thank you. David Calhoun : Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hunter Keay : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. David Calhoun : Good morning. Hunter Keay : Hey, Greg, as you think about, you know, free cash flow beyond 2021, how will orders over the next 12 months impact your decisions on rates, which, of course, also inform the cadence of advances? So, holding other things constant, like the concession payments and the timing of PDPs, can you help me better understand, sort of what your expectations are for order activity, and how that will dovetail into production rate decisions and advances through the cash flow line? Thanks. Greg Smith : And into [timing], we've taken that into consideration, you know with the current rates that Dave talked about, you know, through that period, so, you know, the advanced timeline associated with that is tied rate to how we [see these near term], those production rates. So obviously, if we modify those in any way, it'll have an impact on advances, but I would say separate from that, you know, the delivery profile of [787 and 737] are going to be the biggest contributors to the growth of cash flow. Now, certainly advances will help as we get lead time away on rate increases, but delivery profile loan will be one of the more significant drivers. So, you know, as I said before, you know, looking from the outside, you know, watch the delivery profile on both of those programs in particular, and they'll align, you know, rate to our cash flow profiles and projections we've had gone forward. And then advances will be a little further out from this time period, just because of, you know, the rate increases, particularly on the [737], as we burn off some of the access advances. And then the advances on the [787] will be again tied to the rate increases, you know, beyond the 2021, 2022 timeframe. David Calhoun : You know, maybe I'll add an [ounce of color]. Of course, we expect and believe that the demand for our current 777 freighter is still significant. And we hope and believe that we'll continue to see ordering activity broadly on that one. The [767] similarly, there's an awful lot of freighter demand for the [767], and then when you get to the [787], the only wild card that is more upside than downside is if there is a daytime, if you will, with respect to the trade agreements between the United States and China, and the agreements are in place, it's just a question of whether the posture changes in any way that allows for that Phase 1 deal to move forward. It's a big plus for any administration in light of the number of jobs it supports in the United States. And so, we're optimistic on that front. But if that panned out and panned out, you know, reasonably quickly, that's more up and down. Hunter Keay : Thank you. David Calhoun : Yeah. Operator : Next, we'll go to Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead. Jon Raviv : Hey, thank you. Good morning. Greg Smith : Good morning, Jon. Jon Raviv : Dave, you mentioned that defense is a critical source of stability here. I noticed you had talked about too much, I agree that's not where a lot of the Delta is these days, but nevertheless, what is your perspective on underlying growth there and then your perspective on why Boeing defense, at least from our \u2013 from externally looking at it has not participated in the same growth that others have seen. Others have been growing mid-to-high single digits, still looking at maybe low-to-mid single digits growth in 2021? You guys are still looking at maybe below or very modest growth. So, what's your perspective on that? And then also, looking forward is there an opportunity for sales growth to accelerate perhaps based on some of those big new wins that you've launched over the last few years? And what would the impact on margin be as those programs ramp up? Thank you. David Calhoun : Greg, can I start and you can fill in as you\u2026 Greg Smith : Yeah. Sure thing. David Calhoun : So it has been and we continue to believe that we're going to have stable growth and admittedly at the lower end of the single digits, and that's the best guidance we can talk about, because we do think there is pressure that will ultimately come down as a result of all the COVID spending here in the United States. But a large part of our business now is international markets and the order activity in those international markets has pushed to the right, somewhat, and almost entirely because of COVID related stuff, not because of any competitive issue one way or the other. So, we still like our position, because we have an awful lot of ongoing programs that, you know, the military and of course our defense bills have been kind to in each and every one of their moments, and this last bill was a good one for us in pretty much every respect. So, it\u2019s hard to commit to a big uptick in any way on growth rates anytime soon in light of what I think of the pressures. The only other comment I would make is, there is a big segment of work that we do in the classified world that is incredibly encouraging and incredibly important to us. And anyway, I believe, not just for our defense world, but also ultimately derivative technologies for the commercial world, but that\u2019s going to be a big source of competitive advantage for Boeing. So, we\u2019re high on it, but I\u2019m very [indiscernible] suggest the market is going to get any better or that we\u2019re going to differentiate ourselves any further than what we have been. Jon Raviv : Thank you David Calhoun : Yes. Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss : Thanks, good morning. Greg Smith : Good morning. David Strauss : I want to go back and touch on 787, could you just talk about these 80 aircraft that you have in storage? How many at this point if any have been reworked, what exactly is involved in that, the costs involved, is there any sort of customer compensation that you\u2019re assuming, given the delays on these aircraft? Greg Smith : Yes, the cost associated with it, David, we\u2019ve provisioned for that in our [Technical Difficulty]. So, I think, we\u2019ve got well understood and covered. I don\u2019t have the specific number of aircraft that have been reworked, but there is a number that are complete. And as Dave said, we still got some work to do. Our engineering team does with final dispositions that will inform whether we have additional rework or not, and we\u2019ll adjust the schedule accordingly, but we\u2019ve made a provision in there for what we think are associated costs related to the delay into any rework associated with these inspections. David Strauss : Okay. Greg, can you give a little bit more detail on what exactly is involved in the rework? Is it just exterior? Is there a fair amount of interior work that\u2019s got to be done as well to get the airplanes back to spec? Greg Smith : Yes, I mean, it\u2019s around the structure. As we\u2019ve talked about, you\u2019ve seen around certain areas of the drilling that the team has got to go back \u2013 go in and inspect and potentially rework within the structure, that\u2019s primarily it. So, it\u2019s nothing outside of that as far as interior, it\u2019s around some of those joints. And like we talked earlier, we have been expanding the expansion back into the supply chain as well, but all kind of around the joint areas where we\u2019ve got multiple, I\u2019d say, build ups of different materials. And do we have the appropriate [indiscernible] in there, and if we need to do any additional rework or inspection, that\u2019s essentially what\u2019s taking place. David Strauss : Okay. And I think there were some airplane \u2013 handful of airplanes that were grounded, but do you think there are any additional implications to the installed base from what you found? Greg Smith : Not at this time. No. David Calhoun : No. Those ones that were grounded, and ultimately proven okay involved more than what we\u2019re working on now. It was a combination of factors, and we know one of those factors have been eliminated. David Strauss : Yes. Alright. Thanks very much. Greg Smith : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Rob Spingarn : Hi, good morning. Greg Smith : Good morning, Rob. Rob Spingarn : Dave, I wasn\u2019t going to ask on product development, but your answer to Doug makes it somewhat more compelling now. When you distinguish between advances and airframe and production advances, does this mean that the next aircraft is not necessarily a platform to introduce a future propulsion technology like they are talking about in Europe, and therefore that the next plane would be conventionally powered? Greg Smith : Yes, I believe that. Yes, and I\u2019m on the record of saying that. Hydrogen power, I just believe has a much longer timeline than the timeline that, at least, I\u2019ve read like you did. I have a fair amount of experience with hydrogen. Our company has an incredible amount of experience with hydrogen, at least in the size of airframe that we\u2019re all talking about. You can experiment down at a very low end, but that\u2019s not going to be a meaningful market here. And the advent of sustainable fuel, already we\u2019re capable of living with that sustainable fuel. I believe that\u2019s going to be the 15-year answer to 2050 guidelines and approaches, because we\u2019ve all worked with it, experimented with it, we know it works, and now, we\u2019ve got a developer supply line for it. But I believe it\u2019s the only answer between now and 2050. Rob Spingarn : Okay. Thank you very much. Very helpful. Maurita Sutedja : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : And next will be from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for the time. Greg Smith : Good morning, Sheila. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Greg, you mentioned last quarter PDP significantly impact 2021 free cash flow. Just in light of the additional 787 build that we\u2019re seeing here and the MAX unwind, is it fair to say you unwind a majority of those 787s that are sitting there right now and 200 MAXs? You get an $8 billion inventory benefit, and then the advances or the PDPs are a similar offset in 2021, and then how does that look into 2022? Greg Smith : Yes, you\u2019re right. I mean, if you look at 2020 to 2021, certainly, the largest driver of the improvement in cash flow there will be 787 deliveries. And as we talked about, they will be more back loaded. We\u2019ll obviously have the increase in the 737 deliveries, but as you indicated, we have accessed PDPs. So, they\u2019re being utilized and will be utilized in some of these deliveries.  So, you really won\u2019t see the, I\u2019ll say, true-up of that until you move from 2021 into 2022. But when you look at the growth profile, 2021 to 2022, again 737 is a key driver to that. So back to my comments earlier around the rate profile and the delivery of the aircraft off the ramp, that is the single biggest driver, as you look at 2021 to 2022 as it sits here today. So, and the advances start true-up in that time period as well, I\u2019ll say, kind of, get more to a normalized level of advances, but those are ultimately the key drivers year-over-year. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay. Thank you. Greg Smith : You\u2019re welcome. Maurita Sutedja : Alright. That completes The Boeing Company\u2019s fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Thank you all for joining us. David Calhoun : Thank you.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Thank you for standing by. Good day everyone, and welcome to the Boeing Company's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analyst question-and-answer session are being broadcast live over the Internet. [Operator Instructions] At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Ms. Maurita Sutedja, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Boeing Company. Ms. Sutedja, please go ahead. Maurita Sutedja : Thank you, John, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. I'm Maurita Sutedja, and with me today are David Calhoun, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Executive Vice President of Enterprise Operations and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. Projections, estimates, and goals we include in our discussion this morning are likely to involve risks, which are detailed in our news release in our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures. Now I will turn the call over to Dave Calhoun. David Calhoun : Yes. Thank you Maurita, and good morning everyone. I hope you're all staying safe and healthy as we navigate this global pandemic. On behalf of Boeing, I want to share our heartfelt thoughts and support for those in India who are coping with the devastating and deadly impact of this most recent COVID-19 surge. If we think back to where we were a year ago as the impact of COVID-19 began to unfold it's been quite a year. While it has been challenging we saw the US industry and government come together to support one another like never before. And thankfully, we view 2021 as a critical inflection point for our industry and a proof point for those public investments. While a full recovery is still likely a few years away, we're seeing encouraging signs including progress on vaccine distribution in many countries and domestic travel recovery in certain markets. I remind everyone at the outset, we never imagined vaccines would be developed and distributed this early in the pandemic. We continue to adapt to new ways of conducting our business and remain dedicated to supporting our teammates and their families as well as our customers and the communities where we operate. So let me start with an update on the business on the next chart. Starting with the 737 program, as all of you know, we have identified electrical issues in certain locations in the flight deck of select 737 MAX airplanes. We are finalizing the plans and documentation with the FAA to outline the process required for operators to return their airplanes to service. Upon approval by the FAA, we expect the work to take a few days per airplane. Approximately, 100 in-service airplanes are impacted. We will complete this same work on airplanes in our inventory. We have also paused deliveries while we address these issues, which will make our April deliveries very light. At this time, we expect to catch up on deliveries over the balance of the year. We recognize and regret the impact this has had on our customers' operations and are focused on ensuring that their airplanes are ready for the summer season. More broadly in the last several months, we've made important progress in safely returning the MAX to service worldwide. Since the FAA's ungrounding late last year, more than 165 countries have now approved the resumption of MAX operations. We've delivered more -- 85 MAX airplanes to customers, 21 airlines have returned their fleets to service, and we've safely flown more than 26,000 commercial flights totaling more than 58,000 flight hours. We also recently received regulatory approval for the 8-200 variant of the 737, an important aircraft for our valued customer Ryanair. We now assume that the remaining non-US regulatory approvals will occur this year with approval in China most likely now in the second half of the year. As always, we will continue to work with global regulators and follow their lead in the steps ahead. Our first priority remains assisting our customers with returning their parked fleet to service. More than one third of the previously parked fleet is now flying revenue-generating flights. We're also honored and encouraged by the orders from Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, and Alaska Airlines in the quarter, along with an order last week from Dubai Aerospace Enterprise, and the trust our customers are placing in Boeing and in the 737 family. These orders underscore our customers' commitment to continued modernization of their fleet with 737 airplanes that enable operational efficiencies such as improved fuel burn, which reduces carbon emissions, quieter engines that benefit the communities they serve, and excellent dispatch reliability to support on-time operations. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 3,200 aircraft in our 737 backlog. We're currently producing at a low rate and expect to gradually increase the rate to 31 per month in early 2022 with further gradual increases corresponding with market demand. We will continue to assess the production rate plan as we monitor the market environment and engage in customer discussions. The timing of remaining regulatory approvals will also determine our delivery plans and shape our production ramp up. We will continue to communicate transparently with our supply chain to ensure readiness and stability. Turning to the 787 program. We resumed deliveries in March following rigorous testing and analysis and are closely coordinating with our customers. We will follow the FAA -- the FAA has been involved every step of the way in this process. We've delivered a total of nine 787s since restarting deliveries last month with potentially a couple more by the end of this week. Based on what we know today, we still expect to deliver the majority of the 787 aircraft currently in inventory by the end of the year. We will closely monitor the market environment and keep you updated on delivery progress. As we've previously communicated, in March, we consolidated the 787 final assembly to Boeing South Carolina, which went smoothly. Also, we transitioned to a low production rate of five by the end of the quarter. On the 777X program, we're working closely with global regulators on all aspects of development including our rigorous test program. Our team remains focused on executing this comprehensive series of tests to demonstrate the safety and the reliability of the airplane's design and we're pleased with the progress that we've made to date. We're also providing regular updates to our customers and still anticipate that the first 777X delivery will occur late in 2023. As planned, we are transitioning the combined 777 and 777X production rate to two per month. We also continue to see strong freighter demand and are assessing our production plans to efficiently transition to the 777X. In addition to our commercial programs, we continue to deliver for our Defense, Space, and Services customers. As we reach these program milestones, we're firmly grounded and guided by our core values : safety, quality, and integrity. Let me highlight a few of these accomplishments. Our Defense, Security, & Space team began production of the T-7A Red Hawk advanced trainer and achieved first flight and delivery of the F-15EX to the US Air Force with the second aircraft delivering just last week. On the KC-46A Tanker program, the US Air Force has begun demonstrating limited operational use for air refueling as well as cargo and passenger airlift operations and has safely conducted over 1,400 missions over the last six months. We also successfully completed hot fire testing for NASA's Space Launch System, SLS rocket. Additionally, our global services team delivered the 50th 737-800 Boeing Converted Freighter and inducted our first EA-18G Growler for the US Navy modifications. We also continue to manage the COVID-19 disruption on our programs, including impacts to the VC-25B program, where employee clearance constraints impedes our ability to exchange mechanics when quarantines are required. In addition to operational and programmatic highlights, we've also maintained significant emphasis on sustainability across the company and are making great strides. We're enhancing our sustainability disclosures and planning to release our first ever global equity, diversity, and inclusion report and our first integrated sustainability report later this year. Underscoring our commitment to the environment for the 11th year in a row, we're proud that we've received the ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award for Sustained Excellence in recognition of our company's successful energy conservation practices. Now let's turn to the next slide to discuss the industry environment. Our government services, defense, and space businesses remained significant and relatively stable. While increased government spending on COVID-19 response is adding pressure to defense budgets in some countries, others are increasing spending on their security. Overall, the global defense market remains strong, and we continue to see solid global demand for our major programs. The strength of our defense portfolio is underscored by another strong quarter of BDS orders totaling $7 billion. The diversity of our portfolio will continue to help provide critical stability for us as we move forward. In the commercial market, we continue to see near-term market pressure due to COVID-19. However, many of our key long-term fundamentals remain intact. The recovery is gaining traction but remains uneven. We continue to anticipate the next six months will be very challenging for our airline customers and the entire industry. COVID-19 case rates are still high in many areas around the world and travel restrictions remain in place, putting significant pressure on passenger traffic, especially in those affected markets. We're seeing some positive momentum, particularly in domestic travel. Consistent with what we discussed in prior quarters, the domestic market is leading the recovery; and in some cases, it has slightly outpaced our expectations. February domestic traffic was 51% below 2019 levels. Since then, it has picked up in some regions, including the United States and China, and we anticipate continued momentum this spring. On the other hand, international operations remains extremely low with February traffic still 89% below 2019, slightly behind our earlier expectations. Ongoing virus concerns and the absence of coordinated global policies on cross-border entry protocols have hindered the recovery in the international segment. Vaccine distribution remains the critical hurdle to a broad reopening. The active fleet is still around three quarters of its previous size with single-aisle activity levels slightly above twin-aisle, and although utilization rates and load factors are increasing in some areas, they are still below historic levels, which means airlines are flying less than 60% of their normal capacity at the global level. Regional dynamics such as case rates, government travel policies continue to influence passenger traffic and drive uneven recovery profiles all around the world. The US and China domestic markets are showing resilience with pent-up demand. US airlines are seeing a significant increase in bookings for domestic and leisure routes. TSA throughput in April has been the highest we've seen since the onset of the pandemic with daily averages of approximately 1.4 million passengers, around 60% of 2019 levels. However, passenger traffic in other parts of the world such as Europe and parts of Latin America remained significantly lower due to new strains of the virus, lower vaccine penetration, and uncertainty about government reopening plans. As expected, the number of aircraft being retired from the active fleet keeps growing with around 1,500 airplanes retired or announced to be removed since the onset of the pandemic. We anticipate this trend will continue, as our customers focus on retiring their oldest and least efficient airplanes and replacing them with new airplanes that will be as much as 25% to 40% more fuel-efficient with commensurate emission improvements. The freighter market remains another bright spot with cargo traffic in February 9% higher than 2019. Yields have remained very high and more freighters are flying than before the pandemic due to limited belly cargo capacity from passenger airplanes. Over the long run, cargo demand will continue to be driven by global trade and GDP growth. Progress on vaccine dissemination and domestic passenger traffic in many countries continue to support our medium-term outlook and our belief in the long-term strength of the market. As we've shared previously and consistent with IATA and other industry groups, we expect passenger traffic to return to 2019 levels in 2023 to 2024. We still see the recovery in three phases; first domestic traffic; then regional markets such as intra-Asia, intra-Europe, and intra-Americas flights; and then finally long-haul international routes. Therefore, demand for narrow-body aircraft is expected to recover faster, while wide-body demand will remain challenged for a longer period. As we start to see positive signs in the resumption of domestic and international air travel, our Confident Travel Initiative has continued to partner with airlines, regulators, leading universities, and medical experts around the world to demonstrate the safety of air travel. Our confidence in air travel has been substantiated by science, testing, and analysis based on a multilayered approach to keep our air crews and passengers safe no matter where they're seated in the aircraft cabin. We've also -- we're also working with governments and industry associations to help ensure when people decide to travel they know what to expect. We encourage any new protocols that use data-driven, risk-based approaches to minimize disease transmission risks between countries. Standardized and secure methods to verify traveler information should be part of any solution to safely expand the international travel. As we move forward testing mechanisms, progress on vaccine distribution, and coordinated global interactions will be the key drivers of the recovery. We're also monitoring the global trade environment, in particular US-China relations, given the importance of the Chinese market to our near-term delivery profile as well as future orders, which influence future production rates. We will continue to engage with leaders in both countries to urge a productive dialog, reiterating the mutual economic benefits of a strong and prosperous aerospace industry. China represents 25% of the global growth in our industry over the next decade. In the commercial services market, we saw stable demand in the first quarter. We're seeing some rebound from the bottom, and we expect to see increased activity as airlines are preparing for the summer season. That said, we continue to anticipate it will take multiple years to reach previous demand levels and the recovery trajectory may be uneven. Additionally, accelerated retirements are lowering the age of the fleet reducing services demand and prolonging the recovery for commercial services. On the liquidity front, managing the liquidity continues to be vital for the aerospace industry until the market recovers. Despite the challenges and as we noted in our recently released current aircraft finance market outlook, there generally continues to be liquidity in the market for our customers to acquire new airplanes. In fact, 100% of Boeing deliveries in 2020 were financed by third parties. Financiers and investors understand the long-term value proposition of aircraft and the fundamental need to connect the world. As we see airlines adapt to these market realities, product differentiation and versatility will be key. Our product lineup is well-positioned to meet our customer needs. As we navigate this difficult time, we're not losing sight of our future. We've taken great care to ensure we have the team, the resources, and the investments necessary to meet our customer commitments to drive our improvement initiatives and innovate for the long term. In addition to our work on our current programs, we're also advancing technology that will define our next chapter. We anticipate that our investments will lead to next-generation aircraft that offer higher performance, while being more fuel efficient and easier to maintain and easier to reconfigure. We will continue to take the right action to adapt to the market impact of COVID-19 and position our business for the future by closely managing our liquidity and while driving long-lasting change to make our business leaner, sharper, and more sustainable. So with that, let me turn it over to Greg. Greg Smith : Great. Thanks, Dave and good morning, everyone. Let's please turn to Slide 4. First quarter revenue decreased to $15.2 billion, primarily due to lower 787 deliveries and commercial services volume. This was partially offset by higher 737 deliveries and higher KC-46A Tanker revenue. Earnings in the quarter were also impacted by lower commercial airplane period costs, partially offset by lower tax benefits and higher interest expense. Income tax in the quarter primarily reflects a benefit from the impact of the pre-tax losses, largely offset by the adjustments to the valuation allowance and true-ups to the tax benefits recorded in 2020. Let's now move to commercial airplanes on Slide 5. Revenue was $4.3 billion, driven by lower 787 deliveries, partially offset by higher 737 volume. Although commercial airplanes\u2019 operating margin continued to be under pressure, they performed in the quarter -- they improved in the quarter due to higher 737 deliveries, lower abnormal production costs compared to the same period in the prior year and the absence of the first quarter 2020 charge related to the 737 NG pickle fork repair costs. We delivered 58 737 MAX airplanes in the first quarter. We currently have approximately 400 737 MAX aircraft built and stored in inventory. As we've previously communicated, we expect to have to remarket some of these aircraft and potentially reconfigure them. As you've seen by the recent orders, we are making good steady progress on the remarketing effort. You may also recall right before the 737 MAX return to service, we estimated that around half of the approximate 450 aircraft we had in storage would be delivered by the end of 2021, and the majority of the remaining by the end of the following year. That estimate is unchanged. Through the first quarter we have delivered 85 737 aircraft from storage, and as Dave mentioned, the recent delivery pause will impact our April deliveries. We expect delivery timing and the production rate ramp-up profile to remain dynamic given the market environment, customer discussions, and the remaining global regulatory approvals. There is no material change in our estimated for total 737 abnormal costs of $5 billion. During the first quarter, we expensed $568 million of abnormal production costs, which brought the cumulative abnormal cost expense to date to $3.1 billion. We expect the remainder of these costs to be expensed as incurred largely in 2021. Our assessment of the liability for estimated 737 MAX potential concessions and other considerations to customers as well as the expected cash impact timing did not change significantly in the first quarter from our prior assessment. Cumulatively, we've accrued a $9.3 billion liability for the estimated potential concessions and other considerations. To date, we've reduced the liability by $4.9 billion through cash payments to customers and other forms of compensation, including $1.2 billion we paid this quarter. We have settlement agreements covering approximately $2.5 billion of the remaining liability balance of $4.4 billion. Turning now to 787. As we discussed, we resumed deliveries in March. We currently have approximately 100 787 airplanes in inventory. Based on what we know today, we still anticipate that we will deliver the majority of these airplanes during 2021. We are working with our customers to facilitate deliveries and continue to monitor the international long-haul recovery as we assess our delivery plans. Our latest assessment of the financial impact related to the inspections and the delivery delays has been included in our first-quarter closing position. As we've previously disclosed, the 787 program has near breakeven gross margins due to previously announced reductions in production rates and program accounting quantity. If we are required to further reduce the accounting quantity and/or production rates or experience other factors that result in lower margins, the program could record a reach forward loss in future periods. However, on a cash basis, the 787-unit margin has held up relatively well even at lower production rates as many underlying profitability drivers remain intact. Moving now to 777X. As Dave mentioned, we still expect first delivery of the 777X to occur in late 2023 and we are making good progress on our flight test efforts. We still expect that peak use of cash for 777X program was in 2020 and that cash flow will improve as we get closer to EIS and begin deliveries in late 2023. We anticipate the program to turn cash flow positive approximately one to two years after the first delivery. Given the significant headwinds that remain in the market, BCA margin progression will be highly dependent upon future production rates and will take time. However, we continue to take appropriate action to make foundational lasting change through our business transformation efforts in order to help offset those headwinds as much as possible. Let's now move to Defense, Space, & Security on Slide 6. First quarter revenue increased to $7.2 billion, and first-quarter operating margins increased to 5.6%, primarily driven by higher KC-46A Tanker revenue and the absence of charges related to the program in prior period, partially offset by a pre-tax charge of $318 million on the VC-25B program which was largely due to COVID impact and performance issues at our supplier. We received $7 billion in orders in the quarter, including contracts for 27 KC-46A Tanker aircraft to the US Air Force, 11 P-8 Poseidon aircraft to the US Navy and Royal Australian Air Force, and six Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey rotorcraft to the US Navy and US Air Force holding the backlog steady at $61 billion. Let's now turn to Global Services results on Slide 7. In the first quarter, Global Services revenue declined to $3.7 billion, and operating margins decreased to 11.8%, both driven by lower commercial services volume due to COVID-19. No notable asset impairments were booked in the quarter. During the quarter, BGS won key contracts worth approximately $3 billion resulting in backlog of approximately $20 billion. While services demand was relatively flat in comparison to fourth quarter 2020 we expect the quarterly revenue trend to improve as we support increased airline operations and more airplanes are flying as travel recovers. That said, given the dynamic environment, we can expect to see revenue trajectory vary from quarter to quarter. Despite the challenging environment, we continue to position our services business for the future and are evaluating our portfolio to ensure that we have the right solutions to help our customers and industry navigate the downturn and prepare for market recovery. These efforts are starting to take hold and positively impact our operating margin performance. Let's now turn to cash flow on Slide 8. Operating cash flow for the quarter improved to negative $3.4 billion, reflecting the timing of receipts and expenditures and higher 737 deliveries, partially offset by lower 787 deliveries and lower advance payments. Let's move now to Slide 9 to discuss our liquidity position. We continue to proactively manage our cash position and assess our liquidity through the pandemic. We ended the first quarter with strong liquidity, including $21.9 billion of cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet and access to $14.8 billion from our newly increased bank credit facilities, which remain undrawn. We also continue to have access to the capital markets. Our debt balance remained stable at $63.6 billion at the end of the quarter. As part of our ongoing prudent liquidity actions, we refinanced $9.8 billion of our delayed draw term loan that was due in early 2022 and expanded our revolving credit facility by $5.3 billion. These liquidity-enhancing activities are in addition to the many actions we have discussed before, including suspending our dividend, reducing discretionary spending, matching 401(k) contributions in stock, pre-funding pension with stock, and awarding most of our employees a one-time stock grant that will vest in three years in lieu of a merit increase. These actions reflect our continued de-risking strategy and are part of our balanced approach to ensure we proactively meet future obligations. We worked hard in the past to maintain disciplined cash management, while seeking opportunities to strengthen our balance sheet, and we will continue these efforts. Once cash flow generation returns to more normal levels, reducing our debt level will be our top priority. We believe we currently have sufficient liquidity and are not planning to increase our debt levels. However, we will continue to actively manage our balance sheet. Our investment-grade credit rating is important to us, and we will continue to consider all aspects of our capital structure to strengthen our balance sheet. Let's turn now to the next slide to summarize. Our business environment remains dynamic, and while the commercial market recovery is gaining some traction and has been uneven and the path ahead is far from certain, we will continue to diligently work opportunities and monitor risk factors including vaccination pace and case rates along with passenger traffic recovery and remaining 737 MAX regulatory approvals and U.S.-China relations. As Dave mentioned, we're still awaiting 737 MAX regulatory approval from China, and the timing of it will affect our 737 delivery plan. China is an important market for our commercial airplanes and order activity from China will affect our future production rates. As we've discussed, even as our industry begins to recover, we anticipate 2021 will be another challenging year. However, based on what we know today, we still expect revenue, earnings, and operating cash to improve from 2020. Commercial deliveries will continue to be the single biggest driver across all financial metrics. Revenue improvement from 2020 to 2021 will be driven mainly by higher 737 and 787 deliveries as we plan to unwind inventory and deliver from the production lines. Consistent with what we shared last quarter, we also expect improvement to our bottom line from 2020 to 2021, primarily driven by higher commercial deliveries absent of 2020 charges, improved performance, and benefits from continued business transformation actions. These impacts will be partially offset by higher interest expense. Also bear in mind that our commercial business will continue to book significant abnormal production costs for the 737 program in 2021. Similar to our revenue and earnings trajectories, we continue to expect 2021 operating cash flow to be much improved from 2020, driven by -- mainly by inventory burn down associated with 737 and 787 programs. While higher deliveries will be a tailwind, the timing of advance payments and the burn down of excess advance payments along with 737 customer settlement payments and higher interest payments will continue to be headwinds. We expect the first quarter was the most challenging quarter from a cash perspective, and we expect the trend improve for the remainder of the year as we ramp up 787 and 737 deliveries in subsequent periods. However, there could be some timing variation quarter-over-quarter, so quarterly trajectory could be uneven. As discussed, our cash flow profile is heavily dependent upon obtaining the remaining 737 MAX regulatory approvals, the commercial market recovery, and ongoing discussions with our customers on their fleet planning needs. In aggregate, we continue to expect 2021 to be a use of cash. We expect that continued improvement on the 737 MAX program due to lower customer considerations and higher delivery payments as well as recovery in commercial services will enable us to turn positive cash flow in 2022. The key watch items that I highlighted earlier will be the differentiator in our outlook trajectory. Given the dynamic environment, we continue to monitor the risks and opportunities to ensure we're well positioned for the future. Over the past year, we've been keeping you updated on our extensive business transformation effort. We're continuing to closely examine all aspects of our operations to simplify and streamline everything we do and take billions of dollars out of our operating costs, while driving our key efforts in safety, quality, and performance. We're doing this now so that we can emerge a leaner, sharper, and more resilient company as the market recovers and production rate increases in the future. We'll continue to execute a widespread set of changes over a multi-year period. I'm pleased with the strong progress we have shown in 2020, that has carried into 2021, and is gaining momentum. We expect the majority of our efforts will result in lasting change that will drive long-term productivity, future margin expansion, and cash flow generation as our market continues to recover. And as we take action, we're ensuring that every step only further drives key efforts in safety, quality, and delivering on our commitments. We have a dedicated team focused on these efforts embedded in every business unit and function to ensure we're continually improving in every aspect of our operations. This is an enduring effort that our entire leadership team is committed to driving forward in the future. And finally, as you know, last week, I shared my intent to retire from Boeing in July. I want to take a moment to thank the 140,000-great people at Boeing and all of our partners who have made my 30 years at the company so special. It has been a true honor and a privilege to work alongside all of you. I will cherish the relationships that I've been very fortunate to have here and over the years and those include all of you in the financial community that I've had the opportunity to get to know so well over the last decade and beyond. At Boeing, I've been inspired every day by the incredible technology, products, and services we bring to the world. And while it's our products and our mission to get you excited, it's the great people at Boeing that make it all possible, and it is the people that I will miss the most. Over the next few months, I will be solely focused on a smooth transition of my responsibilities and then on to the next chapter in my career. I will always be cheering on Dave and the entire Boeing team from the sidelines. I'm confident in the long-term market opportunity ahead, the Boeing Company itself, and the team behind it. So, with that, I'll turn it back over to Dave for some closing comments. David Calhoun : Thanks, Greg. Thanks for everything as you know. On behalf of the Board and the entire Boeing team, I want to thank Greg for his incredible contributions and his dedication to Boeing and its people. His remarkable leadership has made a significant and lasting impact for our company, for our customers, and for our stakeholders. Thanks to Greg's efforts, Boeing has -- also has had the benefit of very solid teams across the function that he oversees, people I've gotten to know quite well. As we build on Greg's legacy, we're not searching for a new strategic direction. We will engage in a comprehensive and thoughtful search process for a world-class executive with the talent and skills commensurate with the high level that Greg has set. This process will encompass executives within Boeing and across the external market. We're well positioned for the future, and we will continue to transform our business to not just navigate through this pandemic but to ensure that we emerge stronger and more resilient for the long term. While there's no question that COVID-19 has had a profound impact on our industry, we view this year as a key inflection point as positive signs begin to emerge. As governments around the world accelerate vaccine distribution, people are getting back to work, and global economies are beginning to get back to business. And as they do, we are proud of our role in enabling travel to connect people, to connect businesses, and importantly to connect cultures. As we face into the challenges at hand, we remain steadfast in our commitment to quality, safety, integrity, and transparency. Through it all, I am proud of how our team continues to stay focused on our customers and their important missions, and I'm confident in our future. With that, Greg and I will be happy to take your questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you. Good morning, everyone, both Dave and Greg. Greg, congratulations and we look forward to your next chapter. I guess for either of you, how do we think about commercial profitability going forward and into next year? Is there a breakeven rate when we think about production or deliveries on both the MAX and the 787 as that destocking resolves itself? Greg Smith : Yes. Sheila, I think, as I mentioned in my remarks and obviously, I'll let Dave weigh in here, but it's really tied to burning off that inventory and then the production rates associated and particularly with the 737. So very similar to what we talked about on cash and revenue trajectory, earnings and margin are going to be very much on the same trajectory. But also, as we've talked about under the umbrella of business transformation, we've been really -- as we've been in this period, we've been challenging all aspects of the business and looking for opportunities to streamline but at the same time never losing sight of the future. So, as you've seen from as we posted last year, we continue to make significant investments in the business and we will. But at the same time, we're going to still stay very focused on the business transformation efforts that should help -- continue to help that trajectory as we see the market improve and then our ability to increase production rates associated with that improved market, but I'll let Dave weigh in as well. David Calhoun : Yes, there's probably not much I can add there, but I am -- I'll just add my confidence that as production rates begin to return to what we would consider ultimately normal and then above, we should get more leverage than we've ever gotten simply because of all the actions that we've taken with respect to the fixed and readiness to serve costs that are out there. But maybe even a bigger part is the stability we will bring back to the production lines themselves, so that as we move the rates up, we can do so in a stable fashion. There is enormous productivity attached to that track. So, I agree with all the comments that Greg made, I would just add that commentary. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you. Greg Smith : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And next, we'll go to the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Doug Harned : Thank you. Good morning. Greg Smith : Good morning. Doug Harned : First Greg, I just want to thank you for all the work you've done with all of us over the years. It's been great, and definitely want to wish you the best in your next steps here. Greg Smith : Thank you very much, Doug. Time's flown by. Doug Harned : Yes. No kidding, no kidding. It's a long time. Actually Dave, I have a question for you that also goes over a long time, I think and your involvement in the industry. If you think back over the years, Airbus and Boeing historically have always had kind of an ongoing battle about market share. They talk about against each other that sort of thing, and it's been particularly true on narrowbodies. So, when you look at the situation today, the MAX obviously has been held back, and there\u2019s still a large market for it. But Airbus has been delivering a lot of neos. They have a big backlog. On the last call, we talked a little bit about the 321XLR. So, when you look forward now, how important is market share? Do you think about that? Is that number for narrowbodies important, and is there something that -- is there a level that you would want to make sure that Boeing is at? David Calhoun : Yes, it's a great question. I want to be -- I want to split that market. Let's put it that way. That's the way it's played out historically. They do better in some segments of that market, and we do better in other parts of that market with respect to the products that we field. And I'm confident we can get there. What I will say about this is, I can't make up for the production gap that we created on our own right for that entire year. I can't make up for that. And so, I'm not going to try to regain that ground. I'm simply from this point forward going to try to hold our own with respect to what I think is our rightful share. I will also bring the rates back in the most stable fashion I can conceivably bring them. So, I will pace that. And I think that is good for Boeing and I think that is really good for shareholders. So, it's all a question over what period of time do you want to measure it? I'm confident that over a longer period of time, we'll get back to where we need to get to. And I'm confident in the product line, and I always have been and I continue to be, and I think some of the recent activity suggests that. When you look at the applications that we're actually putting our airplanes to work for, I think we're in a pretty decent place. So, -- it's a great question though. Doug Harned : But -- if I can follow-up on that, when you look at the last four months, you've been averaging a little bit more than 20 MAXs since it restarted, and that's clearly well below the capacity that you have to deliver them. What are the constraints here? Are they more on customer willingness to take delivery or more on your processes to get those airplanes out there and delivered? David Calhoun : Well, it's the former. I'm quite confident that recovery in this country is coming, and it's probably coming sooner than most anywhere with the exception of China. But when you look broadly around the world, it's not quite as robust. And so, this year is still going to be a rough and tumble year for most countries around the world, including Europe. And that is the issue, is when did they project that they're going to come out and then will the order activity pick up in each of those markets the same way it has picked up here in the United States, and I'm confident that it will and that we will get over those gaps, but it's uncertain in a lot of countries around the world. And then the final and very important stride is we've got to reinstate our trade relationship in aerospace with China. That's a big part of the market long term. It's important that we get our share -- our fair share of that market, which historically has always been at 50%, a little more when you consider all the widebody activity. And we need to get back to that stage. I believe that will happen but it's going to take a little time. Doug Harned : Great. Thank you. Operator : And next we'll go to Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much, and good morning. Greg, thanks very much for all your help over the years and best of luck to you. Greg Smith : Yes. Thanks Seth. Seth Seifman : Sure. I just wanted to ask this morning about 787. And we think -- when we think about the process from here similar to the question that Doug asked about 37, the delivery pace, is it more governed by customers' willingness to take deliveries or is it governed by putting aircraft through kind of a change in corporation process, in which case kind of how much of that work is done? And then not to split hairs too much here, but I believe last quarter the plan was to deliver the vast majority of the aircraft in inventory. And this quarter, it's the majority. So has that -- is there now an expectation to carry some more 787 inventory into 2022? David Calhoun : Yes. Can I -- let me take that and I'll let Greg -- if he wants to add something he can. You used the word willingness, and that's an important word. That is not the issue. It's -- there are a lot of logistics issues when we look at month to month to month to month around getting crews in and getting them out. Not so much with respect to the U.S. policy, but from where they might be coming. So, in all of these orders, there's not a giant reconfiguration cost embedded in the 87 program. These are orders with known customers and known destinations. And there was no -- we're not playing games with our language. We -- whether we put the word vast in front of it or not, we'll see. But that's not going to be because of a lack of willingness to take airplanes. It's just going to be because of logistical timing with respect to when crews can get in and take delivery and move them out. Anyways, that would be my commentary. Greg, anything you want to add? Greg Smith : No, no. I think that's absolutely right on. Seth Seifman : Okay, great. Thank you. Greg Smith : You're welcome. Operator : And our next question is from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Carter Copeland : Hi. Thanks. Good morning guys, and Greg I echo everyone else. Thank you so much for your help over the years and nothing but the best of luck in the next chapter. Greg Smith : Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Carter Copeland : You only have to deal with one more geeky accounting question from me. Greg Smith : I could guess what it is, but I won't. I'll let you\u2026 Carter Copeland : Like maybe you can ask it for yourself. I want to ask about the 87 deferred production number, the reduction in that --? Greg Smith : I would have had. That was my guess too. Carter Copeland : Good. Then you have the answer ready to go. So, you have been running $400 million, $500 million a quarter up until this quarter. You talked about a rate change. Obviously, you've got the rework on the planes that are sitting there in inventory. Can you just help us understand kind of bridge between the $178 million and the kind of numbers you were running, because the rate is not all that different it doesn't seem. So, any color there I think is helpful. Greg Smith : No absolutely. Yes. And actually, Carter you got it right. I mean it's all those other moving pieces that are obviously unusual and didn't exist in the prior quarter. So, once we kind of get through that and get kind of to a normalized pace, you'll see deferred continue on the trajectory that we've outlined before. But near term to your point, there's a lot of moving pieces in there. They're weighing into that number that are not, I would say sitting on a normalized level, but . But it will once we start continuing delivery. And long-term, like I said, we will be on the same path as we've talked about before. And like I said on a \u2026 Carter Copeland : Is it safe to say that the biggest piece is revaluation? Greg Smith : Pardon me? Carter Copeland : Is it safe to say the biggest piece of that delta is the revaluation of the inventory? Greg Smith : Well, it's the fact that you've got so much disruption going on in the factory. That's it. Carter Copeland : Okay. Greg Smith : Between the rework and building inventory and storing aircraft, it's all that that's weighing in the current period that obviously will not be experiencing once we -- even when we start ramping up, which is as Dave indicated earlier what we've already started. So, like I said, before long, you'll see that back at a normalized, I'll say level of burn. Outside of that, like I said cash -- unit cash basis, programs really doing a great job and really holding up well at a very low rate. And again, that's a testament to all the hard work that's gone on over the years on stabilizing the factory and the operations and the productivity initiatives. So, you're seeing the benefit of that. So, as the rate kind of stabilizes and goes up and we certainly deliver those inventoried aircraft, that's going to be a big driver as I mentioned on cash flow between the balance of this year and then going into 2022. Carter Copeland : Okay. Thank you very much. David Calhoun : If I could add just one thing is, we -- our pause went on longer than I think anybody wanted it to, maybe even including us except for that pause we directed an awful lot of energy, a lot of cost and a lot of effort to remove the nagging rework loops that existed for quite some time. So our ability to now climb down that rework curve, get back to real standard operations with fewer constraints to get us ready for a return on rate, I'm highly confident that that's exactly the way this is going to play out. So, it was purposeful with respect to that pause the amount of work that we took on. Carter Copeland : Great. Thank you for the color, gentlemen. David Calhoun : Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead. Peter Arment : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, Dave, Greg. David Calhoun : Good morning. Greg Smith : Good morning. Peter Arment : Greg, thanks for everything like everyone else said. I appreciate it over all the years. Greg Smith : Thank you. Peter Arment : Hey, Dave this is more I guess a bigger picture question on the US-China relations, kind of the watch item comment. It seems like it's the first time you're really highlighting this under the business environment. Has something changed in terms of your timeline on what you thought when the regulator would be approving, or is this just that it's just taking longer and maybe you could just give us a little more color on that in terms of when you expect it? Thanks. David Calhoun : Yes. Thank you. No, this issue has been hanging around for quite a while, but we have a new administration in place in the United States. I don't want to -- I didn't want to walk in their office on the first day when they're trying to come to grips with their own strategies with respect to China broadly, and I'm glad they're doing that. But we're now at a stage where the focus on the economic recovery here in the United States on the part of the administration as well as now getting their feet a little firmer on the ground with respect to China relations. It's time for us to just point out the economic implications of trade with China in the aerospace industry and commercial aviation specifically. They're significant. You all know that. And so, we're just hoping to get everybody incentivized and lobby both sides. We have great relationships in China. We have firm orders on the books with China, but we need to get the order stream going again, and I'm confident that that will happen, but this just happens to be the moment to begin to talk about that broadly, and that's why you saw me talk about it on the call this morning and in this discussion. We're just going to make sure that our administration knows the importance of getting those relationships straight. I think trade is good for everybody. I think they do too, but we've got to work our way through that and give them the time to process. Peter Arment : Okay. Dave, just as a follow-up to that is just the -- is the timing aspect if this drags on into the middle of the second half or later, if that impacts your rate decisions for next year? Is that what you were alluding to earlier? David Calhoun : Well, it will eventually. If we drag out all the way through the year, it eventually relates -- will impact the recovery of our rates, not so much the rates that exist as we exit the year. So, the pace of that recovery of those rates is what it may impact. And anyways narrowbodies before widebodies, but -- so that's it. It is what it is. Peter Arment : Got it. Thanks so much. David Calhoun : Yep. Operator : And our next question is from Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead. Myles Walton : Thanks, good morning. Greg, best wishes on the next pursuit. Thanks for all the help over the years. Greg Smith : Thank you. Myles Walton : Even the IR at Raytheon was helpful. The question for Dave or Greg one of the pushbacks I get which I think is actually fair is that Boeing maybe shouldn't be putting or taking out as much structural cost, and instead maybe there's an absence of cost that need to be added for innovation, program execution, and supply chain health. I know the last call, a lot of the comments were actually on the structural cost actions. I'm just curious how would you respond to that given the program execution has not been perfect whether you can go down the list, but how would you respond to -- you actually might need to put structural cost into the system? David Calhoun : Yes. Well, I completely reject that argument, and of course, I would, but we have maintained and sustained -- it's actually quite remarkable in light of everything we face, but we have sustained all the important research investments that we've been making. We've sustained all of the development programs that were in the works and they're not insignificant, and we've added resource to those development programs as reflected in the accounting adjustments we made at the end of last year. They represent that we put time and we put more cost into these programs. We didn't make -- take less. So, I'm actually very confident. I think we have removed an awful lot of duplication of effort, and Greg can give you that in living color, especially with respect to overlapping technology development programs between our BDS and our commercial world. So anyway, I'm confident in our future, and I think the level of investment we put into our research and development differentiators compared to our competitors, I feel great about. I feel great about it. That's the benchmark we care the most about. So, anyway that would be my commentary. I'll turn it over to Greg. Greg Smith : Yes. No surprise. I completely agree. And, look I think you\u2019ve got -- also got to step back. We've invested over $60 billion over the last 10 years, and that has all been in key technologies and programs and all efforts within our factory, within our space. So, we have not been short on investment by any means. And you saw even last year in the middle of the pandemic, we continued to make the appropriate investments in the right area of the business. And I'd say even in some cases, we've made more investment like on the 737 line in order to capture stability on the other end, as Dave indicated. It's ultimately going to be great for our company but great for our industry and our partners. So, in a lot of cases, we've moved money or shifted money or even added money in some cases because we're playing a long game here and we're looking for areas where we have constraints or where as Dave said we have duplication of effort. And we're just challenging ourselves also in what's best-in-class, even down to program levels of layers and spans around leadership and what constraint they have down at a program level, and how can we remove those constraints, so -- but not losing sight of the future. And quite frankly, making some of these moves that are going to provide even more stability going forward as Dave indicated, and that's the whole idea that as 37 rate comes up, we see better stability coming out of this than we did going in, and it's no different on any of the other programs. So -- and yes, there\u2019s lots being done here and there are going to be -- continue to be lots being done, but I think I can speak on behalf of everybody, no losing sight of the future here and it's all about helping our workforce, helping our suppliers, and driving stability that ultimately will be good for the entire industry. Myles Walton : Thanks for the color. Greg Smith : You\u2019re welcome. Myles Walton : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss : Thank you. Greg, let me echo what everyone else said. Congrats on a good job particularly in these last couple of years. Greg Smith : Thanks, David. David Strauss : I want to ask on 787, the 100 or so aircraft that are parked today, what proportion of those have actually had the fixes implemented? And how long does it take to make the fixes to an individual airplane? And just so we're all on the same page here, you're implying that you think you can deliver 100-plus aircraft over the next three quarters. Greg Smith : Yes. So maybe I'll start and Dave can certainly weigh in here. But as far as the number of aircraft, we're working through them sequentially, Dave. So, we're working through them in tail number by tail number. So, as we're working through those that's informing aligned up with our delivery plan. So, you're not going to see all of them being reworked at the same time. That's not going to -- how it's going to work and that's not how it is working, but it's progressing well as you can see by the increase in the deliveries so far to date. As far as -- you're measuring this in days as far as the amount of rework required, but we're taking whatever time it takes to get the work done in station and completed per our spec. But it is improving aircraft over aircraft. So, as the teams are completing the rework, they are actually coming down a learning curve. So, we anticipate that overall cycle time to improve. And like we said, look, we're -- right now, we've got a schedule lined up with -- by tail number, by month, by customer that gets the majority of the 100 inventoried aircraft delivered by the end of the year. And as Dave indicated, that could move around from customer to customer and so on, but we're trying to stay ahead of that and staying very engaged with our customers around specific time frames of which we'll be making our delivery and all that aligned up with how we do the rework and how we stabilize the ramp and complete the final deliveries. So, I don't know, Dave, if there was anything, you wanted to add to that? David Calhoun : No, no. This is more about, how the airplanes move from position to position as opposed to the applied work itself. And at the end of the day, we're going to be at a rate probably this month at 10 or 12 airplanes, and that just demonstrates that that's what we can do. And we're going to hold that rate for as long as we can depending on customers and their ability to get in and take deliveries. It's -- again, as I said before, the trick in this one is the logistics of all of the customers coming in and out and then how we move these planes through position. The applied work itself, that's pretty clear and it's getting more productive every day. So, we're in a pretty good place on that front. David Strauss : Thanks. And Greg, you had mentioned sequential free cash flow improvement through the year. Would you expect by the fourth quarter that you're free cash flow positive? Greg Smith : Yes. No, what I said was that the first quarter was the more challenging one. It's going to be plus or minus month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter. So, it\u2019s going to be a little bumpy David, but it's going to play right back into Dave's comment just prior on the 87 delivery profile that's not linear. So, it's again laid out in detail, but it's not exactly the same month over month or quarter over quarter, so all that's going to play in. But look, everybody is working extremely hard obviously to meet our commitments to our customers', get these aircraft reworked appropriately and then of course get -- continue the delivery and the same thing on the 737, and that's what's going to get us to a better profile by the end of the year. But I'd expect it to be lumpy quarter-over-quarter between and particularly the second and third quarter, and then some -- I think on a better trajectory in the fourth quarter. David Strauss : Great. Appreciate the comments. Greg Smith : Yes, you are welcome. Operator : And next, we'll go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ron Epstein : Yes. Good morning guys. Greg, I echo everybody else's comments. It's been a pleasure working with you over the years both at Raytheon and at Boeing. So, thank you for that. Greg Smith : Likewise. Ron Epstein : Best of luck with what's going on. Dave, a question for you. So, I just want to follow up on Myles' question. You've talked a lot about business transformation. What's the end state? And ultimately, how does engineering fit into that vision? Because to be fair, 73 had issues, 78 had issues, 777X has issues, 747-8 had issues, KC-46 has issues, Air Force One now has issues, and the Starliner has issues. So, how does business transformation fix that? David Calhoun : Well, I'll remind everybody that the A380, the A350, the A330, the A3... Ron Epstein : We're not talking about Airbus. We're talking about Boeing. David Calhoun : But I just want to remind everybody, but they -- that they had a little trouble as well. These programs are big and they're complicated. So, the idea that we fix everything, I'm not sure, I can sign up for that. The idea that we're going to be a whole lot better, I can sign up for it. And the work we've done to align our engineering function broadly, everybody inside the company has signed up for that endeavor and feels great about it. The work we've done with respect to the safety management system that surrounds that engineering function and which they lead in behlf of the company, it avails itself to new data to a faster cycle time with respect to how our company processes that data and ultimately makes decisions around that data. And a reinvestment in the fundamental design practices of the company that will instill disciplines that we just need to get better and better at, and everybody in the company signed up to do this, and we're making real investments in that process. So, I feel very, very, very good about all of that. And it will -- it does not mean, that in a flight test somewhere along the way we don't run into an issue that needs to get resolved. And so, it is the nature of our industry to do big things and do them very well. So anyway, I'm confident that these transformation efforts are significant. I'm also confident on this production stability which goes hand-in-hand with engineering. We've taken actions over this -- really hard actions over this course of this year to stop things when we see an issue and get them fixed once and for all, and the 87 in Q1 was a glaring example of that. These fit and finish issues with respect to the joints in our fuselages were just nagging problems, difficult problems, and we applied real engineering talent and expertise to that, new process controls, new lines of communication with our supply side so that we're not surprised by that stuff anymore and we can eliminate rework loops that ultimately travel with the product. I could go on and on and on and on and on, but I think some of the signs should be very apparent to you and to our customers. Ron Epstein : On the next product, would we expect to see it go smoother? David Calhoun : Yes. Yes, and I expect the next product to get differentiated probably in a significant way on the basis of the way it's engineered and built and less dependent on the propulsion package that goes with it. Ron Epstein : Got it. Okay. Thank you. David Calhoun : Yes. Thanks. Operator : And next we go to Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead. Jon Raviv : Good afternoon. Thank you very much and best of luck Greg kind of obviously on the next endeavor. Greg Smith : Thank you. Jon Raviv : But one related question here looking at the balance sheet, I mean, when we look at net leverage, you're over three times levered versus your peak EBITDA, and appreciate that number climbs as you continue to consume cash. So, how is the company prepared for, you know god forbid another crisis given this position and your commitment to the IG rating? I realize you've issued some stocks for pension and 401(k), but how are you evaluating it here? I know it's a different conversation versus $100 ago, but here we are in the mid-200s depending on the day. So how are you thinking about that dynamic at this point? Greg Smith : Yes. Look, I don't think it's any different than we have been thinking about it since the beginning, which is we're looking around corners and playing out options and making sure we have them and understanding the second and third order effect. And to your point, some of them -- sequence of these sometimes matters and the timing of them matters. So, I think the big takeaway should be that we're going to constantly review the capital structure and the strategy and the long-term strength of the balance sheet. And with that, we're going to keep all our options open and on the table. But how we think about it is again not just as a base case, but we just -- as we have just keep looking around corners and understanding what levers would we pull and when would we need to pull them and what would be the implications of doing that. And as I said on the call that as we see it today, we don't see a need for additional liquidity, but also as you've seen how we've handled the bank line and extended our credit facility, we\u2019re making sure that we've got all the right things in place if we need to go there. And if we do, we'll be prepared to do so. Jon Raviv : Thanks very much for fitting me in. Greg Smith : Yes. You\u2019re welcome. Maurita Sutedja : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. And that will be from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hunter Keay : Thank you so much for getting on. Greg, let me be the last one to say congratulations. It's been a pleasure. Greg Smith : Yes. Likewise, Hunter. Thanks. Hunter Keay : Of course. Dave, I'd love for you to continue on the comment that you made to Ron at the end there about what's next and how it's less dependent on the propulsion package. Can you just continue to elaborate on what you're about to say please? What is this going to involve from a product perspective, but also from a manufacturing perspective? What are you guys thinking about? David Calhoun : Yes. So, there's a lot that goes into this, but I think it's important that everyone understand. Most often when a new airplane is developed by either side, it is usually developed around a propulsion package that offers 15% to 20% improvement with respect to efficiency versus the one it's displacing. That's the way it's happened over a long period of time. I don't believe the next generation of engine can deliver that kind of performance. And then therefore, whatever cost efficiency ultimately and whatever performance advantages are derived from the next airplane in my view are going to come from the way it's engineered and the way it's manufactured all with a focus on a lower cost per seat when we get it out to the marketplace, and yes, a more sustainable package with respect to environment. So that's what we all have to be focused on. I like the pressure that puts on the manufacturers. That means the technologies we deploy are our technologies. We've done an awful lot of fantastic work in our defense programs with respect to using engineering modeling and then manufacturing processes that tap that engineering modeling directly, create parts that can be assembled in one motion with great efficiency. Secondly, we've invested as you know in composites in our platforms for a very, very long time. The learning curves associated with getting efficient at composite development are significant. I believe Boeing has a huge advantage on that front, and so how we bring that engineering modeling, the composite development work that we've done over these years, and then quick, simple assembly like we've demonstrated with the trainer airplane and other defense programs, we have to do it at scale and we have to prove to ourselves we can do it at scale. But in my view, those are going to be the advantages to that next airplane that gets developed, and I just love where Boeing is positioned on that front when the time comes. Hunter Keay : Thank you. David Calhoun : Yes. Maurita Sutedja : All right. That completes the Boeing Company's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Thank you all for joining.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst question-and-answer session are being broadcast live over the Internet. [Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Ms. Maurita Sutedja, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Ms. Sutedja, please go ahead. Maurita Sutedja : Thank you, John. Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's second quarter 2021 earnings call. I'm Maurita Sutedja. And with me today are David Calhoun, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Dohnalek, Boeing\u2019s Interim Chief Financial Officer. And as a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. Projections, estimates and goals we include in our discussion this morning involve risks, including those described in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statements disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures. Now I will turn the call over to David Calhoun. David Calhoun : Thank you, Maurita, and good morning, everyone. I hope you're all staying well as we continue through this global pandemic. And please encourage everyone you know to get the vaccine if they haven't already. With the onset of COVID-19 roughly a year-and-a-half ago, our worlds were turned upside down. As an industry, we faced it head on and worked together every step of the way. While there is still ways to go before a full recovery, we're encouraged by the continued progress on vaccine distribution and the uptick in domestic travel. We're also looking forward to further progress on coordinated international travel policies and protocols. I've said before that we view this year as a critical inflection point, and it's proving to be just that. We're turning a corner and the recovery is gaining momentum. Throughout all of this, we are continuously learning and adapting how we operate to best serve our customers, our suppliers, our teammates, our communities, and other stakeholders. And I'm proud of how our team has remained focused on our mission. Before I go through our business update, I'd like to take a moment to recognize and thank Dave Dohnalek for serving as our Interim CFO. Dave is a proven well-respected leader here at Boeing, and I'm grateful for his partnership as we transition. And as you know, we have appointed Brian West to serve as Boeing's next CFO. It's effective August the 27. Brian is an exceptional leader with significant financial management and long-term strategic planning experience in complex global organizations across the aerospace, manufacturing and services industries. And thanks to Greg Smith's legacy, he is inheriting a world-class finance team here at Boeing. I've worked directly with Brian previously in my professional career. He has brought operational expertise and will bring a great perspective to our business transformation journey and post-pandemic recovery as he joins the team this month. With that, let's start with an update on our business on the next chart. Overall, we've made important progress in the quarter as our transformation actions began to take traction or get traction. And we focused on improving performance and driving stability across all of our operations. Let's start with the 737 program, where we've made significant headway. We resumed 737 MAX deliveries in May and have continued to support our airline customer efforts to return those fleets to service. Excuse me, I\u2019ll keep going? Yes. In the second quarter, we delivered 47 737 MAX airplanes, including our first 737-8-200 delivery to Ryanair. The 737 MAX 10 also completed its first flight in June, marking an important milestone for the largest member of the 737 family. As you may recall, roughly nine months ago, we had approximately 450 airplanes in inventory and we were awaiting approval from the FAA to begin returning the 737 MAX to service. Fast forward to today and the progress is noteworthy. 175 countries have now approved the resumption of 737 MAX operations. We've delivered more than 130 airplanes. Our airline customers have returned more than 190 previously grounded airplanes to revenue service. 30 airlines have returned their fleets to service and those airlines have safely flown nearly 95,000 commercial flights, totaling more than 218,000 flight hours. Importantly, the fleet has an impressive schedule reliability rate of more than 99%.  Airlines are operating over 1,000 revenue flights daily. And just last week added nearly 3 million 737 MAX seats into second half 2021 schedule operations, a testament to the value proposition the airplane family offers. And as domestic traffic recovers, we believe we have started to turn a corner from an overall demand perspective. This is reinforced by five straight months of positive net commercial airplane orders, driven primarily by the 737 MAX. We are honored by the more than 280 additional orders during the quarter, including those from United Airlines and Southwest Airlines. And we appreciate the trust our customers are placing in Boeing and the 737 family. These orders underscore our customers\u2019 commitment to continued fleet modernization as well as the accelerating demand for air travel. These new 737 airplanes are designed to improve the customer experience, while significantly lowering carbon emissions per seat. At the end of the quarter, we had over 3,300 aircraft in our 737 backlog. We\u2019re currently producing 16 airplanes per month and continue to expect to gradually increase the rate to 31 a month in early 2022, with further gradual increases to correspond with market demand and, importantly, supply chain capacity. We will continue to assess the production rate plan as we monitor the market environment and engage in customer discussions. As we previously communicated, the timing of remaining regulatory approvals will shape our delivery plans and our production ramp \u2013 our rate ramp. We continue to work with global regulators and still anticipate that the remaining regulatory approvals will occur this year, including China. And as always, we will follow global regulators lead in the steps ahead. Now, I\u2019d like to spend a bit of time on our business transformation efforts. As we discussed before, our activities in this area are organized around five pillars : infrastructure, overhead and organization, supply chain health, portfolio and investment, and operational excellence. We\u2019ve put rigor around each pillar and have detailed projects supporting each one. We are implementing these projects to create long-lasting change, which will improve our competitiveness, help us grow our cash flow and create a foundation to enable us to return to healthy margins even at lower production rates. Many of the projects that we\u2019re executing have been shared previously and are widely visible such as consolidating the 787 final assembly in Charleston, optimizing our facilities\u2019 footprint to reduce nearly 6 million square feet of real estate and forming strategic partnerships with IT vendors accelerating our migration to the cloud. Other projects may be less visible externally, but they are improving our productivity, simplifying our operations, reducing bureaucracy and driving first-time quality. Through our business transformation efforts over the past year, we\u2019ve reduced billions of dollars of costs. And our objective is that the majority of the savings is long-lasting even when volume returns. At the same time, we remain focused on identifying new opportunities to further streamline how we operate. We\u2019ve started to see the benefits of these efforts in our quarterly financial results, which Dave will go through in more detail. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, we\u2019ve been adjusting the size of our workforce to align with the commercial market environment reality and lower production rates. We now plan to keep our overall workforce size roughly consistent with where we are today at approximately 140,000. This will allow us to support the encouraging trends we\u2019ve seen in the commercial market recovery, the growth opportunities in our defense and government services business and increased investments to strengthen engineering and drive quality and stability into our production system where the payback is large. Going forward, the pace of the commercial market recovery, trade relations with China, production rates and our own performance, our execution, will be key factors of our overall employment levels. Turning to our efforts to drive stability, with every action we\u2019re driving toward engineering excellence, production system stability and first-time quality and delivery predictability, which holding ourselves accountable to the highest standards. We\u2019re implementing comprehensive quality and productivity initiatives in our factories and strengthening our quality reviews within our supply chain. We conduct regular audits internally with suppliers to ensure adherence to improve processes and practices, ranging from production methods to documentation standards. And as part of our process, we proactively and transparently keep the FAA fully aware of our efforts. This enhanced rigor has helped identify areas that we can improve. And by identifying and correcting any issue at the source while our rates are still relatively low, we can strengthen first-time quality, eliminate traveled work and drive stability and predictability as demand returns. These efforts have played a key role in supporting a healthy and stable rate ramp on the 737 MAX and we\u2019re applying this same approach to the 787. Now, specifically on the 787 program, I understand the difficulties we have caused by the inconsistency in both our production rate and our delivery cadence. The impacts are felt by our suppliers and by our customers. I also recognize these uncertainties create challenges to the investment community to forecast our performance. We are determined to address these issues and will work tirelessly to do so, just like we have and continue to do on the 737 MAX. We\u2019re fully committed to this methodical approach to driving first-time quality and stability in our operations. The issues that our engineering teams have identified and we are now addressing are part of this purposeful process and we have transparently communicated with our regulators and customers every step of the way. We\u2019re progressing through these inspections and rework, including the additional work we shared earlier this month. We continue to engage in detailed discussions with the FAA on verification methodologies for the 787. And based on our assessment of the time required, we\u2019re reprioritizing production resources for a few weeks to support the inspection and rework. As that work is performed, the 787 production rate is now lower than five per month and will gradually return to that rate. The exact timing of returning to a rate of five per month will depend upon our progress on production stability and delivering airplanes from inventory. Of the approximately 100 787s currently in inventory, we expect to deliver fewer than half of them this year. While this has a near-term impact to our operations, I\u2019m confident it\u2019s the right course of action and we will continue to take the time necessary to ensure the highest levels of quality. Although it\u2019s been a long journey, we believe we\u2019re closer to the end than the beginning. Let me touch on the 777/777X program before I move to other segments. The combined 777/777X production rate is two per month. We continue to see strong freighter demand, as evidenced by orders for 13 777 freighters in the quarter, providing a solid bridge to the 777X. On the 777X program, we are subjecting the airplane to a comprehensive test program designed to demonstrate its safety and reliability as well as meet all applicable requirements. We continue to communicate transparently with the FAA and other global regulators about certification. And like any development program, we learn every step of the way. We incorporate feedback from our regulators and we mature and advance our product with every conversation, every engagement, every test, every review. We continue to make progress to the previously shared schedule, including certification work with regulators and conducting Boeing flight tests. The performance data we\u2019ve collected to-date suggests the airplane is performing as we expected and to our customers\u2019 commitments. We will be validating these results in the near future, along with continuing to work with the FAA to ensure we meet the requirements prior to beginning certification flight tests. We continue to expect that we will deliver the first 777X in late 2023, as we shared previously. Meanwhile, we continue delivering for our Defense, Space and Services customers. Dave will go through the financials in more detail in his remarks. But as you can see from the results, both our Defense and Services businesses had strong financial performance in the quarter. Let me highlight a few accomplishments. Our Defense, Space & Security team made history as our MQ-25 test asset completed the first ever unmanned aerial refueling of another aircraft, the F-18. We also joined the front fuselage of the first production T-7A with its aft section in less than 30 minutes, a testament to the digital advancements of the U.S. Air Force first E-series aircraft and a demonstration of our model-based engineering and 3D design benefits. Earlier this month, the U.S. Air Force approved the KC-46A tanker for Joint Forces operational use of the centerline hose and drogue refueling system, which provides more daily operational capabilities. KC-46A tanker is of critical importance to our customer. Moving to Space, we began stacking the core stage of NASA\u2019s Space Launch System rocket with other Artemis 1 elements at Kennedy Space Center. And of course, we\u2019re looking forward to the un-crewed orbital flight test of our Commercial Crew Starliner vehicle later this week. Additionally, in our Global Services business, we announced that we will be opening two new Boeing converted freighter lines in 2022. We also signed a parts agreement with Turkish Technic and received a key contract to support C-17 training from the UK Royal Air Force. In addition to program milestones, we made key progress on our sustainability, innovation and technology efforts. Just this week, we published Boeing\u2019s first Integrated Sustainability Report, which is an important step in our continued efforts to reinforce our environmental, social and governance principles. Also, we recently announced that we\u2019re collaborating with Alaska Airlines to fly an Alaska 737-9 aircraft in our ecoDemonstrator program. In fact, today, our ecoDemonstrator aircraft is at Reagan National Airport demonstrating to key leaders many of the new technologies and improvements we\u2019re making to enhance safety and support a more sustainable future. Earlier this month, we also announced a partnership with SkyNRG focused on advancing the availability and use of sustainable aviation fuels, or SAF, globally. As part of this commitment, we will invest in SkyNRG Americas\u2019 first dedicated U.S. production facility for SAF to help establish SAF supply for airports and airline customers largely on the West Coast. Now let\u2019s turn to the next slide to discuss the industry environment. Our Government Services, Defense and Space businesses remain significant and relatively stable. While increased government spending on COVID-19 response is adding pressure to defense budgets in some countries, others are increasing spending on their security. Overall, the global defense market remains strong and we continue to see solid global demand for our major programs. The diversity of our portfolio will continue to help provide critical stability for us as we move forward. Congress has kicked off the annual authorization and appropriations cycle for fiscal year 2022. The President\u2019s budget proposal called for strategic investments in Boeing products and services from across the BDS and our BGS portfolios. The budget proposal demonstrates confidence in the capabilities of Boeing\u2019s F-15EX and Apache, as well as key commercial derivative programs such as the KC-46 tanker and space programs like the Space Launch System, SLS, among other platforms. The FA-18 and the Chinook Block II remain critical capabilities for the war fighter, both domestically and for non-U.S. customers. We will continue to work with the administration and work with Congress to ensure the necessary support for these key programs are in place. In the commercial market, while near-term pressure due to COVID-19 remains \u2013 the recovery is accelerating, and many of the key long-term fundamentals remain intact. In June, we saw global departures approach 70% of 2019 levels, up from less than 60% in the first quarter. We\u2019ve seen encouraging signs in some markets, although the recovery continues to be uneven. In the near-term, we expect the environment will remain very challenged for many of our of airline customers and the industry as a whole as they adapt to this rapidly evolving travel demand. While vaccine dissemination is broadening and some travel restrictions are loosening, others are still in place and some even tightening, which keeps significant pressure on passenger traffic. Continuing the positive momentum we saw in the first quarter, domestic traffic is leading the recovery. May domestic traffic was 24% below 2019 levels compared to 50% the quarter before. Since then, it continues to pick up in regions like the U.S. and Europe and we anticipate continued improvement this summer. The U.S. domestic market is showing remarkable recovery with summer bookings consistent with 2019 levels, according to several airlines. TSA average daily throughput has already reached over 2 million passengers, around 80% of 2019 levels. Additionally, some regions such as Europe, India, Latin America are recently seeing double digit monthly improvements in operations as vaccine rates improve and travel restrictions begin to loosen. While a recovery in China has wavered at times due to case rates, it remains robust with operations above 80% of pre-pandemic levels. However, passenger traffic in other parts of the world such as Southeast Asia remains significantly lower due to travel restriction uncertainty and new strains of the virus. International operations remain extremely low and May traffic still 85% of 2019. And concerns about virus variants and limited coordination on cross-border entry protocols are still, significantly hindering recovery in the international segment. Nevertheless, on average, roughly 100 aircraft per week have returned to service over the past four months, making the active fleet now approximately 80% of its previous size with single-aisle activity levels slightly above twin-aisle. And although utilization rates and load factors are increasing in some areas, they are still below historic levels, which means airlines are flying around 70% of their normal capacity at the global level. With the toughest impacts appearing to be in the rearview mirror, airlines are shifting their focus to medium-term fleet planning. The number of aircraft being retired from the active fleet is significant with around 1,500 airplanes and growing retired or announced to be removed since the onset of the pandemic. We anticipate this trend will continue as our customers focus on replacing the oldest, least efficient airplanes with new airplanes that will be as much as 25% to 40% more fuel efficient with commensurate reductions in emission. The freighter market continues to be strong with cargo traffic year-to-date through May at 8% higher than 2019. Limited belly cargo capacity from passenger airplanes has resulted in more freighters flying with high load factors. In fact, 72% of air cargo is now being carried on dedicated freighters. That compares to 48% pre-pandemic. This demand is evidenced by orders in the quarter for 31 additional freighter airplanes and strong demand for Boeing-converted freighters. Longer-term, cargo demand will continue to be driven by global trade and GDP growth, both of which experienced improvement in the second quarter. And we\u2019ve shared previously and consistent with IATA and other industry groups, we expect passenger traffic to return to 2019 levels in 2023 to 2024 and then a few years beyond that to return to long-term trend growth. We still see recovery in three phases. First, domestic, then regional markets such as intra-Asia, intra-Europe, intra-Americas and, finally, long haul, international routes. Therefore, we expect demand for narrow-body aircraft to recover faster, as evidenced by our year-to-date orders for 737 MAX airplanes and demand for wide-body aircraft to remain challenged for a longer period. On the global trade environment, we welcome the agreement between European Union and United States that all future government support for the development or production of commercial aircraft must be provided on market terms. We will fully support the U.S. government\u2019s efforts to enforce this agreement. We are also monitoring U.S. trade \u2013 U.S.-China trade relations, given the importance of the China market to our economy and our industry\u2019s recovery as well as our near-term delivery profile and future orders, all of which influence future production rates. We remain in active discussions with our Chinese customers on their fleet planning needs and will continue to engage with leaders in both countries to urge a productive dialogue, reiterating the mutual economic benefits of a strong and prosperous aerospace industry. Ultimately, America\u2019s leadership in aerospace as well as the health and stability of millions of commercial aerospace jobs rely on free and fair trade. And we\u2019re confident our leaders understand the importance of this area not just for our business but for the overall health of our economy and competitiveness. Turning to the commercial services market. We saw improved demand in the second quarter as we are rebounding from the trough and as airlines prepared for the summer season. We expect this trend to continue near-term slightly ahead of our expectations. That said, we still anticipate a multi-year recovery that may be uneven. Overall industry liquidity, which remains critical for our industry and our industry\u2019s bridge to full recovery, it\u2019s been improving. Product differentiation and versatility will also be key as airlines adapt to the evolving market realities. I\u2019m confident our product lineup is well-positioned and we\u2019re focused on executing to meet our customers\u2019 needs. The impact of COVID-19 has been significant and a number of challenges remained, but we are seeing signs of recovery. More broadly, across the economy, we\u2019re now seeing positive indicators for economic growth. And we believe bipartisan agreements on infrastructure investment can further support growth across the economy, not just for airports and highways, but also for the tens of thousands of small businesses and suppliers that contribute to industries like ours across the country. With economic activities picking up, labor availability within our supply chain is a watch item. As we position for a market recovery, we\u2019re taking the right actions to manage liquidity and drive long-lasting change to make our business leaner, sharper, more sustainable. We remain committed to safety, quality, transparency and I\u2019m confident in our path forward. And with that, let me turn it over to Dave Dohnalek. Dave Dohnalek : Great. Thanks, Dave. And good morning, everyone. It\u2019s good to be reconnecting with many of you that I know from my time in Investor Relations and throughout my career at Boeing. I\u2019m honored to be in the role of Interim CFO and to help facilitate a smooth transition for Brian. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 4, please. Second quarter revenue increased to $17 billion, primarily due to higher commercial deliveries and commercial services volume. Positive earnings in the quarter also benefited from lower period costs. Additionally, several non-recurring items favorably contributed to the quarter. Income tax in the quarter primarily reflects benefits from a lower valuation allowance. Now let\u2019s turn to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. Revenue was $6 billion, reflecting higher commercial airplane deliveries. The improvement from the prior year was also due to a $551 million 737 MAX customer consideration impact in the second quarter of last year. Although Commercial Airplanes operating margin continued to be under pressure, it improved in the quarter due to higher commercial airplane deliveries and lower period costs. We delivered 47 MAX airplanes in the second quarter. We currently have approximately 390 MAX aircraft built and stored in inventory. We have made significant progress in our efforts to remarket some of our inventory airplanes and have now largely addressed that issue and put it behind us. Just prior to the 737 MAX return to service in the U.S., we estimated that around half of the approximately 450 aircraft we had in storage would be delivered by the end of 2021 and the majority of the remaining aircraft by the end of 2022. That expectation has not changed. We expect delivery timing and the production rate ramp profile to remain dynamic, given the market environment, customer discussions and the remaining global regulatory approvals. There is no material change in our assumption for 737 abnormal costs or our assessment of the liability for estimated 737 MAX potential concessions and other considerations to customers. Turning to 787. Second quarter deliveries were light as we worked through the activities that Dave just mentioned. Our latest assessment of the financial impact of inspections, rework, temporary production rate adjustment and delivery delays has been included in our second quarter closing position. The 787 program margin remains near breakeven. On a cash basis, these additional costs will create a headwind in the near term. However, we still expect overall unit margins to hold up relatively well. Moving now to 777X. As Dave mentioned, we still expect first delivery of the 777X to occur in late 2023. We are making progress in our flight test activities. We still expect that the peak use of cash for the 777X program occurred in 2020 and that cash flow will improve as we get closer to EIS and begin deliveries in late 2023. We anticipate the program will turn cash flow positive approximately one to two years after first delivery. We are starting to see improvements in Commercial Airplanes financial performance due to increasing 737 MAX deliveries and great efforts by the BCA team to manage costs through our business transformation activities. We also captured strong orders in the quarter, which is a testament to the value of our products and our customers\u2019 focus shifting now to fleet planning. Although the Commercial recovery will take time and we still have work to do, we\u2019re on a positive path and we remain \u2013 and we will remain focused on driving stability on the 787 program and across the business. Let\u2019s now move to Defense, Space & Security on Slide 6. Second quarter revenue increased to $6.9 billion, primarily due to higher volume on the KC-46A tanker program and the P-8A program. We posted the strong operating margin of 13.9% in the second quarter. The margin increase was driven by lack of a charge on the tanker program as compared to second quarter of 2020 as well as a favorable adjustment on a non-U.S. contract. We received $4 billion in orders during the quarter, including an award for 14 Chinook helicopters for the UK Royal Air Force. We also reached an agreement with Germany for five P-8A aircraft. BDS backlog is currently valued at $59 billion. Now let\u2019s turn to Global Services on Slide 7. In the second quarter, Global Services revenue increased to $4.1 billion and operating margin grew to 13.1% driven by higher Commercial Services as the market continues recovering from the impact of COVID-19. Operating margin was also helped by lower asset impairments, lower severance costs and a favorable mix of products and services. During the quarter, BGS won key contracts worth approximately $3 billion, resulting in a total backlog now of $19 billion. We saw incremental improvement in Commercial Services during the second quarter and we expect the quarterly revenue trend to improve as we support increasing airline flight operations. That said, given the dynamic environment, we can expect to see variability in the revenue and margin trajectory from quarter-to-quarter at BGS. Now let\u2019s take a look at cash flow on Slide 8. Operating cash flow for the quarter improved significantly to negative $0.5 billion, reflecting higher Commercial deliveries, higher order receipts, reduced expenditures on lower wide-body production rates and benefits from our business transformation efforts. While we saw a cash flow benefit from order activity in the second quarter, keep in mind that we continue to expect advanced payment burn-down to be a headwind for the rest of this year and into next. Now let\u2019s move to Slide 9 and discuss our liquidity position. We ended the second quarter with strong liquidity, including $21.3 billion of cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet and access to $14.8 billion from our bank credit facilities which remain undrawn. Our debt balance remains stable at $63.6 billion at the end of the quarter. We expect to have lower total debt at the end of the year due to the paydown of maturing bonds and potential early paydown of our delayed draw term loan. Given the dynamic environment, we maintain vigilance in managing our cash. Thanks to actions taken throughout the business to enhance our cash balance, we believe we currently have sufficient liquidity. We remain focused on reducing our debt levels and actively managing our balance sheet. Our investment-grade credit rating is important to us and we will continue to consider all aspects of our capital structure to strengthen our balance sheet. Moving to the next slide. In summary, we operate in a dynamic business environment. We\u2019re seeing the commercial market recovery accelerating. However, it continues to be uneven across different regions and the near-term path remains challenging. Given this backdrop, we will continue to diligently cultivate opportunities and monitor risks. Our key enablers include vaccine distribution and travel protocols, U.S.-China trade relations, remaining 737 MAX regulatory approvals and resumption of 787 deliveries. Our financial performance in the second half of this year will largely be driven by these key enablers. On cash flow, we still expect full year 2021 to be a use of cash. Despite additional pressure from the updated 787 delivery schedule, our expectations for cash flow this year have not deteriorated due to timing of advanced payment burn-down and favorable order activity. With respect to the quarterly trajectory for the remainder of this year, we expect continued variability in cash flow quarter-over-quarter due to timing of deliveries as well as receipts and expenditures such as expected cash tax benefits and MAX customer settlement payments. We still expect to turn cash flow positive in 2022. The key drivers of cash flow in 2022 as compared to this year include continued improvement on the 737 program due to lower customer considerations and higher delivery payments as well as recovery in commercial services. However, advanced payments will still be a headwind in 2022. While our delivery expectations are now higher next year due to some 787 deliveries moving from this year into 2022, the related additional cash flow will be largely offset by the burn-down of advanced payments next year. To close, while focusing on safety, quality and operational excellence, our team continues to closely examine all aspects of our business, simplify and streamline everything we do, drive stability in our operations and make long-lasting change. I\u2019m honored to be a part of such a strong team and look forward to our bright future. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Dave Calhoun for closing comments. David Calhoun : Thanks, Dave. I appreciate it. As we continue to transform our business, we remain committed to quality, safety, integrity and transparency in everything that we do and every action we take. I\u2019m extremely proud of the resiliency and dedication of our team and I remain confident in our future. So with that, Dave and I are happy to take your questions. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Noah Poponak : Hi, good morning, everyone. David Calhoun : Hi, Noah. Dave Dohnalek : Hi, Noah. Noah Poponak : I wanted to ask about margins given the performance in the quarter, and you talked a lot about the business transformation. Is there any way to quantify what you're gaining in the aircraft business, whether it's a structural cost out or where the MAX and 87 production rates need to be to achieve the margins they had last cycle or anything along those lines? And then, can we expect BDS and services margins to continue to march higher from the levels they achieved to this quarter? Thanks. David Calhoun : Yes. Noah, thanks for that question. So let's start with maybe BDS and BGS. As you know, BGS, before the pandemic was sort of mid-teen margin business. And I think, you saw some significant progress towards that this quarter to 13.1%. So I think that will depend from quarter-to-quarter on mix. There's a variability in many, many programs in BGS, but I think we're seeing positive trajectory there. And we see a path to getting back towards those mid-teen margins over time. In BDS, strong quarter on margins with 13.9%. Now some of that was due to, as we mentioned, a higher or a benefit from a non-U.S. program adjustment that the benefit of the quarter, even if you sort of stripped that out, BDS performed well. And in the kind of the low double-digit margin territory that they've been in good times, we were not taking charges. So clearly, the fact that we didn't take any significant charges in the quarter and performed well across the programs that turned out very well. And so, then back to BCA, clearly, we're still in a negative margin territory, although much better than we've been certainly in recent quarters and compared to the same quarter last year. I think a lot there will be driven by rate. We are ramping up in the 737 MAX program at 16 per month now moving to 31 per month at the beginning of next year. And we intend to go higher, obviously, driven by what we see in the market beyond early next year in some of that, the key enablers that we just talked about China being one are important in that in addition to just overall traffic trends. So I think for BCA, it's going to be production rate-driven in addition to getting additional traction on the business transformation efforts we've had cutting costs. And then, of course, as Dave mentioned, achieving stability, especially in the 787 program as we work through our final issues there. Dave Dohnalek : Yes. I'm optimistic to get to or beat our prior, the margins you were accustomed to with respect to BCA, biggest part be in transformation and the leverage we can get by reducing our sort of break-even rates and that's what we're working on. It's been quite effective. The key will be to keep it when the market turns back. So anyway, I'm looking forward to that. Noah Poponak : So, David, it sounds like you believe you can have the margins you used to have in BCA even before you're all the way back to the production rates you had? David Calhoun : Well, yes. I mean, our initiatives are definitely intending to do that. We'll see when the measures come. But if you think about the dynamics with respect to that, it's all about that underlying infrastructure costs and the consolidation of a couple of plants and a few things like that. That has to give us benefit at similar rates from where we were before. So yes, the leverage is in the rates, but when we get to those similar rates, I feel good about where we're going to be. Noah Poponak : Can you just quickly give us the millions of dollars of the contract adjustment in BDS? Dave Dohnalek : Yes. We don't have that specific number that we're disclosing. But again, it would be, even if you strip that out, above 11% margins at BDS, which is we're happy about the progress there. Noah Poponak : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning. Dave Dohnalek : Hi, Myles. Myles Walton : Good morning, Daves and Maurita. Dave Calhoun, some of the order activity in the last six months would seem to be opportunistic as you're backfilling some of those guidelines from the 37 and repositioning some of those. So a lot of questions we get is, is this more just a surge of opportunism or is this really significant demands that's turning to the positive? Maybe you can frame it for what you expect over the next six to 12 months for an order activity. David Calhoun : I don't view this as opportunistic either on my side or on the customer side. When you make decisions to order 270 airplanes, expand your capacity and get aggressive in the marketplace, that is a fundamental decision as it gets. And it was very little with respect opportunism. The good news when I just evaluate the United order is they have to consider all of their routes, all of their operations and then they, as you know, solve for the lowest cost, most efficient delivery of a passenger, a route of a passenger. And then they make choices around the airplanes. The good news is they have history with both manufacturers. So I liked the way our product line competed with our competitor. I mean, it was straight up out of the 270, we got 200, the models and the routes that they're intended to satisfy their optimal for United. And anyway, so I'm quite pleased with how that went and it was quite in my view strategic and long-term. And in the case of Southwest, it's the same. Southwest, we benefit from it being in all Boeing fleet and they benefit from it being all Boeing. But on the other hand, they're doing the same thing as United. These are two very strong airlines who are staking out the future and making big strategic decisions to do so. They're extending their reach, they're improving their routes structures, et cetera. So, yes, I can't see these in any way as being opportunistic. I do think, and expect as domestic markets return recoveries robust, the retirements stay retired, and I believe most of them will, that we're going to end up in that same real estate play going forward, meaning airlines who get aggressive and have balance sheets and are strong who want to improve their routes structures and grow into the market, they'll be the first one to play. I can't predict exactly when that happens. Just like I couldn't predict when United would step forward or Southwest. But I know, I think these two are as strategic as it gets. And we held our ground and posture and we let the airplanes performance and sell itself. That's really the way it happened. Myles Walton : Okay. So you would expect the backlog on a 37 MAX to continue to build even if the stronger deliveries in the second half of the year? David Calhoun : Yes, I do. I do. Again, I can't predict timing and I certainly can't predict the scale of each and every order. But I liked the way these were led and I liked the way we competed. Myles Walton : Thanks. Operator : Next question from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Kristine Liwag : Hi, good morning, Dave and Dave. David Calhoun : Hi. Dave Dohnalek : Good morning, Kristine. Kristine Liwag : Can you help us understand the drivers of a free cash flow through the rest of 2021 and how we should think about the run rate of 737 MAX concession payments? I mean, ultimately, is there a path to positive free cash flow for any of the remaining quarters of the year? David Calhoun : Yes, so. Kristine, I think number one, the burned out advanced payments, as I mentioned, is going to be lumpy, obviously dependent on delivery schedule. And we're going to see that effect the second half of this year and also 2022. So that is a headwind. Certainly, the tailwinds you see are expected higher airplane deliveries certainly 737 MAXs. And as we work through 787 higher deliveries there too, once we complete the work and are able to deliver again. I think, well, we're not predicting which quarter or this year might be cash flow positive. I think, it will be variable. We certainly made a lot of progress from Q1 with the Q2 cash flow performance. I think the rest of the year, I think it will be a balance of higher deliveries and some headwinds from advanced payments, but also benefits from, as Dave mentioned, continued work on the business transformation efforts and also on the expectation that we should be receiving a cash tax benefit sometime in the second half could be in Q3, could be in Q4. So that would be a benefit to the year as well on cash. But we're not predicting Kristine, not giving guidance on a quarter, cash flow level. But we see, we do see some tailwinds for the rest of the year. Dave Dohnalek : The underlying trajectory is good. And we're making really solid ground on that basis. So I feel good. We always have our quarterly lumps, but anyway I do think this quarter is indicative of the underlying trend. Kristine Liwag : Thanks. And if I could squeeze one more on the 737. Earlier this month, we saw news on Chinese willingness to conduct flight tests. Has there been any feedback on what you need to do to get the aircraft certified? David Calhoun : Yes. But let's just say, the dialogue with the CAAC, first of all, remember they have a hundred airplanes on the ground in China that the airlines want to get into the year. They got the Olympics coming and they want to move down that path. So they have a lot of natural incentive to want to do it. We've been working closely with them from the beginning. It's constructive. Technical issues are being resolved. In fact, for the most part, I think they're all behind us. And yes, I anticipate there will be test flights conducted in certification. As we said, we expect that we will get that before the end of this year. So anyway, I'm very encouraged about the constructive nature of that, of how that's going. And anyway hopefully bigger trade issues don't get the way. I don't believe they will. Both sides are incented for this industry to move forward. Operator : Our next question from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Doug Harned : Thank you. Good morning. David Calhoun : Good morning, Doug Dave Dohnalek : Good morning, Doug Doug Harned : On the 787. The new issue that you're addressing, it appears to be the same type of structural nonconformity problem. You've been addressing elsewhere in the airplane since last August. Now, how do you get comfortable to know there's not a next place where this issue could come up and because it appears to be occurring across multiple suppliers, how do you resolve that for the long term? Is it a production process problem, a quality control problem, or maybe even an over specification of tolerances? I mean, can you describe a little bit of what's going on here? David Calhoun : Yes, Doug, I really appreciate the question, because it outlines the heart of what we're trying to accomplish here. So let me start by saying, this is not the FAA getting tough on Boeing. This is Boeing getting tough on Boeing. We launched a program to inspect because we did find some issues by way of notice of escape out of out supply chain. Early on, we decided we would do a nose to tail inspection of all of it, tier one, tier two. And we did exactly all the things you're describing. Our specs to type, the process controls that our suppliers where they need to be is the rework operations that we've now put into our operations in Charleston, are they necessary? And are they getting the job done? And in every case, we look for even the smallest exception to the tolerances that we've designed. And in every case, we then take a step to one identify it. We immediately talk to the FAA about it. Two, we fix it. Three, we make sure it won't happen again. How do you do it? Well, you have teams inside our suppliers working on process control development understanding of exactly why that spec is necessary and where it is. And on our side, we start putting disciplines in place that make it clear to those supply chain that we're not going to keep our line running. If we get one that isn't right. That's a little bit of what's going on here. Here's the good news. If we ever add a window to get this behind us once and for all it's now. We're producing at the lowest rate ever customers are not knocking down our door to get their airplanes in light of the COVID impact on international traffic. And so we're very determined to see our way through this. Good news, the inspections are done right, toe to tail. So those inspections are done. Doesn't mean somewhere along the way, our suppliers are going to raise their hand and tell us there's an escape somewhere along the way. But it's not going to be as a result of this big effort that we've put forward here. And each and every one of these issues that we find, we always have a decision to make with respect to compliance, which is that each and every part and every airplane is built precisely to the drawings that we've created and it's our to job to rework the issue. And that's \u2013 that is what we're going through. I view this as a courageous moment for Boeing. My hats off to our team, believe it or not, all of these conditions were preexisting my leadership team. So the work they're taken on and the readiness that we're getting in place for, what I think is the second half recovery in the wide body world of next year. That's when I believe it border protocols are going to get understood and predictability will return to the market. When that happens and orders come, we will have to be able to respond to rate increases in a very stable form and fashion. And I think the actions we're taking right now are the most important part of that puzzle. So I really do apologize to investors and I apologize for guessing that the last issue was our last but we're getting close. And most importantly, the underlying causes are getting understood and resolved. Doug Harned : Then is this latest issue, which seemed to be somewhat of a surprise, was that the result of just the completion of inspections, which are now done, and this one was turned up, or is there more to go here? So that there's still some risks that remains, I mean, I know there's always a tiny bit of risk, but how would you characterize that? David Calhoun : The former, it was part of our inspection process. This one happened to be a tier two issue. So you go through your supplier, then you go through your supplier\u2019 supplier to find that process control that needs to be implemented clearly and correctly. And the rework that needs to be done is largely done on their premise. So again we don't have a, like a big inspection program from here forward. This one is for the most part complete and I expect things to change dramatically. But most importantly, the amount of rework we'll eliminate in our factory and the predictability of our supply chain on all these fronts is that much better off. Doug, one other comment I want to make just to make sure everyone knows how important 87 is. During this COVID period, no wide body passenger airplane has been flown more aggressively than 87, it's everywhere. 90% of that fleet is up and active and being worked as hard as it can be worked. So despite the low numbers with respect to all this international traffic, et cetera, the 87 is the prized asset. That's getting worked hard. Doug Harned : Okay. Thank you. David Calhoun : Yes. Operator : Our next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much. And good morning, everyone. Dave, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the advanced balance you mentioned that as a headwind to free cash flow in the second half 3022 almost $51 billion right now. It hasn't really come down very much at all since the pandemic started. Is there, a kind of a back to the envelope way that you can help us think about how much that liability balance used to come down? David Calhoun : Yes, thanks, Seth. So it's \u2013 that's going to be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, and obviously depending on the delivery schedule, which we've talked about is going to vary from quarter-to-quarter. We also saw orders come in, right? So you've got deliveries happening. You've got orders coming in, so you've got adding and subtracting at the same time. So the bottom line for you to think about is that we still do see these PDPs or advances as a headwind, through the second half of this year and into next year. It's a headwind, we think we will more than overcome, because we we're predicting or expecting cash flow to be positive in 2022. But just so it's not off your radar screen, this will be with us for the next number of quarters as we work through these deliveries out of inventory and apply advanced payments, case by case, customer by customer. So it's really hard to predict or give guidance there, but net-net, again, 2022, we expect to be positive cash flow and we would have tailwinds more than offsetting that headwind. Seth Seifman : Okay. Thanks very much. I'll stick to one. David Calhoun : Thank you. Operator : And next we will go to Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Rob Spingarn : Hi, good morning. David Calhoun : Good morning, Rob. Rob Spingarn : Just a clarification, first, Dave Calhoun for you, and then a question on R&D. But do you need to do any rework on delivered 787s? That's the first question. The second question on R&D is it's \u2013 I think it's down about at least for BCA at about half the second quarter 2019 level. So, when does that trough and when might you expect to start investing in R&D again, growing headcount there and what will be the focus of that incremental investment? David Calhoun : Yes, I'll start this with the underlying premise on R&D. I mean, we are \u2013 my view is we are fully funded on the important R&D efforts that will support BCA broadly. I want to separate that from development funding which is the ongoing certification work associated with the MAX 10, 777X. And I hope in the relatively near term a freighter version of that airplane. So, we are going to be very busy and have been very busy on the development front and spending a fair amount of money on it. I don't expect that number to go up significantly at any different at any point in time even in the relatively near term, not because we're not going to take on new stuff just because. And the next comment I would make on just the research front and what is the likely technologies that will surround that next airplane. It's not going to be dramatically different with one exception, and that is everything sustainability. That next airplane will have to meet some serious sustainability tests. I do think that sustainable aviation fuels is going to be a big part of that and our propulsion suppliers with respect to the packages that they are now promoting, you may have seen the CFM package most recently with the fan. Anyway, I think, it's going to be a fight between sustainability propulsion packages and meeting that spec. And then for Boeing it's to make this the most efficient airplane it can possibly be. And you may have heard me say our investments in the underlying modeling technologies that have to be deployed applying the digital thread that we have in our defense programs to the commercial programs that is critically important to this next development. It will shorten the cycle on development, it will improve the productivity on the program itself and that's critical. And then finally just our production system will be quite different as we think about it. And we have very active programs on both the modeling and production system to be ready for that moment. So that's a lot. But I'm quite \u2013 I'm actually quite confident that our R&D budgets are what they ought to be and quite robust relative to the needs of our BCA business. Rob Spingarn : Okay. And then just on that 787 any retrofit needed? David Calhoun : Oh yes, I'm sorry. Look, that's a determination that has to be made with the FAA. And most of this in light of the fact that the safety margins on the structural elements of our airplanes is huge. So, it's not the world's easiest set of analyses to go through and our teams have taken their shot at it. They go through the FA in great detail. And so, I don't really know the answer to that. But the ideal for all of us is to just incorporate it into ongoing maintenance schedules of the airlines. So that is that's our hope and desire and sort of anyway, but I'm going to leave it to the FAA and our ultimate conclusions between those two teams as to just what happens on that front. Rob Spingarn : Okay. Thank you, Dave. David Calhoun : Yes. Operator : And next we'll go to Rob Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Rob Stallard : Thanks so much and good morning, David Calhoun : Good morning Rob. Dave Dohnalek : Good morning Rob. Rob Stallard : I can't really keep track of the number of times you mentioned China on the call, but this is clearly a very important issue. Now Dave Calhoun, you said that you expected certification by the end of this year. Is that effective to the drop-dead date, that if we're sitting here on the 31 of December and you haven't got certification, then you'd have to then cut the, say the 737 RAM, for example, and maybe further push out the recovery on the 787? Or is it actually an earlier day because you need to give notice to your suppliers? Thank you. David Calhoun : Yes, it's a great question. If we get to the end of the year, I often use the beginning of the following year, but I'll start thinking about it very hard and end it by the end of the year, if we get to that moment and importantly, we're not within a minute of getting certification in some way, we do have to consider real actions with respect to what the future rate ramp looks like. And so yes, that's \u2013 your premise is right? Rob Stallard : So that still gives supplies enough notice to effectively double production in that timeframe? David Calhoun : Yes, I mean, but I \u2013 we put some margin into that. In other words, we may have to take some risks ourselves with respect to their readiness and their production rates and inventory that we might accumulate. That's on us. We understand that, but yes, the answer is yes, we\u2019ll have to give them notice. And I think they're going to be \u2013 they will be okay with that largely because of risks we take. Rob Stallard : That's great. Thank you very much. David Calhoun : Yes. Operator : Our next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you. Good morning guys. So just a follow-up on Bob's point, actually, since we're on the map, can you talk about the ramp to 31 a month production in the beginning of 2022 from 16 today? And burning down half of the inventory \u2013 inventory to aircraft at the beginning of the year, implies 165 deliveries and assuming 16 per month production rate through year end, that implies our delivery rate of 44. So how do we kind of think about that visibility on the regional basis? What kind of assumptions did you make on China and other regions? And then also just on that last point you made Dave on profitability, what does that kind of mean for BCA profitability and when you hit breakeven? Dave Dohnalek : Well, I can't throw a dart and be that precise with respect to the day we are at profitability. But we have a real rate ramp scheduled for the remainder of our year on the subject of deliveries. Not so much production. I think we get as high as 50 as we exit the year. And then that begins to make a big dent. And I'm pretty confident we can do that. We have de-risked our year largely for China. So, they become next year's risk with respect to delivery. So, we'll run that play and that ramp as hard as we can, we will have signals with respect to where China is well before that. And if we have to make adjustments, we will. But I do think we are prepared for that delivery rate. And I think we're close to what we\u2019ve already demonstrated. I think we delivered over 30. I don't think I know over 30 in the month of June. We've got big teams, they know how to do it, the FAA has granted us our authorities and we're running full speed. And as I said, the performance of the airplane has been fantastic. So, again, it's your premise is right, China is mostly de-risked for this year, but will definitely be part of next year is a risk as we talked earlier. Again, I remain confident on that prospect, but we'll know when we know. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you. Dave Dohnalek : Yes. Operator : And our next question from Ron Epstein with Bank of America, please go ahead. Ron Epstein : Hi Dave, how are you? Dave Dohnalek : Hi, Ron. Good. Ron Epstein : Just maybe a question on the engineering front. There has been some press that we've seen some engineering ranks sitting out at Boeing. How do you think about that, particularly at the, maybe the more senior level, some of the senior technical fellows taken off? Are you worried about a bit of a brain drain in the engineering ranks, Boeing, and how are you addressing that? Dave Dohnalek : With every \u2013 first of all, as you well know, I've been in engineering businesses most of my life. With every retirement of a seasoned veteran in Boeing, in engineering, there's always a, oh my gosh, what's going to happen, because they carry an awful lot of knowledge. And so, I accept that as a norm. On the other hand, those very same people work as hard as they could to train the best engineers that the aerospace industry, whatever see behind them. And when moments like this happen, where we've had a few more and mostly just out of natural, voluntary actions on their part all good for them all in good relation to us. These folks that they've trained all these years step up and they step up big and they are impressive and they are good. And so, in many ways, there are always two sides to that coin. And I love the side I'm seeing, which is an incredibly qualified, highly motivated group of younger engineers who studied under these folks. And I promise you, these folks who left will never not return those kids\u2019 phone calls. Life goes on. And we continue to improve. I have been traveling the engineering function across The Boeing Company in some of the highest profile projects, some of the most amazing technologies I have ever seen. I can't, I don't ever come away unimpressed. The folks are great. I really don't worry about it. I do worry about input, meaning we are now in a ruthless competition with everybody, not just our aerospace industry, which is getting bigger, but also all of the folks in the cyber and Silicon Valley world. But I like our chances. We've got a great mission. Most engineers start their career and start their jobs based on the mission of the company. We got a pretty good one and anyway. So, look, I read it, I've seen it, I understand the concern from the outside in, but from the inside out I'm quite confident in our technical team. Ron Epstein : So, just as a logical follow-on, what are you doing to recruit the best? I mean, there's a lot of choices out there like you highlighted. And in fact, there's even a lot of startups now in aerospace, which is an interesting time. How are you getting the best folks to come to Boeing? Dave Dohnalek : Big internships, we got a lot of them, active internships. We never slowed them down during COVID. I personally participate in the discussions with many of the interns. This virtual world allows you to do that. So that's something we will continue. It's the mission. It's really the mission. Most of these engineers and these highly qualified data analysts and software engineers, they like what we do. They want to go to deep space, right? They want to help protect their country. These are meaningful things. So, we try to attach them to our mission, our vision, and then we try to give them the best set of assignments they can get. Move them around, do the things that Boeing can do because of our big footprint. Anyway, and then some of them just go as deep as they can go, because there is a particular technology, we might be a world leader on. Those are easy for us to recruit because they just want to go deeper. So anyway, we're active on it. I personally am active on it and I'm confident in what Boeing brings to them. Ron Epstein : Thank you. Dave Dohnalek : Yes, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Carter Copeland : Hey good morning, gentlemen. David Calhoun : Good morning, Carter. Dave Dohnalek : Good morning. Carter Copeland : Just a question on the 787 for either one of you actually, I know you had been pretty close based on the previous disclosures to forward loss on the program, just given where that stood. And given that you've now taken the delivery rates lower, I was kind of surprised you didn't actually tip that line. Was that related to the efficiency that you talked about earlier, Dave, in terms of on the backend, you'll be better. Just any color you could help us on how you guys avoided that despite the lower production will be helpful. Thanks. David Calhoun : Yes, Carter, yes, thanks for the question. Certainly, there are some additional costs associated with the rework, production rate adjustment, delivery, timing, et cetera. But there also are other puts and takes that, go into this as, you know that have enabled us to maintain a positive margin there. And so, we \u2013 it's still near to zero, it's that where we want it to be, we've got work to do to get it, to keep moving north in higher. And we, obviously examine this thing every quarter very detail approach along with our auditors, et cetera. And so, we just have some additional benefits in the cost side and that are offsetting enough so that we don't find ourselves in an RFL position. And obviously, as Dave said, it's all about achieving stability and starting to march back up that margin. Dave Dohnalek : We have not made any outlandish forward assumptions with respect to productivity that we don't know is there, because we don't do that. So anyway, it's not half baked, this is fully baked. Carter Copeland : Great. Thank you for the color gentlemen. David Calhoun : Yus. Thanks, Carter. Operator : And next, we'll go to Richard Safran with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Richard Safran : Everybody, good morning. How are you? David Calhoun : Good, Rich, how are you? Richard Safran : Excellent. So, Dave I wanted to know if you could expand on your opening remarks about freight and your strategy there? Your comments about current freight demand, I would think drive an improvement your long-term outlook and wondering if that's the case. Second, am I correct that there are new emission standards coming that might impact the 637 and 777 freighters? I was wondering if you comment on how you are going to address and meet those standards. And then finally, Airbus is talking about a 350 freighter any plans to address this threat? Dave, I'm just trying to get to your overall product strategy here for freighters. David Calhoun : Yes, I am quite confident in the freighter market. I think some secular things have happened there that are going continue to make that a very important market. As you know we are significant in that market and have long-standing customer relationships. And especially in the next couple of years prior to the ICAO standards being implemented. I'm confident it will drive some additional 76 and additional 777 demands, et cetera. We need to develop a new ICAO compliant freighter version opportunity. I circle the 777Xs, the logical place for that and the smart place to do that. So, as I said, without suggesting that we've already launched and/or that we have one plan by the day, we're confident and I'm confident that that might be the next of our programs. And it will be an incredible freighter with incredible long-term advantages for our major customers. So anyway, that's where we stand. And in the meantime, there are exemptions that exist within the ICAO language that have to be accommodated by our U.S. Government in some way, shape or form that allow for a transition strategy to that new kind of opportunity that is ICAO compliant. Because you'll recall, or maybe know, or don't know the 76 when it moves into a, like a FedEx or UPS opportunity. If this displaces airplanes that are 40% plus less efficient and most importantly, 40% less environmentally friendly. So, there is, I think, some transition strategies that can and should be implemented that will help us in that. But we need to step forward on an airplane itself. And yes, so I don't mind tip in my hand. That's what's got my greatest interest. Richard Safran : Great thanks for the color. Maurita Sutedja : Operator, we have time for one more analyst question. Operator : Certainly. And that will be from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr : Yes, thanks so much for squeezing me in. So, Dave, I was a little surprised by your comment on expecting China approval by year end, because while I get it that the airlines wanted and that you are making progress with testing, nothing in China happens without political okay. And everything I read is that situation has been going downhill. So, the question is, are you seeing any specific signs either from the Chinese government through your contact or from the U.S. Government that would give you confidence to make a projection that you expect to see those the approval by year-end? Thank you. David Calhoun : Yes, let me just in some ways state the obvious. I don't want to imply that anything is risk-free on this front. It's not, it never will be. Especially as it relates to the China relations, which are real. And then we see all the strains as well. The advantages and the needs on both sides with respect that the need for the equipment, again, 100 airplanes on the ground, an economy that has been the fastest to recover from COVID and economy preparing for the Olympics and for a substantial amount of traffic to, and from in the domestic market. So, all of those needs line up and they support to airlines to accommodate that traffic is where it needs to be. There is nothing that prevents this trade from happening. So, there's nothing written that says you can't do it. I mean, so there's nothing that prevents it. And our government fully understands and appreciates the fact that our industry is a leader in the world. And that leadership in China is critical to that and the employment that it, of course holds. So, without them having to sort of launch this as some big new opening to a structural agreement, we're just going to stay on course and continue to support free trade between these two players, both of whom understand the importance. And there are plenty of trade partners that exist between China and the United States. All I like to do is look, look at all the sort of import numbers in this country and vice versa. It's a big corridor. We just want to be part of that and we want to do it the right way and support our customers. And things have been constructive if they weren't. I would tell you so anyway that\u2019s where we are. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you. David Calhoun : Yes. Operator : All right, that completes The Boeing Company\u2019s second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. And thank you all for joining.",

The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst question and answer session are being broadcast live over the Internet.  [Operator Instructions]. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions. I'll turn the call over to Mr. Matt Welch, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Boeing Company. Mr. Welch, please go ahead. Matthew Welch : Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's Third Quarter 2021 earnings call. I am Matt Welch and with me today are David Calhoun, Boeing 's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian West, Boeing's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com.  As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. Projections, estimates, and goals we include in our discussions this morning involve risks, including those described in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of the web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures. Now, I will turn the call over to Dave Calhoun. David Calhoun : Thanks, Matt. And good morning, everyone. I hope you're staying well as we navigate to the other side of this crazy global pandemic. We continue to work with our customers, our suppliers, and our partners to stabilize our industry and chart the path to recovery. While this summer brought us new challenges with the variant, we have seen encouraging signs of increased vaccination rates, further progress on coordinated international travel policies and protocols, and ongoing discussions with customers on their fleet planning. As expected, the recovery has been uneven. However, it continues to gain broader momentum, giving us confidence in the resilience of our market. Vaccines have proven safe and effective and they are key to personal health and to reopening the global economy, reopening travel routes and businesses. Our customers, both commercial and defense, have implemented vaccine mandates for their employee populations. After careful review and consideration and to ensure compliance with President Biden's executive order we are implementing a requirement for U.S. based employees to show proof of being fully vaccinated from COVID-19, or have an approved reasonable accommodation. As we have done since the beginning of the pandemic, we will continue to prioritize the health and the safety of our employees. We're making important progress in transforming our business, driving stability and quality in our operations, and investing for the future. I'm proud of our team's continued resiliency and unwavering focus on our mission. Before I go through our business update, I'd like to formally welcome Brian West, our new CFO, who is with us here today. And the 2 months since Brian started, he has spent countless hours at our operational sites with the finance and the broader teams, digging into issues, gaining an in-depth understanding of our business. Brian is an exceptional leader and we're grateful to have him on board. With that, let's start with an update on the business in the next chart. Beginning with the 737 program, we continue delivering to our customers and supporting their efforts to return their fleets to service. In the third quarter, we delivered 62 737 MAX airplanes, the most we've delivered since the first quarter of 2019. We have made noteworthy progress since receiving approval from the FAA.  And today, over 175 countries have approved the resumption of 737 MAX operations. We delivered more than 195 airplanes, including about 1/3 of the 450 airplanes originally in inventory. We have largely placed the airplanes that required remarketing. Our airline customers have returned more than 200 previously grounded airplanes to revenue service. 31 airlines have returned their fleets to service.  And those airlines have safely flown over 206,000 commercial flights totaling more than 500,000 flight hours. Importantly, the fleet has an impressive schedule reliability rate of more than 99%. And as domestic and regional traffic recovers, for example, Intra-Europe, demand for the 737 MAX continues to improve. In September, we saw the 8 straight month of positive net commercial airplane orders, primarily due to the 737 Max. At the end of the quarter, we had over 3300 aircrafts in our 737 backlog, highlighting the airplane's families value proposition.  Given this demand during the Third Quarter, we increased our production rate to 19 airplanes per month and continue to progress toward a production rate of 31 per month in early 2022. While we continue to deliver from inventory, we're balancing the need to increase the production rate to position us to support increasing demand longer-term. We're actively working to ensure that production system, including the supply chain is stable prior to making decisions to further increase the production rate.  Raw materials, logistics, and labor availability will also be key watch items for future rate increases. As we previously communicated, the timing of remaining regulatory approvals will shape our near-term delivery plans and our production rate ramp beyond 31 per month. Following the completion of the 737 MAX flight test in China during the third quarter, we continue to work toward approval by the end of the year with a resumption of deliveries to follow in the first quarter of next year. We also continue to make progress on the certification of the 737 MAX 7 and the MAX 10. We currently anticipate the first delivery of the MAX 7 in early 2022 and the first delivery of the MAX 10 in 2023. As always, we will follow global regulators lead in the steps ahead on all certification matters. On the 787 program, we remain fully committed to our methodical approach to driving first-time quality and stability in our operations.  The issues that our engineering teams and/or our suppliers have identified and are addressing, are part of this purposeful process, and we have transparently communicated with our regulators, our customers, and our suppliers every step of the way. As recently shared, we've also identified quality issues with a sub-tier parts supplier.  And while our review is ongoing, there are no immediate safety of flight concerns. We're in regular communication with the FAA on these issues and are committed to taking any action required to address them. As to the 787 generally, we're conducting inspections and rework and we continue to engage in detailed discussions with the FAA regarding the required actions for resuming deliveries.  As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to re-prioritize production resources to support the inspection and the rework, and are currently producing at a rate of approximately two airplanes per month. Once deliveries resume, we expect to return to five per month over time. Keep in mind exact timing of deliveries and future production rates will depend upon inspections and rework, ongoing customer and supplier conversations, production stability, and our activities with the FAA.  Again, our regulators will make the ultimate determination, but we believe we have a clear line of sight to the steps ahead. And we are continuing to make steady progress to begin delivering airplanes to our customers. Moving to the 777, the 777X program. The combined production rate is 2 per month. Given continued strength in freighter demand, we have coordinated with our supply chain and our increasing 777 freighter production capacity, in the near term, we now expect 2022 777 deliveries to be relatively in line with 2021. On the 777X program, we continue to subject the airplane to a comprehensive test program to demonstrated safety, it's performance and reliability while working through our rigorous development process to ensure we meet all applicable requirements.  We continue to engage with the FAA and global regulators throughout this process, and like any development program, we are learning along the way and incorporating those learnings into our plans. As we progress in our certification work, we continue to conduct Boeing flight tests and began engine performance flight testing earlier this month. The airplane is performing well and in-line with our customer commitments based on the data that we've collected to date. We will validate these results and we will continue to work with the FAA to ensure we meet their requirements prior to beginning the certification flight tests. We still expect that we will deliver the first 777X in late 2023.  Given the continued robust freighter demand and the compelling economics of the 777X we're currently evaluating the timing of launching a freighter version of our 777X airplane. We will keep you updated as we progress in this evaluation. In addition, the 737 MAX 7, the MAX 10, and the 777X, we are investing our future laying the foundation for our next commercial airplane development program.  This quarter, we stood up an integrated product team to bring together a digital environment where the next commercial new airplane and production system can be designed together. While we have not launched a new airplane this is an important step in our digitization journey and our development journey to evaluate how we holistically design, build, test, certify, and support the airplane and production system. It will build on the invaluable experience of our recent defense programs.  Meanwhile, we continue to execute for our customers across our business. Let me highlight a few key milestones. Our Defense, Space and Security team made progress on key programs. For example, our MQ-25 unmanned test asset, completed aerial refueling of a F-35C fighter jet and an E2D command and control aircraft. We also delivered 37 aircraft in the quarter, including the first CH-47 F Chinook to the Royal Australian Army.  As was recently shared, the NASA and Boeing teams have identified the most probable cause of the valve malfunction on our commercial cruise Starliner, and we are working through corrective and preventative actions. We're currently working toward opportunities for the second orbital flight test launch in 2022, pending hardware readiness, the rocket manifest in space station availability.  As we have demonstrated, we will continue to prioritize the safety of our employees, crew members, and spacecraft as we progress. In our global services business, our team continue to perform and demonstrate sustained recovery from the impacts of COVID-19. As cargo demand increases, we announced plans to create additional capacity for the 767300 Boeing converted freighter. In addition to these program accomplishments, we continue to make progress on our commitment to drive the future of sustainable aviation. Boeing recently joined a virtual White House event on sustainable aviation, reiterating our commitment to have our commercial airplanes capable of running on a 100 % sustainable aviation fuels by 2030. And our partnership with SkyNRG to expand the global supply of sustainable aviation fuel. We also hosted a 2 day Boeing innovation for them in Glasgow, bringing together partners in the region, customers, aviation experts, and stem students to accelerate efforts to ensure a safe and sustainable aerospace future.  We were also excited to participate in the Ayada annual general meeting to discuss our path toward a more sustainable future. and how we can support the aviation sectors commitment to achieve net 0 carbon emissions by 2050. In fact, just yesterday, our Chief Executive Officer, along with the CTOs from 6 other leading aerospace manufacturing companies, reaffirmed our commitment to reaching this industry-wide target.  Now, let's turn to the next slide to discuss the industry environment. Last month we released our 2021 Boeing market outlook, which forecasts a total market value of 9 trillion over the next decade. This is up from 8.5 trillion a year ago and from 8.7 trillion in the pre -pandemic 2019 forecast, reflecting the markets continued recovery.  The forecast closely aligns to what we laid out last year. Our government services, defense, and space markets remain significant and relatively stable. While increased government spending on COVID-19 response is adding pressure to defense budgets in some countries, others are increasing spending on their security. Overall, the global defense market remains strong and enduring with all of our major programs. We remain focused on delivering the highest quality, innovative, capable, and affordable platforms to the war fighter and maintaining the health of our supplier base.  The diversity of our portfolio creates new opportunities and continues to help provide critical stability for us, as we move forward. We continue to focus on our customers needs, expanding capabilities on our trusted platforms, investing in next-generation technologies, like autonomy and building on our foundation and model based engineering to deliver and intelligently support key franchise programs like the T-7A and the MQ-25.  We see strong continued bipartisan support for U.S. national security, including strategic investments in Boeing products and services, as congress works through its annual budget and authorization process for fiscal year 2022. The F/A-18 and the Chinook Block II remain critical capabilities for the war fighter, both domestically and for non-U.S. customers. We will continue to work with the administration and with congress to ensure the necessary support for these key program is in place. The commercial market is shaping up largely as we expected, while near-term pressure due to COVID-19 continues, the recovery is broadening and the key long-term fundamentals remain strong. We've seen positive momentum in some markets.  However, the recovery continues to be uneven. In the Third Quarter, we saw a global departures increase slightly to an average of 67 % of 2019 levels, up from 59 % the previous quarter. Similar to what we saw in the first half of the year, domestic traffic is leading the recovery. However, traffic took a slight step back in the late summer due to the Delta variant, an increased travel restrictions resulting in global August domestic traffic of approximately 30 % below 2019 levels. Since then, it has shown signs of improvement, most notably in the domestic China market.  The U.S. domestic market continues to be a bright spot in our recovery with PSA screenings, resuming an upward weekly trends since mid September and peak travel days are reaching 80 % to 85 % of 2019 volumes. We're also seeing the recovery accelerate in more parts of the world, with reduced travel restrictions and coordinated protocols. Japan's domestic traffic is accelerating after the country recently dropped its COVID state of emergency.  And European airlines have seen large bookings spikes following the U.S. decision to open the vaccinated foreign travelers in November. Passenger traffic in other parts of the world, particularly Southeast Asia, remains significantly lower due to continued travel restriction, uncertainty, and case rates. Even there, however, there is increasing momentum for air travel as vaccination rates climb operations are starting to see incremental improvement with August traffic 69 % below 2019, which was an improvement from June and July.  And we're seeing promising signs of entry protocols loosening across the trans-Atlantic quarter. Despite this progress, international traffic is still a long way from full recovery. Limited coordination on travel protocols are still significantly hindering traffic in the international segment. Yet the active fleet is now approximately 85 % of its previous size, with single aisle activity levels slightly above twin-aisle. With utilization rates and load factors still below historic levels.  Airlines are flying around 60 % of their normal global capacity. Recent changes, the government policies could accelerate this to 70 % by year-end. However, we have seen continued variability in capacity due to supply chain and logistics challenges our customers are facing. As the recovery continues to expand, airlines are shifting their focus to medium-term fleet planning. As part of this assessment, airlines have retired or announced plans to retire around 1500 airplanes since the onset of the pandemic, we anticipate this trend will continue as our customers modernize their fleets to reduce carbon emissions and increase operational efficiency. With oil prices today approximately 30 % higher than at the end of 2019, operating efficiency is top of mind for most of our customers.  The new airplanes we deliver will be as much as 25%-40 % more fuel efficient with commensurate reductions in emissions compared to the airplanes they replace. The freighter market remains robust with cargo traffic 8 % higher year-to-date through August, compared to 2019 With limited belly cargo capacity on passenger airlines, more dedicated freighters are being utilized to transport cargo.  This is resulting in healthy demand for our freighter offerings with 24 additional freighter airplanes ordered in the quarter and strong demand for Boeing converted freighters. In fact, our converted and new freighter orders through the first 9 months of this year have already surpassed our highest annual freighter tally in history. As we looked at medium and long-term, we see our original forecast still holds. We continue to expect passenger traffic to return to 2019 levels in '23 to '24, and then a few years beyond that to return to long-term growth trends We still see recovery in 3 phases.  First, domestic, then regional markets, such as Intra-Asia, Intra-Europe and Intra Americas flights. And finally, long-haul international routes. We've seen this phase recovery translate into demand with strong 737 Max orders this year, which mainly support domestic markets. We anticipate demand for wide-body aircraft to take longer, in line with the international traffic recovery. Our 10-year commercial airplane market outlook is largely unchanged from what we assumed a year ago, reflecting the impacts of the global pandemic, as well as the ongoing market recovery.  From now until 2030, we forecast demand for over 14,000 single aisle airplanes, such as the 737 MAX, which equates to roughly 115 to 130 airplanes per month. From a 20-year perspective, we still see the impact COVID, but to a lesser extent, as traffic reverts to long-term trends. Through 2040, we project demand for about 43,500 new airplanes, an increase of about 500 planes over last year's forecast. And as air travel grows, we're committed to reaching sustainability, goals and future guidelines through government and industry partnerships. And a combination of technology, policy and operational advances.  In a significant area of growth, projected demand has increased for dedicated freighters, including new and converted models. With sustained demand for air cargo tied to expanding e-commerce and airfreights, speed and reliability. We project the global freighter fleet in 2040, will be 70 % larger than the pre -pandemic fleet.  On the global trade front, we continue to support monitor U.S. China trade relations. Given the importance of the Chinese market to our economy and our industry's recovery, as well as our near-term delivery profile and future orders, all of which influence future production rates. We remain in active discussions with our Chinese customers on their fleet planning needs and continued words leaders in both countries to resolve trade differences by reiterating the mutual economic benefits of a strong and prosperous aerospace industry. Ultimately, America's leadership in aerospace, as well as the health and stability of millions of commercial aerospace jobs, rely on free and fair trade, and we're confident our leaders understand the importance of this area, not just for our business, but for the overall health of our economy and competitiveness. Turning to the commercial services market, we saw a demand improve again in the third quarter as we supported airlines during their peak summer season.  We expect this trend to continue near-term, slightly ahead of our expectations. At said, we still anticipate a multiyear recovery that may be uneven. Liquidity is improving across the industry and managing liquidity remains critical for the aerospace industries bridge to full recovery we highlighted previously, product differentiation and versatility will be a key as airlines adapt to evolving market realities. In fact, the 787 has been the most utilized wide-body airplane during the pandemic and demand for the MAX continues to grow. So far this year, we have sold more than 557 37s across each of the models from Dash-7 to Dash-10, reflecting the value of versatility and commonality. I'm confident our product line is well positioned and we're focused on executing to meet that customer demand.  Despite the continued challenges our industry is facing due to COVID-19, passenger traffic is increasing and more broadly, we're seeing incrementally positive indicators for economic growth. With economic activity picking up, labor availability within our supply chain will be the critical watch item. As we position for a robust recovery, we're focused on delivering for our customers and capturing the opportunities ahead.  We're maintaining and, in some cases, expanding key investments in strategic processes, technologies, and capabilities that will define our future. And whether we're investing in manufacturing technology, digital engineering, technology advances, autonomous solutions, supply chain capability, or platform designs, sustainability will be a key factor in every decision.  We're continuing our transformational efforts to create long lasting value, which will improve our performance, help us generate positive cash flow and create a foundation to enable us to return to healthy margins. While we do this, we remain committed to safety, quality, and transparency, and I'm confident in our future. With that, let me turn it over to Brian. Brian West : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. In the short time I've been here, the priorities couldn't be more clear, delivered for our customers, drive the highest levels of safety, quality, instability in all we do, innovate for the future and generate positive, sustainable free cash flow. While we have our share of challenges, I'm impressed the team and confident in our path forward. Let's turn to Slide 4, please. Third quarter revenue increased to $15.3 billion primarily due to higher commercial deliveries and commercial services volume. We recorded a $0.60 loss per share in the quarter, primarily driven by higher commercial volume, partially offset by lower tax benefits. Third quarter 2021, was also impacted by 77 abnormal costs and the Commercial Crew Starliner charge. Now let's move to Commercial Airplanes on slide 5. Revenue was $4.5 billion reflecting higher 737 deliveries, partially offset by lower 77 deliveries. Although commercial airplanes operating margin continued to be under pressure and improved in the quarter to the higher commercial airplane deliveries. And the BCA backlog is currently valued at $290 billion. Moving to the 737 MAX, we delivered 62 airplanes in the quarter. We currently have approximately 370 MAX airplanes built in store and inventory, including those that we have successfully remarketed. We know where the vast majority of the airplanes are going, given the demand and we anticipate delivering most of these airplanes by the end of 2023. This assumes we resumed delivery to our customers in China during the first quarter of 2022. This delivery timing and the production rate ramp profile remains dynamic given the market environment, customer discussions, regulatory approvals, and supply chain stability. There is no material change to our assumptions for the 737 abnormal costs or our assessment of the liability for estimates 737 MAX potential concessions and other considerations to customers.  Turning to the 787, we did not deliver any 787 s in the Third Quarter while we continue our reviews and work with the FAA as Dave mentioned. In line with our accounting practices, we recorded $183 million of abnormal costs in the Third Quarter due to the low rate of 77 production, as well as inspection and rework costs. These costs will continue in future periods while we complete the rework, and we remain at an abnormally low production rate. We currently anticipate total 787 abnormal costs to be approximately $1 billion. Our latest assessment of the financial impact of these abnormal costs and the estimated impacts of delayed deliveries to customers has been included in our third quarter closing position. The 787 program margin remains near breakeven. We still expect overall unit margins to hold up relatively well. And we're confident in the demand and the health of the 787 program over the long term. At the end of the third quarter, we have approximately 105 787s in inventory. Timing deliveries will be dependent upon completing necessary inspections in rework, ongoing fleet planning conversations with our customers, and closing out our activities with the FAA.  While the commercial recovery will take time, we remain focused on driving stability on the 787 program and across the business. As we bridge to the recovery, we expect improvements in commercial airplanes, financial performance due to increasing deliveries and continued efforts by the BCA team to transform for the future. Let's now move to Defense Space and Security on Slide 6.  Third quarter revenue decreased slightly to $6.6 billion and operating margin was 6.6% primarily due to $185 million earnings charge on our commercial crew Starline program, driven by the second on crude orbital flight test, now anticipated in 2022 and the latest assessment of remaining work. We received $6 billion in orders during the quarter, including an award for 4 Chinook Block 2 helicopters to the U.S. Army, and a JDM contract or the U.S. Air Force. We also received the award from Germany for 5 T80 aircraft.  The BDS backlog is currently valued at $58 billion. Let's now turn to global services on Slide 7. In the third quarter, Global Services revenue increased to $4.2 billion and operating margin grew to 15.3% driven by higher commercial services as the market recovers for the impacts of COVID-19. Operating margin was also favorably impacted by lower severance costs and mix of products and services. During the quarter, BGS1 key contracts worth approximately $4 billion, including 12 additional 737 MAX-800 Boeing converted freighters for BBAM and an award for performance base logistic support of the global C17 fleet.  Total backlog remains at $19 billion. We continue to see incremental improvement in commercial services during the third quarter and we expect the quarterly revenue trend to improve as we support increasing airline flight operations. Looking ahead, we expect the continued commercial market recovery to drive commercial services to increase as a percentage of total BGS revenue.  Let's now turn to cash flow on Slide 8. Operating cashflow for the quarter was negative $0.3 billion, reflecting higher commercial deliveries, higher order receipts, reduced expenditures and lower wide-body production rates, and importantly, benefits from our business transformation efforts. Operating cash flow was favorably impacted by a $1.3 billion income tax refund. While we continue to see a cash flow benefit from order activity and we saw some advanced payment to benefit in the third quarter.  We still expect advanced payment burned down to be headwind through next year. Let's move to Slide 9 and discuss our liquidity position. We ended the third quarter with solid liquidity, including $20 billion of cash and marketable securities on our Balance Sheet. We have access to a total of $14.7 billion across our bank credit facilities, which remain undrawn. Our debt balance decreased by $1.2 billion from last quarter to $62.4 billion, driven by the paydown of bond maturities.  As we mentioned last quarter, we expect to have lower total debt at the end of the year due to the paydown, a maturing bonds, and early pay-down of the remaining $4 billion delayed draw term loan. Given continued uncertainties in our environment, we are vigilantly managing our cash. We've seen our cash balance begin to stabilize due to prudent actions taken across the business and increasing commercial deliveries. Therefore, we believe we currently have sufficient liquidity.  We remain committed to reducing debt levels and actively managing the balance sheet. Our investment-grade credit rating is very important to us and we will consider all aspects of our capital structure, to strengthen our Balance Sheet. Cash flow expectations are largely unchanged from what we shared last quarter. We still expect full-year 2021 to be a use of cash and turn cash flow positive in 2022.  As always, cash flow may vary quarter-over-quarter due to timing of deliveries as well as receipts and expenditures, including the potential of further cash tax benefits and MAX customer settlement payments. The key driver of cash flow in 2022 compared to 2021 is higher 737 and 787 delivery volume. The significant working capital benefit of delivering airplanes from inventory will have some offset for the reduction to the advances in progress payments balance.  As we previously shared, our advances balance largely reflects delivery plans from before the pandemic at MAX production pause. While we anticipate a meaningful burn down next year, we expect the balance will normalize by the end of 2022. Also keep in mind, there will be an impact to cash flow in 2022 for compensation to customers for delivery delays, and some headwind from the strong 2021 order book, which helped fill the near-term skyline and improved cash flow, in this calendar year. As we bridge to sustainable free cash flow generation, we continue to proactively manage our liquidity and look to strengthen our balance sheet. In closing, while our business environment is dynamic, we're confident in the future. The key enablers for our business in our financial performance for the remainder of this year and into 2022 include vaccine distribution and travel protocols, which will ultimately facilitate the commercial market recovery. Remaining 737 MAX regulatory approvals, U.S. trying trade relations, and resumption of 787 deliveries. Our team continues to closely examine all aspects of our business, simplify and streamline our work, and make long lasting change. Above all else, we'll stay focused on safety, quality, stability, innovation while generating sustainable free cash flow. With that, I'll turn it back to Dave for closing comments. David Calhoun : Thanks, Brian. We're making important progress. We're taking the right actions to drive stability, to drive safety and quality in everything that we do. But while the past can be dynamic, I'm confident in our recovery and in our long-term growth. I'll close by thanking our teammates, your resilience, your passion, your commitment, continues to impress. These are challenging times and you've continued to bring your best to Boeing each and every day. As we look to the future, we're investing in our people, in our teams, to be sure Boeing remains a unique place to build your career and contribute to our important mission. Thank you for all that you do to support our customers, our Company, and each other. And with that, Brian and I will be happy to take questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, in order that your question be clearly heard. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, in the interest of time, we are asking that you limit yourself to 1 single part question. Our first question from Doug Harned with Bernstein, please go ahead. Doug Harned : Good morning. Thank you. David Calhoun : Hi, Doug. Doug Harned : So you -- you have taken customer compensation related to the MAX down from 9.8. billion to 3.4, and this has understandably helped with getting deliveries out in the tough demand environment, and I think of it as many of your customers are effectively seeing a discount through compensation. But two issues around that, first, how complete are your compensation negotiations at this point? In other words is the remaining 3.4 billion largely spoken for and it's just a matter of paying it out over time. And then second, how do you work with new customers? To see if I'm an airline, I look at others benefiting from these effective discounts and discounts that would not be available to me potentially. Is this an issue that can hold back new MAX orders or put added pressure on pricing? David Calhoun : So Doug, I think as you know, we have done everything in our power to separate the settlement of the contract misses that we've experienced from new airplane orders and discounts. So we we've done everything in our power to keep them separate and we've been very successful in that process. No negotiation is complete until it's complete, so I can't be perfectly accurate on this front. But the lion share are, in fact in the rear-view mirror. And we know where the wiggle room is with respect to them. We think the final ones. On the other hand, I never say we're done until we're done. I am quite confident that pricing discipline going forward has been and will continue to be sustained and maintained. And I think as we shift from what used to be a demand problem to more of a supply problem in the course of next calendar year, that, in fact, all of the trends are in our favor on that front. I really -- I think this has been managed well in the separation of those issues, and I think we're in a pretty good and disciplined place with respect to pricing. Doug Harned : Your sense is that when you are talking with new customers around this, you're essentially back to the kind of pricing you would normally be at on the MAX, in other words, nothing that in a sense is handicapped by the deals you've made over the last two years essentially? David Calhoun : Yes. Doug, I feel very strongly that that is, in fact, the case and I've been involved in them and we have proof points, so, yes. Doug Harned : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Next, we go to the line of Myles Walton with UBS, please go ahead. Myles Walton : Thanks. I was wondering you'd comment on the timeline for exhausting or liquidating the MAX inventory. I don't think you made a similar comment on the 787 of those 105 aircrafts. Could you lay out the timeline you think you can get those out-the-door? David Calhoun : Yes, I think it's too early for me to even suggest that one. We'll be as aggressive as we can in moving them out. But as you know, it all depends ultimately on the fleet. Planning changes that our customers employ. We've cause them harm to date, as they rethink their fleet planning. They're going to take them, when they want to take them, I can't jam them down anybody's throat. So, as soon as we have real clarity with respect to the timing of all that, we will give you a good firm guidance on it. Myles Walton : And a follow-up to that is there baked into the program concessionary damages that have been included or would those - are those still being calculated and given that the year ongoing and imagine you're starting to mount those if that's correct. Brian West : We are actively talking with customers and as we closed the quarter, there are provisions for what we believe those concessions to be as we stand here today. Myles Walton : Okay. All right. I'll leave it at two. thanks. Brian West : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies, please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good morning, Dave and Brian. Thank you for the time. You're actually a month -- your 2 month on production on the 787, what are the gating factors to restarting -- you gave a better color on that if you could give a little bit more, and how do we think about underlying demand for the 787? David Calhoun : Yeah. I wish I could give you a little more clarity. It's going to be when it's going to be with respect to increasing the rates and also beginning deliveries, because we really do have to get through these issues that prevent us from getting ticketed. While I believe we have clear line of sight on the issues, we've got to give our own teams and then the FAA time to get through all their analytics and agree with everything that we we're doing with respect to the rework plans, etc. We are well through it, but we're not through it. So until that happens, until we can announce deliveries commencing it going to be hard for me to give you guidance. With respect to demand, look if I thought we were going to be at something below five a month anytime soon, I would make bigger adjustments and we'd have less of an abnormal cost scenario. Abnormal costs for me are important costs to keep this line up running fresh and ready when 5 comes back. And so that's where we are. And I also just happen to believe on the basis of the testimony from customers and their experience with the airplane. As I said, and I reiterate the irony of the whole story as it's the most utilized wide-body out there.  It's delivering on efficiency, it's delivering on everything we promised. It's got cargo capability which has been an important factor in the role that its played. I think the demand is going to be quite robust and I think as we get to the second half of next year, that will begin to play out for all of us. But at this moment in time, I just can't be real definitive until we commenced deliveries. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay, thank you. Operator : Next, we go to the line of a Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ron Epstein : Hey, good morning, guys. David Calhoun : Hi Ron. Ron Epstein : Dave, just on the 777X, you guys are saying you're reasonably confident that's going to be completed in late 2023. Maybe you can give us some color around why you would think that would be the case? Most airplane developments, not just you guys, to be fair, have had this effective slipping into the next year at the end of the year. What gives you the confidence there? David Calhoun : Well, the time we gave ourselves just for starters, we put a lot of time into this that prior to the 37 MAX [Indiscernible], we would never have included. It would've been the total opposite. We would've been doing sort of straight lines from here to the chart. So we have put time in based on everything we've learned from the MAX.  So far, our experience is that there have been pauses that the FAA has taken. Maintaining the same posture that they did with the MAX. Boeing get your house in order before we run this test, Boeing do this before we do that. And we have stuck to that discipline and that was all part of the original plan and the timing for Fourth Quarter of 23. So we're still on that plan, nothing at this moment in time has sort of -- or posture taken has suggested that the plan isn't still workable. So that's why it really was that first moment when we surprised everybody with the delay and the time that it was going to take. It was all the planning involved in that, that I think still gives us confidence. Ron Epstein : And as a follow on to that same question. What are the technical milestones that were sitting outside the Company, obviously, right, that we can keep an eye on, just as followers to understand that you are indeed not you, but the Company is indeed on-track. David Calhoun : Well, on technical milestones, meaning commitments to our customers efficiency, this, that and the other thing. I think we've done all of our own flight tests. That's one another reason why we're so confident. We've been flying, and so we are in a pretty good place on all that front and we believe we can meet those expectations if not surpassed them.  No shortfalls on that front technically. As we work through all the safety protocols and all the documentation required on that front, I can't really guide you to any one thing, and I don't believe there is any one thing that gets in the way, but if there was ever going to be a got you, that's where it would be. Ron Epstein : Okay. Operator : Our next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Noah Poponak : Hi. Good morning, everybody. David Calhoun : Morning. Noah Poponak : Dave, you mentioned you were -- on the 787, you were in discussion with the FAA about the required actions to resume deliveries. Can you tell us what the FAA's required actions are at this point? You mentioned conducting inspections. Are you still -- are there still inspections for potential new issues or have you found everything you're going to find and the inspections are now just looking for those to then do the rework? I know there's uncertainty here and it's up to the regulator but you mentioned having some line of sight I think, for the investment community, this timeline feels very uncertain. If you could just tell us everything you know here even if there is some uncertainty just to help us some -- have some degree of visibility. David Calhoun : On the subject certainty. I can't give you a certainty until I'm certain. I wouldn't use the word very. I would characterize it as something quite a bit less than that. Our tip detail inspection, I think I had mentioned this the last time we're all together is complete, so we're not out there hunting for anything.  We did have a sort of a late breaking from a parts supplier that unfortunately is sub-tier supplier to other suppliers where we have to track a particular material substitution question that was brought to us by their regulators and track it through every part and then every supplier to us. So that process just takes time. We have, of course, segmented those parts. We believe we're in a good place. We don't believe there's safety ramifications.  On the other hand, on the subject of compliance, we have to make sure we're compliant with the material specs that are included in our design. That just takes some time. We're working our way through it, we're well past halfway. We're working our way down to the finish line, but that was the one that added some time to this. And then with respect to the workload, it's 90 % Boeing.  We're the ones that have to satisfy ourselves that we're compliant. And then the FAA has to agree with those set of analytics and they have to agree with all of our -- ultimately the judgments we make. And that's reasonably well in and we've been transparent from the word go.  So there won't be any surprises with respect on what the issues are and or the data that we're collecting to support our ultimate conclusions. So I think we're in an okay place. I wouldn't say very uncertain but I don't use that term, but we are uncertain, and we've got to get to that moment where we can start delivering. Noah Poponak : You're done a tip detail inspection, is the FAA done or is the FAA still searching for additional possible issues? David Calhoun : Yeah, no, they -- I wouldn't suggest they've been hunting for in any profound way. This is from the very beginning, this has been mostly Boeing on Boeing. So, but anything and everything that we ultimately find and or a supplier volunteers to us, we take it straight to the FAA and then we begin to work our way through it. So again, I want to be careful, this is not a problem with the FAA. They are doing their work. We just have to solve these things by ourselves and bring it to them and make sure that they agree with our judgments. Noah Poponak : So it sounds like it's now just down to this titanium component input issue. Is that correct? David Calhoun : That's correct. That's a long pole in the tent. Noah Poponak : Okay. Alright, thanks a lot. David Calhoun : Yeah. Operator : Our next question is from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Kristine Liwag : Hey, good morning, guys. David Calhoun : Good morning. Kristine Liwag : Dave, on the 737 MAX inventory -- aircraft and inventory. Some of these airplanes had different customers than the initial customers, can you provide more color in terms of the additional work and testing that needs to be done on these airplanes before they're delivered and how long that process takes? David Calhoun : Well, that's a little bit of why some drift into '23, it's like everything, we don't get the unilaterally decide, who gets them and how fast they get them. They got to incorporate them into their fleet plans and there has been some repositioning of airplanes that require work. And you're right about that. That's all included in our forward estimates with respect to the program performance.  It's very manageable and I think well within our means to do it all, I wouldn't consider it significant relative to the number of airplanes that we're going to move. Most of them are going to move under previously determined plans. So that's probably the best color I can give it to you. But that is why there is some drift into '23 with respect to deliveries. Kristine Liwag : I see. And I guess on production right? The supply chain has been a low production for the 737 max for some time now, and there's a lot of inventory also in the supplier system. Considering the constraints that other industries are seeing with regards to supply chain, raw materials, and labor what gives you the confidence that you can get to 31 per month and sustain that next year? David Calhoun : Well, because 31 was the number we we used to evaluate the supply chain. I continue to believe in the evidence is beginning to support that by the second half of next year, our industry will be supply constrained. So in trying to determine what the right rate would be for us at 31, we believe we have a supply chain that can handle that, and you're right. With the amount of inventory build that we have asked for during these current months, we have low production rates.  We think we're in a pretty good place to be able to do that. With respect to increasing from 31, as we go through the second half of the year and forward, I think that will be an assessment of the supply chain, not an assessment of demand, that gets us to whatever number we get to. I think we're going to be in a supply constrained world, probably from second half through all of '23 with respect to narrow-bodies. And that's true, I believe for the industry. Kristine Liwag : Thank you. David Calhoun : Yes. Operator : Next we'll move to David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A follow-up there on MAX. Dave, what is the reason you're not delivering more MAX aircraft? If I look at market share of narrow-body deliveries, year-to-date, even adjusting out that you can't deliver into China, market share is -- for the MAX is something like 35 %, 40 %. So is it an issue with rework, is it an FAA issue, or is it a market share issue? When would you expect to see -- you talked about MAX getting back to 50 % market share, when would -- when should we see that in terms of delivery levels? Thanks. David Calhoun : Good question David. The bigger source of variability with respect to completions and deliveries is on the inventory airplanes that we are back -- we are bringing into service, as opposed to ones coming fresh off the production line. So there's -- of course, as you know is a lot of warming up, there's a lot of things that you have to do. Depending on what you find, you got to do the work to make sure the readiness is what it needs to be. And we've said to the team, take all the time you need to get that exactly right. We're going to do this one airplane at a time. So we still have more variability in that then I would like to have. We are getting a little more stable. I think as we move into next year, we were going to be quite stable on that front. But at any rate, that has been the source of most of our delivery variation on the MAX. And we got to keep -- we do have to keep that discipline. That is why we're at the reliability rates we're at, which is extremely high. David Strauss : And a follow-up on that, Dave, can you be any more specific at all, the 370 MAX that are in inventory, is it kind of we do a little bit more -- liquidate a little bit more through the end of the year and then it's half of whatever is remains '22, and half is '23 or is it still going to be more skewed towards '22? David Calhoun : Ought to be more skewed to '22, yes. It will be more skewed to '22. David Strauss : All right. David Calhoun : Remember, like I said, we don't -- all these airplanes have homes. And so fleet -- our customers fleet plans and all the turmoil that we've created for them, we got to incorporate every one of these deliveries into their fleet plans, and so it's a -- the counter party has a lot of sway with respect to when we deliver and how we deliver and like I said, that has a lot to do with the tail moving into '23. David Strauss : Thanks very much. David Calhoun : Yup. Operator : Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr : Yes. Thanks so much. So Dave, what percent of the 370 approximately are planes in inventory are for China? David Calhoun : I don't have that number -- I don't have the percentage on the tip of my tongue [Brian] (ph), if you might. But what I will say this is the risk, if the question is related to risk, the risk related to that number continues to go down as we continue to move out delivery rates.  And then secondly, with the robustness of the market the willingness and the number of people interested in potentially taking some big portion of that. That's also at the door. So it's not as big a risk to our Company as it once felt. On the other hand, I don't have the number on the tip of my tongue. Brian West : Cai, it's roughly a third. Cai von Rumohr : That's very helpful. So the one problem I have is, if you're really going to take down more than 1/2 of the inventory and storage, and you're going to have -- you're going to raise the production rate at 31. By my math, you have to deliver over 5 -- about 500 planes next year maxes or more.  And you really only didn't an average of 20 per month in the third quarter, I guess, 26 in September, October doesn't look a little -- so much stronger. So how do we get there? I mean, that just seems like a huge increase in deliveries. Is there a problem there? What am I missing? David Calhoun : Yeah, I know I -- we have to get better at delivering out of the completion center or inventory airplanes, which I think we will, as I mentioned to you before, we've had a lot of variability on that front and we got to be better at that and that is the kind of work that we're doing. So I'm reasonably confident. I'm not sure I've got the same math you've got. But nonetheless, you're in the ballpark. And that's when we have to commit to do. Cai von Rumohr : Excellent, thank you very much. David Calhoun : Yup. Operator : Next, we'll go to Peter Arment with Baird, please go ahead. Peter Arment : Good morning, Dave, Brian. David Calhoun : Good morning. Peter Arment : And maybe one for Brian, he seem maybe he's getting lonely over there. Just maybe how you're thinking about kind of the drivers, the bigger buckets, as we think about comparing 2022 versus '21. And obviously a lot determined on some of these liquidations of what's parked. Thanks. Brian West : So a big piece of it is going to be, as I mentioned, the deliveries and the subsequent inventory unwind. We've talked a lot about how the 737 is going to unwind. Looks the same thing with the 787. We continue -- that would be a huge benefit going from negative to positive. We always want to temper folks to make sure they appreciate that the advanced burn down will happen by the end of 2022 and it's going to naturally occur as those deliveries take place. So really it's deliveries, it's vast majority of that swing in the cash flow, as well as continuing to drive the operations to hire stability and continuing to work our business transformation efforts. Peter Arment : Is there any -- and just a follow-up on that. Is there any color on what the burn down looks like on the advanced line? Brian West : We don't have that specifically, but we do know that based on the some of the order activity from this year and the delivery timing between the 2 years, it's naturally going to have to burn down and we're preparing for that. It's a headwind, but not so much so that we can't accomplish that free cash flow generation large because we're going to deliver a lot more airplanes. Peter Arment : Appreciate the calling. Thanks, Brian. Operator : And our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hunter Keay : Thank you for getting me on, good morning. I have 2 quick ones. What are you penciling in for tax refunds for the '22 free cash flow guide? And then, of the 105 787s that you have in the inventory right now, assuming the FAA gave the green light to start delivering again, how many of those 105 require additional rework and how many could be delivered pretty quickly? Thank you. David Calhoun : Let me answer the second question. First, I'll let Brian discuss taxes all the way downhill. One of forecasted. Most of the rework with respect to the issues that have come up on the 787 is in the rear view mirror for us. So this will be a little less about that, you know whatever we find in these last set of parts in anything that we may have to do on that front, as I said, is ahead of us. But we've been doing rework nonstop for the last 7 months.  So it's not a giant mountain ahead of us. Then it just becomes a question of customer -- when do they want it? Now remember, international ops grew, almost all of our customers are still significantly below where they used to be. So when do they want them? How does it melt into their fleet plan? Because we're going to be incredibly accommodative to that. And then second, just how we orchestrate the movement through our completion center alongside the FAA. So those will be the determinants, but it will not be a giant rework backlog that is going to prevent us from delivering airplanes. Brian West : On the taxes. We could expect something, but when we execute our suite from negative to positive, it's not a factor in underwriting that case, so not a lot. Hunter Keay : Got it. Thank you both. Brian West : Yes.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Thank you for standing by. Good day everyone and welcome to The Boeing Company\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst question-and-answer session are being broadcast live over the internet. [Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mr. Matt Welch, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Boeing Company. Mr. Welch, please go ahead. Matt Welch : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Boeing\u2019s fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. I am Matt Welch and with me today are Dave Calhoun, Boeing\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian West, Boeing\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And as a reminder, you can follow today\u2019s broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. Projections, estimates and goals we include in our discussions this morning involve risks, including those described in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of the web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures. Now, I will turn the call over to Dave Calhoun. Dave Calhoun : Yes. Thanks, Matt. Just upfront, we\u2019ve changed in this format just a bit so that I can limit my remarks upfront to some observations and thoughts with respect to where we are in this rebuilding process. And then, Brian will take you into more detail on the financial side. With respect to the environment, there\u2019s no doubt Omicron has paused the industry recovery. But it has not changed the outlook for the industry recovery, such that while it might be delayed a few more months, the bookings and the customer discussions with respect to fleet plans, medium and long term, are still quite robust. And we are quite confident in that outlook. 2021 I would characterize for Boeing as a rebuilding year. We came from recovery to rebuilding. And I give our team a lot of credit for, frankly, making a lot of progress on that front. Number one, on the orders front and demand, particularly led by the MAX and the freighter market, I feel very good about where things are and the competitiveness of our product line with respect to that market. Supply constraints to date have not constrained us. On the other hand, I think in the medium to long-term future, it\u2019s something we all have to plan for. I\u2019ve always viewed the unfortunate means by which we got here and the buildup of finished goods inventory, both with respect to the MAX and the 787, as sort of a double-edged sword. I hate that we have a lot of inventory. On the other hand, it will probably serve us well in what is likely to be a robust recovery. With respect to fleet rebuilding, I would also just like to highlight the efficiency gains and maybe even more importantly, the emissions gains that our customers enjoy when they replace their current fleet with these new aircraft are significant, and the pressures are severe. So, I think that creates some additive pressure with respect to fleet renewals as we move forward. And I don\u2019t think either of those will let up. The MAX return to service. I\u2019m quite proud of where we are on that. We have regulatory approval now in almost every jurisdiction in the world. You know that China, Indonesia and Ethiopia all delivered prior to the end of the year. We delivered 245 airplanes in \u201821. We\u2019ve flown safely over 800,000 flight hours, 99.3% service reliability. And we\u2019ve now flown more post the MAX grounding than we did pre-MAX grounding. China is preparing for their MAX return to service and for delivery. And we have set up a plan that allows for that in the first quarter. But of course, they\u2019ll take them as the government returns the current fleet to service. Our customers are moving methodically and very well with respect to that return to service. 87, very unfortunate charge that we took here in the fourth quarter. It reflects everything we\u2019ve learned about the rework process itself, the data required to restart deliveries and obtain ticketing and then customer expectations regarding concessions as we move forward. With all that said, I still feel fantastic about the future of the 787 airplane for The Boeing Company. And anyway, as I think I point out every time we get together, these 87s today, the field -- the fleet and service is flying, is more utilized than any other widebody airplane. 99% of it is in service today with respect to the pre-pandemic levels. And it\u2019s the most utilized widebody out there, 98.99% reliability. So, this is a great product line and a competitive product. And as soon as we begin delivery, we feel very good about the ultimate recovery. On BDS, we did hit a bunch of really important milestones. The MQ-25, we experienced our first refueling, and we began carrier tests. The T-7A production line, which is based on significantly improved development process and engineering modeling capabilities, is off to a very good start, and the efficiency associated with that development process is being realized. And then, the tanker. The tanker today, despite the charge, again, which we don\u2019t feel great about by any respect, but the tanker today is an incredible asset for our customer and now serves 70% of the missions that were intended in the development of the tanker. And our job is to continue to deliver the tanker and to do it more expeditiously as we move forward. The good news is our customer likes the performance of the airplane. And again, we intend to serve that need. Global Services, it is recovering like all the service businesses that surround aviation. It\u2019s on a great path. The team is doing a terrific job. We had a small write-off with respect to materials that ultimately would not be utilized in this recovery. But BGS is doing quite well, and is experiencing the recovery. And then, I feel very good about the free cash flow that we generated in the fourth quarter. As everybody knows, we have been focused relentlessly on improving our free cash flow situation. It has been our number one metric. And to be able to achieve that I think is terrific news. Sustainability, it is the one issue every customer wants to talk to us about, not with respect to 2050 or 2035, but they want to make sure that we have a program in place that will support them over that time frame, and it is very important to the every next order that we achieve. So, believe it or not, the competition for today\u2019s airplanes is often built around the future plans that we have with respect to sustainability. And I love where we\u2019re going on that and the story we -- that we have for our customers. Innovation is strong in every way. I mentioned the MQ-25, the T-7A. Future capabilities with respect to the next development program, we\u2019ve invested a lot. We continue to invest a lot. It\u2019s more important to me that we get our development tools where they need to be, demonstrate manufacturing capability and capacity where we need to be before we call out the spec on the next new commercial airplane. So, I remain focused on that as a priority, and so far, so good. Talent, we were stable over the course of \u201821. Turnover was managed I think quite well and quite aggressively. And so, I feel good about that and our ability to hire as we move forward. But, I will also acknowledge that there are shortages out there in critical skills, and we have to be very competitive in order to get them. I\u2019ll highlight the priorities we have. I don\u2019t think any of them should surprise anybody. They may look boring with respect to words like stability, safety, quality management. But that is still our focus, and we\u2019re going to be relentless about it. This is a very important year as we begin the year and then exit the year where we can predict to customers and to all of you the deliveries of our airplanes and ensure the quality is what it needs to be, et cetera. And culturally, our team is getting closer to their work than they\u2019ve ever been. We feel good about that. And we invest. We\u2019re investing heavily in the future capabilities of our Company. So, that\u2019s it with respect to my upfront comments. I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian. We can go through the quarter\u2019s performance and then a little more time for Q&A. Brian West : Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. 2021 was a year of recovery for our business. We\u2019re optimistic about how we\u2019re positioned entering into 2022 and have high confidence in the long-term strength of the Company. We remain focused on solidifying our business for long-term success. The lessons we\u2019ve learned and the changes we\u2019ve implemented in the last two years will help us to do that. We\u2019re driving safety, quality, stability into every corner of our operations to enable future growth. And we made solid progress against our goals over the last three months. In particular, as Dave mentioned, we\u2019re proceeding to get 737 MAX airplanes ready to deliver in China as early as the first quarter and follow the lead of our customers and regulators on next steps. On the 787, while we can\u2019t predict when deliveries will restart, we have made meaningful strides in addressing many of the non-conformances we identified. We have work remaining to do, and we continue to hold detailed productive discussions with the FAA every step of the way. Looking to our financials. Despite some of the near-term challenges, we generated positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter and believe free cash flow will continue to materially improve this year and into 2023. With this backdrop, we think of 2022 in three parts. First, we\u2019ll focus on reaching key milestones so that we can resume 737 deliveries to Chinese customers and restart 787 deliveries. Then, once we achieve these important milestones, we expect to see improvement in our performance metrics, including deliveries, revenue, margin and cash flow. And we intend to come back to you with detailed plans for the rest of the year and beyond. Finally, as we move through the second half of the year, our financial performance should start to accelerate. And we think there is a significant opportunity ahead for our Company return to sustainable growth. Net-net, we\u2019re well positioned at the start of the year and encouraged by the hope of a return to normalcy in 2022. Before I get into the detailed financial results, I want to make a few points on the current environment on slide 4. Let\u2019s start with the demand side. In the commercial market, we continue to see an overall broadening of the recovery starting with domestic traffic, which rebounded to around 90% of prepandemic levels in countries such as the U.S. and Brazil. In the U.S., domestic traffic nearly fully recovered at 94% of pre-COVID levels in November. December data suggests resilient traffic despite the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, but early 2022 bookings data indicate a more visible negative impact likely extending through February. Beyond that, we expect the recovery for the spring and summer seasons. Outside of the U.S., the recovery continues broadening in Europe and South America. However, further lockdowns have stagnated recovery in China, where we have seen traffic decrease considerably. Despite some near-term volatility, we\u2019re encouraged by airlines\u2019 plans for the spring and summer travel seasons. On the international front, traffic has improved throughout the year from more than 85% below 2019 levels to 60% as the year ended with a meaningful benefit from reopening of borders and lifting of travel restrictions. In particular, the transatlantic corridor showed improvement due to coordinated travel policies between the EU and the U.S. The commercial freighter market continues to be robust with 2021 cargo traffic 7% above prepandemic levels. We saw record freighter demand last year driven by both e-commerce growth and demand for faster, more reliable transport that airfreight can provide. And we\u2019re seeing the same steady recovery broadly in our commercial services business as well. Given this demand recovery, our customers are increasingly focused on their medium-term flight planning and continue to prioritize fleet modernization as an enabler to reduce carbon emissions and increase operating efficiency. New airplanes we deliver will be as much as 25% to 40% more fuel efficient with commensurate reductions in emissions compared to the airplanes they replace. And as oil prices remain high, our customers are keenly aware of these benefits. Overall, our projections for the three-phase commercial market recovery remain unchanged, and we still assume pass-through traffic will return to 2019 levels in the 2023 to 2024 time frame. We continue to see domestic traffic lead the recovery followed by intra-regional and then long-haul international routes. Long-term fundamentals that support demand for air traffic remain intact as we continue to project average traffic growth of mid-single digits over the long term. In the defense and space markets, we\u2019re seeing stable demand. We continue to monitor the federal budget process in the U.S. and see strong bipartisan support for national security, including Boeing products and services. While governments around the world remain focused on COVID-19, security spending remains a priority given global threats. On the supply side, with our production at relatively low rates and higher-than-normal inventory levels, the supply chain is currently not a constraint. However, as we look forward to the industry recovering and future production rate increases, our supply chain remains a key watch item due to raw material and labor availability as well as logistical challenges. We regularly monitor supplier health and have risk mitigation plans in place for critical components. As we prepare for future rate production increases, we will continue to prioritize operational stability across the value stream. Long term, the markets we serve are robust, and we remain confident in the fundamentals of our business and the growth of the industry. With that, let\u2019s turn to the financials on page 5 -- slide 5. Fourth quarter revenue of $14.8 billion declined 3%. And the core operating loss in the quarter was $4.5 billion, resulting in a $7.69 loss per share. We generated positive operating cash flow of over $700 million in the fourth quarter, driven by 737 deliveries and favorable receipt timing in BDS. Let\u2019s now look to Commercial Airplanes on slide 6. Commercial order activity picked up significantly in 2021 as airlines are positioning for the recovery, particularly in the narrowbody and freighter markets. In total for the year, we booked 909 gross Commercial Airplane orders, including 749 orders for the 737 MAX. We also booked a record number of orders on our freighter airplanes. And we ended the year with 11 straight months of positive net orders. We appreciate every order from our broad customer base, including United, Southwest, Alaska, UPS and FedEx. We are also honored that Akasa, Allegiant and 777 partners recently selected Boeing to support their future fleets. We had over 4,200 airplanes in backlog at the end of 2021 valued at $297 billion. Fourth quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, essentially flat, primarily driven by higher 737 deliveries, partially offset by lower widebody deliveries and less favorable mix. Operating losses of $4.5 billion were primarily driven by charges on the 787 program, resulting in a negative margin rate. 787 deliveries remain paused, and we had 110 airplanes in inventory at the end of the quarter. As you know, last year, we set out on a comprehensive program to ensure every 787 airplane in our production system conforms to our exacting specifications. We resolved many of the non-conformances and, we\u2019re finalizing our work on the remaining items. We also continue to focus on fulfilling the requirements and expectations of the FAA, and we\u2019ll follow their lead on the timing of resuming deliveries. While this effort has inevitably impacted our deliveries to customers and our near-term financial performance, we are fully confident is the right thing to do for our future. In the fourth quarter, we determined that the activities required to resume deliveries and the rework that will be needed on each airplane and inventory will take longer than previously expected, resulting in further delays in customer delivery dates. We regret the impact these delays have had on our customers and are working closely with each of them to support their fleet planning needs. Consequently, we\u2019re producing at very low rates, and we\u2019ll continue to do so until deliveries resume, gradually returning to five airplanes per month over time. From a financial impact standpoint, we now anticipate 787 abnormal costs will be approximately $2 billion, with most being incurred by the end of 2023. This estimate increased by approximately $1 billion from last quarter due to the additional rework requirements and lower production rates continuing longer than previously expected. We recorded $285 million of these abnormal costs in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we recorded a $3.5 billion noncash charge in the quarter to write down unamortized deferred production costs, primarily due to estimated customer compensation for the longer delivery delays. It is important to keep in mind that from an economic standpoint, cash margins on the 787 remain positive. While the additional costs and customer considerations will put some downward pressure on cash margins in the near term, cash margins are expected to remain positive and significantly improve over time. We remain very confident in the future success of the 787, and it remains one of our most compelling programs. Importantly, none of the issues we\u2019re addressing have raised immediate safety of flight concerns or impacted the capabilities of the in-service fleet. We received gross orders for 21 airplanes last year, and we see a long runway ahead. We are working diligently to ensure that we are well positioned as demand recovers and accelerates in the future. Moving on to the 737 MAX program. The MAX is now approved to fly in over 185 countries. As mentioned, we continue to prepare airplanes for deliveries as early as the first quarter, subject to customer and regulatory approvals in China. We also delivered 245 737 MAX airplanes last year, and we\u2019ve steadily ramped up production. And we are now producing at 27 airplanes per month on our way to 31 per month early this year. As you look to ramp both our production rate and delivery gains this year, we will continue to monitor the impact of Omicron on resource availability. We currently have 335 737 MAX airplanes in inventory and still anticipate delivering most of these airplanes by the end of 2023. Timing and pace of deliveries to Chinese customers are also critical assumptions to our delivery outlook. 737 abnormal costs and the liability for 737 MAX customer considerations are largely behind us. We expect the majority of the remaining $2.9 billion liability to be liquidated this year with less than 10% of the total estimate left to be negotiated. On the 777X, we continue to progress through our rigorous and comprehensive test program. We have flown over 1,800 flight hours through the end of 2021. We also completed engine and airplane performance testing, and the airplane continues to perform in line with our customer commitments. Our customers recognize the compelling economics and sustainability benefits this airplane offers. We remain engaged with the FAA and other global regulators throughout this process. We\u2019re working towards reaching Type Inspection Authorization or TIA, which is a pacing item for us to begin FAA certification flight testing. We are still anticipating delivery of the first airplane in late 2023. Also, we are currently offering the freighter version of our 777X airplane to customers. And we\u2019ll keep you updated as we progress on sales campaigns and conclude our launch timing evaluation. As a result of increasing freighter demand, we plan to increase the combined 777, 777X production rate from two to three per month this year and expect 2022 deliveries to be relatively in line with last year. Let\u2019s now move to Defense, Space & Security on slide 7. Fourth quarter revenue was $5.9 billion, down 14%, and operating margin was negative 4.4%. These results were primarily driven by lower volume and less favorable performance across the portfolio, including a $402 million pretax charge on the KC-46 Tanker program. The charge is primarily driven by evolving customer requirements for a remote vision system as well as factory and supply chain disruptions, including the impact of COVID. On the commercial crew program, as previously shared, we and NASA anticipate the second uncrewed orbital flight test to occur in May. We received $7 billion in orders during the quarter, including an award for modernization of Airborne Warning and Control System to Royal Saudi Air Force. The BDS backlog increased to $60 billion. During the quarter, BDS also delivered on critical customer milestones. Overall, we remain optimistic about our defense business. Now, let\u2019s turn to Global Services results on slide 8. Fourth quarter Global Services revenue was $4.3 billion, up 15%, and operating margin was 9.3%. Results were driven by higher commercial services volume and favorable mix. Earnings were impacted by a $220 million inventory impairment in the fourth quarter. We received $6 billion in orders during the quarter, taking the BGS backlog to $20 billion. We also delivered the 50th 767-300 converted freighter and announced plans to add 10 new converted freighter lines. Our services business has shown great resilience in part due to the balance of both defense and commercial offerings. Let\u2019s move to slide 9 and cover the full year financials. Full year revenue of $62.3 billion improved 7% versus prior year. The core operating loss was negative $4.1 billion, an improvement of $10.1 billion. The resulting core loss per share was $9.44, primarily driven by the charge on the 787. Operating cash flow was negative $3.4 billion, an improvement of $15 billion. The in-year cash usage was driven by 787 inventory build, 737 customer considerations and interest payments, partially offset by commercial deliveries, order activity, favorable timing of cash receipts at BDS and tax refunds related to the CARES Act. Now, let\u2019s turn to slide 10 to cover cash and debt. We ended the fourth quarter with strong liquidity, comprised of $16.2 billion of cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet and access to $14.7 billion across our bank credit facilities, which remain undrawn. Our debt balance decreased by $4.3 billion from the end of the third quarter to $58.1 billion driven by the early pay down of the delayed draw term loan. We remain committed to reducing debt levels, and our investment-grade credit rating is a priority. Please turn to the next slide for a look at 2022 and key drivers of the business. As you look ahead, 2022 performance will be driven by the commercial market recovery, return to delivery for the 787 and 737 MAX in China, production system and delivery stability and U.S.-China trade relations. Our efforts to stabilize our production system, including the supply chain and improve our delivery predictability remain top priorities. These activities will be paramount to our success. Looking broadly across our enterprise, we\u2019re maintaining, in some cases, expanding key investments in our people, technology, manufacturing capabilities and strategic partnerships. We\u2019re advancing our development of the MAX 7, MAX 10 and 777X programs, all while continuing to invest in digital capabilities to support our next commercial airplane program. In BDS, we\u2019re progressing on the MQ-25, T-7A, Commercial Crew and several other key development programs. As we invest, we continue to be laser-focused on our business transformation efforts to drive quality, productivity and cash flow. Now, let\u2019s take a look at the key drivers of 2022 revenue and cash. We anticipate revenue increase primarily driven by higher commercial airplane deliveries on the 737 and 787 programs. That said, revenue will be impacted by 787 customer considerations and delivering 737 airplanes that were previously remarketed. We are forecasting stable revenue in our defense business and solid growth in our services business as the commercial market continues to improve. Moving to cash. We still expect to generate positive free cash flow in the year. The key driver remains higher 737 and 787 delivery volume. Keep in mind the working capital benefit from delivering airplanes from inventory will be partially offset by a lower advances in progress payments balance. We still anticipate a significant burn down of our advances balance this year, which we expect to be more front-end loaded in line with customer discussions. Additionally, cash flow will remain impacted by timing of receipts and expenditures. As you may recall, we booked orders last year that filled near-term skyline positions, and those unique receipts may not continue at the same levels this year. From a phasing standpoint, we anticipate the first quarter to be our lowest quarter of the year for deliveries, revenue, earnings and cash flow. First quarter cash flow could look similar to the usage we saw in 1Q \u201821, driven by unfavorable receipt timing, excess advance payment burn down, resource availability due to the Omicron variant and normal seasonality. We remain confident that our free cash flow will improve in the second quarter and will meaningfully accelerate in the back half of the year as we achieve the key delivery milestones that I previously outlined. As we look to the future, we expect 2023 cash flow will be materially higher than 2022. We look forward to sharing more details on our plan as soon as we can. In closing, the business environment remains dynamic, but we\u2019ve made important progress. We are confident that we\u2019re on the right path, we\u2019re taking the right steps to drive stability and making the right investments to ensure the business is well positioned for future growth. With that, closing comments? Dave Calhoun : Yes. No further comments. I\u2019d like to turn it over to questions and give all our time to that. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu : So maybe can you help us understand the $3.5 billion of charges tied to the 787 in addition to the abnormal cost of $2 billion through 2023? That\u2019s up $1 billion from Q3 as you mentioned, Brian. What does this imply for the future profit and cash tied to the 787 program? How do we think about those deliveries going back up to 5 and then timing of those deliveries restarting because some of your customers have talked about an April time frame? Brian West : Thanks, Sheila. So, on the 787 $3.5 billion, we previously described a pretty labor-intensive rework solution on the door surrounds. And in the quarter, we determined that this rework was going to be needed to be formed on all of the airplanes inventory. So, the abnormal is $1 billion higher and will mostly go through 2023 because of this higher rework cost and the production rates being lower for longer. This, in turn, has our delivery slide to the right. So, more airplanes will be impacted, not just the ones in inventory. And we provided for estimated customer concessions because of these delays, which drove the $3.5 billion charge. While this hurts in the near term, we still believe it\u2019s the right thing to do because long term, we\u2019re going to sell a lot of these 787s for decades. So, we just got to work our way through this. In terms of getting back to 5, so we got to first get cleared to deliver, and then we\u2019re going to gradually work our way to a point we\u2019re going to get back up to 5. We don\u2019t have the time frame, but we think that the first step is getting the first one out the door. On the April time frame, Dave, maybe you could comment on the customer implications on that one. Dave Calhoun : Well, the April time frame is all I\u2019ll say is the customers know everything that we do. We share the same regulator. They are in our factories looking at the airplanes every day. So, they know exactly what\u2019s going on and where it is. I don\u2019t want to get ahead of anybody with respect to speculating the day we pick it. That\u2019s up to the FAA, and we\u2019re going to let them do what they have to do. Otherwise, I think Brian described this charge exactly the way it is. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr : Yes. Thanks so much. So, maybe to follow up on Sheila\u2019s question. Of the $3.5 billion, you mentioned that\u2019s noncash, how much of it turns into cash? How much of it is the abnormal -- the $1 billion increase? And how much of it is customer considerations? And when do you expect those to be paid out? Brian West : Yes. Sure, Cai. So, the $1 billion increase on the abnormal is separate from the $3.5 billion. And in terms of the $3.5 billion, that will play out over a longer period of time, particularly as we have discussions with customers. Some of that might be accelerated in the near term, but overall, it\u2019s going to take us time for that cash flow to go out. It will take years. In terms of how much is customer concessions, we\u2019re not going to talk about all of the pieces. Trust that as we closed the quarter, we took all the estimates in terms of what we think was going to happen both for contractual and non-contractual concessions. And it\u2019s embedded into our closing position. And we feel good about that, and now we just have to work through with our customers to -- and then start delivering. In terms of the abnormal, again, that cash flow will likely go out over the next two years as most of that will be behind us as we get out of 2023. Dave Calhoun : The only other context is that unlike in the case of the MAX, we do have an experience, unfortunately, that we can draw from in setting these estimates, and most importantly, the management of the concessions with our customers over time. So, what we\u2019ve posted and the way we think about it is largely based on that historical experience, of course, with the MAX. So, I feel like we\u2019ve probably bounded it pretty reasonably. Operator : Our next question is from Myles Walton with UBS. Myles Walton : On the 37 MAX given the lead times in the supply chain, I know that you\u2019re evaluating the timing of further increases, but can you get much above 31 a month before the end of the year if you haven\u2019t made that decision yet? And obviously, suppliers are thinking that you\u2019re looking to the 40 level as you leave \u201822, maybe a little clarification there. Brian West : I\u2019ll leave the supplier and the increase to Dave. I want to take the near-term production delivery MAX question head-on because it\u2019s largely unchanged from where we were last quarter as what we expect to happen in 2022. We\u2019ve got 335 units of inventory. And that will liquidate through the year at a quarterly rate that is pretty similar to what we did last quarter. And then, the production ramp, as you know, Myles, is going to go from 26 to 31 fairly soon. So, we all think that\u2019s going to play out. And again, it\u2019s similar to what we had thought last quarter. The one watch item that we have in the first quarter is any disruption on Omicron that might have a bit of a slower start, but we\u2019ll work our way through that. The total profile is largely unchanged. And we\u2019re quite confident in the demand. And maybe in terms of further rate increase supply chain, I\u2019ll let Dave comment on that. Dave Calhoun : Well, just the prognosis that we can move it up and based on what everybody seems to want to believe. We are going to be very aggressive with our supply chain to get buffers at every corner so that we can do it. And then the question is, do we do it? So, right now, we have fewer supply constraints probably than the industry simply because we\u2019ve got this big finished goods inventory that\u2019s going to carry us for the better part of the calendar year and then even a little bit into next year. So, we\u2019ll take advantage of that, and then we\u2019ll ask the supply chain to build buffer, both on our premise and in theirs to protect upside. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking about it. Myles Walton : Can you talk about that next release, the next uptick this quarter? Dave Calhoun : Can I talk about the next... Brian West : So, going to 31? Myles Walton : Above 31. You announced that -- is that a 1Q decision basically? I know the Company is evaluating further increasing\u2026 Dave Calhoun : Yes. No, no. I would say no, it\u2019s not a 1Q decision for us. As I said, we will work our supply chain and work with our supply chain transparently to protect upside on rate as we get to the second half of the year, et cetera. And the minute we are ready to do it, we\u2019ll do it. But I don\u2019t want to get ahead of myself on that front. Certainly not now. Operator : Our next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Noah Poponak : Just going back to 787 timing, so I just want to make sure I have this correct. So, American Airlines is up to speed. It\u2019s an estimate, but their estimate isn\u2019t missing an update from you that they said last week that there\u2019s been nothing new for them in the last few months. So, today\u2019s updates from you are marking to market additional rework, future concessions as you\u2019ve determined them over the last few months as opposed to an additional timing delay for the restart. Dave Calhoun : Yes, I agree with what you just said. Noah Poponak : Okay. And then, Dave, can you maybe just get a little more specific in what is left to do? It sounds like you were kind of iterating back and forth on inspection and rework, but that you\u2019ve agreed to that. So, what\u2019s actually left to do to resume deliveries? Dave Calhoun : Well, -- so we\u2019ll have to complete the rework on a large fleet of airplanes. So, that in and of itself is -- takes some time to do. But then we have to update every analytic that we provide to our regulator based on every next rework. So, to just again, corroborate the case that we have with respect to conformance. So, you have a lag in that. You collect that data. You include it in the analytic. And then when it gets to be sufficient, you will provide it to the FAA, and then there\u2019s a work -- you work through it with them. But that is the sort of the process that we have to go through. And there\u2019s no way to shortcut it. And I can\u2019t collect data on the airplanes I haven\u2019t reworked yet. I have to get through it. I\u2019ve got to simply work my way through that. I have confidence in the rework programs. We have no new discoveries with respect to how we do the rework, and they\u2019re getting perfected just like in the case of standard work in building an airplane the first time, we have to do sort of the same thing with rework processes. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. So, I wish it could go faster, and I can\u2019t accelerate it. I need them all to take their time and go through their learning curves and post the data to the analysis. Noah Poponak : Why can\u2019t you deliver a new one clean off the line that doesn\u2019t have any of the historical errors as opposed to waiting to rework what\u2019s already built? Dave Calhoun : Yes. Well, there\u2019s a -- again, I\u2019m not going to speak for my regulator because that\u2019s up to them on how we do it and maybe that\u2019s how things end up working. On the other hand, they are going to ticket that airplane, and they\u2019re going to want to know everything there is to know about everything. And we\u2019re still posting data with respect to what we find in our fleet. So, I don\u2019t know what more to say. I wish it was perfectly predictable. It\u2019s just not. Operator : Our next question is from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss : Dave, in terms of MAX deliveries, can you give us kind of an estimate of what we should think about for actual deliveries in 2022, given the rate and given the inventory liquidation you\u2019re talking about? And then, Brian, a follow-up on free cash flow just given what you\u2019re implying for the Q1 burn at like $4 billion to $5 billion seems like a long pause to get to free cash flow positive for the full year. I mean, are we talking about closer to low-single-digit billions and mid-single-digit billions in terms of positive free cash flow? Thanks. Brian West : Yes. So, in terms of the free cash flow, it\u2019s really going to be driven by three specific things. There is seasonality like every first quarter. There\u2019s going to be BDS stability that doesn\u2019t repeat, and there\u2019s going to be some assumption on excess burn down. But I think that we have a handle around all that, and we do think it is in and out of the first quarter, and the second quarter does get favorable. In terms of -- I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be quite as high as the number you are throwing around, but it is going to be in the small billions. In terms of the -- your question on MAX deliveries. So, I go back to where we were last quarter, and we kind of had a ballpark of what that would look like. That hasn\u2019t changed. And again, if we continue to liquidate the inventory at about the rate that we did last quarter, and you then have your production ramp go from 26 to 31, that kind of gets us to a spot where we have a pretty good profile of what that\u2019s going to look like through the year with the one caveat is that the first quarter is probably going to be a little slow, one, because it usually is; and two, because we, like others, are wrestling with this Omicron. David Strauss : Somewhere around 500 deliveries, is that what we\u2019re looking at? Brian West : Ballpark seems pretty good. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Seth Seifman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman : I guess, it seems a little bit of a shame to ask the question about the next aircraft because there\u2019s -- I know there\u2019s a lot of more imminent stuff for the Company, but you did discuss it, Dave. And so, when you think about that, just maybe your updated thoughts because you did mention the work that you\u2019re doing there. And I also asked the question in light of the success that Airbus had this past quarter with some of -- with some 737 customers. Any evolution in your thinking, number one, about market share; and number two, about the -- about where the value comes from in the aircraft? Because I think you\u2019ve said in the past that it\u2019s going to come from Boeing and not the propulsion system. And that suggests a pretty big investment for Boeing. And so, maybe Brian can also chime in on thinking about how the balance sheet plays into that. Dave Calhoun : Yes. Seth, I appreciate the question. We are -- as you know, have a reasonably full pipeline with respect to airplane developments with the MAX derivatives and the 777X, which I, again, I will highlight as a true differentiator in the marketplace as it displaces not just the 47, but also 380 over time. Anyway, so I feel good about that. And if we\u2019re fortunate and we get customers interested in a freighter version of it, we will move aggressively along those lines. So, we have a pretty good product family and development pipeline ahead of us. I just don\u2019t think that should be lost on anyone. And then secondly, the much longer term and much bigger program for me is the one we refer to as our IPT, integrated product team, where we\u2019re going to revamp the development process itself. And anyone who\u2019s been around our industry for a long period of time knows that the big variables in our financial performance over time usually relate to shortfalls in the development process. And my intent and my hope in light of all the new tools that are available to us, both in terms of digital modeling on the original design, but then also being able to use that same modeling to perfect manufacturing processes at scale and ultimately, serviceability, that is where the action is. That is where the next airplane is going to differentiate itself more than any other, in my opinion. So, we are invested and continue to stay invested. We\u2019ve allocated much of our top talent across the Company to that effort. I can\u2019t wait to update everybody on, again, that progress. It won\u2019t be as exciting because it doesn\u2019t fly away, but it is, in my opinion, the most important thing that we can do, and we remain totally focused on that. With respect to the competitiveness of our product portfolio, I still feel very good about it. I never will look at any last deal and suggest that we\u2019re losing to this -- losing to somebody or not. You have to take the totality of the last couple of years. They have airplanes that absolutely outperform us in certain applications, and we have some that outperform them in applications. And our customers are really good discerning the differences and making their choices. So, I apologize, I\u2019m sure I sound like a broken record, but we think we have our priorities right here. There will be a next airplane. As I did say and I will acknowledge, I don\u2019t think the propulsion system is going to add as much value to that next airplane, either ours or theirs, as it has historically, which means that the airframer has to add more value to it in order to make it a compelling sale to our customers. I look forward to that moment anyway. So, we\u2019re doing our very best to get ready for it. Brian West : And on the balance sheet side of it, for us, over time, one priority is to take leverage down, but also a priority is to make sure we\u2019re going to be ready to invest in that next airplane at the right moment. And we do various scenario plannings, and we think we\u2019ve got options and things to make all that happen. But again, that\u2019s a little bit of a longer look, but nothing would suggest we wouldn\u2019t want to be investors for the right airplane. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ron Epstein : Just maybe following up on that previous question. When you look at the market share dynamic in the narrowbody market, and the charges that have been taken on 78 and 73 and T-7 and tanker and MQ-25, why was this the right time to put $0.5 billion into Wisk? Dave Calhoun : Ron, I appreciate the question. This is definitely the right time to put $0.5 billion into Wisk. Number one, it\u2019s a very innovative product and a very innovative product team. I didn\u2019t create it. Our partners did at Kitty Hawk. I couldn\u2019t be prouder of the work they\u2019re doing. The world wants autonomy and the world wants electric. And this is going to be our application of those two technologies and to put it into real service by way of certification. So, everything about this program we like, technically innovative, and it will serve a niche we don\u2019t serve today. And that\u2019s really not necessarily why you do it if you don\u2019t think there\u2019s a long-term avenue for both autonomy and electric and a lot to learn in the process. So, again, I view this as a high priority. It does not compete for the discussion we just had with respect to the next large commercial airplane by way of financial resources. We\u2019ll have plenty of financial resources and wherewithal to be able to do both and then some. But I am enthusiastic about our Wisk investment in the airplane and the experience to date. It\u2019s incredibly innovative. Brian West : And Ron, one thing to note. So, we\u2019ve made this commitment to the investors, but that cash is going to happen over time. And it\u2019s capped in any given quarter. So, we\u2019re not really going to see it disrupt anything in the near term. Ron Epstein : Got it. Got it. And Dave, do you see the autonomous technology that\u2019s being developed there potentially with an application on one of your larger products? Dave Calhoun : There\u2019s a lot to be learned and applied, yes. Operator : Next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Doug Harned : Dave, you\u2019ve talked a lot about China and how important it is from the demand side. But, if you look at the other side of this, you\u2019ve got a lot of content in China, like the Tianjin Composite Center structures from SAMC. Given the heavy border restrictions and lockdowns there, aside from the political things that keep getting talked about, how are you managing that part of your supply chain and any potential risks there? Dave Calhoun : Yes. I don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t -- our team doesn\u2019t see any near-term or even medium-term risks there. And performance has been outstanding. I\u2019m never going to say never that big disruptions can occur. I don\u2019t -- if those kinds of disruptions occur, we got a lot of other issues we\u2019re going to have to contend with. So honestly, it\u2019s not the highest thing on our list. It performs quite well. We do have options. Admittedly, they take time to put into gear. But no, I think we\u2019re in an okay place there. Doug Harned : Can you highlight then where you do see the most -- the biggest constraints as you try and ramp up from a supply chain point of view? Dave Calhoun : Today, it\u2019s going to go back to the old engine questions and castings and forgings. That has already constrained our outlook. And I think as I mentioned the last time we were all together, I wish we could have done increase rates even faster than we had acknowledged, but it has always been a supply constraint that has done that. And it\u2019s mostly forgings and castings and mostly through our engine suppliers. So, that is what it is. I do think they are under control and being managed very effectively and that the supply side of this is that everybody has put their cushions in place to be able to take care of it. And then the only other medium term, I haven\u2019t been asked, maybe I will, I won\u2019t call it short term, but medium-term question, of course, is titanium. And as long as the geopolitical situation stays tame, no problem. If it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019re protected for quite a while, but not forever. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to Rob Spingarn with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Rob Spingarn : Dave, I wanted to go with a high-level question here now that you\u2019ve been in the seat for a while, recognizing that you\u2019ve spent most of this time putting out fires. But when we discuss the Boeing investment thesis after a decade of fairly extreme swings in performance, we\u2019re often asked, particularly by investors that are returning to the story after an absence, how the culture is changing at Boeing. So, how should investors think of you and your team as agents of change? And in what ways are you improving the culture of Boeing? Dave Calhoun : Yes. I mean, that\u2019s the million-dollar question, and I appreciate you asking it. And that\u2019s what we work on every day all day. I think investors, those same investors, what frustrates them is the unpredictability of our performance in light of those few instances that caused severe pressure on our company. And I will be the first to admit that they were not events caused by the outside world, but unfortunately, missteps inside. So, we\u2019re doing, I think, what they would want us to do. Our culture is focused on getting as close to our work as we possibly can from the very top of the Company through the engineering ranks all the way down through all the support functions that ultimately have to help mechanics on the line stay disciplined, create standard work that\u2019s predictable, repeatable, et cetera, safety and quality systems that are reinculcated in every way I can think of into every nook and cranny of the Company. And that is literally what we have been working on. So, I appreciate the question. I think we\u2019re getting much better. In fact, we\u2019re getting really good at it. And I think someday, we\u2019ll all point to it as a real advantage for The Boeing Company. But I know where we\u2019re coming from. And you do, too. Again, I do appreciate the Company. Sometimes, our vision and our priorities look boring to people. But when you stop and think of where we came from, I\u2019m proud of this team for rallying around exactly that. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead. Peter Arment : Hey Dave, maybe just to put a finer point on China MAX kind of deliveries resuming. You sound pretty confident that this could be a first quarter event. So, what do we specifically need to see from the Chinese regulator? It sounds like they\u2019re doing some test flights over there already. What should we be looking for? Thanks. Dave Calhoun : Yes. Thank you. Yes. It\u2019s again, I don\u2019t think this is necessarily in the geopolitical realm as much as it is in the needs of the customers and operations inside of China. What I will say is it has been perfectly predictable and methodical way in which they\u2019ve returned their fleet to service. They went through the cert process. They reauthorized the airplane to fly. The airlines are warming up the airplanes they already have. As you said, they\u2019re taking test flights in a very methodical, intelligent way. And they are beginning to notify us around when they intend to bring it into revenue service. That all has to happen with the airplanes they own. And then deliveries, in my view, will commence. And it is quiet, methodical and as effective way as it has been to date. There\u2019s nothing that we\u2019re involved in that would suggest otherwise. So anyway, I do feel confident only because of every tea leave I\u2019ve been able to watch here. And they\u2019re following through on, frankly, every commitment they\u2019ve made. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Kristine Liwag : Brian, thank you for providing the puts and takes and free cash flow for 2022. But could you quantify some of these pieces for the year and the key variables they depend on? I mean, ultimately, the questions I\u2019m getting is, is 2022 free cash flow a smidge over zero, or is it closer to something like $5 billion? Brian West : Yes. It\u2019s not a smidge over zero. I promise you that. And we\u2019re not going to be as descriptive as you might want. However, as we begin to deliver on these milestones and we start to be able to have the volume improvement from the 737, 787, we know we are going to have accelerated cash flows. As I mentioned, first quarter, we know it\u2019s going to be usage, but we do expect that there will be a relatively sharp acceleration in the back half of the year as we begin to liquidate this inventory. And then as we exit the year, we\u2019re going to be moving to a much more normalized state and then have a meaningful acceleration of cash flow in 2023. And again, what number of billions, too close to call, but it\u2019s more than zero, I promise you. Matt Welch : Operator, we have time for one last call or one last question. Operator : Certainly. And that will be from Ken Herbert with RBC. Please go ahead. Ken Herbert : I just wanted to see if we could put a finer point on the 787 and where you are with production today and the inventory drawdown. It looks like you\u2019re producing at a lower rate, perhaps one or lower a month than the two you were coming out of the third quarter. And obviously, the uptick to five sounds maybe a little more cautious than before. Can you just comment on build rates on the 87? And then, what the free cash guide implies in terms of the inventory reduction this year? Dave Calhoun : Let me just start with the rate. There\u2019s not going to be a finer point other than to reemphasize our priorities, which is we don\u2019t like carrying a bunch of inventory. That\u2019s for sure. We will run our rate as low as we can while we burn our inventory as fast as we can I think is the way to think about it. And then, as the order books fill up and the market gets very active, and I happen to believe it will, then we\u2019re going to sort of monitor production rates to make sure we stay ahead of that delivery cycle. So, again, I can\u2019t give you a finer point on exactly when and how. I will suggest we have a clear priority, which is to burn down that inventory first. Brian, anything you want to\u2026? Brian West : And there is an assumption that we\u2019re going to have some liquidation of inventory for sure on the 787. Stay tuned for the specifics. Operator : And that completes The Boeing Company\u2019s fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining. Dave Calhoun : Yes. I appreciate it, everyone.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analyst question-and-answer session are being broadcast live over the Internet. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Matt Welch, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Mr. Welch, please go ahead. Matt Welch : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Boeing's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I am Matt Welch, and with me today are Dave Calhoun, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian West, Boeing's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. Projections, estimates and goals we include in our discussion this morning involve risks, including those described in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures. Now I will turn the call over to Dave Calhoun. Dave Calhoun : Yes. Thanks, Matt. I'm going to make a few comments upfront and then turn it over to Brian for a more detailed look at our financials in the quarter. First, I need to acknowledge that on the 21st of March, Flight 5735 of our good customer, China Eastern, unfortunately crashed and took the lives of 132 passengers and crew. These things always take our breath away, and I want to extend our thoughts and prayers from the entire Boeing company, of course, to the families and friends of those passengers. Those are always rough moments. Our technical team is, in fact, supporting both the NTSB and the NTSB as it supports the CAAC, who is, of course, the lead investigator. Those are the only comments that I will make along the lines of the China Eastern accident but know that we are in the middle of that investigation. 2022, 1Q, some challenges presented themselves. Unexpectedly, Russia obviously is the big issue in the news. Inflation continues to take a hard run at pretty much everything we do. And COVID, unfortunately, didn't leave as soon as we would have liked. So the -- at least the first 45 days of the quarter were impacted more than we imagined. All that said, our focus and progress remains consistent with what we shared the last quarter. We still expect to accelerate our performance and the key financial metrics, namely cash flow because that is our key financial metric. That's what we've been focused on for a couple of years, and we will remain focused on. And we remain committed to the notion that we will have positive free cash flow over the course of 2022 and meaningful improvement in 2023. Everything we are doing is leading with safety, quality and ultimately driving stability for our airline customers. And we believe we're taking the right actions for the future. We have progressed on many key milestones. We'll comment on a few of them today. But we're focused on the 37 MAX and the 787 production and the return to service of those airplanes that we have built and stored in behalf of our airline customers. We feel good about all the progress we're making on that front. The commercial market recovery, I'm not going to expand significantly on that. You've heard from almost all of the US airline customers, many of the European customers. Traffic is returning, and it's returning in a pretty big way. Airplanes are being utilized at a fairly high rate. Domestic markets are the first to have recovered, and they're recovering robustly. Regional markets, second, and even long-haul traffic now is beginning to return. The only real exception in that demand scenario is China in light of their current COVID constraints. But we're hopeful and we expect that they'll come out of that and continue to expand their fleet. So that commercial market is very, very strong. And it's particularly strong for our line of airplanes, namely the MAX, 387 and the 777. And I don't want anyone to forget the 67 because it continues to play a very important role in the freighter world. I should comment on the conflict in Ukraine. I think I mentioned the last time we were together, we had 1,000 people in both the Ukraine in Kyiv and in Moscow. And those two teams work pretty closely together. So it's been a bit of a gut-wrenching and emotional period for all of The Boeing Company and our associates. I'm very proud of the work that we are doing to support our team in Kyiv. We've provided $1.5 million in humanitarian assistance, but also matched all of our employee donations to those people who are helping. And then most importantly, we have Boeing families in Poland and throughout the region who have willingly accepted and opened their homes to our displaced teammates. That's a big deal, and it's been an uplift for all of us to watch that happen. We're following the lead of the US government and strictly adhering to export controls and all the restrictions. We suspended maintenance and support for Russian customers. And in the spirit of doing the right thing, we had suspended titanium imports. Fortunately for us, we had a program of inventory built for quite some time ever since Crimea, such that we believe we are reasonably protected on that front. Next, I should comment on the 37 MAX specifically. It's only been a little over a year since that airplane was recertified and put back into service. We now have over 1 million flight hours. It is performing incredibly well at 99%-plus service reliability. Our customers are happy with it in almost every case that I'm aware of. They talk about the airplane exceeding the performance specs that we sold it on. So we feel very good about that, and we feel very good about the skyline and our ability to deliver on that. Brian will get into rate discussions in his piece on that one. But we still continue to think about this one airplane at a time, so that we can maintain that high in-service reliability rate. We're applying the same rigor to the 787, and we took a very important step just in the last week by submitting the cert paperwork and the plan to the FAA. We're proud of that work. We touched a lot of operations across our facilities, exacting spec with respect to the 87 \u2013 precisely. And that's all embedded in the cert paperwork that we presented to our FAA. And as always, we will let the FAA take the lead with respect to cert and ticketing, and we will work closely with them. They have been involved in this process from the very beginning. So there is no new news embedded in this. 777 family I'd like to make a comment with respect to the decision we made on the 777X and the extension of its introduction until 2025. I believe, we've made that decision out of a position of strength, not weakness. We've embedded every lesson that we've learned on the 37 MAX certs, and we continue to have two of those ahead of us. We've applied all the lessons from the 787 cert, which, of course we have just submitted and believe that we've got to give ourselves the time and freedom to get this right with the FAA and give everybody the time they need to give us the cert that will last, frankly, for decades and decades into the future. It also, by calling it out now, gives us an opportunity to create some capacity for our traditional metal wing 777 freighter, which right now is in incredibly high demand. So we will extend that airplane life and continue to meet that demand. And then finally, the 777-8 Freighter, which we introduced with Qatar, is a very big deal with respect to the long-term ramifications of the 777 family in the decades ahead. We're very proud of the 777 family in the post A380, 747 world. We think it stands on its own, and it will be one of the great contributors to shareowner value over the decades ahead. Boeing Global Services, I'm not going to get into a lot of detail other than to say, we're riding that wave of a recovery with respect to fleet utilization, pretty much everywhere in the world. And so that business has enjoyed that success and has been able to stay ahead of the supply chain constraints that some are feeling. So all things good on that front. And then on BDS, a messy quarter and we got hit where you might expect us to get hit in a supply constrained, still COVID-impacted and inflationary world. And then that is on a group of fixed-price development contracts that I think you're all aware of, where we had to recognize future costs on those program economics. And so we have taken a write-off on those programs, VC-25B, the T-7A and the MQ-25. Brian will talk to you a little bit more about this. VC-25B was, by far, the biggest part of that hit. You'll recall, it was a public negotiation that happened quite some time ago. We took some risks not knowing that COVID would arise and not knowing that an inflationary environment would take hold like it has. And both of those things have impacted us fairly severely. This will ultimately accrue to two airplanes where we will continue to do our work and deliver first-rate airplanes to our customer in the government. As we deliver today's numbers, know that we are increasing our investment. Safety and producibility, digital transformation, autonomy and sustainable aerospace are the keynotes with respect to where those investments are going. We feel good about where that's setting us up for the future. We're progressing on our development programs. Are we frustrated with the timing? You bet. But we're progressing. And everyone is getting their feet firmly planted on the ground, both us and our counterparty and the regulators around the world. And so I have to feel good about the progress that we're making collectively and that matters for the long term. Stability and predictability, it's coming along. It will matter in the years ahead. And above all else, our culture is built around safety, built around quality. And transparency is the word of the day with respect to how we interact with our counterparties everywhere in the world. Strong leadership team in place, I'll comment and also congratulate Leanne. Leanne has retired. She's given us over 30 years of service, never had a more diehard and more engaged leader in our company. So I want to congratulate her on that. As you know, she'll be with us until the end of the year and supporting transition activities. But also to congratulate Ted Colbert, who is a fantastic leader and proven himself in our services world and servicing. Half of his business is servicing the US military. So he is ready to go on Boeing Defense, and he'll do a fantastic job. And then Stephanie Pope in our Services business, it's a bit of an old hat. She was the CFO at our Services business when we stood it up. She did a lot of the hard work associated with that stand up, and we treasure her as an operator, all the right instincts, and look forward to her future leading the Services business. So we feel good about the talent transitions that have occurred. And then I'll call out before I turn it back to Brian, just the -- thanks to administrator Steve Dickson at the FAA. As many of you know, he has retired. He stood tall during a difficult moment for The Boeing Company and to the FAA and the recertification of the 737 MAX, amongst the other multitude of responsibilities that he's had. We respect the work that he did and ultimately, the courage that he provided in the face of what was otherwise difficult external circumstance. So congratulations to him. And then the acting administrator Billy Nolen, he can count on our full support as he now takes over. So I'm confident in the milestones that we've been meeting. And we've been focused, I think, on the right things and with respect to long-term shareowner value. That is what it's all about, and we intend to deliver on that prospect. So Brian, I'll turn it over to you. Brian West : Great. Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. 1Q certainly had a few challenges to navigate : the war in Ukraine, the updated regulatory requirements on our commercial airplane programs as well as a combination of COVID, supply chain constraints, inflation, impacting, in particular, the fixed price defense development program as Dave mentioned. Importantly, though, cash performance is on track with our expectations. The utilization in the quarter was in line with what I shared a few months ago. The trajectory throughout the rest of the year remains intact, and we continue to expect to generate positive free cash flow for the year. The business is resilient, and we're encouraged by the momentum we're seeing. We still think about this year in three parts. First, we anticipate reaching key delivery milestones. On the 87, we're on a path to restart deliveries in the near term. On the 37, we continue to work towards resuming MAX deliveries to Chinese customers. At the same time, we're resequencing our skyline to take advantage of strong customer demand for the MAX airplane and meet delivery objectives. Next, once we see progress on these programs, we anticipate improvement in our performance metrics, including deliveries, revenue, margin and cash flow. And finally, as we move through the remainder of the year, our financial performance will accelerate. And going forward, there is opportunity for our company to return to sustainable growth. This fall, we plan to host an Investor Day to share our more detailed expectations for the rest of the year and beyond. Before I get into the financials, I did want to make a few points on the current business environment on slide 3. I'll start with one of the stronger segments, freighters. The market remains quite robust with cargo traffic up 12% above 2019 levels in February largely driven by e-commerce. This continues to be one of the more reliable forms of transportation, and our lineup is perfectly positioned to take advantage of this growth for a very long time. The commercial pass-through market recovery expectations are largely unchanged from what I shared last quarter even as we saw some events that added near-term pressure, including reduced pass-through traffic in and around Russia. Global flight ops are at about 75% of 2019 levels as the global recovery is tempered by China and the impacts of the war in Ukraine. We still see overall passenger traffic returning to 2019 levels in the 2023 to 2024 time frame. Domestic traffic continued to lead at 78% of 2019 levels in February with China, the notable exception. Ex China, domestic traffic was 84% of the 2019 levels. US carriers are providing the best window into the recovery at this point. Our customers are seeing record booking volumes and very strong forward yields for late spring and summer to the point of being able to offset sharply higher fuel prices, and they're also highlighting the return of business travel. Beyond domestic routes, we're seeing encouraging signs from intra-regional traffic in both Europe and the Americas. International traffic continues to lag at 40% of the pre-pandemic levels, but we are seeing recovery in regional markets such as intra-Europe and US, Mexico, both progressing well with significant reopening now underway across many parts of Asia. Long-haul recovery will be led by the transatlantic market this summer as well as Middle East connectors. Time and again, the market has shown its resilience driven by the essential nature of moving both people and goods around the world. And in addition to Commercial Airplanes, the expanding market recovery directly benefits our Commercial Services business. In defense and space, we continue to see stable demand. The present FY 2023 budget request reflects the important role our products and services have in ensuring our national security, including significantly increased funding for the F-15EX and support for our other critical products and services that support national security. Outside of the US, we're seeing similar solid demand as governments prioritize security, defense technology and global cooperation given evolving threats. Our operations are well-positioned to maintain continuity despite the war in Ukraine, and we see limited impacts to our business. I'll cover the financial impacts a bit later. On the supply side, we are carefully managing supply chain constraints and working through issues as they arise to ensure the stability of our production system. We've experienced some disruption to our production, such as some supplier delays and resource availability, including the impacts of COVID. And we're actively working mitigation plans to ensure continuity. The markets we see -- we serve continue to be big. Our competitive position is strong. And we're actively addressing the supply chain. And all of this gives us confidence in the fundamentals of our business and the long-term outlook as we work hard to serve our customers. With that, let's turn to the financials on slide 4. First quarter revenue of $14 billion was down 8%, and the core operating loss in the quarter was negative $1.5 billion, resulting in a $2.75 core loss per share. Operating cash flow was a usage of $3.2 billion, in line with what we expected. These results were impacted by $1.3 billion of charges at BDS, which I will discuss in more detail in a minute. Due to the war in Ukraine and associated impacts to our business, we did record about $200 million in pre-tax charges in the quarter, related to certain asset impairments. And we also reduced the backlog by 86 units and roughly $5 billion. As we review business unit financials, I'll highlight some unique challenges that we're overcoming as we drive stability and position for the future. Now, let's move to Commercial Airplanes on slide 5. First quarter revenue was $4.2 billion, down slightly. It's primarily driven by the timing of wide-body deliveries, partially offset by higher 37 deliveries. Operating losses of $0.9 billion and the resulting negative margin rate reflect abnormal costs and period expenses, including charges for impacts of the war in Ukraine and higher R&D expense as we increase our investment in the business. Turning to the 87 program, as Dave mentioned, we've met a very important milestone and submitted the cert plan to the FAA. Deliveries remained paused, and we had 115 airplanes in inventory at the end of the quarter. Importantly, we've completed the rework, on the initial airplanes and are preparing them for delivery, including conducting our own check flights in advance. As always, we will work closely with the FAA on the remaining steps, and we'll follow their lead on timing of deliveries. As we stated last quarter, we're producing at very low-rates, and we'll continue to do so until deliveries resume, gradually returning to five airplanes per month overtime. Notably, we're currently rolling out conforming airplanes from the factory. We did not take additional charges on the 87 program in the quarter. We did record $312 million of abnormal costs in line with expectations. And we still anticipate a total of approximately $2 billion of abnormal with most being incurred by the end of 2023. Consistent with what we shared last quarter, cash margins on the 87 remain positive and are expected to improve significantly overtime. We see a long runway ahead for the 87 program based on a very healthy backlog of 405 airplanes and compelling operating economics for our customers. And we're well positioned to capture future demand as the wide-body market recovers. Moving on to the 37 program, we delivered 86 37 airplanes in the quarter, including 37 in March, a slight decrease from fourth quarter of last year, despite impacts of COVID, some supply chain delays and typical seasonality. Given some supply chain disruption and timing of taking airplanes out of storage, deliveries were slightly below our expectations and we ended the quarter with 320 MAX airplanes in inventory. However, we still anticipate delivering most of these airplanes by the end of 2023. The timing and pace of deliveries to Chinese customers and supply chain stability remain key factors to our delivery profile. We continue to make progress ramping our 37 [ph] production rate and are essentially at 31 airplanes per month. As we shared last quarter, 37 [ph] abnormal costs are largely behind us. The MAX customer consideration liability also continues to burn down as expected. On our development programs, we're doing everything we can to complete the certification of the MAX 7 and MAX 10 and ensure their respective first deliveries this year and next. We're working closely with the FAA on implementation of aircraft certification, safety and accountability Act Legislation and expect any necessary actions to be defined later this year. As always, we will follow the lead of regulator on the timing of certification. Moving on to the 777, 777X programs. We remain highly confident in this family of airplanes as Dave outlined. We launched the 777-8 freighter with an order from Qatar Airlines in January. And as a result, we increased the accounting quantity on the program to 400 airplanes. We continue to perform 777-9 Boeing flight test to retire technical risk with over 2,000 flight hours completed through the end of the first quarter. The airplane is performing well and our customers continue to see the value in the compelling economics and sustainability benefits this airplane offers. Based on an updated assessment of the time required to meet certification requirements, we now anticipate delivery of the first 777-9 airplane in 2025. Additionally, we're coordinating with the FAA to prioritize resources across our development programs. As we manage the company for cash flow, we're adjusting our 777-9 production rate, including a temporary pause due 2023. This move will minimize inventory, reduce the number of airplanes requiring change in corporation and avoid capitalizing costs on the balance sheet. Additionally, given the robust market for freighters, we're leveraging this production pause on the 777-9 to add 777 freighter aircraft in the 2023 to 2026 timeframe. We anticipate the 777-9 pause will result in approximately $1.5 billion of abnormal costs beginning in the second quarter of this year and continuing until production resumes. We believe this is the best allocation of resources and cash. Turning to overall demand at BCA. During the quarter, we booked 167 gross commercial airplane orders, including 134 orders for the 37 MAX. As of the end of the first quarter, we had nearly 4,200 airplanes in backlog valued at $291 billion. Let's now move to Defense, Space & Security on slide six. First quarter revenue was $5.5 billion, down 24% and operating margin was negative 17%. These results were primarily driven by lower volume and $1.3 billion in charges on fixed price development programs, including the VC-25B and the T-7A. On a normalized basis, adjusting for onetime items, revenue across our defense portfolio, including government services, was down 9%, half of which was the impact of COVID and supply chain constraints. The other half was from planned program transitions. The VC-25B program recorded a $660 million charge, primarily driven by higher supplier costs, higher cost to finalize technical requirements and schedule delays. The T-7A Red Hawk program recorded $367 million in charges primarily driven by ongoing supplier negotiations impacted by supply chain constraints, COVID and inflationary pressures. We continue to have high confidence in the long runway ahead for the T-7A program. Similar pressures impacted other fixed price development programs, though to a lesser extent. From a cash perspective, these charges will be incurred over the next several years. We received $5 billion in orders during the quarter, including an award for six MH-47G Block II Chinook rotorcraft for U.S. Army Special Operations, and the BDS backlog remains at $60 billion. Across the portfolio, we're focused on improving performance as we transition several development programs into production. And we're making progress, but have more work to do as we position ourselves to deliver for our customers. While we recognize charges on these key programs, we remain confident in demand for these future technologies and capabilities, and our Defense and Space portfolio is well positioned for growth. Now let's turn to Global Services results on Slide 7. The Global Services team had a great quarter, particularly on our parts and distribution business due to the strength of the portfolio and broad offerings. First quarter revenue was $4.3 billion, up 15%, and operating margin was 14.6%, in line with our expectations. Results were driven by higher commercial service volume and favorable mix. We received $3 billion in orders during the quarter, including a fuel saving digital solutions contracts for Etihad Airways 87 fleet and a contract for KC-135 horizontal stabilizers from the U.S. Air Force. The BGS backlog remains at $20 billion. With commercial services revenue now back to nearly 90% of pre-pandemic levels, our service business remains well positioned for growth as the commercial market recovers and the Defense business continues to see strong support. Now let's turn to Slide 8 and cover cash and debt. We ended the first quarter with strong liquidity comprised of $12.3 billion of cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet and access to $14.7 billion across our bank credit facilities, which remain undrawn. Our debt balance decreased slightly from the end of the last year to $57.7 billion driven by repayment of maturing debt. Our investment-grade credit rating is a priority. We remain committed to reducing debt levels. Now similar to what I shared last quarter, I'd like to review the key drivers of 2022 revenue and cash. In comparison to 2021, we still anticipate total company revenue to increase this year. The growth will be primarily driven by higher commercial airplane deliveries on the 37 and 87 programs and solid growth in our services business as the commercial market continues to improve. And while the overall demand outlook for the Defense business remains stable due to the revenue impacts of the charges we took in the first quarter, we're forecasting a modest decrease in revenue at BDS this year versus 2021. However, we expect 2023 to return to stable levels. On cash, we still expect to generate positive free cash flow this year. The key driver of improvement remains higher 37 and 87 delivery volume. As we described previously, the working capital benefit from delivering airplanes for inventory will be partially offset by a lower advances and progress payments balance. We still anticipate a burn down of our advance balance this year. The profile continues to be dynamic due to customer discussions and timing of deliveries. From a phasing standpoint, our first quarter cash utilization was in line with what we shared in January. We remain confident that our free cash flow will improve in the second quarter and will make meaningful -- and will meaningfully accelerate in the back half of the year as we achieve the key delivery milestones that I outlined. As we look beyond this year, we expect 2023 cash flow will be materially higher than 2022 and we look forward to sharing more details on our plan in the fall. To wrap-up, our performance is tied to several key items : commercial market recovery, return to delivery for the 87 and 37 MAX in China, successful execution and certification of development programs, and production system and delivery stability. We remain acutely focused on what we can control. Most notably, we continue to focus our efforts to stabilize our production system, including the supply chain and improve our delivery predictability. And while we saw improvements in some of this first quarter, we have more work to do. And we're keenly aware that these activities will be critical to our success and are prioritizing these resources accordingly. Beyond these execution priorities immediately in front of us, we continue to invest in our people, technology, manufacturing capabilities and strategic partnerships to ensure we're well positioned for future growth. There's no doubt that the business environment is evolving. That said, we're making good progress, driving productivity and cash flow, while addressing risks as they arise. And while we do all this, we're laser-focused on safety, quality and stability. We believe these are the right actions and resource calls. And we remain confident in the strength of our business now and in the future. With that, over to Dave for closing comments. Dave Calhoun : Yes. We believe we're on a real improvement track with respect to engineering and manufacturing of our products and ultimately, the predictability of our business with respect to our commercial customers. We also believe strongly in our defense product line and the prospects for defense orders and growth in the relatively near to medium term. So, that's it. I'll turn it over to questions. Let's go. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And that's from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Noah Poponak : Good morning everyone. Dave Calhoun : Yes, hi Noah. Noah Poponak : A lot of questions, but I guess the two most important things in the near term are when you can restart 787 deliveries and when you'll resume MAX deliveries to China. So, can you give us more specific detail on what the regulators and counterparties are still looking for? What specifically you need to do to satisfy their questions and process? And then I know you don't want to get into predicting timing on these, but you have guidance for cash flow for the year. So, just how are you thinking through what those deliveries need to look like to have that positive free cash? Dave Calhoun : Yes. So, why don't I grab that one? Brian can augment any way you like. Again, this is a tricky moment where I get into trouble if I predict any outcome with respect to FAA certification. What I can say because I do control it is the quality of the package that we've delivered to the FAA. And I also know that their fingerprints are all over it because they've been sort of side-by-side with us in this process. We've been getting guidance every step of the way. So, I feel very good about all of that. Our customers have been through these airplanes. And so I think we're in reasonably good shape to go through a normal order, and I do not expect this to get elongated in any significant way. And I believe our cash flow projections or confidence, if you will, with respect to the year are well suited and have enough room for the FAA to do its work and for us to answer questions in that process. So it's been a long, hard run, but I feel really good about where we are. And with respect to China, similarly, we've had no indications that there aren't going to be China deliveries in any way. As we know, we're certified to fly the airplanes. The COVID environment has put a really tough situation in play because our customers are not flying. They're down 70% in their domestic travel, and this is significant for them. So how long that goes on if it's measured in a couple of months, I still feel good about where we are with respect to deliveries. We derisked this year's delivery significantly, and we can derisk more. The market is creating 737 MAX. So I'm not concerned about our ability to derisk. I don't want to derisk because I still have faith that China can take the airplane. Anything, Brian? Brian West : Yes. Noah Poponak : Dave, the last quarter, you talked about collecting data as you rework 787s. And it sounded like you had to collect a lot of data, it took time then you had to iterate it with the FAA. Is the package you've sent them that you described as a package, is that now sort of binary they'll either accept that package or not, or does it still remain an iterative Q&A type of process? Dave Calhoun : Well, we believe based on all of our interactions with the FAA and our own engineering unit members and others that we have sufficient data to make our case and recertify or certify this airplane in accordance. So we have a reasonably high level of confidence in that, and I don't expect any significant sort of banter around that. But I can't be absolute about it. We're going to go through the process. I just know that there's been a lot of involvement on both sides and a lot of working together in this process and get into the package we've submitted. Noah Poponak : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And next, we'll go to David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss : Thanks. Good morning. Brian, I know you noted that you would expect free cash flow to improve here in the second quarter. I wanted to see if that meant positive or you still think you're negative? And how you're thinking about the capital structure from here? I think you've talked about in the past that you need $10 billion to run the business, you're down to $12 billion if you burn further cash in the quarter. I mean, are you willing to take on additional leverage at this point, or would you look to potentially an equity raise? Thanks. Brian West : Yes, I'll take the last one. We see no need as we think about both near-term and midterm any need for that type of event. We feel very comfortable with our liquidity position and the balance sheet. We know that as we get more progress on really accelerating cash flows, that will -- that derisking will change, and we'll talk about that later as we meet some of these milestones. But we don't see any need to tap lines, add debt or anything else of that nature as we stand here today. In terms of the cash flow for the year, look, 2Q will be better than 1Q. And it's probably pretty obvious, but -- and the second half will accelerate. So I'm not going to put a discrete number on 2Q. It will be better. But the full year, we will generate cash flow. And everything is pretty much lined up, as we talked about last quarter, puts and takes, but overall, confident with where we think we're going to land for the year. David Strauss : So is $10 billion still the right number that you need in terms of cash to run the business, or is it lower than that? Brian West : I think, recency effect, it seems like it's in that 10 to 12, but it's too hard to tell right now, given it's a dynamic world. We're very comfortable where we stand right now. And as we start to put points on the board with delivery and execution, all of that will be a rich discussion that we can't wait to have with you. David Strauss : All right. Thanks very much. Operator : And next, we go to Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead. Peter Arment : Yes. Good morning, Dave and Brian. Dave, I wonder if I could just come back to kind of Noah's questions on the 787. Just you have 115 aircraft in inventory, and it sounds like you now are producing aircraft off the line and conforming to your latest spec. What's left to be done within that 115? And like the other stored aircraft, when we think about MAX, should we think about most of these aircraft will be delivered through 2023, or does it stretch out beyond that? Thanks. Brian West : Yes. So I'll take that one. It is on the 115 in inventory in the 87. As we have described that abnormal cost, it's going to substantially be done by the end of 2023, which will also correspond with the liquidation of that inventory. So that -- nothing has really changed on that front. In fact, we probably feel a little bit more confident as we're starting to look at clean airplanes. On the 37 consistently, we've got 320 in inventory at the end of the quarter. We hate that it's that high. But the flip side of that is that, we'll be able to meet some pretty robust demand that's out there in the marketplace. And that, again, will likely liquidate over the course of between this year and next, and that has not changed. Operator : Our next question is from Rob Stallard with Vertical Research. Please, go ahead. Rob Stallard : Thanks, so much. Good morning. Dave Calhoun : Good morning, Rob. Rob Stallard : The question I have is on the 737 MAX rate. You mentioned you're pretty much at 31 a month here. What are your plans going forward? And what is your confidence that the supply chain could match any further rate increases, especially what's going on with your competitor? Thank you. Dave Calhoun : Yes. So we always think about this in two ways. One is that, that inventory opportunity I just described, and we've got to work on getting those delivered. And then, of course, the production rate that we're essentially at 31 a month. Our biggest job right now is to stabilize around that rate. The teams are working hard. They deal with supply constraints that pop up every now and then, but we got to be stable around 31 and then anything else is going to be a future decision that we're not prepared to take, because we just want to get confidence in what's right in front of us. The good news is that there's plenty of demand that we can fulfill. And while we're watching the supply chain very closely, we feel good about where that particular program stacks up. Rob Stallard : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman : Yeah. Thanks very much. Good morning. Just following up on 737, I think, Brian, you spoke last quarter about looking to deliver about 500 aircraft, and you talked about being on plan. So is that still your target for this year? And how does the kind of evolving situation in China affect that, if at all? And then second, on Rob's question on the production rate for 737. How does the MAX 10 certification question factor into that? Brian West : So we derisk China, just to put that one aside, as Dave mentioned. The first quarter deliveries were a little light versus what we expected. And we probably won't get quite all the way there in the calendar year count, but that's just timing. Like I said, we've got plenty of finished goods inventory. We've got the rate where we want it. So we may not quite get there. But again, the momentum month in, month out has gotten better. And we feel confident that if you don't quite get there this year, it's just going to be timing to the next, which we're perfectly comfortable with. And again, that's been, all factored into our cash flow updated look and still believe that we will be cash flow positive in the year. As it pertains to the -10, right now, it's -- all the energy and focus is on certification. And really that one won't disrupt our near-term projections. Seth Seifman : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr : Yes. Thanks so much. So on their call, General Dynamics, mentioned that their G700 is basically -- may have a certification slip, because of additional software validation that the FAA is now requiring, which was not anticipated when they started this process. And they mentioned kind of the MAX sort of indirectly as an issue. So are you seeing that the FAA is now basically stabilizing what they're acquiring, or are they stable and then they ask for even more data? And how does that sort of relate to your confidence that you will be able to certify the MAX 10 by year-end? Dave Calhoun : Yeah, let me take that one. It's a very tricky question. And I don't want to speak for our counterparty in any way. Part of our 777X move out into 2025 was to incorporate exactly whatever observations that you took account of to incorporate all the learnings we've had from our cert programs, the original MAX, the 87, now the -7 and then the -10. So we keep trying to incorporate all our learnings, and it is definitely a more rigorous process that we're all going through. Everything has to be completed. Every, I has to be dotted, and every T has to be crossed. And now we're all getting used to it. So on the subject of whether that's a mature process or not, boy, I hope so. And I believe we're all better off for it. I don't like all the difficulties we've had to go through to get here, but so far, so good. And I know, I think the FAA has enough, rigor in what they're doing. But with every next cert, I think we're all going to learn that it's just going to take a little longer. It's going to be a little more thorough than it's ever been. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you. Dave Calhoun : Yeah. Operator : Next, we'll go to Rob Spingarn with Melius. Please go ahead. Rob Spingarn : Hi, good morning. Just following with this theme, Dave, we've already covered this today. A lot of the problems and the issues Boeing's facing are on these development programs or this unusual recertification process that you're doing on 787 and had to do on the MAX. Is the common denominator here, the FAA, or is it engineers? Do you have enough engineering resources? Brian mentioned allocating resources with the FAA. So is there a shortfall there? And how do you solve it? Dave Calhoun : Yes. I don't -- I've never seen this, and I have yet to run into an issue where we have not been resourced adequately on the programs. This is always boiled down to the time lines, and we go through these time lines every week. So the time lines have always been impacted by the rigor of the discussion between ourselves and our counterparty, the FAA on what's needed, what data is required, what's needed to demonstrate a certain point or to write fully the development assurance program. A lot of writing, a lot of documentation, very thorough, et cetera. It has not been about whether we've had enough engineers to do the development work or to -- or even to write the technical work. So more focus, more resources on programs is always helpful. But that's not been the constraint so far, and I don't expect it to be the constraint. I think our push out on the 777X with respect to the reallocation of resources, frankly, the biggest beneficiary of that is going to be the traditional metal wing, 777 and our ability to just run some more airplanes through that -- through the line in the midst of the demand that we're seeing. So on the reallocation question, that's where I see the benefit the most. We have to really see it on the cert programs themselves. Rob Spingarn : And if the MAX 10 slips beyond year-end and then you need the new flight crew alerting system, do you assume you'll get the waiver, or does this put the program at risk? I mean, if you can't get the 10 done without substantial more cost and looking at the order book, do you just leave that market for next airplane? Dave Calhoun : It's a great question. I hope I never get there. First and foremost, with respect to the original legislation, there was a lengthy window put in there based on historic certification timetables that would have provided for the seven and 10 easily. So these things have taken longer. The intent of that legislation was never to stop the derivative product line with respect to the MAX. So I believe our chances are good with respect to getting legislative relief. It doesn't mean we'll get them. And if we don't, it's a problem. On the other hand, demand for the MAX is substantial. And we have other airplanes and substitution that we could implement. And that decision has to get made sometime between now and the end of the year. Don't feel the need to do it now. I'm still pretty focused and our company is pretty focused on getting the -10 certified and in our customers' hands. They love everything about the airplane. That's doing incredibly well on the development program itself. So it's a good question. It's the right question, and we have to make sure our decisioning and thought process is ahead of where we think things end up at the end of the year. Rob Spingarn : Thank you. Dave Calhoun : Yes. Operator : And next, we'll go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ron Epstein : Yes. Good morning, guys. Back to the engineering question. Dave, when you sit back and you look at the company, do you -- I mean, do you have to restructure the engineering organization? I mean, really what's going on there? I mean, I struggle to think of a program that you guys aren't or haven't taken a charge on. And the vast number of the issues that you've had compared to some of your peer companies, both in either defense or commercial, it just seems like it's just been more troublesome for Boeing than some of your peers. And why is that the case? And what can you do to prevent that for future programs because future programs are going to have to happen. Dave Calhoun : Yes. So Ron, let me start by hoping that you haven't missed the restructuring of our engineering organization. We -- it's the first thing I did. It wasn't to address the issue you're talking about because I don't attribute all of our issues and specific instances and write-offs to engineering shortfalls. I don't -- I never have. But we did restructure engineering to, in effect, reinforce, build our safety management system in a different way with a different outlet so that people could voice concerns and call out engineering disciplines as appropriate. And it's worked, and it's been fantastic. And we've benefited from the ideas that have moved from the BDS to BCA, et cetera, et cetera. So we've been beneficiaries of what I think is a significant restructuring. We are hiring. We are doing, I think, a terrific job on that front. It is not easy. So I don't want anybody to think otherwise, but we have had a pretty successful hiring program, a pretty successful retention program on that front. But when we look at the write-offs that we've taken, let's say, this quarter, for instance, these fixed price development contracts that we took were taken before COVID existed and before this inflationary spiral came ripping down the road. So I don't attribute that to engineering shortfalls. And I don't attribute our certification issues and time lines to engineering shortfalls in any way. Our airplanes are flying incredibly well. Our 777X made it to Dubai, made it to Singapore and a gangbuster show. Everyone loved it. It's flying beautifully. It's meeting all of the requirements that we laid out. But the process of discovery between ourselves and our certification or our regulators around the world, it's different. It's changed. It's got to be thorough, and it's got to be good. So I don't accept the premise entirely that you put forward in the question. But please don't miss the fact that we have restructured and we are building our engineering function. I've always believed it's strong. I believe it's going to be even stronger. Ron Epstein : Okay. Operator : Our next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good morning, Dave and Brian. Thanks so much. Dave, you've alluded to MAX demand being good several times on this call, but also, you're not at 31 a month on the delivery rate there yet. So how could we think about going above 31 a month? It doesn't seem like you need the MAX 10 start to get above it, but do you need China to get above it, or do we stabilize at that level? Brian West : We don't need the 10. Believe me, the demand is there. And we delivered 37 MAXs last month in the month of March, and we're working our way towards momentum. So we feel pretty good that the trick for us is to stay focused on that production rate of 31 a month and make it stable and dependable and reliable. We de-risked the China piece. The -10 isn't contemplated in the near-term. So if we just execute at that level, we feel pretty good. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay. Cool. And then on commercial profitability, if we exclude the abnormal costs, there was still a loss. So how do we think about that program getting to breakeven and how 787 is maybe impacting it? Brian West : I would say, the 87 from a cash margin standpoint, they're still positive. They're down, obviously. But the future, it's going to get significantly better once the delivery start rolling. So i.e., that program is perfectly fine. And of course, the 37 is strong. We might have some mix in there around any given quarter. And of course, we had a couple of charges related to abnormal period costs and things like Ukraine, but those are kind of isolated. I think going forward, as we get deliveries going on 3787, those cash margins will accrue and accrete. And then the 87, some of the moves we're making, we feel pretty good about getting the metaling freighter going to fill the factory and satisfies demand. So overall, we think that BCA margins are headed in the right direction, and they're going to follow deliveries. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Doug Harned : Good morning. Thank you. Dave Calhoun : Hi, Doug. Doug Harned : I want to switch over to defense. David, as you said, the defense programs that you all are talking about this quarter, they were a bit of fixed price development contracts. And some were very aggressive even to the point of known below-cost bids as investments. And some of those problems, we're now seeing them coming home. So I mean, these were done well before you came on as CEO, but how do you look at the BDS bidding process going forward? And then also are the cost overruns on these programs completely due to higher input costs, or are there other execution issues at work here? Dave Calhoun : Yeah. So it's a great question, Doug. Yeah, I will have a very different philosophy with respect to fixed price development. And so I don't expect, and I hope never to contribute to that issue. But we are where we are. And let me also say, because I was on the Board at the time the T-7 and MQ-25 programs were taken, and yes, they were written off the day we took them knowing that we would be investing a fair amount of our own money in the future of those airfreight. I will tell you this. I think those are going to be really good bet even though the development costs are more than we had anticipated. When we get through them all and deliver on those contracts, those airplanes don't go away. There are futures attached to them and big programs in our view that involve many, many airplanes. And I think both airplanes are going to be very successful in supporting our military. So the futures with respect to real airplanes making real margins and contributing to The Boeing Company, I still believe strongly in. And then I'll just -- as I think I said earlier in my CNBC interview, Air Force One, I'm just going to call a very unique moment, a very unique negotiation, a very unique set of risks that Boeing probably shouldn't have taken. But we are where we are, and we're going to deliver great airplanes. And we're going to recognize the costs associated with it. With respect to inputs, yes, it's predominantly COVID related inefficiency because I'll remind us in the defense world, when a COVID line goes down or a group of workers steps out, we don't have a whole bunch of cleared people to step into their shoes. So it has always been a tougher implication. And for VC-25B, where the clearances are ultra high, it's really tough. So we just got whacked in a number of different areas. Where you started is a great question and one that I hope I never contribute to. Doug Harned : Very good. Thank you. Dave Calhoun : Thanks. Matt Welch : John, we have time for one more question. Operator : And that will come from Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning. Dave, also to a high-level one. When you first signed on, you had, I think, seven performance goals. And after today, I think maybe you'll be able to achieve a couple of them. And so I'm just trying to understand how we should measure your, the firm's performance. And also, it begs the question, is Boeing realistic in its expectations of its own performance? And have you recalibrated some more realistic -- things go bad. So maybe we should calibrate more margin into our measures of success. Dave Calhoun : Well, that's a -- it's a big question for the last one, but I'm very willing to take it on. You know the circumstance under, which I came into the role. It all happened in a period of weeks, and I simply took on the objectives that had been set program by program inside the business. And I discussed with the Board that I would not in any way, shape or form hold that compensation program hostage to what I do with The Boeing Company. I would simply do what's right. I would simply pursue the programs, operate them the way I think they should be. If there are improvement opportunities that would compromise my ability to make one of those deliveries then that's what I would do. So -- and that's what I've been doing. And I have been resetting expectations every step of the way the best I can. We have certain things in the world that we can't predict that frustrates everyone. I get it. But what we do is we just keep trying to improve and get better and get back to a normalized rate of cash flow for you, cash flow for us. And I'm highly confident in our ability to do that, and I'm highly confident in the Boeing people to do it. So I don't want to recalibrate expectations other than timing questions and real-world stuff around how regulators approach certification. These are real. They take a little longer than they used to. They're a little more thorough than they used to. Boeing is better for it in the long run. And every one of these programs lasts for decades and decades, every one of them. And that's how I think about everything I do inside The Boeing Company. I think my Board understands it, and I trust that they will evaluate me on that basis whether or not compensation schemes are perfectly aligned. Myles Walton : Thanks for taking the question, Dave. Dave Calhoun : Thanks. Matt Welch : And that concludes our first quarter 2022 earnings call.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst question-and-answer session are being broadcast live over the Internet. [Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Matt Welch, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Mr. Welch, please go ahead. Matt Welch : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Boeing's second quarter 2022 earnings call. I am Matt Welch and with me today are Dave Calhoun, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian West, Boeing's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And as a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. Projections, estimates and goals we include in our discussions this morning involve risks, including those described in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation. [Technical Difficulty] Operator : And this is John with AT&T, please continue. David Calhoun : Start over? Okay. Sorry, we were muted. It's good to be with all of you. Thanks, Matt, for the intro. I want to start my brief comments upfront with just a revisit at the Farnborough Air Show a little over a week ago. It was important for us. It was an emotional outcoming for our company and our people. We always look a little better when we are standing next to our products and the flight teams who are operating them. It was great to see, and I think everyone witnessed the 777X in flight, which was more than magnificent, the -10 also in flight and our investment in Wisk and its product in the important eVTOL market. We met with our customers. We met with suppliers, partners, the usual, except it didn't feel like the usual because it had been a while. We're proud of the orders that we collected over the course of that week, over 200 orders and commitments. And importantly, it covered the whole line, the 737 MAX, our 87 and the 777X. And it shows the extent to which our airlines are already -- our airline customers are already anticipating fleet renewal projects and their willingness to bet forward on that prospect. Needless to say, they're all as busy as they can be trying to get their own fleets up and running and the supply constraints they face dealt with. Looking at the quarter, a lot of things good happened over the quarter. We are on the verge of returning to the 87 delivery process. I won't give a date. I never have. That's up to the FAA. But we've been working closely with our customers and the regulator on those final steps. We're proud of our team. We're proud for the discipline and the detailed work they applied over this long course. And it will be worth it. In the end, we'll have a predictable and high-quality line, and our customers will be pleased with the products. And a reminder to everyone that this 87 fleet that's out there has been working harder than it's ever worked. And it's been performing incredibly well. Turning to the MAX. Again, one airplane at a time, the fleet is performing incredibly well, oftentimes exceeding the specification and expectations our customers had when they originally placed their orders. And we continue to work hard on predictability of the delivery chain. And we're focused mostly on the engine supply lines and then those second-tier constraints that those engine suppliers are facing. And I think we've made an awful lot of progress on that front. Brian will give you sort of our best guess on how this year turns out with respect to those deliveries. But it is -- it's now, I think, based on a far better knowledge of what those supply constraints are and commitments from our supply side engine suppliers. In BDS, I don't want to skip over the Starliner. It was important. It was an emotional up for all of us at Boeing to get back on track. We had a wet dress for the space launch system rocket, the biggest rocket yet. We're looking forward to that launch. So we had a good sort of engineering coming out with respect to those achievements. And yes, we're still working through some of the challenging macro environment issues, especially with respect to our fixed price development contracts. And Brian will also walk you through that. And then finally, on the services side, like pretty much everyone that's been reporting, it is coming back, and it's coming back in a rapid way. Our commercial service business was up 30%. It carries strong margins with it. And so it's a big and important contributor to our overall cash flow story. And again, the result of all of this work, a big step forward with respect to stability. We did debt to cash flow -- operating cash flow positive. So that puts us a little bit ahead of our internal plan, and we feel good about that. And we are still committed to be cash flow positive for the calendar year 2022. It's underpinned by a very strong commercial market. I think you all know that. Everyone has spoken to it. A lot of supply constraints out there with respect to the operators of our airplanes, the airlines and what they've got to do to get the fleets running efficiently and build their capacity where it needs to be. But they are out there in the market trying to rebuild their fleets for the future and to meet that significant demand. And so far, we have not seen any drawback on that demand. While we understand the sort of recession fears that are growing out there so far, it has not impacted the aviation industry or our customers. So mostly what we're focused on, and I don't think it will surprise anyone, and I think I've heard it in most of my peers' reports is the supply chain, stabilizing it, making sure that it's predictable and consistent. And for us, in particular, with respect to the commercial side of our business, it relates to engine production, engine availability so that we can predictably deliver airplanes to our customers. We think we've made an awful lot of progress on that front. I know you've heard directly from the engine suppliers. They are making progress, and we've adjusted all of our delivery rate expectations at least in the near term to satisfy those constraints. A comment quickly on regulatory and geopolitical. I'll start with geopolitical, China. The good news is that because of the strong demand in the marketplace, we've been able to manage our risk going forward with respect to the airplanes that we have built and are awaiting delivery. We intend to stand by our Chinese airlines, stand by the CAAC and get those airplanes back. But the timing, which has been pushed and deferred in light of some of the COVID management issues in China and some of that geopolitical overhang, we can suffer our way through that and will. And it should not impact the cash flow positive posture that we've taken for the year. So it's a little easier to manage for us. It's no less important, and we will continue to encourage our administration to work as closely as they can with the Chinese to reopen the trade card or with respect to aviation, a relationship we've enjoyed for over 50 years. And we'll continue to support our customers. Medium and long term, it does represent the difference between commercial aerospace leadership or not, given the size and scale of the China market. And then on the regulatory front, we are working constructively with the FAA. We have our heads down. We're working towards certification by year-end on the -7 and the -10. And we believe what we're working on is, in fact, the safe option with respect to all options in the narrow-body space. And so we're going to just keep plugging away. And anyway, that's enough said. As we navigate through this environment, stability is the watch word for all of us. We want to be predictable. We think that will differentiate us. And that's why we've got -- we're focused on it. We continue to increase our investment in research programs, the readiness program with respect to the next big commercial airplane, all the digital modeling tools that are required to be ready for that, we continue to invest aggressively in. And we continue to enhance those underlying digital technologies that we will bring ultimately to the services market as well. Safety, quality, transparency, these are values, and this is what we remain focused on. So before I turn it over to Brian, the MAX, it's on track. And it's performing for customers, in many cases, exceeding expectations. We think we're through the most difficult parts of COVID-19. Starliner, a pivotal and emotional test for The Boeing Company, and we feel good about it, and we're ready for the crewed flight. Global Services, on its way back in a big way. We feel terrific about their progress. And now we are at the detailed moment to get ready for 787 deliveries, the moment we've been waiting for. And we look and feel as though we're on the verge of doing so. So we've taken a long view. We continue to take a long view. And we do believe we're in the middle of a turnaround, and it's beginning to show itself. So with that, I'll end my opening comments and turn it over to Brian. Brian West : Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. This was an important quarter. We made good progress on key programs and a pretty dynamic macro environment affected by inflation, labor availability and supply chain constraints, all of which impacted both us and the industry. Despite these challenges, we improved our quarter-over-quarter cash performance and importantly, generated positive operating cash flow. Cash was driven by higher commercial delivery volume as well as order activity and advance payment timing. This keeps us on track to generate positive free cash flow for the year and higher cash flows in 2023. We still think about our performance in 3 parts and remain confident about the trajectory. First, as Dave mentioned, we made progress on key milestones. We're nearing a return for the 87 and are preparing airplanes for delivery. We continue to focus on 37 production stability of 31 MAXes per month. And we've derisked China from our near-term delivery profile. Next, as we see continued progress on these programs, we anticipate improvement in our performance metrics, including deliveries, revenue, margin and cash flow in the back half of the year. We also expect cash flow benefits from order activity and favorable receipt timing over the next 2 quarters. Finally, our financial performance should start to accelerate into 2023. Going forward, there is a significant opportunity for our company to return to sustainable growth. And we look forward to sharing our plans at our Investor Day on November 1 and 2. Before getting into the financials, I want to make a few points on the current business environment on Slide 3. Demand for commercial airplanes is strong, especially in the freighter market. We've seen cargo traffic increase from 2019 levels largely driven by e-commerce and the efficiency of air freight. With more than 90% share of the freighter market, our lineup is well positioned to capture continued growth. On the passenger side, traffic has recovered significantly but is still well below where it's been historically relative to global GDP. As airlines are currently in the middle of the summer high season, operational and supply constraints are becoming the pacing item for air traffic growth in the markets leading the recovery. That said, the commercial traffic recovery is accelerating. And passenger traffic has reached its highest point since 2019 in both North America and Europe. Domestic traffic remained relatively stable at 77% of 2019 levels as of May. While China still lags significantly, we saw some improvements in flight operations in June as travel restrictions lifted. Excluding China, domestic traffic was over 90% of 2019 levels. International traffic is gaining momentum at 64% of 2019, up from just 48% in March, especially in regional markets such as intra-Europe, Transatlantic and U.S.-Mexico as well as notable improvements via the Middle East and in some parts of Asia. Overall, our commercial passenger market recovery expectations are in line with what we've shared previously. We still see overall passenger traffic returning to 2019 levels in the 2023 to 2024 time frame. Taking all of this into consideration, we recently released our 2022 commercial market outlook, which forecasts a total addressable market valued at more than $3.3 trillion over the next decade and demand for nearly 20,000 airplanes. The forecast closely aligns to what we laid out last year and reflects the market's continued recovery. More specifically, we anticipate demand for more than 14,000 narrow-bodies or over 120 per month on average over the next 10 years. From a 20-year perspective, we project demand for more than 41,000 new airplanes, including 940 dedicated freighters. We are very confident in our product lineup, which is well suited to capture this long-term demand. And we feel very good about last week with over 200 orders and commitments at Farnborough. We appreciate the trust and confidence our customers are placing in us. Our services business also continues to benefit from growing commercial fleet and strong cargo markets with several Boeing converted freighter and materials management agreements recently announced. Over the next 10 years, we see a $3.3 trillion service market that aligns well with our broad customer-focused portfolio of offerings. In Defense and Space, we see solid long-term markets, both domestically and internationally. In the United States, there is support for increased defense spending in Congress to meet the challenges of today. Internationally, many of our fellow NATO members, partners and allies have announced plans for increased spending on national defense, and we look forward to more specifics around these priorities. Turning to the supply chain. We continue to experience real constraints. We're taking action to mitigate risk in a number of areas, including engines, raw materials and semiconductors. To stabilize production and support our supply chain, we're increasing our on-site presence at suppliers, creating teams of experts to address industry-wide shortages, utilizing internal fabrication for search capacity and managing inventory safety stock levels and growing where needed. With that backdrop, let's turn to financials on Slide 4. Second quarter revenue of $16.7 billion declined 2%, and we generated $0.5 billion of core operating earnings. After accounting for interest expense and taxes, we had a core loss per share of $0.37. Operating cash flow was positive $0.1 billion, in line with our expectations and an improvement from the same period last year. Let's move to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. Second quarter revenue was $6.2 billion, up 3% primarily driven by higher 37 deliveries, partially offset by lower 87 deliveries. Operating losses of $0.2 billion and the resulting negative margin rate reflect abnormal costs and period expenses, including higher R&D expense as we continue to invest in the business. On the 87 program, we're very close to resuming deliveries. We're readying airplanes together with our customers and have completed flight checks on the initial airplanes. As always, we will follow the lead of the FAA on the specific timing. We have 120 airplanes in inventory and are making progress completing the necessary rework to prepare them for delivery. As stated last quarter, we're producing at very low rates and we'll continue to do so until deliveries resume, gradually returning to 5 airplanes per month over time. Similar to the 37 program, the supply chain remains a key watch item for 87 production and deliveries. We recorded $283 million of 87 abnormal costs in line with expectations, and we still anticipate a total of about $2 billion with most being incurred by the end of 2023. These costs are driven by rework and production rates below 5 per month. It is important to keep in mind that cash margins on the 87 remain positive and are expected to improve significantly over time. However, as we deliver the first few 87 airplanes, you may see some variability in cash payments as we compensate customers for delays. The 87 continues to be the most utilized wide-body airplane due to its operational efficiency and flexibility. With over 400 airplanes in backlog, recent orders and commitments announced at Farnborough and additional demand as the commercial market recovers, we see a strong future for the 87 program. Moving on to the 37 program. We've delivered 189 airplanes year-to-date, below our original expectations due to 3 things : supply chain disruptions, flow time of taking airplanes out of storage and timing of deliveries to Chinese customers. We don't anticipate making up those deliveries in the back half of the year, and we'll continue to experience monthly variability, including a light month in July. We now expect delivery to be closer to the low 400s for 2022, short of what we discussed earlier this year as we drive stability and predictability. We ended the quarter with 290 MAX airplanes in inventory, of which roughly half are designated for customers in China. Given this uncertainty with our customers in China, we now expect more deliveries of airplanes from inventory to shift into 2024. Due to overall progress on MAX production, we did not book abnormal costs in the quarter. Additionally, we've reached agreement on over 95% of our MAX customer consideration liability. Shifting to the 777-9 program, our status is largely unchanged from what we shared last quarter. We still anticipate delivery of the first 777-9 airplane in 2025 and continue to coordinate with the FAA to prioritize resources across our development programs. We booked $102 million of 777 abnormal costs in the second quarter, in line with our expectations. And we still expect to record $1.5 billion of these costs through 2023 while 777-9 production remains paused. Turning to overall demand at BCA. During the quarter, we booked 184 commercial airplane orders, including 169 orders for the 737 MAX. At the end of the second quarter, we had over 4,200 airplanes in backlog valued at $297 billion. Let's now move on to Defense, Space & Security on Slide 6. Second quarter revenue was $6.2 billion, down 10% driven by lower volume and operational performance. Operating margin was 1.1% driven by approximately $400 million of charges on fixed-price development programs, most notably $147 million on MQ-25 and $93 million on commercial crew. This total also includes relatively small cost growth on the T-7A tanker and VC-25B, with no one program impacted by more than about $50 million. And the drivers were largely supply chain impact and inflation. All of this will be outlined in the Q. We also saw these same pressures across a few of the mature programs. While this performance was disappointing, we're making progress narrowing our development risk profile and remain confident over the long term. We received $2 billion in orders during the quarter, and BDS backlog was $55 billion. Additionally, the Chinook helicopter has been selected to bring heavy lift capability to the German military. We also achieved important milestones across the portfolio. NASA's space launch system completed a wet dress rehearsal, and the KC-46A tanker is now certified to refuel 97% of the military's air refuelable fleet. Let's now turn to Global Services results on Slide 7. The Global Services team celebrated its fifth anniversary this month and continues to perform well, especially in our parts and commercial training businesses. We're encouraged by the overall momentum. Second quarter revenue was $4.3 billion, up 6%, and operating margin was 16.9%. Results were driven by higher commercial services volume now nearly back to pre-pandemic levels and favorable mix. We also discontinued an engine distribution agreement in the quarter, which will impact our government service revenue profile going forward. We received $4 billion in orders during the quarter, including a contract for airlift flight dispatch services for the U.S. Air Force and a contract for avionics upgrades and cybersecurity support for the U.S. Navy. The BGS backlog is $19 billion. With strong support for our defense business and our highly valid commercial capabilities, our services business is poised for growth as the commercial market continues to recover. Now let's turn to Slide 8 to cover cash and debt. We ended the second quarter with strong liquidity comprised of $11.4 billion of cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet and access to $14.7 billion across our bank credit facilities, which remain undrawn. Our debt balance decreased slightly from the end of last quarter to $57.2 billion driven by repayment of maturing debt. Our investment-grade credit rating is a priority. And we remain committed to reducing debt levels through strong cash flow generation over time. As far as the rest of the year is concerned, we still anticipate 2022 total company revenue to be higher than last year primarily driven by higher commercial airplane deliveries on the 37 and 87 programs and growth in our services business, partially offset by lower defense revenue. Looking into 2023, we expect total company revenue growth from this year. BCA revenue is planned to be higher again on 37 and 87 deliveries. The demand outlook for the defense business remains steady, and we expect 2023 revenue to be better than 2022 as the business stabilizes. While we forecast BGS revenue to continue to grow next year, the growth rate will be tempered as we are nearly back to pre-pandemic levels. Turning to cash. We still expect to generate positive free cash flow this year. And the key drivers of second half improvement are higher 37 and 87 delivery volume, orders of advance payments, BDS receipts as well as favorable expenditure timing. As we look to 2023, we still expect cash flow will be higher than 2022, and we plan to share more details in November. Overall, our performance is tied to several key items : supply chain, production system and delivery stability, 37 and 87 delivery ramp, successful execution and certification of development programs, the commercial market recovery and the macroeconomic environment. While our progress depends on some factors beyond our control, we'll remain focused on our own performance and taking the right actions to drive stability and predictability and growth in the future. Taking a step back, this business and our team have come a long way over the last few years. We've seen our fair share of challenges and more hurdles still remain, but we're making progress. Demand for our product is strong. We're investing in our future, and our people are demonstrating exceptional commitment. With that, over to Dave for closing comments. David Calhoun : Yes, I'll keep them brief. We do believe we're in the middle of a momentum shift. We're all anxious and looking forward to delivery of our important airplane, the 787. Again, a reminder of how well it is performing in the field, and therefore, this delivery stream is critically important to our customers. So I'll leave it with that, and turn it over to Q&A. Matt Welch : Yes. Thanks, Dave. Before we start the Q&A, as I noted at the beginning of this call, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. Projections, estimates and goals we include in our discussions this morning involve risks, including those described in our SEC filings and in the disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. Please also refer to those materials for a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures. With that, as Dave said, we are now prepared to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Douglas Harned : When you look to this year and are looking at positive free cash flow for the year, it appears to really depend heavily on 2 things : the delivery restart of the 787 and the deliveries for the -- the ramp in deliveries for the MAX, which you're now saying you're going to get to the low 400s on this. If you look at those 2 parts, I mean, the 787, could you describe on that one, what gives you confidence now that you are so close? We've heard things before, optimism about a near restart. But this appears to be much more imminent now, I would guess, even though I know you're not going to try and predict the FAA's timing. So that's on the 787. And when you go over to the MAX, you've taken that number down into the low 400s. Can you talk about what you need out of that MAX profile to be on this positive cash flow time frame -- timing? And then what's the split between stored and new production? So a lot of things there but all in that positive free cash flow objective. David Calhoun : Yes, Doug. So why don't I start with 87 predictability? So like we said and like you acknowledged, we can't give you a date. But what we do track is all the work, any issues that the both teams have wrestled with over this time. And we are approaching closure on all of that. The number of documents, the number of analyses, the number of sign-offs has progressed at a fairly rapid rate here toward the close. So we see that documentation phase, which has been a lion's share of the phase, as closing relatively soon and then, therefore, the readiness of airplanes, which we have been working on at exactly the same moments simultaneously, has also been in shape to the point where customers are climbing around the airplanes and making certain that they are also ready for delivery and acceptance. So all that's coming together. And yes, the FAA remains in control, but there's just enough workload on sort of both fronts, readiness of the airplane and the documentation and certification requirement that we just feel like we're on the verge and are reasonably confident in that front. So that's why I feel different this time. And I will acknowledge, Doug, that we have felt like it was at near term in previous periods, but not with the same level of due diligence that I feel now. On the MAX delivery front, let me turn it over to Brian. He's got all the numbers. Brian West : Yes. So thanks, Doug. So the low 400s, we think the balance of the year, we'll satisfy the cash flow requirements to do their fair share of that total picture. So we think that's pretty well aligned. In terms of what's coming out of inventory versus the production line, our biggest objective on both fronts is to do both in a stable manner. And as you can see from our numbers, we've been doing about 10-ish out of storage this last quarter. We continue to get a little bit better on that front. So that's something that we're going to work hard on as we turn the corner in the second half of the year. So both are very important and doing both in a stable, predictable manner gets to that low 400 for the year. I will also indicate there's 3 really other important levers of the cash flows in the back half as a bridge from the first half. You mentioned the big 2, the 37 and the 87 deliveries. But there's also going to be favorability, timing from BDS receipts that will work to our favor. There'll be favorability of expense timing that will accrue to us. And there will be higher order activity in advance payments, particularly driven by the 777 adjustments that we made last quarter. Remember, we added metal wing capacity and the launch of the 777X freighter version. And all of those benefits are going to manifest themselves in helping the cash trajectory in the second half versus the first half. So those are the big pieces that we think about. Operator : Next, we'll go to Rob Spingarn with Melius Research. Robert Spingarn : Dave, you opened with the supply chain and the troubles there. And I have a specific supply chain question and something more general on rates. Given your engine background from GE, how do we solve this casting shortfall that's now plagued the industry twice in recent years, both now and I want to say around 2018? Is this a short-term cyclical issue? Or is there a greater structural problem? So that's the first question. The second question, Brian touched on '23 and the significance of the MAX and the 87 ramp. I wanted to see if you could boundary the MAX production rate on the low and high end perhaps with the trajectory perhaps with and without China. David Calhoun : So let me discuss the engine-related. It is a very important issue to be resolved, and it is not yet resolved, that structural casting part of the puzzle. You may recall 2 or 3 meetings ago at this, I acknowledge that would eventually be the issue. And of course, it is. So that capacity is limited. It's not just about money, it's qualification. It's one of the toughest components inside the supply chain to ultimately get to a qualified status as well as just the sheer physical capacity to do it. So I do think we all have to moderate our rates to make sure that we are ahead of that. And I do think the work that we've done, unfortunately, our choice not to move up to 38 here as soon as we had originally predicted is honestly based on that constraint. But I do believe we're at a state now we're at 31, we're comfortable the industry can get there and maybe have already gotten there. And then we're going to watch as they qualify more capacity going forward to make -- before we pull those rates up. So is it medium and long term? Somehow some way that constraint in my view in the next 3 to 5 years has to get solved itself. Some investment has to get made, and capacity has to expand for the engine suppliers to keep up with what I believe will be continued robust demand. So that may not be a satisfactory answer, but that is the reality of the world I've lived in for the last 20 years. So -- and then with respect to the other parts of the question, I'll flip it over to Brian again. Brian West : Yes. For rate, production rate, I wouldn't worry about China. As Dave -- and we've continually talked about, we enjoy a pretty robust demand market. And the China delivery and when that happens, it's separate from our ability to move rate given the other demand in the marketplace. So I think I separate those 2. It's not a pacing item. Robert Spingarn : What does the trajectory look like? Brian West : For? Robert Spingarn : For MAX production. So Dave just talked about 38. Do we know when that's going to happen? David Calhoun : No, I'll answer that. The answer is, I don't know when that will happen. Stability at 31 and then confidence that engine suppliers will have their castings in order and can predict a steady delivery at 38, that will then initiate us to say now it's 38. I don't want to get ahead of ourselves. Stability for me is still job 1, and that's what we'll stay focused on. Do I think it will be better next year? Yes, but I don't know exactly when, and I don't want to get ahead of myself. Operator : Next, we go to Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Maybe if we could talk about commercial profitability. If we strip out the abnormal cost on the 87 as well as the 777, you're at 2.3% operating margins in the quarter with an average of 33 MAXs produced or delivered. So how do we think about how margins come back as maybe the 787 comes in, the supply chain pressures alleviate? How should we look on for the step-up of commercial operating margins? Brian West : Yes. So in the short term, it will be a little bumpy as we start to roll out the 87s and continue to get confidence in our stability in 37s. But over time, when we get to a point where both are stable and operating where we expect them to, the margin rate is going to go up. I can't predict the number. I won't predict the number, but they are going to get better and better because we are going to be more predictably in a stable fashion to be able to deliver on both fronts, anyway. Operator : And next, we'll go to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Noah Poponak : I'm just going to circle back to this MAX delivery discussion because it's a bit confusing. If I -- depending on how you define low 400, if I subtract the first half from that and divide by 6, it suggests the delivery pace would slow compared to what you did in June. And that's with a higher production rate. So the -- suggests the inventory unwind is slowing. So why would that happen? And then just on this underlying rate, I mean, any supplier we talk to says they're kind of ready to go and just waiting for direction from you that they're not getting. The leasing companies are saying there's a narrow-body shortage. You have a competitor at a much higher rate. Is it -- is your answer to Rob's question that it's just purely forgings and castings and otherwise, you'd be higher? It's a little hard to square the circle on all of those inputs. David Calhoun : Before Brian gets in the -- it's never about any supplier. It's about 1 or 2 that surprised you one way or the other. And with respect to medium or longer-term rate increases or changes, yes, it does actually get down to that engine supplier, and it does get down to those castings. So we have to be confident that they are ready and that we can count on those deliveries. So anyway, that is the world we live in now. Brian West : June, we're proud of the 43 that we're able to deliver. I want to caution everyone, as you remember, April was 28. May was 29. I just indicated that July is going to be a little light. So I don't want us to get ahead of ourselves in terms of taking the June rate and extrapolating it. That would be a mistake. Month in and month out, we're aiming at stability around 31. Some months might be a little lower, some months might be a little higher. When we look at the whole balance to go and the things we're watching, we feel comfortable in that low 400 number. And hopefully, it will be better, but that's right now we're squaring to. Noah Poponak : How much lead time do you feel like you need to give the broader supply chain to break to that next higher rate whenever that is? David Calhoun : Well, first of all, we're doing our very best to be transparent, and we are always informing them that -- when we get closed. How much lead time? I don't know, 3 or 4 months if it's a formal designation. But I think they're all -- like you said, I think a lot are prepared to get to those higher rates. But we need a few specific ones to be ready to get to those higher rates. And I -- sorry to keep coming back to that, but that's really where it is. I think we have our eye squarely focused on the constraint that matters the most. And as that plays out, you'll probably know as fast as I do, and then we'll let that go to the rest of the market. I think the rest of the market will respond quickly. Operator : And next, we'll go to David Strauss with Barclays. David Strauss : Dave, Brian, wanted to see if you could tell us how many roughly MAX -- or sorry, 787 deliveries you're assuming for the rest of the year because it's pretty hard to kind of bridge the positive free cash flow for the year without assuming a fair amount of 787 deliveries in the last 5 months. That's my first question. And then the second question, you've talked about a meaningful improvement in free cash flow in '23. I just wanted to see if you could put some bounds around that? Are we talking a couple billion dollars? Or are we talking -- the consensus right now is showing a $7 billion improvement in free cash flow next year. I want to see if that's within the realm of reason. Brian West : Yes, sure. So your last question, can't wait for November to be able to give you more detail around that, and we'll wait until November. And then on your question on the 87 number, we're not going to give a number on that front. We want to get to one. And we're really excited to get to one as fast as we can. And once that plays out, we'll get more visibility. But it's a little too early to quantify that. Clearly, we've got an expectation that we're going to liquidate some 87s over the course of the second half, but I'm just a little cautious to stick a number out there. David Strauss : All right. A quick follow-up. Dave, the IG audit that's going on with the FAA and the change in leadership there, you don't think that potentially holds up the 87 at all? David Calhoun : I do not. I do not. And I've also asked that question many times. So I think we're in a good place. Again, I'm going to follow up just quickly with Brian's comment. We're not playing a game. We are working as hard as we can to get to stability in a tough environment. We chose that November meeting as a moment to sort of say, okay, where are we on stability, what is the framework for cash flow over the course of the next year. We're looking forward to that day and that meeting. And I think at that moment in time, a lot of these variables will have resolved themselves, and we can give you a much a much clearer view of what the future looks like. Operator : And next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Seth Seifman : I guess, Brian, when we look at the advance balance of $52 billion, I think it's higher than it was at the end of 2018 when rates were significantly higher. And it sounds like you're telling us that, that balance is going to be even higher still but perhaps significantly by December 31. Does that ever come down at some point? How do we kind of think about where that goes from here? And Dave, when you say having some visibility on some of these big questions at the November meeting, does that include potentially MAX deliveries into China? Brian West : So we -- that balance did come down this quarter, and we do expect it to come down. It will. It will be the excess PDP burn down that will come down. But it gets offset by the benefit of incoming PDPs and order receipts. And we love that, right? There's a lever of our business that accrue to us. And the more we do that, the more we've got airplanes going and commitments and orders to our customers. So -- but overall, the trajectory will have to fall quarter in, quarter out. It's hard to peg because of that accretive offset. Seth Seifman : But if you had in your model at some point like a requirement that this had to -- that there had to be some kind of $10-plus billion reduction in this balance at some point over time, is that just an incorrect understanding of how this all works? Brian West : Well, I'm not going to comment on $10 billion. I do know that there has to be the burn down of the excess, and that will happen over time. And we do our best to try to isolate that as terms of our projections. On the other hand, the benefits of order volume is something that we benefit from as well. So it has been flattish over the last several quarters. It's been taking small chunks down, and we expect it to continue to come down. But I can't call it an order of magnitude of a $10 billion drop the way you're suggesting. There's just too many dynamics in there, and I'm reluctant to make those kind of statements. David Calhoun : And then with respect to China in November, I will give you the update. You will probably be as up to speed every week between now and then as I am because it does require a bit of a thawing and geopolitical break between China and the U.S., so at any rate. In the meantime, we do deliver airplanes occasionally to China based on pure need. And those are mostly widebodies and mostly cargo. Operator : Next, we'll go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Cai von Rumohr : Yes. So it looks like you produced on average 24 737s in the second quarter. How comfortable are you that you can kind of sustain an average of 31 per month? Because I know that you pause when you have to even though the indicated line rate is 31. And secondly, if you can, should we estimate your production plus taking 10 or 12 out of inventory to kind of get to what we assume for the production rate in the second half? Brian West : So I'll take the second part of that. I think that reliably month in, month out, we'll aim at 31. Anywhere from 8, 10, 12 is the range on liquidity from inventory. It could be in that kind of mix. And that gets you to the low 400s for the total year is the way I would think about it. I don't think the pieces go much below 8 coming from inventory, and I probably don't think we'd do better than 12 in any given month. But we will modulate between that and the production rates as we go into the back half of the year. David Calhoun : And again, the average of 31 with respect to production is a clear objective of ours. Anything short of that will be disappointing. Our real objective though is to make that a stable rate in each of the months, and we're not there yet. So be careful to extrapolate any 1 month. Cai von Rumohr : And you've made the point that demand is so strong. What will you have to see to make the decision to raise the rate from 31 per month? David Calhoun : I'm going to get back to earlier questions. If I thought I had an engine supply, I'd do it today. Operator : And next, we go to the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Kristine Liwag : Dave, on the supply chain, how much will your mitigating actions cost in terms of higher labor costs or investments for internal fabrication or maybe even working capital for buffer stock? And also as a follow-up on the engine discussion earlier, what can you do to encourage investment casting suppliers to invest? David Calhoun : Well, that's -- well, I've been trying to encourage them for a very, very long time. Honestly, I think it's going to be, as is always the case, they're going to increase their margins. My guess is it will be considerable. I don't know all their contract timings and all their relationships with our engine suppliers. But you know how hard they're going to be working. And when those margins get to a point where everyone believes it's worth investing a significant amount of money, that's what they'll do. And I suspect that day will come. And I will encourage the industry in that way. And they're going to have to believe in our demand forecast, which, so far, I think we've been highly credible with respect to the long-term demand forecast for airplanes. So on the -- on all those readiness questions and investments, we are -- you're right to ask the question because we've said to everybody if you're in pursuit of predictability, then you have to invest in all those buffer stocks. And you have to stay ahead of this curve in every way that we possibly can. And I'd say it's marginally more investment-intensive, but not enough to honestly make that big a difference for us going forward, especially when you compare it to our investment in finished goods inventory, which right now is a bit of an all-time high. And I will also -- we haven't talked about it, just mentioned to everybody that while none of us like how we got here, if you are faced with a bunch of supply constraints as a market over the next couple of years, having over 400 airplanes that are finished at your fingertips, and yes, they're hard to get out and get ready and back into the marketplace, is a pretty good buffer in and of itself and allows us to exercise a little extra discipline on the stability front as we begin to march up that curve over the next 18 months. So anyway, I don't want that to get lost as a buffer overall. Operator : And next, we go the line of Rich Safran with Seaport Research. Richard Safran : I'd like to shift the topic to defense for just a minute, your comments about stable global demand. Could you also comment on international demand in general for defense equipment? And maybe in your answer also comment about additional demand for your tanker programs, the 46 and MQ-25? And the reason why I'm asking this is I believe both these programs had quite aspirations for international sales. So I thought maybe you'd comment on that as well. David Calhoun : Yes. No, I appreciate the question. And we've been bullish on international opportunities. I am more bullish now than I was when I even began, and I was -- again, I was optimistic there. And it is because of the world we see in front of us. It does take a couple of years to take the threats that are out there that manifest themselves into real orders and sort of long commitments. And I -- but I suspect that's the way this world will turn here in the next couple of years. We had some early shore indications from those closest to the conflict. Our Chinook victory here came faster than maybe we would imagine. Why? Because our customer is right next to the front. So I am optimistic on the program specifically that you called out. They might be on the leading edge of that demand curve. But it's not going to happen in the next 6 months, and it's not going to -- it will take us probably a year to get to where that demand begins to manifest into real orders. Operator : And we'll go to George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. George Shapiro : Dave, I'm trying to figure out where all the strong demand is coming from because the way I look at it, air show orders were the weakest since 2009 for both you and Airbus. You were better, obviously, but still weaker since 2016. If domestic traffic returns to 2019 in 2023, then the same number of planes should be needed yet unless retirements really pick up to a level never before we've seen at 5% of the fleet versus the current 1.3, there's going to be 2,000 more planes than needed out there. So if you can kind of just reconcile where all the demand is coming from. David Calhoun : Well, there are awful lot of irons in the fire. And like you, I try to compare and contrast how many irons in the fire now versus where they were. Certainly in the COVID period, significantly hotter. But even in that prior '19 world, there's just a lot of irons in the fire, and there's already a concern about supply constraints. So you know what that mix ends up doing. And then I will just add to that puzzle. You know the sustainability constraints. And while you may be skeptical and maybe I am too about renewal or taking airplanes out of service, I think that day is on us. And I think that's going to be real in the years ahead. You'd be surprised how many of the orders, particularly in the mature markets like Europe, et cetera, where that is the discussion more than any other, which is we need to improve the sustainability performance of our fleets otherwise, we're going to lose ground. I will point, if you don't mind, to a tool we introduced at the show called Cascade, which is a measure of emissions for every airplane every day for everybody. And it's meant to be an open tool for the industry to use to think about policy changes and all those things that are going to incent the renewal of fleets and the improvement on this front. That tool is a tool that we'll show you in our November meeting, and it's one I hope you'll use because I do think that changes the -- that rate of retirement in a pretty big way. Brian West : Yes. Because, I mean, you really got to get a level we've never seen before to get these 2,000 planes out. And I mean if I even just look at Delta and your recent order with Delta, they're not taking the MAX 10 till 2025. Right now, they've got 65 [MAX 7s] that are over 25 years old. David Calhoun : Yes. No, exactly. But those 25-year-olds -- I believe the pressure on this will not subside. It will grow, and policies will get written. I think our trick here, honestly speaking, for the industry for a moment and as you get familiar with the tool that I'm referring to and think about this, our trick is to make sure that policy with respect to the environmental and sustainability performance of the aviation fleet does not get so far ahead of the industry that it stopped the music. We've seen that happen in the energy world a little bit. I don't want to see that happen in the aviation world. So that's why this tool is important to us. Incent the retirement of some of the old, less efficient airplanes. And yes, that's good for us and good for the industry, but also educate the policymakers so they don't get so far ahead that it begins to constrain the industry's growth. George Shapiro : And how do you think increasing recession concerns affect this? You would think there'd be less retirements then? David Calhoun : Well, so far, I'm not sure I can draw the correlation all the way to retirement, but I -- this general recession thing so far hasn't impacted our aviation industry. Will it at some moment? Maybe. Price elasticity has been remarkable as I look at things. And demand for air travel, I think, has been prioritized fundamentally to a higher slot in the consumers' list of priorities. So anyway, I'm not smart enough to draw a perfect line between one and the other, but I believe that the retirement world is going to change in a pretty big way. Matt Welch : All right. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. This completes our second quarter 2022 earnings call.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company\u2019s Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst question-and-answer session are being broadcast live over the internet. [Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I\u2019m turning the call over to Mr. Matt Welch, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Mr. Welch, please go ahead. Matt Welch : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Boeing\u2019s third quarter 2022 earnings call. I am Matt Welch, and with me today are Dave Calhoun, Boeing\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian West, Boeing\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, you can follow today\u2019s broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. Projections, estimates and goals we include in our discussions this morning involve risks, including those described in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures. Now, I will turn the call over to Dave Calhoun. Dave Calhoun : Matt, thanks. Welcome to everybody. Thanks for joining us. I will acknowledge upfront that our plans for the investor conference middle of next week we\u2019re looking forward to them. We hope we can give some guideposts for the forward look in The Boeing Company. So, many of our comments today will be a little shorter than usual and focused strictly on the quarter. This quarter was a big one for us. We hit a marker, a marker we\u2019ve set since the beginning of our turnaround effort in the beginning of 2020, and that was to generate positive free cash flow. So, we generated $2.9 billion in the quarter. That puts us on the path that we projected for 2022, which was positive. So again, a very important accomplishment for us and I think begins the real turning point for the Company. At the same time, we took a charge on our fixed-price development contracts. These are contracts that we have talked about now repeatedly on these calls. We believe, as we always do, that the charge that we took is meant to complete these contracts ultimately to deliver them to satisfied customers in the Air Force or the armed forces. And anyway, we\u2019re not embarrassed by them. They are what they are, and we intend to deliver against these contracts and satisfy our customers. Without a doubt, and you\u2019ve heard it from all of the earnings calls over the course of the week, the supply chain, inflation, labor shortages, macroeconomic challenges are challenging for everybody. That is reflected in these third quarter calls, Again, the charges in our fixed price development world, et cetera, all of that\u2019s embedded. We\u2019re not anticipating or suggesting that the supply chain world is going to get much better in the near term. We expect it will continue to be challenged over the course of 2023. One of our problems is not demand. Demand is very strong. It\u2019s strong across the portfolio of products, and it\u2019s strong across the world with all of our customers. Why? Because their demand is strong. Bookings in pretty much every geography is strong with the exception of China. But also there are concerns about the very supply constraints that we\u2019re all referring to, sort of force them to want to get in line and get their orders in so that they have the lift they need as the world returns to some normal state. What\u2019s our job in this supply-constrained world? Well we\u2019re in the factories. We don\u2019t push the system too fast. We slow down when we have to and we try not to compound problems that may arise from the supply chain or from our own shops. We\u2019ve added more than 10,000 people this year, and we are investing in training and development to accelerate their experience curve and improve our productivity over time. And we\u2019re driving stability in the supply chain. We\u2019ve introduced all kinds of on-site technology, digital tools to watch what they\u2019re doing, but also we\u2019ve added people to those organizations that are more challenged than others. And we\u2019ve increased inventory, safety stock wherever we can. Truth is it will still take time to normalize. And our objective in the investor conference that lies ahead is to give you that projection as to how and when we think that is likely to happen. Despite the challenges, I\u2019m very pleased with the progress broadly. Our 87 deliveries have returned. It\u2019s a reflection on us focusing on the right things. Strict conformance with respect to our manufacturing processes is very important. We\u2019ve gotten it right, and the delivery process has started, and so far, so good. On the 737 MAX, return to service, again, philosophy is one at a time. 1 million revenue flights, exceptional schedule reliability, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve experienced. And that is why the folks who have leaned into the MAX continue to lean into the MAX and continue to place orders with us. In total, over the quarter, 227 orders for airplanes, WestJet, UPS, Cargolux, China Airlines, just a few, again, very strong. You probably have seen today, Alaska has upped their commitment to the MAX, and we greatly appreciate it from all of them. In a strong demand and yet supply-constrained world, our inventory, the fixed -- finished goods inventory that we have is an asset, not a liability, and we use it to de-risk that delivery outlook. And as for China, we continue to derisk. That\u2019s been our objective. We still would like to deliver airplanes to China. We continue to support our customers. We continue to support the regulator. As we all know, the COVID restrictions and policies in China have reduced demand for airplanes in general. And we hope that is what is restricting the acceptance of our -- of the airplanes that they have on our tarmacs. But we also are clear eyed about the geopolitical risks that are out there, and we are not going to impart new risks on our investors, and we believe we can derisk what we have. We\u2019re progressing on our development programs, the -7, the -10, the 777-9 and the -8 freighter. All of these are progressing well. As everybody knows, we are up against a deadline here at the end of the year. We remain confident that we can get an extension of that deadline because this is the safe answer. And we\u2019ve heard from airlines, we\u2019ve heard from pilots, we\u2019ve heard from our workers, associates, and we know that the FAA has been putting in the work to certify these airplanes. So, we remain not just hopeful but confident that we can get this across the finish line. And then those airplanes, as many of you know, complete that narrow-body portfolio in a way that allows us to compete head-to-head with our important competitor, Airbus. BDS, Boeing Defense, yes, we have these fixed price development challenges. But we have a rich portfolio. We delivered 4 MH-139 Grey Wolf test aircraft to the U.S. Air Force. We received contracts for additional KC-46A tankers for both the U.S. Air Force and the Israeli Air Force. And despite the challenges on our real development programs that the tanker T-7 and MQ-25, we still remain confident in our long-term success and contribution to our cash flow. And then Boeing Services, BGS, just another very strong quarter. They\u2019re trying to keep up with demand the best they can. They delivered their 100th contracted 737-800 Boeing freighter conversion to AerCap. We\u2019ve got key awards in both commercial and defense customers and things are going well, and margins continue to expand. And then finally, we have not stopped investing in our foundational capabilities. We had some pretty good examples of that over the course of the quarter. We opened three advanced facilities across the country, composite fabrication, additive manufacturing and an important autonomy investment alongside MIT just in Cambridge. Also very excited about Wisk\u2019s unveiling of the world\u2019s first autonomous self-flying 4-seat all electric vertical takeoff and landing air taxi. There\u2019s a very bright future ahead for that. And with respect to autonomy and its advancement in the world of certification, it\u2019s a very, very important part of our strategy. So, we\u2019re making great progress. I feel good about our turnaround. I do think the cash flow numbers in the quarter are, in fact, a marker for us. We\u2019ve been focused on it. We will continue to manage the Company on the basis of the cash economics that we support our investors with. And that\u2019ll be that. So, I\u2019m happy to turn it over to Brian now for some color on the quarter. Brian West : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s jump right in. Cash flow, as Dave mentioned is our primary financial metric and it was positive in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $3.2 billion and free cash flow was $2.9 billion, both up pretty significantly versus both prior year and prior quarter, essentially driven by higher deliveries and some receipt timing. Revenue, earnings both impacted by charges in our defense business, where we took a $2.8 billion hit across five fixed price development programs, which I\u2019ll go into. The macro environment challenges that Dave described required us to make certain adjustments, including a reassessment of future period cost forecasts. These adjustments are important to our go-forward momentum as we de-risk our defense portfolio and move to more predictable performance. And we still think about our performance in three parts and are positioning ourselves for an improving trajectory. First, we have reached important milestones across the business and made progress on commercial deliveries with the resumption of the 787 in August. Also, the 737 MAX return to service is largely complete, and we\u2019re derisking the near-term delivery skyline for China. Next, we started to see improvement in our primary financial metric of free cash flow. This third quarter performance puts us on track to be positive for both the second half and the full year of 2022. And finally, as we look to 2023, our operational and financial performance should continue to improve. Now, the acceleration will not be as significant as previously anticipated, and our path to recovery is taking a bit longer than expected driven by the challenging macro environment. Longer term, there is a significant opportunity for our company to return to sustainable growth. As we liquidate the 37 and the 87 inventory, we improve execution on a de-risked BDS portfolio and achieve certification on the MAX, -7, the -10 and the 777X development programs. We look forward to sharing our plans at our investor conference next week. Before getting into the financials, I want to make a few points on the current business environment. Slide 3. While the turnaround is taking a bit longer, one thing that remains strong is demand for airplanes, as the commercial market recovery is playing out better than expected. We still see overall passenger traffic returning to 2019 levels in the 2023 to 2024 time frame. And although the economic indicators point to challenges ahead, this demand has proven resilient. In August, domestic traffic was at 85% of 2019 levels, led by the U.S., Europe and Latin America. Going forward, the recovery will be driven by China domestic and international traffic, which remain below 2019 levels at 62% and 67%, respectively. In aggregate, commercial passenger traffic was at 74% of 2019 levels. So, even with economic headwinds, we see the strength of demand continuing as air traffic recovers to its historic levels. In Defense and Space, we see solid long-term markets, both domestically and internationally. In the U.S., there\u2019s broad support for increased defense spending in Congress to meet current challenges. And internationally, ongoing global tensions are driving our partners and our allies to announce plans for increased spending and additional capabilities for national defense, and we\u2019re working hard to support their needs. In services, our business is well positioned with a broad set of offerings and will continue to benefit from the growing commercial fleet, a robust cargo market and increasing defense budgets. Turning to the supply chain. Constraints continue to impact production in both our commercial and defense businesses. On the commercial side, we\u2019re focused on a few key areas, namely engine deliveries, which is the primary constraint to 737 production rate stabilization and subsequent increases. Customers are counting on us to resolve the situation with our supply chain partners, and we will. We\u2019re taking actions to mitigate these impacts and support the supply chain. And as Dave described, we\u2019ve increased our on-site presence at first tier and sub-tier suppliers to support work movement and address industry-wide shortages. And we\u2019re utilizing our own internal fabrication for surge capacity and managing safety stock inventory levels and increasing where necessary to protect risk. With overall healthy demand, finished goods inventory and a diverse backlog, we feel well positioned to navigate the current environment and are confident that our product lineup is well suited to meet our customer needs. With that backdrop, let\u2019s turn to the financials on slide 4. Third quarter revenue of $16 billion increased 4%. Core operating earnings were negative $3.1 billion, resulting in a loss per share of $6.18, largely driven by $2.8 billion of defense charges. We generated $3.2 billion of operating cash flow, a significant improvement from the same period last year, primarily due to higher commercial airplane deliveries and favorable receipt timing. Also, similar to the same period last year, we benefited from a tax refund of $1.5 billion in the quarter. Let\u2019s move to Commercial Airplanes on slide 5. Third quarter revenue was $6.3 billion, up 40% primarily driven by the resumption of the 787 and higher 737 deliveries. Operating losses of $0.6 billion and the resulting negative margin rate reflect abnormal costs and period expenses. On the 87 program, we delivered 9 airplanes in the quarter and have 115 airplanes in inventory. The pace of deliveries from inventory going forward will be based on finishing rework as well as customer fleet planning requirements. We expect most of these airplanes to be delivered over the next two years. We continue to produce at low rate and will gradually return to five airplanes per month over time. Near term, the supply chain remains a key watch item for 87 production and deliveries. Longer term, with more than 400 airplanes in backlog, we anticipate higher production rates due to the expected wide-body market recovery. As customers return to medium-term fleet planning, we continue to have positive discussions with our customers on the 87. We recorded $330 million of 87 abnormal costs in the quarter, in line with expectations, and we still anticipate a total of about $2 billion, the most be incurred by the end of 2023. These costs are driven by rework and production rates below five per month. Moving on to the 37 program. We delivered 88 airplanes in the quarter, below our previous expectations, primarily due to supply chain disruptions, which impacted factory flow time. We continue to work towards stabilizing deliveries. However, given our delivery to date, we now estimate about 375 737 airplanes this year. The monthly delivery trend is expected to remain in the low-30s into next year. We ended the quarter with 270 MAX airplanes in inventory, down 20 versus last quarter. There were 35 deliveries out of storage, largely in line with our plan, but we also began positioning for MAX 7 deliveries and built 13 airplanes in the quarter. Of the inventoried airplanes, 138 are for customers in China. We continue to explore options to remarket some of these airplanes as we derisk our near-term delivery plan. Based on our latest assessment of China and the -7, -10 certification time lines, we now expect most of the inventoried airplanes to deliver in 2023 and 2024 with some moving into 2025. Moving on to the 777-9 program. Development efforts are ongoing and the program time line is unchanged from what we shared last quarter. We still anticipate delivery of the first 777-9 airplane in 2025 and continue to coordinate with the FAA to prioritize resources across our development programs. We booked $111 million of 777X abnormal costs in the third quarter, in line with our expectations, and we still expect to record about $1.5 billion of these costs through 2023, while 777-9 production remains paused. During the quarter, we booked 227 commercial airplane orders. As Dave mentioned, the customers we are proud to serve. In September alone, we received orders for each of our programs, including the 737 MAX, the 767, 787, 777, 777X. And at the end of the third quarter, we had over 4,300 airplanes in backlog valued at $307 billion. Let\u2019s now move to Defense, Space and Security on slide 6. Third quarter revenue was $5.3 billion, down 20%, and operating margin was negative 52.7%. Results were driven by approximately $2.8 billion of losses on certain fixed price development programs. KC-46A and VC-25B made up the bulk of these charges at $1.2 billion and $766 million, respectively. We also recorded losses on T-7A, MQ-25 and commercial crude programs and saw pressures across other programs. These losses reflect a comprehensive review of program financial estimates. While some changes resulted from new information or developments during the quarter, others were the result of our most recent assessment of estimated future performance. Adjustments were primarily due to higher estimated manufacturing and supply chain costs as well as technical challenges, which are expected to continue longer than anticipated. The cash impact of the losses we recorded year-to-date are now heavily weighted in the near term, resulting in a cash flow usage at BDS for both 2022 and 2023. While current performance doesn\u2019t reflect where we\u2019d like to be, for sure, we\u2019re focused on driving execution stability. These programs have an outsized impact on BDS margins and will be key to margin recovery in future periods. On the demand side, we received $5 billion in orders during the quarter, including tanker awards from both, the U.S. and Israel, resulting in BDS backlog of $55 billion. Additionally, the Apache helicopter has been selected by the Polish military. Now, let\u2019s turn to Global Services results on slide 7. The Global Services business had another strong quarter, primarily driven by our parts and distribution business. Third quarter revenue was $4.4 billion, up 5%, and operating margin was 16.5%. Results were driven by higher commercial volume and favorable mix, partially offset by lower government volume. We received $5 billion in orders during the quarter, including a tanker support contract for the Italian Air Force and an F/A-18 depot expansion contract. The BGS backlog is $19 billion. With highly valued commercial capabilities and support for our defense portfolio, our service business is positioned to see continued growth. Based on what we\u2019ve seen so far this year, we anticipate healthy total services top line growth for 2022 and similar growth in 2023. Now, let\u2019s turn to slide 8 and cover cash and debt. We ended the third quarter with strong liquidity with $14.3 billion of cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet, an improvement of $2.9 billion since the end of the second quarter driven by free, cash flow generation. During the quarter, due to our improving cash flow and business outlook, we chose to reduce the size of our revolving credit facility capacity from $14.7 billion to $12 billion, which remains undrawn. Year-to-date operating cash flow was a generation of $55 million, and free cash flow usage year-to-date was $841 million. We expect our primary financial metric, free cash flow, to be positive for the fourth quarter and the full year, driven by commercial deliveries. Our debt balance is consistent with the end of the last quarter at $57.2 billion. Our investment-grade credit rating is a priority, and we remain committed to reducing debt levels through strong cash flow generation over time. In conclusion, while we have more work to do, we\u2019re executing on our turnaround, and we\u2019ve come quite a long way over the last three years. We remain focused on our own performance and taking the right actions to drive stability and growth for the future. We also continue to invest in key capabilities that will lay the foundation for the future. And through it all, our team is demonstrating exceptional resilience and dedication. More work ahead, but we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re on the right path. With that, over to Dave for closing comments. Dave Calhoun : Yes. I\u2019ll keep it short and sweet. We\u2019re on a turnaround. We\u2019ve been on a turnaround. We\u2019ve made very important progress with our regulators. We\u2019ve made very important progress with our customers and even more importantly, the flying public. And now, we\u2019re wrestling through supply chain constraints. And when we get through it all, we\u2019ll get back to normal and ultimately deliver what our shareholders are expecting. So, I\u2019ll leave it at that and open up to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good morning, Dave and Brian. You started the call with comments around the supply chain challenges that you\u2019re seeing, and you talked about it lasting through 2023. And it doesn\u2019t seem inventory is the issue, and it\u2019s mostly engine. So, what sort of steps is the team taking to work with suppliers to resolve these risks? And how do you expect it to impact the output and, ultimately, deliveries? I think you mentioned low-30s through next year on the Max. Historically, you\u2019ve said 8 to 10 out of inventory. So, how do we think about the production pipeline there? Dave Calhoun : Well, that -- let me start with steps. So, I\u2019ll let Brian maybe quantify best he can. But I -- the steps are they\u2019re as clear as they can be. We\u2019ve been talking about this for quite a while. We get on regular calls with our counterparts at the engine suppliers. And as you know, in our case, it\u2019s predominantly CFM and then GE broadly across the wide-body fleet, et cetera. So, we literally go down through all of those schedules. It inevitably comes down to castings and the support that they get from the two big casting suppliers. So, the best thing I can say now is that we are clearly on the same page, ourselves and our suppliers. We are taking steps to increase at a very gradual and, I hope, a disciplined way, the increase in rate with respect to castings and then ultimately from engines to us. I don\u2019t want to predict outcomes on that front. I think the most important thing is we\u2019re not being surprised as frequently as we used to be, and I do think that the engine suppliers are getting their heads -- their arms around things in a much better way than they had previously. So that\u2019s really the situation as it is. I am confident that the industry will step up, but it will take more time than I probably had hoped when we started these conversations. And I suspect it won\u2019t be until we get to the sort of end of next year before we can really make sizable rate increases with respect to that constraint. Brian? Brian West : And what I would say is that my comment on being in the low-30s, year-to-date, we\u2019ve been in the low-30s. And as we turn the quarter into next year, that all of a sudden is going to snap up to a 40 type number. So, it\u2019s going into the year. We\u2019re going to be constrained, as Dave mentioned, largely by the engines, and will be that low-30s. But as we get through next year, that rate will go up. And we\u2019ll talk a lot more about that next week. Operator : Next, we go to Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Myles Walton : I\u2019m wondering on the defense charge. Obviously, we\u2019ve gone through a number of these, but they sort of keep growing in magnitude. And was there anything different, tripwire-wise that triggered the size and expansiveness of this charge? And I know you gave more color on the slip-out of the tanker, which seems to continue to happen. But maybe was there a tripwire? Number one. Number two, this -- forward losses that have accumulated on the balance sheet, the size of the headwind in \u201823 versus what you experienced in \u201822 would be helpful. Thanks. Dave Calhoun : Yes. Thanks, Myles. Let me get to the last part. It\u2019s going to be about the same in terms of the headwind, to answer your last comment. Our BDS portfolio, the 85% of the business is doing pretty well. It\u2019s these fixed-price development programs that, unfortunately, we\u2019re working our way through. We had to account for recent performance, including a reassessment of our forecast cost to complete. There\u2019s no doubt about it. The biggest impact was the tanker, as you mentioned. At $1.2 billion, it was driven by two things. The supply chain constraints and specifically part shortages have been persisting and they likely will persist longer than we had contemplated; and then, two, this labor instability. As you know, all airplane programs contemplate a learning curve improvement over time. And we adjusted our assumptions because labor stability is an issue that is likely to continue into the future. We can hire. It\u2019s getting the workforce trained and up to speed that we had to account for in this particular period. We applied the similar framework to the VC-25B, where the labor stability issues are magnified because of the requirement to get secured -- security clearances. And that\u2019s also contributed to schedule shifts. So, those are the two big ones. And it\u2019s just at this moment, the provision reflects what we think is likely to happen in front of us. The other bucket really relates to what I would call true development, which is MQ-25, T-7 and Commercial Crew. We did adjust for similar macro constraints where needed. But there\u2019s also a recognition, there\u2019s technical challenges that we\u2019re organized through and sometimes impact schedule. But overall, we feel very confident about those programs long term and the benefits that we\u2019ll accrue, once we get them out in the market. So, there\u2019s no doubt that we derisk these programs. Now, the two big ones for the next two years, and I\u2019m not suggesting perfection, but we definitely lowered the risk profile. And for the smaller programs, in some cases, we derisked even longer. I think the thing we have to keep in mind is that our mandate is to stabilize and now deliver very important products to our customers who need them, anyway. Myles Walton : Okay. And then, just clarification on the tax refund, you\u2019ve had one last year this year. Do you anticipate another one next year, no? Dave Calhoun : No. Myles Walton : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss : Brian, you made the comment that I believe the recovery is not accelerating as fast as you expected. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll give us a lot more on this next week, but maybe some broad strokes as to what that means in terms of the trajectory of free cash flow generation from here in your ability to delever as you have a fair amount of maturities coming due in the first half of next year? Brian West : So, I\u2019d answer that question. We\u2019re confident that we will be able to satisfy the maturities in front of us. We\u2019ll talk a lot more about that. But, given the fact that where we ended the quarter with our cash balance, $14-plus billion, plus being able to be cash flow positive in the fourth quarter, that\u2019s not a concern. In terms of the rate of change, we have a supply chain, as Dave mentioned that we\u2019ve been dealing with, and that\u2019s been reflected in our commercial deliveries through the course of the year. And we\u2019re working our best to stabilize and get more predictable. But, while it may not be quite the rate of acceleration going forward, momentum is going to improve. It just could take a little bit longer, and we\u2019re going to share a lot more about that with you next week. But, in terms of our liquidity position, what\u2019s in front of us, high degree of confidence. David Strauss : Okay. Quick follow-up. The airplanes that you have in inventory for China, how many of those have you remarketed at this point? Dave Calhoun : Well, there\u2019s active discussions with customers about that topic. More to come in terms of things getting finalized, but it\u2019s an active discussion, so that we can no longer defer that decision and actually start to think about how we liquidate that in terms of working capital improvement and cash flow. More to come, and we\u2019ll keep you updated. Operator : Next, we go to Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead. Peter Arment : Hey Dave, maybe I could just circle back on the China question that David was just talking about. Have you seen any kind of positive movement from customers over there regarding wanting the MAX? And right now, you\u2019re up to 51% of the store fleet is tied to China with 138 aircraft. And just, how you\u2019re thinking about that because that obviously that percentage is going to continue to grow? Thanks. Dave Calhoun : Yes. So, I\u2019ll start with my hope. My hope is that these two big geopolitical forces get together and endorse free trade again and COVID policy ultimately lightens sometime in the future in China so that they can take more deliveries of airplanes. So, we\u2019re going to keep supporting our customers, keep supporting their regulator every step of the way. But, we are also going to take steps to derisk. I have not gotten a single signal. And I\u2019m surprised by it. They\u2019re going to take deliveries in the near term. So, we are going to continue. We\u2019re going to -- we have begun and we\u2019re going to continue to remarket these airplanes as we move forward, and we\u2019re confident that there\u2019s a market for it, not a little market but a big market. In some ways, there are a lot of ways we could take advantage of it. I would prefer not to take advantage of it. I\u2019d prefer to just reinstate deliveries with our China customers. But anyway, that\u2019s the course we\u2019re on. It hasn\u2019t really changed much. But it is really hard for me to find signals that things are going to change in China and move in our direction. So, hopefully, that will give you everything you need here in terms of the way we\u2019re likely to move. Peter Arment : And just as a follow-up, Brian, just the 8 to 10 out of storage, is that still a good number on a monthly basis? Thanks. Brian West : Yes. Operator : Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ron Epstein : You mentioned on the call that your primary focus metric is going to be free cash flow. In the past, focusing on free cash flow got the Company to where it is today that didn\u2019t end very pretty. How are you viewing that differently than how it was viewed in the past? Dave, you were on the Board when a lot of the decisions were made in the past. So, what\u2019s -- how are you going to view this cash focus different than you did, call it\u2026 Dave Calhoun : Yes. Ron, I\u2019m not going to comment on the past. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s helpful to anybody. Our need to focus on free cash flow is a result of having taken a significant amount of debt on in light of the crisis that we had, some self-inflected; some definitely COVID related as it relates to the marketplace and all the things that we\u2019ve had to contend with. So, we took on a lot of debt. Shareholders told us it would be great if you got rid of that debt sooner rather than later. And so, we\u2019ve been focused on free cash flow. It is a great metric, period, in terms of how we measure all of our people and the work that we\u2019re doing. It does not suggest that we have stopped investing in new capabilities that will ultimately differentiate this company and bring it right back to the leadership role that\u2019s always enjoyed. So, I\u2019m probably not going to take the bait. I do have confidence that we are doing exactly what we need to be doing, and the free cash flow metric is a very clear indicator of performance, not just in the near term but also the medium and long term. So, I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s the answer. Ron Epstein : No, that\u2019s fine. And if I may, just a quick follow-on. Of the 787s you have in inventory, can you give us a sense on how many are like ready to be delivered, how many have to be depickled, how complicated a process that is? Brian West : Well, thanks, Ron. They all have to go through a prescribed set of rework. We\u2019ve been very clear on that. And we\u2019ve contemplated what that is going to take. And now it\u2019s up to our great team in Charleston and in Everett to get that work done. And it\u2019s going well. It\u2019s early innings, but it\u2019s going well. And we have high confidence that they will get done what they need to do to get those inventoried airplanes in the customers\u2019 hands over the next two years. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to Seth Seifman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman : I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on this issue of engines and castings. LEAP deliveries were up significantly in the third quarter. And it sounds like they see things getting better. I haven\u2019t gotten the impression from Airbus that they\u2019re expecting quite the pressures next year that you are. It seems like they expect that things are getting better. Is that because most of the LEAPs are going there and you guys have to wait longer, or is there more to it, or are these increasing CFM deliveries, is that not really enough to help you guys? Dave Calhoun : Yes. So, just in context, things are getting better. They are getting your hands around things and they\u2019re beginning to project forward. The real issue for us is simply -- when I refer to constraints, it\u2019s because we have such huge demand for the airplanes that we wish we could do double the rates. That is why we will refer to this as a constraint and a difficulty. The measurement of where engines are going with respect to Airbus versus us is the easiest thing in the world to measure. And so, we\u2019re well aware of it, and we don\u2019t see any indication that one\u2019s being favored over another. And then, with respect to maybe suggestions that they\u2019re not having any trouble, that\u2019s not what the industry tells us. And frankly, that\u2019s up for them to explain and to all of you, and I\u2019m sure they will. So, I\u2019m not worried about this as the industry favoring one over the other. It\u2019s too easy for both sides to measure and to hold people accountable. And yes, it\u2019s improving, but it\u2019s nowhere near where we all want it to be because the demands -- or demand on our airplanes is just so strong. Seth Seifman : Okay. And just to be clear then, it is the engines though that is preventing Boeing from delivering 737s off the line between, let\u2019s say, the expected pace of 20 a month to be at a total delivery pace of low-30s versus the nominal production rate of 31 a month. So, they\u2019re only able to get you engines to deliver at roughly 20 planes per month or so. Dave Calhoun : Yes. We\u2019re short of engines. We have a clear picture of what it\u2019s going to take to make it up, and we\u2019ll get back on rate. But yes, the answer is yes. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll go to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Noah Poponak : A lot to work through, but it seems like what underpins some large portion of your challenges is labor availability, both for yourself, for the supply chain. It seems like it\u2019s behind a decent amount of the defense charges. Can you put some numbers on it? How many people do you need to hire? How far into that have you broken? When you say it takes time to get somebody trained and seasoned, how long does that take? And do you have those numbers in the castings part of the supply chain? I mean how many people do they need to hire? And how far along are they? And where are these people going to come from given the macro level openings versus workers\u2019 gap? Dave Calhoun : Well, that\u2019s a big complex and macro question. I\u2019ll start with us. We have brought on 10,000 people. We are at a headcount level that we think can handle rate increases and all the things that we need inside our own shop. We have significant training and development programs and investments that are being made as we speak, so that we are productive with the introduction of all of these new people. I don\u2019t have a number with respect to all of the supply chain constraints and labor shortages that they might have. But a lot of our constraints and -- with those suppliers that represent constraints are labor related. Some like in the casting world, are a little more labor and experience related because you may know in the casting world, that is not a simple process. It\u2019s not just bring in people and start them up. There\u2019s a real learning curve and cycle that is needed to sort of ramp up capacity. So, I don\u2019t have a sort of big number for you. I wish I did. I know this. All of us, all of us in this industry are wrestling through these constraints. We try to compare notes. We\u2019re trying to help our suppliers on the commodity side with our own contracts and the application of those contracts to their needs. And then on the labor side, anything that we can do to help them find people, that\u2019s what we do. And we often second or send our own people out there to help them. So, it\u2019s -- this is just what we\u2019re in. I think it\u2019s going to take probably all of next year before things really do begin to stabilize because we begin to see layoffs in other industries. We definitely feel that in the software world, we\u2019re not having any kind of trouble bringing in the engineering resources that we need, particularly as it relates to software development because the rest of the industry that competes with us is beginning to soften considerably. So I wish I had a big specific number and an easy resolution. I don\u2019t. This is what we\u2019re going to struggle through all year next year. Operator : Our next question is from Rob Spingarn with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Rob Spingarn : Dave, a couple for you. You\u2019ve said numerous times today that demand is not the issue. So, I was going to ask if you could talk about the developing wide-body cycle and the environment for that. And could it mitigate some of the narrow-body issues in China, in other words, selling wide-bodies into China? And how might that influence your rate plan for 87 and 777 freighter? Dave Calhoun : It\u2019s a great question. Number one, I -- the wide-body world is heating up. There are some significant orders out there that we\u2019re all competing for. So, that\u2019s just a reflection of the markets that are returning, largely in international base, but a lot of domestic carriers as well, so anyway, a big robust. The answer on China is just as you\u2019re suggesting and the premise that underlies it, which is -- that is the airplane they are going to likely need from us more than any other. They don\u2019t have a domestic alternative. And I don\u2019t believe that a single provider from France can meet those requirements, so. And we do get orders, but they\u2019re -- I put them in the incremental category for airplanes, large wide-bodies, freighters in particular, from China. Does that ramp up? It\u2019s not something we\u2019re counting on, but it could. And if it does, that will compete for a very crowded skyline. So again, if China really does rebound and we can get the geopolitical tensions to calm down somewhat, that\u2019s going to present another challenge for us on the demand and the supply front, but one we would welcome and probably be upside to whatever guidance we provide next week. Rob Spingarn : Okay. And just to clarify, a slightly different topic. How does this BDS review differ from prior reviews? How confident are you that you\u2019ve captured everything here? Dave Calhoun : I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll let Brian in to talk. So, the best, I mean, fact set that we can give is, number one, we\u2019re getting closer to the end of these programs. So, we\u2019re getting work done. We know more. We see more. We\u2019re also running out of time with respect to learning curves. There\u2019s no time to develop learning curves. They take a couple of years. We don\u2019t have a couple of years. We\u2019re -- so we don\u2019t have any baked-in learning curves anymore. We are simply saying these supply constrained -- supply constraints that we\u2019re facing today will not end until we finish. So, we\u2019re trying to assess these programs with real clarity and realism with respect to what we\u2019re experiencing now and not projecting significant improvements in the future. So, it\u2019s -- for me, that\u2019s sort of the set around it. It\u2019s definitely the way we went into it. And of course, Brian has been through every little detail. So Brian, I\u2019ll let you add. Brian West : I don\u2019t have much to add other than we sit in this environment and you can\u2019t ignore these macro constraints and how they impact these programs. And that just is what happened this quarter. But the thing that we\u2019ve done our best to do is derisk, and derisk, as Dave mentioned, some of these assumptions and future cost forecasts. So, we like where we closed the quarter of our position. We do it every quarter, and we feel confident. This particular quarter, it really was the recognition of the very rapidly changing environment that is persistent, and can\u2019t assume it\u2019s going to get better anytime soon. Operator : Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr : So, I guess, I kind of get the $2.8 billion on the development program, although that seems large. What confuses me is that excluding the $2.8 billion all those mature programs, F-18, F-15, Apache, et cetera, look like they\u2019re at breakeven. They\u2019re making no money when Lockheed and GV have their issues, but basically the mature stuff is doing okay, how come? Dave Calhoun : Brian, you probably want to grab that one. Brian West : We saw across some of these other programs, similar disruptions in terms of both, factory stability, part shortages, labor. So, those weren\u2019t immune at all. It\u2019s just that they\u2019re not magnified in the sense that there are these big fixed price development programs that have these reach forward losses embedded in them. Cai von Rumohr : And then\u2026 Brian West : You know in making comparisons across our companies, our BDS is programs only. It\u2019s not including the government services part of our business, which continues to run at reasonably healthy margins and does its things. So, I know you know that, but I just want to point it out. Cai von Rumohr : And then -- so I mean, we\u2019ve seen sort of a whole set here. We thought first quarter, $900 million, got it done. Now we have $2.8 billion. What should we be looking for to see -- to feel confident that, in fact, you guys really are out of the woods at BDS? Brian West : Better numbers, better performance, better everything. So, I don\u2019t want to tell you anything other than that. Our objective is to make sure these tankers are doing the job for our military customer. That is it. That\u2019s all we\u2019re focused on. And they are doing that. And they are now permitted to do all the missions that are required. So, we are knocking down risk and we are implementing these programs. And so, I am confident we\u2019re going to get where we need to get, and you\u2019ll be confident when you see the numbers play out the way I expect them to play out. Cai von Rumohr : Yes. Dave Calhoun : As you know, better than anyone, these are complicated programs, lots of assumptions, lots of moving parts, backdrop of a volatile environment. We did our very best to derisk. Matt Welch : Operator, we have time for one last question. Operator : And that will come from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Doug Harned : I wanted to go back to the MAX rate and engines,, because on the earlier -- I think Seth\u2019s question earlier talked about the LEAPs out there, and we\u2019re looking at GE just reported 347 LEAP deliveries for the quarter. We are seeing Airbus finally, and they\u2019ve struggled. But finally, that -- the LEAP-powered A320 seemed to be coming through. When I look at -- if we look at the numbers and you had sort of that target production rate of 31 a month and look at what Airbus is doing, it seems like CFM is finally getting there. And then on top of it, we know that well over 100 LEAPs were delivered ahead of production before. So, I\u2019m just trying to understand how the engines can be the main constraint here. Is there another issue that\u2019s also slowing down the delivery rate or the -- I\u2019m sorry, the production rate? Dave Calhoun : Doug, no, I can try to reconcile numbers. All I can tell you is I personally witnessed alongside my counterpart the reconciliation of the engines we need to deliver the airplanes and the engines they\u2019re producing on weekly rates. And so, we just have -- we have a gap. We got room to make up. And we\u2019re going to get there, but it\u2019s going to be at a constrained rate and we know that. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to factor into our forward looks,, and that is what you will see when we get together next week. So, there\u2019s no -- there is no other constraint, Doug, with respect to our rate projections and others. There are lots of weekly constraints that just simply impact the stability of the line, but they are not going to be rate limiters, either short term or long term. It will boil down to engines and the competition for castings between Pratt and CFM. Doug Harned : And then, if I can just follow up with one more thing, which when you guided early in the year to positive free cash flow for the year, was that including the assumption of this tax benefit that we saw this quarter? Because just wondering if you\u2019re thinking about positive free cash flow still in the absence of that sort of $1.6 billion additional benefit here. Brian West : It was contemplated, Doug. Doug Harned : Okay. So, that\u2019s part of the outlook you had. Okay. Brian West : Sure. Matt Welch : All right. That completes The Boeing Company\u2019s third quarter 2022 earnings conference call.

The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst question-and-answer session are being broadcast live over the Internet. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Matt Welch, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Boeing Company. Mr. Welch, please go ahead. Matt Welch : Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I am Matt Welch, and with me today are Dave Calhoun, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian West, Boeing's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And as a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation at boeing.com. As always, detailed financial information is included in today's press release. Furthermore, projections, estimates and goals included in today's discussion involve risks including those described in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of the web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures.  Now I will turn the call over to Dave Calhoun. Dave Calhoun : Thanks, Matt. Good morning. Thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. Last time we were together was the 2nd of November, where we had a chance for the first time, at least in my 3-year tenure to talk about guidance and expectations for the years ahead. The good news is we had a very solid fourth quarter-over-quarter that, in my view, puts us in good stead to step forward and meet the guidance that we have delivered to all of you. Not only have we taken big steps to reduce the risks that, of course, we've faced over the last three years but importantly, we're well on our way to restoring the operational and financial strength that we got used to prior to our MAX moment. Challenges remain, we have a lot to do, but overall, we're feeling pretty good about the way we closed '22 and we're well positioned for '23 and beyond. Our key metric, as everybody knows, is free cash flow. Importantly, we were able to generate more than $3 billion in free cash flow in the fourth quarter driven by the progress in our performance and importantly, continued strong demand. And this helped us generate positive full year cash flow for the first time since 2018, a very important turnaround metric for us. Several key milestones and events that I'd like to highlight. Let's start with the BCA deliveries, which I know everyone tracks. '22 total was 480 with 69 deliveries in December. Notably, the 737 deliveries, we had 387 and exceeded our target of 375 and it included 31, 787s as we unwound inventory and delivered from the production line following the important return to delivery over the course of the summer. On the order front and on the market side, we continue to see very strong demand across the portfolio. More than 800 net orders on the year, driven by the 737 MAX and the 787, highlighted most recently by the very historic deal with UAL, United Airlines in December. In 2022, we sold 200-plus net wide bodies. That's the most since 2018. More broadly, the 737 MAX team has made tremendous progress. Fleet is performing exceptionally well. Production is stabilizing, demand is strong. We delivered 1,000-plus 737 MAXs in total now. And since our return to service, the fleet has surpassed 3 million flight hours. It's safe and it's the most reliable of the airplane fleets. Production, we've all gone from 0 to 31 a month and we're prioritizing stability, which we have not yet achieved, but we're on a steady course to do so. And orders, more than 1,500 gross orders to date. 737 MAX returning to service in China is another indication of this overall improvement in our business. This month, of course, we all know that that occurred. We have more airplanes on the tarmac in China to bring back into service just as we did here in the U.S. before we began any deliveries of any sort. And I'm not going to guess going forward when deliveries may or may not start, as everyone knows in our guidance, we have derisked for that possibility. 737 MAX 7 and 10, everybody knows, we got our extension approved and attached to legislation at the end of the year. That was a very important moment. I'll remind everyone that, that doesn't mean that these were certified. It simply means that the FAA and Boeing can follow the existing application and do that job and do it the right way. So, we feel very, very good about having derisked that moment as well. I will also want to point out, every argument we made on behalf of that extension related to safety. The premise for our chosen course and the application that we filed with safety first and it will always be safety first. Following defense. Our SLS launch. This was an enormous emotional upper for our company and for our team broadly. The Artemis 1 launch in November, which was powered by the SLS rocket was more than a little inspiring. And I'd like to congratulate the NASA team broadly for the succession of the Starliner mission. It's an incredible success, incredible, and it went beautifully and almost flawlessly every step of the way.  So again, a significant accomplishment for space travel in general. But that rocket, again, just shows what Boeing is capable of when we put our minds to it, we follow our disciplines, we stay patient and ultimately prove to the world that there's more to do in space. Following Global Services, another terrific story, it is simply following the recovery of our industry in general and everywhere in the world. So, we had a great quarter pretty much across the board. We continue to grow. We continue to invest so that we are prepared to support our customers as they bring their airlines back to where they were before COVID.  So, we'll reaffirm our guidance. And with this progress, which we feel good about both the financial and the operational outlook that we shared with you in November, and that includes the cash flow, the delivery ranges that we set for '23 as well as for the 2025 and 2026 time frame. Our realities are still the same, a difficult, difficult supply chain. And while average deliveries met our objectives, we continue to face a few too many stoppages in our lines simply so that we do not travel work as we run into supply chain shortfalls. So those stoppages, while they are coming down are not where they need to be as we think about stable rates going forward. I will not, in this discussion and or in Q&A, highlight any one supplier within the supply chain. Know that we're working with all of them. There's a significant amount of transparency in those discussions between them, between us and everybody is focused on the rate improvements that we have outlined to all of you. All things considered and reflecting on these last few years, we're feeling pretty good about where we stand heading into this year. Demand, very strong portfolio, very well positioned. We have faced plenty of tests in a number of orders all around the world with some of our toughest customers, and we know this portfolio is well positioned. We have a robust pipeline of development programs, including broadly across our defense business, and we're innovating new capabilities that prepare us for the next generation of products. One of the more significant achievements was recently announced by NASA in their Sustainable Flight Demonstrator contract. This is a set of technologies that's intending to cut fuel emissions by up to 30%. Those are the kind of standards that, in our view, are required to ultimately launch a new commercial airplane wrapped in sustainability. We've de risked major aspects of the business, and our performance is improving. We're embedding lean across our operations to drive productivity ultimately to achieve the kinds of targets that we've set out. We've got work to do, but we're feeling really good about our progress. We're proud of our team, and we're confident in the future.  With that, I'll turn it over to Brian West. Brian West : Great. Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's go to the next page and cover the fourth quarter financial results. Revenue in the fourth quarter came in at $20 billion. That's up 35% year-over-year, driven by higher commercial volume. Core operating margin was negative 3.3%, and the core loss per share was $1.75. Both the margin and the loss per share were significantly better than prior year and impacted in the quarter by period expenses and abnormal costs. From a free cash flow perspective, our primary financial metric was positive $3.1 billion for the quarter, up significantly versus the prior year on higher deliveries and strong order activity and up sequentially versus the prior quarter and a bit better than our original estimate. I'll take a minute to go through each of the business units. Moving on to the next page with BCA.  BCA revenue in the fourth quarter was $9.2 billion. That's up 94% year-over-year driven by higher 787, 737 deliveries, partially offset by 787 customer considerations. On the operating margins, they were negative 6.8% in the quarter, seemingly better than a year ago and in the quarter driven by abnormal costs and higher period expenses, including higher R&D spending. I'll take a minute to go through a few highlights of the major programs, starting with the 737. We had 110 deliveries in the fourth quarter and 387 for the full year, slightly ahead of our estimate. We ended the year with 250 MAX airplanes in inventory, 30 of which were Dash 7 and Dash 10 s, and we had 138 for customers in China. We do expect the monthly deliveries from inventory to slow slightly as fewer airplanes will be available, combined with some impact from the Dash 7, Dash 10 builds. We still expect most inventoried airplanes will be delivered by the end of 2024. On the 787, we had 22 deliveries in the fourth quarter and 31% for the full year. We ended the year with 100 airplanes in inventory, most of which will be delivered by the end of 2024. We booked $350 million of abnormal costs in the quarter, taking the total to date to $1.7 billion. We're increasing the abnormal accounting estimate by about $600 million to roughly $2.8 billion in total as we will be under the five per month production rate a bit longer than expected due to a supplier constraint that has temporarily slowed production. We still expect to hit five per month this year. Our total year delivery guidance of 70 to 80 is unchanged, and there is no change to the 2023 cash flows. 77 orders were strong in the quarter, and we've added 100 airplanes to the accounting quantity, which increases our GAAP program margin. On the 777X, the program time line is holding and efforts are ongoing. Abnormal costs were $112 million in the quarter, and there is no change to the $1.5 billion total estimate. On the customer settlement front, we continue to make good progress resolving contractual issues on the three big programs. The 737 MAX is near the finish line with the vast majority of customers settled. Of the original $9.3 billion of the set aside, there's only 3% left. On the 787, a year ago, we included a significant provision in the program, which has been very stable. There are far fewer customers in the MAX, and we've already reached agreement with several, all in line with our estimates. On the 777X, there are even fewer customers and discussions are ongoing. Keep in mind that the revenue and cash impact of these settlements will be over several years and all contemplated in both the near- and long-term financial guidance. Finally, on the orders front for BCA, we booked 376 orders in the quarter and have over 4,500 airplanes in backlog valued at $330 billion. Moving on to the next page, I'll cover BDS. BDS revenues in the fourth quarter were $6.2 billion, up 5% year-over-year. Operating margins were 1.8%. And if you include services, defense margins would be 200 basis points higher to 4%. There are two things impacting BDS margins in the quarter. First, we felt the operational impact of supply chain constraints in labor and stability. Second, we saw adverse timing of certain cost accrual true-ups, including higher pension costs that flow through the P&L in the quarter a big focus for the BDS leadership team to improve execution stability both in the factory and in the supply base. Some additional highlights, as Dave mentioned, we're very proud of Artemis' 1 successful mission to the moon last November, and we delivered 45 aircrafts in the quarter, including the first P8 to New Zealand as well as three satellites, including the first 2 O3B mPOWER units. We received $7 billion in orders during the quarter. including a contract for 2 KC-46A tankers from Japan and an award for 12 Chinook helicopters from the Egyptian Air Force. The BDS backlog is at $54 billion.  Moving on to the next page, Global Services. BGS had another strong quarter, primarily driven by our parts and distribution business. BGS revenue was $4.6 billion, up 6% year-over-year and operating margin was 13.9%. Commercial volume was very strong, partially offset by some softness in the government space. We received $5 billion in orders during the quarter, including an F-15 depot support order for the U.S. Air Force, and we opened up the Germany distribution center. The BGS backlog is $19 billion. Moving on to the full year, the next page. Full year financial results, revenue came in at $66.6 billion. That's 5% up year-over-year driven by higher commercial volume, offset by lower defense revenue. Core operating margin was negative 7% and the core loss per share was over $11 both a bit worse reflecting the impact of defense charges taken earlier in the year. And on free cash flow, we generated $2.3 billion positive free cash flow in the year up significantly from the prior year driven by higher deliveries and order activity. Moving on to the next page. I just want to put that $2.3 billion of free cash flow in perspective. As you can see from the chart on the left, we've made a lot of progress over the last three years. 2020 was a usage of $20 billion of cash, 2021 improved but was still a usage of $4 billion of cash, in 2022, $2.3 billion positive. As Dave mentioned, a lot of work that's been done and more work to do. The team is pretty proud to get back to positive territory.  It's been the 737 return to service and the deliveries that are ramping. It's been the 787, it's been restarted. It's been the commercial market recovery that's been a benefit along the way with a very strong order book, reflecting our customers' confidence in our product lineup. And of course, our service business has held up incredibly well. It was a good exit to 2022, and we expect momentum to continue for 2023.  Moving on to the next page, cash and debt. On the cash and marketable securities front, we ended the year with $17.2 billion, up $3 billion versus the third quarter and we had $12 billion of revolving credit facilities, all of which remain undrawn. On the debt side, we finished the year with $57 billion in debt. And as a reminder, our investment-grade credit rating continues to be a top priority. Our liquidity position is strong, and we're very comfortable satisfying near-term maturities, and the overall plan continues to be deliver airplanes, generate cash, pay down debt. Moving on to the next page, 2023. Our financial outlook for 2023 is unchanged from what we shared in November. Operating cash flow in total will be between $4.5 billion and $6.5 billion. We'll reinvest about $1.5 billion in CapEx for a net free cash flow of $3 billion to $5 billion in 2023. As we start the year, overall demand remains strong. Global pass-through traffic increased almost 70% in 2022, and we're at 75% of pre-pandemic levels globally. If you take out China, that number grows to over 90%. So, demand is pretty robust and reflective of our order book. Our priority continues to be execution stability. And while we still see some disruptions in the factory and the supply chain, we're hard at work with our partners to address these issues and ultimately focused on meeting our customer commitments. On the segment operating cash flow, same numbers as November, BDS, we expect to be a usage of between $0.5 billion and $1 billion of cash. BGS will generate between $2.5 billion and $3 billion, and BCA will generate between $2.5 million and $3.5 billion. On the commercial delivery front, 737 deliveries are unchanged and between 400 and 450 airplanes, 787 deliveries are unchanged between 70 and 80 airplanes, and we've added a couple of items on the expense front. We expect R&D for 2023 to come in at about $3.2 billion versus $2.9 billion in 2022. The vast majority of this increase will be in BCA.  We also have unallocated eliminations in other which will be relatively in line with 2022 at $1.6 billion. One important thing to note is on the quarterly phasing, it will look very similar to last year as both deliveries and the financials will improve throughout the course of the year. On the first quarter specifically, EPS will be an improvement over 4Q 2022 but remain in a loss position. And cash will still be a usage in the first quarter, although an improvement from the first quarter of 2022. Overall, we're squarely focused on free cash flow. And it's so far so good as we enter 2023. Moving on to the last page, 2025, 2026 long-term guidance. Same page we showed you in November, $10 billion of free cash flow is still our objective. And it's important to note that margins and EPS are important, but they will be uneven over the next two years. As we unwind the BCA inventory, we put the BCA abnormal costs behind us, and we get the BDS margins back on track to its normal trajectory. We're still confident that this plan is underpinned by things we largely control. One, productivity. Two, the commercial rate ramp. Three, services growth and four, the transition of key defense programs from development to production. Overall, we're as confident today as we're back in November, and we feel good about the way 2023 is starting.  With that, I'll turn it over to Dave for any final comments. Dave Calhoun : Yes. I think, Brian, the numbers speak for themselves. We couldn't be more pleased with the way the year closed with very few surprises. We're heading into the year. We know the supply chain is going to be tough and constrained, but we also believe that we control that environment. It's our job to get ahead of it. So, thank you. We're happy to take some questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will be from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead. Peter Arment : Good morning, Dave and Brian. So congrats on the progress in billings in the fourth quarter and the free cash flow generation, and you reiterated, obviously, the long-term free cash flow target of $10 billion in the decade and the $3 billion to $5 billion in '23. So Brian, I guess, on '23, can you just maybe talk around confidence levels around that expected free cash flow target specifically at BCA and BDS, like kind of what are the key risk to call out, I assume it's supply chain around the guidance ranges? And then just, Dave, unrelated question, but can you comment broadly on the pickup in MAX flights in China as our checks show 220 revenue flights that are scheduled in February, and there's already 60 flights that have occurred this month. So clearly, there's MAX activity that's picking up in China? Thanks. Dave Calhoun : Yes, Peter, why don't I start with China. Your numbers are within the range of my numbers, that is what's going on. I think as everybody knows, the opening up of China is going to be a major event in aviation. And the aviation industry was already stressed in terms of demand broadly in the world. So this is a serious bump for everybody, but most importantly, within China, they need the MAX to fly to satisfy those demands. So we were going to do there what we do here in the U.S. and focus on the airplanes they have on the Tarmac today, which is close to 100 airplanes, the readiness of each and every one of them, and ultimately, they're getting into full revenue service. So for six months, I think that's the course for all of us to stay focused on. And then we're going to take up the question of deliveries. And is there a moment in time where that begins to come back. I don't want to predict that date, Peter, but the odds go up every day. Our MAX gets back into service and the airplanes that we have on our tarmacs, hopefully, we get ready and deliver to our customers. So, I think there's a reason to be optimistic. We will not change guidance and or predict those outcomes until they actually occur. Brian West : And Peter, on the cash flow, the 3% to 5%, again, we feel very confident with that range. The key underpinnings will be the deliveries that we talked about, the 37 at the low end assumes that we don't get much better through the course of 2023 than we did this past year, which is low 30s for the whole year. At the high end, it actually says we do low 30s first half and then low 40s in second half. So I think that all of that is within the mix. As you recall, we had a big December. One caution is that December was kind of over 50% on the MAXs, but October was not quite that high, and that's an indication that we're still not stable, it's still bumpy, but we still feel good about the overall trajectory in terms of being able to hit the $400 million to $450 million. And on the 87 similarly, I feel good about where we landed and then we were headed to hit the 70% to 80%, which underpins pretty much most of the cash flow for BCA, those two product lines. And then BDS, no change to what we thought things playing out pretty much as we expected. Peter Arment : Appreciate the color. Thanks. Operator : And next, we'll go to Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Doug Harned : Thank you. Good morning. When you look at the MAX right now, the good news is you don't have a demand problem. And as you guide to 31 a month production in 2023, and our assumption is that if you had engine delivery is higher, you can move up from there, given that you're facilitized and staffed for 38. And if you look out at the 2025 or 2026 timeframe, when you're guiding to 50 a month, you were once at 57 a month. So that would not be new territory. So what I'm trying to get at is when you look at these two years, clearly, there are supplier issues in '23, but is it feasible that you could see that production rate go higher? And if so, what would you want to see? And I look at '23 and '25 differently since '25, I'm assuming we'd be out from under a lot of these supplier issues. Dave Calhoun : Yes, Doug, again, I don't want to conjecture too much, but the two essential things to achieve that kind of objective. Number one, are we facilitized at that kind of rate? And the answer is, as we progress through this year, we'll be yes. Number two, and by far, the more challenging is, are we going to be stable, month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, predictable where the supply chain and the buffers that we put in place with respect to that supply chain are adequate. That's a harder, tougher put. I think it's going to take us all year to ultimately demonstrate that stability can and will be achieved. And if I get to that, and I hope I do, we do, then I'll take on that conjecture. But I -- for right now, we are just squarely focused on that question of stability. As Brian said, our fourth quarter was good. We finished well. We didn't have a lot of surprises in December. But if you look at the month-to-month in the quarter, you can't be happy with that. I mean just a few too many stoppages along the way. As you know, our philosophy is we're not going to travel anything anymore. We're not going to compound issues that occur. And we're going to maintain that philosophy. So watch the month-to-month, that's going to tell you a lot about our willingness to consider the rates you're talking about. Doug Harned : And is that true? And when you look out to the '25, '26 timeframe, obviously, there's a long way to go before we get there. How do you think about just flexibility given there may be a number of scenarios that could come out here in terms of production levels? Dave Calhoun : Well, as I said, will we be facilitized to handle that kind of volume at that stage? Yes, we'll stay well ahead of that. And you'll see things that occur over this year that will demonstrate that. So I'm -- that's the part of it. I'm not so worried about. Again, it's stability questions. And then there will be a factor that we'll have to apply with respect to China. We're going to have to believe we're back and we're back for good. Doug Harned : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Noah Poponak : Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about supply chain. Can you -- I heard you, Dave, that you're not going to mention any specific supplier and I hear that and respect that. But if you could provide any more detail on what's happening on the 787? Is there a new quality control escape? Or is it just pure timing delays, visibility into that getting better? Any incremental detail there would be really helpful. And then what's the latest from the engine OEMs? I sounded a little better yesterday, but what are you guys hearing? Dave Calhoun : Let me start with the latter of the engine discussion. Again, what I'm really happy with is the transparency with which we are planning for rates with our engine suppliers and you know who they are and predominantly one. And I'm feeling good about that. And we have plans to do it. I don't think any of us are yet at the high confidence moment on that, but we will. And that progression will occur over the course of the year when we are at high confidence, then we're going to get to the kind of rates that we -- that are built into our guidance. We've got a low end and a higher end and we'll find out where we're going to fit on that depending on it. But the transparency is amazing, no one's out guessing each other. And because this market has been so strong, no one is second guessing the rates. Everybody knows these rates, if we get to them, we'll achieve them and then we can continue to move forward. So there's a lot of good, but until we see it month to month and until we get to that high confidence moment, we're going to hold our production rate steady. And Brian, you're up to date on the 87 discussion. Brian West : Yes. So on the 87, so the fourth quarter was our first real full quarter in a while of being able to deliver airplanes, both still at a low rate and also from an inventory it feels pretty good. And as we go into 2023, remember, the scope of work is pretty clear what we have to do in terms of reworking the inventoried airplanes. But remember, our suppliers have a part of that responsibility in their scope. So, bringing the suppliers - the big suppliers along to make sure that they are conforming and they've got all the protocols in place to get that done on their end is something that we're working our way through. It's going to take us a little bit longer than originally expected, which is why we are going to shift out, going to five per month a bit later in the year but we still see 70 to 80 in the cards, and so far so good. What you'll likely see is some good liquidation of the inventory as we go through the year and then obviously ramp up the factory as we get deeper into the year. But net-net, the 70 to 80 we still feel good about. Operator : Next question is from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to clarify a couple of things. One, Brian, I think you mentioned $600 million higher abnormal cost on the 787. Is that cash? Is that absorbed now in the '23 unchanged free cash flow guidance? And then also for defense, if you can just touch on your margin profitability expectation and rough magnitude for 2023? Thanks. Brian West : Sure. So, in terms of the first question, the 787 abnormal, there is no cash impact. Part of that is just because part of that is just fixed cost absorption, but there's no change in the cash outlook. It's not significant in that regard. So, we're holding on the defense margins. So, in the quarter, as I mentioned, we had some bump around from the supply chain constraints and some of the labor, not just in the fourth quarter, as well as some of the timing of accruals that I mentioned. As we move our way into 2023, we clearly expect those margins to get better. It's not going to be all the way back to what normal might look like, but it's going to be improved sequentially. And we feel pretty good about the lineup in terms of the product portfolio. And as we remind you is that the products are performing incredibly well with the customers. So, we feel good about the underlying basis. BDS margins will get better, and we're positioned for that as we head into the year. Myles Walton : Alright. Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Kristine Liwag : Good morning, everyone. Dave, you mentioned the milestone order from United despite the macroeconomic uncertainty in the near and medium term. So, when you look at COVID-19 now approaching the rearview mirror, China reopening, I mean the demand for air travel has been pretty strong. Can you talk about what your customers are saying about potential new aircraft orders? Should we anticipate more airlines making landmark orders like United? And could we see BCA at a positive book-to-bill for the year? Dave Calhoun : Yes. Again, I always hesitate to forecast specific orders. I will say that we're involved in more big orders now than we've been in a long time. I think last year was a big indicator for folks that big orders are out there. I think the United One is, in fact, indicative. But Delta earlier, there's just -- there are some big interests in aviation, I'd say, the majority now outside the U.S. as opposed to inside the U.S. And we're considering some big -- some really big things. And we're in the midst of all of those. So yes, I have a -- I'm pretty optimistic. I'm not going to forecast numbers because that's never healthy. But I do think over the next couple of quarters, you'll see some big decisions made to both manufacturers, and you'll see some new entrants into the aviation world that aim to make a real difference, and again, largely in the global markets. Kristine Liwag : Thanks, Dave. If I could do a follow-up, with that environment that you described, it sounds pretty robust. Can you describe the pricing environment for these orders and how they compared to pre-COVID levels? Dave Calhoun : Yes. Well, when you're in the midst of any one deal, it feels ruthless. But if you really do balance it out, and I guess I credit both manufacturers, it's been pretty disciplined through this whole COVID moment. And so, you see very few reaches and sort of crazy things that are out of the norm. And now we're in sort of that supply chain constrained world where people simply want to get positions so that they know they have airplanes when the time comes. Recessions don't seem to get in the way because remember, we're competing for deliveries out four and five years from now. So they're not really computing recession into that. So anyway, again, I feel good, and I also -- I'm going to guess that -- because it's always a guess that pricing will stay disciplined. Kristine Liwag : Thank you. Operator : And next, we'll go to Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much. Good morning. And really, I guess, just a little bit of a quick clarification this morning rather than a question. Just making sure to understand the difference between production and deliveries this year on 737. When you say the high end of the guidance is assuming low 30s and moving to high 40s you're talking deliveries there. And then with regard to production, when you say that you are kind of hoping to get to a place where you see some stability this year, that's with regard to production in the factory. And so that would make it very -- make it seem unlikely that the production rate is going higher than 31% this year. Is that a fair way to think about things regardless of where that deliveries shake out? Brian West : You're right on characterizing the delivery framework. And I would say that as we move through the course of the year and we'll have fewer inventoried airplanes, that will put a little bit more opportunity on units come out of the factory. So production rate at the right moment could get higher. We'll wait and see. We're just going to stick to the range for now. Dave Calhoun : And as a reminder that we're not shooting for the low end of the range. Seth Seifman : Right, right. And as far as that stability that you're looking for, how much at this point would you say needs to come from improvement in the supply chain versus any improvement that's necessary in the internal productivity? Dave Calhoun : Yes. Look, I don't want to suggest that we don't have our own opportunities internally. We do, mostly driving cycle out and creating buffers in the right positions, et cetera, all things that you would attach to a company that really practices lean. So we will make improvements there. But the lion's share of the rate discussions is going to be built around the supply chain and the capacity, literally the capacity and capability of that supply chain to meet the new rates. And as I said, very transparent discussions. It's almost entirely built around labor availability, trained labor ability as we move through the course of the year. Hiring is not a constraint anymore. People are able to hire the people they need. It's all about the training and ultimately getting them getting them ready to do the sophisticated work that we demand. Seth Seifman : Thank you. Operator : And next, we go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr : Yes. Thank you very much. Could you update us on your efforts to certify the MAX 7 and 10 as well as the 777X? And as part of that, the agreement to allow you to push out the certification date of the 7 and the 10, I think you agreed to backfit some software changes on the existing MAX fleet. Could you tell us how much that's likely to cost? When did you take the accounting impact? Thanks. Dave Calhoun : I'll take the last part of that to get that off the table. The provision to retrofit the fleet was taken in the fourth quarter. That's behind us. It was small. And there's a reason why it's small. But I just -- I hope everybody knows and understands how important it was to get those extensions in place in the legislation. The argument was purely a safety argument. Fortunately, we got a lot of support on both sides of the aisle, and we got it done. So this gives us all the flexibility we need to get these airplanes certified under the existing applications and we feel good about that. We think first flights for the 7 will be this year and probably for the 10 next year. So we like where that stands. Everybody's calm, the FAA, nobody ever put pencils down. So we're just going to progress. And like always, we're not going to tell you exact dates as to when we expect those certifications. So all feels good. And then yes, the legislation that was approved included some improvements that we put into our cockpit on the DASH 10 that everybody agrees are useful and helpful to pilots. And those largely software adjustments will be incorporated into the entire MAX fleet over several years. As Brian said, it's not a large number, but we provided for it, and we're confident we can meet those objectives provided the CERT and those improvements are accomplished here in the next year or two. Cai von Rumohr : And the 777X? Dave Calhoun : No, I'm sorry. Everything is on course for the 777X. And I think the only issue that has created some concern over the last couple of years has been our agreement with the ASO and some of the design principles that we think we're making terrific progress with ASO. And I think we will have a coordinated regulatory approach to the set, and so we're staying on our targets. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you. Operator : And next, we'll go to David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss : Thanks for taking the question. Good morning. Could you touch on the large pickup in 787 deferred the balance in the quarter, what that means going forward for the cash outlook on the 87? And also, Brian, if you could just touch on the big pickup that we saw in the BCA unit loss, is that just related to the higher 787 deliveries in the quarter? Thanks. Brian West : Yes. On the deferred production balance, that's basically the 787 cost base extension that I mentioned has an impact on program margins, and that's amplified by all the finished goods inventory that's sitting there on the under airplanes. So that's driving the increase. And your last question, basically, it's impacted by customer mix and the impact of customer concessions and considerations. David Strauss : Okay. And a quick follow-up on the -- I think you said 138 China airplanes in inventory. Are you still looking to remarket those? Dave Calhoun : Yes, but only partially. And as of now, when you see the sort of the results of that effort, you can assume that will be on pause with respect to that until we get -- until we understand completely where China wants to go. So the answer is yes, and you'll see progress but you'll also see a pause so that we can discern what China wants to do. And hopefully, that's good news. David Strauss : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead. JasonGursky: Good morning, everybody. Brian, just a quick clarification question and then one over on the services business. And a clarification, you mentioned that margins at BDS tick up in '23, but don't get back to the long-term margin rates that you expect are on a normalized basis. Just curious what the milestones are going to be for us to be watching out for on getting back to those normalized rates? And then on the services business. Maybe just a little bit more color on expectations for '23 with regard to your expectations on growth rate and margins? Thanks. Brian West : Yes, sure. On the BDS. So as you mentioned, long term, high single digits, is what we've talked about. But in the near term, the same kind of supply chain constraints and labor availability that we've talked about in the BCA world, impact the BDS role as well. So when the current environment is less constrained and stabilizes, that will be a benefit. We expect it to happen partly in 2023, but the key thing to watch is just the stability of the supply chain is going to be a big, big deal that we're keeping our eye on. And that's going to be important as margins will tend to accelerate. The time and the pace remains to be seen, but it will get better in 2023. On the services side, so we had a big year for the services business. It's going to have to -- and part of that was based on the commercial recovery, and we enjoyed the benefit of that in 2022. But BGS, in terms of their revenue, they finished the quarter at a pretty good spot pretty clean basis. And if you just kind of think about that as how you would extrapolate into 2023 by quarter gives you a pretty good view of where we see that growth coming for. So it will grow, margin will be just fine right within that mid-teen levels that we've enjoyed. So we feel pretty good about the prospects of the service business, very stable, continue to grow, no surprises. Jason Gursky : Great. Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead. RonEpstein: Good morning, everyone. Just circling back on thinking about product development and so on and so forth. Like you mentioned at the Investor Day that Boeing wouldn't be going forward with a middle of the market product probably until sometime in the 2030s. How should we think about that in light of the recent win with NASA on the -- that you trust based -- the trust brace transonic win program and what that means? Could that be some early technology on a new platform? Or what are you looking for to happen in the technology world to feel confident about doing something new? Dave Calhoun : Yes. So Ron, I'm going to highlight three things that I think are going to contribute to a truly differentiated new product. One of them is the trust wing, so I'll refer to that now. As you know, that is technology that's been worked on for the better part of a decade alongside of NASA. And the program that we've embarked on here is how do you commercialize it? How do we put it through the right set of tests, et cetera, so that, in fact, can be incorporated into new airplanes? So there's real intent there to be able to do it. I'm not sure it is going to be as good and/or applicable for middle of the market and/or a wide-body, but it will definitely have a role to play someday in the narrow-body world. So that's number one. Number two, you've heard us talk about the digital thread being able to create the digital model, not just for the airplane, but for the factory and for the servicing. But we are really cutting our teeth on a couple of defense programs that, frankly, we're learning a lot every day, all day, so that whatever we do on that next commercial airplane will incorporate the digital threat. And it will be way more mature than what it's been so far in our discrete defense programs. So anyway, I feel very good about that. And then the last major element has been the one that usually carried the day, but in this case, I think will simply contribute to a better day and that's propulsion technologies, bigger bypass ratios, and you probably know a trusting setup, trusting setup will create that opportunity to a far greater extent than today's wing simply because of the distance from the ground. So there are lots of reasons why I think these technologies can and will be proven and ultimately adapted. And when you're considering a 50-year kind of program for any new airplane, you have to think about this. And in our view, the objective has to be somewhere between 25% and 30% better than it is today. And that's what we're focused on. And I think we have the time to do it and the technologies to play out. Ron Epstein : Got it. And if I can, just a quick detailed follow-on. What are you thinking about headcount productions as we go -- headcount projections as we go into '23? I mean how has it been in the labor market kind of across the supply chain, which you hear is everybody needs more people. And how has it been for Boeing? And what are you doing to try to cross that bridge? Dave Calhoun : Yes. Ron, I want to be clear. We have had no trouble hiring people, none. We're sort of at or a little above where we were in the days you guys all remember because we've got so many of these rework apparatus going on, and there are a lot of people required to do it. So our job is to actually just take what we have, incorporate all the learning from the folks who are doing the rework that will displace whatever retirements and or demographic issues that we have over the next couple of years. We have a pretty good setup on labor and a pretty good mechanism ironically with these return to service aircraft and the joint verification, a pretty good mechanism to train mechanics, train our people to do the job. And on the engineering front, man, we've had a real good run hiring is over 10,000. Our job is to make sure that we just train them right, get them involved early and get on the life. So we are not facing a big demand. Our supply chain probably still is working the hiring a bit, but it's nowhere near as important as their -- the training of the people that they're bringing in. I've seen this thing really ease up in the last year, like really ease up. Tier 1s, I doubt any of them are really fighting for talent anymore. And underneath that, I think the supply chains are filling out. It's all about now that training and development. Ron Epstein : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And next, we'll go to Rich Safran with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead. RichSafran: Dave, Brian and Matt, good morning. So you're not going to be surprised, I'd like to ask you about defense. I wanted to know, first, could you broadly discuss your defense portfolio, the opportunity set and what we should be focusing on? Just by example, I noticed that AIAA you were discussing a C-17 C-130 recap. Second to that, could you also discuss the F-15EX program in terms of expectations for deliveries, production rates? And also if margins on the program might be comparable to what we saw when you were selling older models under FMS? Thanks. Dave Calhoun : Yes. So let me take this one. Let me address it at the portfolio level. In light of the difficulties we've had with the fixed-price development contracts, which I consider more of a contracting exposure as opposed to a portfolio exposure, I feel really good about the portfolio broadly, and there are reasons why I feel that way. We're fully invested, as you know, autonomy. I believe autonomy and teaming are going to be one of the real drivers with respect to airplane development, Air Force, Navy requirements going forward. And we're already invested and we're making real progress with both of those members of the fighting forces. And I'm sure you know the programs that we talk about. And there are others we can't talk about, which we're as excited, if not more excited about. So the long portfolio and the development that we've sustained over all these years, I feel really good about. We have the T7 trainer. It's way more important than just the market for trainers itself. Ultimately, we think it's -- it can be used as a derivative to do other things for the Air Force, and I'm sure you know what that's about. But maybe even more importantly, it's an absolute poster child for our digital thread. And it's teaching our customers how to think about the use of the digital thread, and it's teaching us how to perfect all the production technologies that we need to take full advantage of the digital trend. So if I look at our -- just our sort of our wing fleets, I feel very good about where we are. And as you point out, the F-15 -- the new derivatives boy, they are really important to our customers. We feel great about the future. It feels like a new platform, frankly, from my perspective, I'm not going to hand out the production rates at this stage, but we're feeling pretty good about the international demand as well as our U.S. demand. And you know, in light of the only other choices, this gets, frankly, more valuable over time until the really new classified work ultimately was completed and brought to the market. Anyway, I feel quite good about the portfolio. It's development where we stand in it. And I'm sorry, some of the contracting methods that we used in the early going here, but anyway, we are where we are. And I can't get off the page without talking about the tanker, which we all still believe very, very strongly and, again, difficult contracting moment for us. On the other hand, futility to the Air Force has been fantastic. The Vision system our commitment to it and then technologies beyond that allow for even autonomous refueling. These are things we're fully invested in, and we believe in the growth of the industry and the need with our customer. So anyway, there are other things, and you probably know a lot of that, but there's a reason to feel good, frankly, on the development front with respect to Boeing's defense business. Rich Safran : Thanks for that, Dave. Brian West : John, we have time for one more question. Operator : Certainly, and that will be from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good morning, guys. And thank you. I know it's been asked a thousand different ways, but I don't know if I know the answer yet. So maybe, Dave, can you give us an idea of how -- where you are on the MAX and 787 from a cash per aircraft perspective? Or how far that is below prior peak? And is there a cadence of that profitability, free cash flow as we think about production rates increasing, supply chain impacts and just pricing as you get aircraft out of inventory. Dave Calhoun : Let me take a shot at the -- I'll talk cash margins, and let's start with the 787. So near term, they're pressured but positive, and we got to work through all the things that we've been describing. In long term, they're going to be higher than they were back in 2018, driven by productivity, pricing in the Dash 10 model. So the 87 feels like it's on the verge of doing some real special stuff over the long term. On the 37, near-term pressure because all the supply chain things we talked about, some customer mix things that we're going to battle through and possibly some impact to remarketing. And then long term, it's going to be more or less in line with what it was before and the benefit being the productivity and the rate ramp. So that's kind of how we think about those two programs over time from a cash perspective. Brian West : Really -- Sheila, you really have to get through calendar year '24. And then a lot of the cloud, a lot of the things that we've been wrestling with, the things that impact the -- our margins and the lumpiness along the way, that all begins to clear as we get to the tail end of '24. And as we think about '25 and on, I think that clarity will be apparent to everybody. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Great. Thank you. Matt Welch : And that concludes our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Thank you for joining. Dave Calhoun : Thanks, everyone.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and the slide presentation, plus the analyst question-and-answer session are being broadcast live over the Internet. [Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Matt Welch, Vice President of Investor Relations for Boeing. Mr. Welch, please go ahead. Matt Welch : Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. I am Matt Welch, and with me today are Dave Calhoun, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian West, Boeing's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  As a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation at boeing.com. As always, detailed financial information is included in today's press release. Furthermore, projections, estimates and goals included in today's discussion involve risks, including those described in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of the web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures. Now I will turn the call over to Dave Calhoun. David Calhoun : Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We had a solid first quarter, and we continue to make real progress, steady progress in our recovery. Challenges remain. There's more to do. But overall, we feel good about the operational and financial outlook shared last November, including cash flow and delivery ranges set for 2023 as well as for the 2025, 2026 time frame, where we can see $10 billion in annual free cash flow. Let's start with an update on our 737. Our team has been working hard over the last week. We've been progressing in our early inspection of affected airplanes. The issue's understood. It's isolated to two specific fittings, and we know what we have to do. The work will impact the timing of our deliveries over the next several months. However, we still expect to deliver 450 737 airplanes this year. Unfortunately, the timing of these delivery shortfalls will impact summer capacities for many of our customers, and we feel terrible about that. Deliveries and production will be lower near term, but we will recover over the coming months, and we plan to increase our rate to 38 per month later this year. As mentioned last week, we're also not changing the supplier master schedule to ensure that they can keep pace, and we're comfortable adding parts inventory. Stepping back, we appreciate that Spirit promptly notified us of this issue. They're an important partner. We're working closely on the recovery plan, and we are working in a very constructive way. We will continue to work transparently with the FAA as always. As well, we will work transparently with our customers to support their fleet planning and scheduling requirements. As we mentioned last week, there's no immediate safety of flight issue, and the fleet can continue to operate safely. We will work diligently through this process together. We will prioritize safety. We will prioritize quality and transparency every step of the way. Taking a wider view. I couldn't be more proud of the MAX team and the progress that we have made. We now have over 1,000 737 MAX airplanes flying in the fleet. And since our return to service, the fleet has safely flown more than 4 million flight hours with exceptional reliability. And with respect to China, our focus has been and is on supporting our customers and their return to service. All MAX operators have returned to flying airplanes in service, and 45 of their 95 airplanes are back in the sky. In addition, the CAAC released their 737 Aircraft Evaluation Report. It's an important step toward the delivery of aircraft that are currently in Boeing's possession. We will follow the lead of our customers. Moving to BCA. I'll start with orders. Demand remains very strong across all of our product lines. We booked 107 net airplane orders in the first quarter. And on top of this, we were proud to announce major customer commitments earlier this year : Air India, 190 737 MAX, 20 787s and 10 777Xs; and Riyadh Air, the newly established airline in Saudi Arabia; and Saudia, ordering up to 121 787 airplanes. On the subject of deliveries, with strong demand, we're working to meet our customer commitments. We delivered 130 commercial airplanes in the quarter, including a strong month in March with 64 deliveries. However, variation in monthly deliveries remains high, and we still have work to improve stability. Of course, that starts with the 737, as I mentioned earlier. On the subject of production, we are also steadily increasing rates across key programs to meet the robust demand. And we'll prioritize our stability and not push the system too fast. And yes, we will pause when we are notified of defects. On development, we're progressing across all of our key development programs. And certification time lines have not changed on the 737-7, -10 or the 777X. Now let me switch to BDS, Boeing Defense. In defense and space, we still have more work to do to improve our operating performance. But our portfolio is well positioned, and our products are performing well in the field. First quarter results were impacted by the added cost on the KC-46A Tanker program, driven by a supplier quality issue that we previously shared last month. The good news is we understand it, and we're progressing through that rework. On the operational side, the tanker is continuing to perform its mission well. Customers' decision on the KC-Y is a great opportunity for us, and it reflects the capabilities the tanker is delivering for the United States Air Force. On the demand side, we're continuing to see solid order activity. In the quarter, we booked key orders on the tanker, the Apache and E-7. In addition, we are accelerating the delivery of missiles and weapons in response to our customers' needs. We're also encouraged by the initial presidential budget request recently released. It's in line with our expectations. And our portfolio and capabilities are well positioned to support the needs of the nation and our allies, both in the short and the long term. Our defense business is well positioned, and we'll continue to improve operational performance to more normalized levels. In Boeing Global Services, another very strong quarter. Solid, steady performance has enabled both commercial and military customers to keep fleets flying through a very dynamic time. The services business has now fully returned to pre-pandemic levels. I'm very proud of the team and the progress that they have made. All things considered across the businesses, we remain on the right path. We'll work through most recent MAX issue transparently and in partnership with our customers and our suppliers. We're focused on the long term, and we'll continue to drive stability across the business and the supply chain. In our November guidance, we did not predict significant supply chain improvement until well into 2024. We remain in the same place today and share that same view.  That said, we've seen improvement, and our line of sight is getting better every day. Demand is strong and our portfolio is well positioned. We have a robust pipeline of development programs, and we're innovating in new capabilities to prepare for the next generation of products. Lots of work to do, but we're on track to restore our operational and our financial strength. And we still feel good about the outlook that we've shared, both for this year and for our longer term. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Brian West : Great. Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's go to the next page and cover the total company results. First quarter revenue was $17.9 billion. That's up 28% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher volume in both commercial and defense. Core operating margin was minus 2.5%, and the core loss per share was $1.27, both big improvements versus last year due to higher commercial volume and improved operating performance. Margins and EPS were negative driven by expected abnormal costs and period expenses as well as a charge on the KC-46 Tanker program that I noted last month. Free cash flow was a usage of $786 million in the quarter, significantly better versus last year driven by the higher commercial deliveries as well as an advanced payment tied to lot 9 on the tanker program, another important award for the KC-46 franchise. As we noted in our last earnings call, cash was lower this quarter than the fourth quarter due to lower wide-body deliveries and expected seasonality. Turning to the next page, I'll cover Commercial Airplanes. Let's start with orders. BCA booked 107 net orders in the quarter, including JAL and Lufthansa, and we have a backlog of over 4,500 airplanes valued at $334 billion. Moving to the figures on the left. Revenue was $6.7 billion, up 60% year-over-year, driven by 130 airplane deliveries with increases on both the 87 and the 37 programs, partially offset by 87 customer considerations. Operating margin was minus 9.2%, which was significantly better than last year. But margins are impacted by expected abnormal costs and period expenses, including higher R&D spending. Let's take a minute on the 737 program. The 37 had 113 deliveries in the first quarter, up 31% year-over-year, including 53 deliveries in the month of March. Picking up where Dave left off regarding the supplier fuselage item. We found the issue. We booked a nonmaterial financial impact in the quarter. We understand the rework steps required, and we started repairs on several airplanes. And although near-term deliveries will be impacted, we still expect to deliver between 400 and 450 737s this year. April and 2Q deliveries will be lower, but the first half monthly average will be about 30 airplanes per month, in line with what we said previously. The second half deliveries are expected to be around 40 per month, with sequential quarterly improvement in the back half. While the high end of the delivery range is pressured, ultimate performance will be dictated by the pace of the fuselage recovery. Regarding inventory, we ended the quarter with approximately 225 MAX airplanes in inventory, including 138 that were built for customers in China and roughly 30 -7s and -10s. Within these 225 inventoried airplanes, roughly 75% will require the fuselage rework. And the number of inventoried airplanes will likely increase in 2Q, and we still expect most to be delivered by the end of 2024. On production, we're completing airplanes in final assembly and expect to recover in the coming months, paced by fuselage availability. We're supporting Spirit through this recovery, including manufacturing and engineering resources as well as a cash advance. To support overall supply chain stability, we're not changing the master schedule, including anticipated production rate increases and we've contemplated any near-term parts inventory builds into our forward look. Within final assembly, as Dave mentioned, we expect to increase our rate to 38 per month later this year and 50 per month in the '25, '26 time frame. Moving on to the 787 program. We had 11 deliveries in the first quarter and still expect 70 to 80 deliveries this year. We're producing at 3 per month and still plan to reach 5 per month by year-end. We ended the quarter with 95 airplanes in inventory, most of which will be delivered by the end of 2024. We booked 379 of abnormal costs in the quarter, in line with expectations, and there's no change to the total estimate of $2.8 billion. We still expect abnormal to be largely done by the end of this year. Finally, on the 777X program, efforts are ongoing. Both the program time line and the abnormal estimate of $1.5 billion are unchanged. We booked $126 million of abnormal costs in the quarter, in line with expectations. With that, let's turn to the next page and go through defense and space. BDS booked $10 billion in orders during the quarter, including awards for the U.S. Air Force for 15 KC-46 Tankers and an E-7 development contract as well as 184 Apaches for the U.S. Army. The BDS backlog is $58 billion. Moving to the figures on the left. Revenue was $6.5 billion, up 19% year-over-year, driven by the KC-46 Tanker award, program milestone completions and underlying volume. We delivered 39 aircraft and 3 satellites in the quarter and also began production of the MH-139 Grey Wolf. Operating margin was minus 3.2%, significantly higher than last year but still negative, driven by a $245 million pretax charge on the tanker program, which I noted last month. Let me give you a little bit of context on the overall BDS portfolio. Remember, 15% of the revenues in the quarter are the firm fixed-price development contracts. These contracts get a lot of attention, and there is a commitment to derisk these programs as much as we can as we move through the development cycles and into full-scale, stable production. Next and importantly, over 60% of revenues in the quarter collectively delivered double-digit margins. We have many important programs that are performing to historical performance levels. The balance of the 1Q revenue is made up of a small number of established programs that are experiencing negative margins on certain contracts due to specific near-term supply chain and factory stability pressures that we've highlighted previously. It will take time to work through these issues, and we fully expect that these programs will improve through the course of this year and return to normal margin levels over time. The BDS team is fully committed delivering the development programs to our customers. We've implemented new contracting disciplines, accelerated efforts around lean manufacturing and we're investing in innovation and in our people, all of which underpin our plans going forward. Overall, the defense portfolio is well positioned. There's strong demand across the customer base, the products are performing in the field, and we're confident that our efforts to drive execution and stability will return this business to performance levels that our investors would recognize. Turning to the next page, I'll cover Global Services. As Dave mentioned, BGS had another very strong quarter. We received $4 billion in orders during the quarter, and the backlog is $19 billion. Looking to the figures on the left. Revenue was $4.7 billion, up 9% year-over-year, primarily driven by our commercial parts and distribution business. Operating margin was 17.9%, an expansion of 330 basis points versus last year, with both our commercial and government businesses delivering double-digit margins. Operating margins in the quarter were higher than expected due to favorable mix, and we don't assume that will repeat. In the quarter, BGS announced the first Boeing Converted Freighter line in India, delivered AerCap's 50th 737-800 Boeing Converted Freighter and broke ground on a new component operations facility in Jacksonville, Florida. Turning to the next page, I'll cover cash and debt. We ended the quarter with $14.8 billion of cash and marketable securities, and our debt balance decreased to $55.4 billion. We paid down $1.7 billion of debt maturities in the quarter and absorbed the expected cash flow usage driven by seasonality. We also had $12 billion of revolving credit facilities at the end of the quarter, all of which remain undrawn. Our liquidity position is very strong. The investment-grade credit rating is a priority, and we're deploying capital in line with the priorities we' ve shared : generate strong cash flow, invest the business and pay down debt. And flipping to the last page on our outlook. The 2023 financial outlook is unchanged from what we previously shared, including $3 billion to $5 billion of free cash flow generation. Commercial demand remains strong across our key programs and services.  Passenger traffic in February increased over 55% year-over-year and is at 85% of pre-pandemic levels, comprised [indiscernible] domestic and 78% international. Defense demand is robust, and the initial FY '24 presidential budget is in line with expectations. As Dave mentioned, our portfolio and capabilities are well positioned to support the needs of the nation and of our allies. On the supply chain front, as you'll recall when we set out our 2023 framework last November, we predicted the supply chain instability would likely continue. The good news is that we plan for it within our financial and delivery guidance. There's progress in many areas of the supply base, but we will likely face pockets of variability through the rest of this year. We continue to make key investments, including higher inventory buffers and forward deployment of resources as we take appropriate actions to mitigate impacts and improve predictability. From a quarterly perspective, we continue to expect financials to improve throughout the year. On 2Q specifically, we expect core EPS will be roughly in line with 1Q '23 performance absent the tanker charge, as the 737 delivery impacts would be largely offset by higher wide-body deliveries. We expect free cash flow to be breakeven to slightly negative as we work through the 37 recovery. All things considered, we feel good about what's in front of us. And we remain on track to achieve our long-term guidance, including $10 billion of free cash flow in the '25, '26 time frame. With that, I'll turn it over to Dave for any closing comments. David Calhoun : Yes, not much to add. Just a reminder that in November, when we did finally set out guidance for all of our investors, we described an environment that would continue to be strained through 2023 and through most of 2024. We still see the world exactly that way. Demand is as robust, if not more than what we had thought back in November, and so we remain confident. So thanks for your time, and let's take some questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Myles Walton : Dave, the quality slip or escape at Spirit, it sounds like it's been going on for several years actually. So I think the natural question we've been getting is, why did it take so long to discover? And how should we be comfortable that things like this won't continue to pop up, particularly with the FAA's sort of renewed zero tolerance for noncompliant deliveries? David Calhoun : Yes, Myles, I appreciate the question. This particular defect, I happen to take a look at it, by the way, along with the rest of my Board. We happen to have our shareowner meeting shortly after the issue came to our attention. It's not only a defect. It's in that app section of our airplane and very difficult to visibly assess. In fact, it's impossible to visibly assess once the process to do it is complete. So without witnessing firsthand that process in action, you're not likely to find it from that point forward. It's -- process was not standard. And importantly, there was a ceiling that was applied on top of the fitting that made it impossible to notice any cracks. So it's just one of those. Again, no safety implications. The margins in our designs provide for significantly greater safety protection. So anyway, I don't ever accept and I hope you don't think we might ever accept that where these things go on, but this one, in particular, very, very difficult, no matter how many people you put in the field or that Spirit puts out there to see. Anyway, the good news is we've now been through the unveiling of the issue. We've been through the rework procedures, both on the captured fuselages in our factory that have not yet gone through the subsequent stages. And we've already looked at finished good airplanes where we have to remove the fin in order to get at it. And these are all now defined work scopes. And now we just get more efficient in the process of doing that reworking. That's why we're confident in our guidance.  But again, we don't accept them. They are, without a doubt, over time, becoming more manageable. And things like this, I will celebrate the fact that an employee witnessed the procedure and raised his hand and said, \"That doesn't look right.\" That is the only way that we would have ultimately found out about it. And I'm encouraging everybody in our supply chain, if they see something of that sort, to raise their hand. Operator : The next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Sheila  Kahyaoglu: Maybe how do we think about BCA margins going forward? How do we think about the production trajectory of your impact, concessions historically in aircraft and inventory impacting BCA margins? Brian West : Yes. Thanks, Sheila, for the question. Broadly speaking, as we've said, margins will be a bit volatile this year and the next as we do a couple of big things. First, we got to liquidate the 37 and 87 inventory levels as well as shutting down those shadow factories. We also have to move through the abnormal expenses on the 87, the 777 and then prepare to ramp rates.  So it will be a little up and down as we move through and get out and get out of next year. In terms of the near term, I did indicate last month that the first quarter BCA margins would be lower than fourth quarter, and that's for things like the abnormal and things like the lower volume. 2Q will also be negative.  But as we move into the back half of the year, the margins will improve. And of course, as Dave mentioned, by the time we get to '25, '26, we still see a path to get BCA back to the double-digit margins that you all recognize. So we got to work through what's in front of us. It's clearly defined, and we just got to execute. Operator : The next question is from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Douglas Harned : On the 787, you're on the path to reach 5 a month in Q4 and then go to 10 a month in '25, '26. And you've also had some discussions that the rate could potentially go higher longer term. Now this is all being done in Charleston. And if we go back a few years, the maximum capacity at Charleston was 7 a month. So as you go to 10 per month there or higher, what do you need to do in terms of investment? And how would you expect margins for the 787 out of a single facility then compared to what they were before the downturn when you were operating out of both Everett and Charleston? David Calhoun : So let me start from the back end and work my way toward the front end. As you might imagine, when you go from 2 to 1 and you optimize that 1 and you don't transport parts from one to another, you expect higher margins, and we do, and I'm confident we will achieve that. With respect to investment, this has a lot less to do with physical investment in equipment and more to do with how we route things through that factory. Today, our factory is pretty constrained because we have this joint verification effort that has taken up lots of space, both inside the factory and we continue to do that workup up in Everett. So we have got to work our way through that. We have a team that works full time planning the new routings in the factories, and we're confident we can get it to 10. I don't think -- not only don't think, we don't see a big demand on investment to get us from what you noted as 7 to 10. So it's just going to take us time, and we've got to remove that joint verification effort from our business. Brian West : And Doug, as it turns to margin, on the program margin side, we fully expect by the '25, '26 time frame to have 87 margins that are higher than they were back in '18. And it will be because of things like this consolidation to Charleston. And also on the cash front, on the unit margin perspective, 87 margins will get better on the improved -10 content as well as the benefits that Dave described of consolidating in Charleston. So we think we've got a good plan in front of us, and we are very focused on 10. 10's the number, and there's like execution that's underwriting that. Operator : The next question is from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Noah Poponak : Wanted to try to ask about the 737 pace in the near term and then also in the medium term between now and the plan you've outlined for '25. So I guess, how many units are somewhere in process somewhere in a factory? It seems like those need to be reworked before you could then restart to sort of clean off the line units. Brian, it sounds like the averaging 30 for the first 6 months, you kind of have implied second half of April as disrupted, May as maybe heavily disrupted, June starts to look normal again. Is that all correct? And then in the medium term, in terms of the ramp, there's some reputable press talking about this 38 being close to the middle of the year, wanting to be at 42 early in '24 and wanting to be at 52 early in '25. I guess we know the demand is there. In a scenario where the supply chain is relatively consistent, is that at least what you're working towards? Brian West : Yes. Let's start with that back end. So we will have a plan to get to 38. In terms of subsequent ramps to higher numbers, let's let that take care of itself. Let's focus on getting to 38. And we still believe that 50 is the number in '25, '26. And in terms of the near term, so in terms of what's in front of us, we know barrel by barrel in Spirit's factory and obviously, we know everyone in our factory in terms of what's got to get done. If the unit is not too far into the production -- our production cycle, the time to take to repair one of these, it's days. As you have the vertical fin on an airplane, obviously, it's more complicated, then it takes more time. But we will sort our way out. In the near term, getting back to production levels that are normal will be months. In terms of the inventory that we've described, the 225 finished goods inventory, 75% of those are going to have to have this fix. The good news is that this will not take us off our path to liquidate that inventory in the 37 of 225 by the -- largely by the time we get out of 2025. It's going to cost a little bit more. We provided for that -- 2024 rather, yes, liquidated by 2024. It will take a little bit more cost, but we factored that into our closing position in the first quarter. So all in all, we think we know what's in front of us and working closely with Spirit. And as we move our way out of the short-term recovery, then we get back to an area we can start to get to the 38. And I think that the -- for us, the biggest thing is that, one, we're calling it out; and two, we have not changed the master schedule. And that's a big deal. We want to make sure that the supply chain keeps pace as we move our way through the rest of the year. David Calhoun : Noah, on the finished goods, by the way, it's two things to keep in mind. One, we are largely through a couple of them already. So -- and we are defining the scope of that work and again, measured in a few weeks, not measured in months. And so we're confident in that. But the other thing to keep in mind on the finished goods is you know we have a big conformance work scope now even without that defect. A lot of that work can get done concurrently, so it's not a pure add. Noah Poponak : Right. Right. The finished goods, it would just seem like as long as you can rework faster than you deliver, that doesn't change your pace and the deliveries were -- the percentage of deliveries from that wasn't enormous. So that makes sense. That's what I was sort of trying to get at, what's factory, but I think I better understand it now. So appreciate all that color. Operator : The next question is from Rob Spingarn from Melius Research. Robert Spingarn : Just a quick clarification and then a question. The clarification, the production rates you're talking about, the 38, et cetera, is that Renton only? Or does that include deliveries out of inventory from Moses -- or rather production out of Moses Lake on the mods? And then the question is on the pricing environment, just with the other guys sold-out on narrow-bodies and the 787 really being the strongest airplane out there on the wide-body side at least from a demand perspective, how has the pricing been on these big recent orders? And how do you [Audio Gap] as we go forward here? Brian West : You broke up a little bit at the end of your question on pricing. Could you just... Robert Spingarn : So it didn't work. Basically, I just asked you, with the sold-out conditions on the narrow-body side at Airbus, how's pricing on the MAX? And then on the wide-body side, 787 is arguably the strongest offering. So how is pricing there just given the demand situation? David Calhoun : Yes. Let me comment on pricing, particularly on the wide-body world. Nobody is sold-out. We're just all selling further out. So we still compete and then we -- the deliveries themselves are important competitive factor in everything that we go for and then pricing follows. So the implication that the pricing environment is firming is probably a solid point of view, and we don't discuss pricing on these calls other than to suggest that as tight as the market is, it's both the prospect of when you get your airplane and the price itself. And each and every competition, we all do what we got to do. I will say I'm very happy and pleased with the orders that we have won, and I'm sure Airbus says the same. Brian West : And in your clarification question, the first part, that 38 is the final assembly number. So right now, it's at 31, movement of 38 sometime later in the year. Robert Spingarn : So it's a Renton number. Brian West : Yes. Operator : The next question is from David Strauss from Barclays. David Strauss : Just following up on the MAX issue. Has Spirit fixed the manufacturing issue from their end? In other words, are fuselages coming off their line clean now? And when would you actually start to expect to see those come to you? Brian West : They know the fix there, they know the scope, and they're going to start delivering clean ones imminently. So we feel good about what they've got to go do. Of course, the harder work is on our end for something that's in finished goods inventory. David Strauss : Okay. Quick follow-up, I think from the Investor Day, I recall the pacing item on going to 38 a month being activating the third line in Renton. Have you actually activated the third line at this point? Brian West : You bet. David Calhoun : And we're still moving forward on the fourth. Operator : The next question is from Jason Gursky from Citi. Jason Gursky : Just a quick question on the outlook for orders in the commercial business. So wondering if you could kind of provide a little bit of color on your expectations from a book-to-bill perspective for the year, given the pipeline that you're seeing. And I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves here, getting the MAX back up in the air and China is great. Deliveries are next. But I'd also be interested to get your thoughts on the future for deliveries in China specifically. David Calhoun : Yes. Let me start. I want to make sure -- I want to speak out of both sides of my mouth here, if you don't mind. Number one, all of our guidance, all of our expectations are predicated on no China. So everything that we've discussed by way of production rate, supply constraints and demand in the marketplace does not factor that in, and I want to be clear about that. On the other hand, we are working very hard to regain China. And if and when we're able to do that, it takes risk out of the delivery of the finished goods inventory simply because there's less work to do in getting the airplanes to their originally intended customer. But it doesn't change much by way of production rates or anything along those lines because we're already -- our rates all the way out to 50 and beyond are constrained by supply. They're not -- these are not demand rates. I think we could add plenty if I thought the supply could meet it. So -- and with respect to how I think we should think about future orders, all I know is that every next order and they're sizable, and there are plenty in play as we speak, deliveries are further and further out. So now we're out, believe it or not, in the 30s. So it's -- I think that's the best way to just think about it, what does the backlog support in terms of deliveries over what period of time. And right now, we're out competing in years far out, 5, 6, 7 years. Operator : The next question is from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen. Cai Von Rumohr : At the November Investor Day, you laid out a forecast of cash flow of $3 billion to $5 billion this year. And since that time, you've taken a couple of shells, you see the 737, you discussed the 767, and you mentioned because of supply chain having to build to higher inventories. So there were a lot of bad guys in that revised number. What are the good guys to get you home to stay in that number? I know you had the $1 billion tanker advance, but are the advances from airline customers substantially better? What are the good things in that forecast that allow you to maintain it? David Calhoun : Cai, let me start with a reminder, and then I'll let Brian mention one or two good guys. Sort of the tanker advance, we had always counted on. So it may have come a little earlier because of their need to get tankers in the field. But that was always counted on. But what we did when we gave you that guidance is we did not, like I said, expect the supply chain to come ripping back, and we never have any problems. So there was some judgment applied when we gave the range that we would have to live through some of these things. Now I would suggest that one or two of these might have been a little tougher than things we were thinking about, but not much. And so anyway, that was factored into our guidance. And that will continue -- that factor continues all the way into 2024. So Brian, you might want to comment on a couple of individual things. Brian West : Yes, just a couple of things. Thanks for the question, Cai. On the first quarter, 87 deliveries were a little light. We'll make that back up in the rest of the year. You mentioned the tanker benefit. That's something that we always plan for later in the year. The customer just wanted to get it done a bit sooner, which we think is good. So that's the first quarter. And then in the second quarter, as I mentioned, we'll be in more of a breakeven position largely because of the 737s that are going to push out. But again, it's going to be back half benefit. In the second half, as I think about the acceleration, it's going to be the 37 recovery, the 37 rate ramp. And there's going to be wide-bodies that are going to accelerate across the board, 777, 87, 67. So all of that's contemplated. And we've still got high conviction along that range. High end might be a little bit pressured, but we're committed to delivering that commitment of $3 billion to $5 billion. Operator : Peter Arment from RW Baird. Peter Arment : Dave, I appreciate your comments on China. And I know you've derisked the skyline out through '26 on sort of deliveries, but seems like it's important steps that the regulator made. I'm just wondering whether you see this as that these next steps to delivery, is it customer-driven? Or is it still regulator-driven? How do you interpret that? David Calhoun : Yes. Again, I don't want anything to get misinterpreted here. The China market, which in my view has always been the issue with respect to taking deliveries of airplanes, has come back as robustly as anyone might have imagined. And domestic travel now is at the pre-pandemic level and will continue to grow. So they need airplanes. And so I'll just sort of state as a fact that our customers, in my view, are going to need more airplanes in the relatively near to medium term. And this is a pretty easy way for them to satisfy that need. So rather than get involved in any geopolitical discussion because no geopolitical discussion is actually required here. It's -- we have orders on the books. We have airplanes on the tarmac. And so this is just a nod from the Chinese government that they would like to take delivery of their airplanes. So that is the situation as it exists. And I'm going to stick with sort of my posture, if you don't mind, that all of our guidance and all of our activities are going to assume that the best things don't happen. And if they do, then we will welcome that news and get back to all of you. Operator : The next question is from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Seth Seifman : Dave, I wonder if we just talk for a second about Spirit in a broader context. I think the current issue might even predate the grounding, but they've been struggling there on a couple of different fronts lately. And the idea of moving to 38 and then to 50 is you can only go as fast as they can go. And it's pretty understandable because I don't think anybody has had a more challenging 3 or 4 years than Spirit other than maybe you guys. But how are you going to make sure that they're there to support that rate increase for you maybe more broadly, and then with a specific reference to the big labor contract that they have coming up in June? David Calhoun : Well, I'll be optimistic about the labor contract. I think as you might guess, I suspect their workers know the situation they're in. They know that they've got to deliver for Boeing, and my guess is they'll all get to a palatable answer. It's not my control, so you'll have to ask Tom about that. I am confident in their ability to ramp with us. We were on a steady course to keep them ahead of us in this ramp rate, and they were on a reasonable course there. This last defect will slow them down in measures in weeks and months, not in years and will not impede their ability to get to our rate increases. We're going to stay present with Spirit. We're in their factories, we're talking to their people. As I said, there's a couple of ways you can look at this issue that came up. Like I said, it's normally -- it was difficult to find, but an employee raised their hand and noticed a bad procedure and everybody jumped on it. Within a week, we had this resolved with the FAA. We had a clear picture of the airplanes that were impacted, and we were all at work on the rework. That is a signal of a healthy supply chain, not a weak one. And so we're going to maintain that attitude. We're going to continue to work constructively with Spirit. Brian mentioned you our willingness to advance them cash during this moment while they go through their recovery stages. So yes, we're going to stay constructive. I have confidence that Tom and the team at Spirit can get ahead of this. And I -- and we have been on the rate increase request and supply chain requests with them for quite some time, and we are confident they can get there. Operator : The next question is from Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Kristine Liwag : Following up on the supplier master agreement schedule -- or sorry, the supplier master schedule for the 737 MAX, how long will the supply chain be at a higher production rate than your final production rate? And how much is that inventory build going to cost? Brian West : Yes. It's a matter of months, Kristine. Thanks for the question. It's a matter of months, and the inventory is all contemplated in our forward look. It's not anything we worry too much about. In fact, again, another indication of how we're thinking about this, we're perfectly comfortable keeping everyone at pace and hold a little buffer. We think that's a better alternative than keeping it a little bit too close to the wire. And we're going to keep having that posture, and that's going to help us get to 38 and then beyond. Kristine Liwag : Great. And a follow-up on Seth's question on the labor agreement with Spirit. Should we see a production disruption at Spirit? What are mitigating actions you could take? And are there things that you could do to make it easier for you to meet your targets if, again, there is a production disruption at Spirit? David Calhoun : Yes, I'm not going to speculate on that. I'm going to assume that our supplier and the workforce at our supplier are good enough and smart enough and can play far enough ahead to not worry about that. Matt Welch : And Lois, we have time for one final question. Operator : That will come from Matt Akers from Wells Fargo. Matthew Akers : Can you touch on BGS margins in the quarter? I think this is like the highest you put it since you broke that out. I know you mentioned the mix was positive, but can you say how much of that benefit was? I think this is kind of like a mid-teens margin pre-COVID. Should we expect to kind of gravitate back to that level? Or could it be kind of a little bit higher here? Brian West : Yes. Thanks for the question. We love the service business, right? It's a franchise that goes on for years and years and years. And the good news is, is that, as Dave mentioned, on the commercial side, we're back to pre-pandemic levels. That's a healthy sign. And the team is very focused on profitable, capital-efficient growth. And that's important in the service business. So I think we're set up very well. The quarter, a little bit of a mix benefit. But overall, we're set up very well to deliver a mid-single-digit revenue growth business with mid-teens margins and a high cash flow conversion just like we set out in November. And we get more and more confident about that business and the team that's running it. So I think it's going to accrue to our benefit over the next several years. David Calhoun : And if I just think in my short 3 years or maybe it feels long, we made a lot of changes to services, and we tightened up the capital disciplines in a pretty significant way. They all leaned in favor of higher margin, more intellectual property content in our work that we do. And of course, we now have a supply-constrained market around that. So I'm not surprised these margins have expanded, and I'm not expecting them to go down. I think the team is doing a great job. Matt Welch : And that concludes our first quarter earnings call. Thank you, everybody. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the Boeing First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for joining.",

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I am turning the call over to Mr. Matt Welch, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Mr. Welch, please go ahead. Matt Welch : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Boeing\u2019s second quarter 2023 earnings call. I am Matt Welch. And with me today are Dave Calhoun, Boeing\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer and Brian West, Boeing\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And as a reminder, you can follow today\u2019s broadcast and slide presentation at boeing.com. As always, detailed financial information included in today\u2019s press release. Furthermore, projections, estimates and goals included in today\u2019s discussion involve risks, including those described in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of the web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release for presentation \u2013 and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures. Now, I will turn the call over to Dave Calhoun. Dave Calhoun : Thank you, Matt. Welcome everyone. As usual, I am going to make a few comments upfront with respect to the quarter. The quarter was solid, very solid for all of our businesses. We continue to make steady progress on our recovery. We do have challenges. The supply chain notably is the most significant, but it\u2019s steadily getting better. Overall, we feel good about our operational and financial outlook, including the free cash flow and delivery ranges that we set for 2023 as well as for that 2025 and \u201826 timeframe. We are particularly encouraged by generating $2.6 billion in free cash flow in the quarter. Cash flow is the best metric that we have to measure progress against this recovery. We had a very strong second quarter and we are confident in the $3 billion to $5 billion target for the year. I\u2019d like to highlight a couple of updates around the businesses. Commercial Airplanes had a very solid quarter. Demand remains high. We booked 460 net orders in the second quarter. And we are proud to announce our firm-up key orders, I should say, 220 for Air India and we secured our commitment for up to 300 with Ryanair. Broadly, demand is strong and resilient. The need for 42,000 airplanes over the next 20 years is what the industry is telling us. And with demand strong, the supply side of the system is beginning to settle down. Our focus remains on execution and driving stability in the production and the supply chain and we are making steady progress. We delivered 136 commercial airplanes in the quarter, including 103 737s and 20 787. Given the progress through the first half of the year, we are on the right path to reach our 737 and 787 delivery guidance for the year. And we are steadily increasing our rates on each program with focus on stability every step of the way. With respect to the Spirit quality escapes, the work stoppage and the bridge impairment, all have been contained or will be remedied as we exit the third quarter. So it will cost us a few deliveries in the quarter itself. We are also progressing across our key development programs : the 737-7, the 737-10, the 777X and the 777-8F. This quarter is a solid proof point that we are beginning to stabilize our operations and are on the right path and the financial results speak for themselves. I\u2019d like to recognize our team and our customers on the 737 MAX return to service. As of this month, the fleet has flown more than 5 million flight hours and over 2 million flights since returning to service, all with exceptional reliability. The return to service in China is now largely complete as well with more than 90% of the 737 MAX aircraft back in service. More broadly, in China, we are encouraged by recent signs of progress. It\u2019s an important market for us. We are committed to our customers there and we\u2019ll be ready to deliver when that time comes. Boeing Defense. In defense and space, we still have more work to improve operating performance, but the portfolio is well positioned and we are making progress. Results impacted by continuing losses on three fixed price development programs, Commercial Crew, the T-7A and the MQ-25 have hit us in the quarter. On Starliner, we are in lockstep with our customer. We prioritize safety and we are taking whatever time is required. We are confident in that team and committed to getting it right. On MQ-25, schedule pressure added cost to the program, but we have had some recent successes that give us confidence that we are heading in the right direction. We are approximately 25% of the way through the build of our first MQ-25. The static test article fuselage is complete with preparation underway for the start of static testing this quarter. And on the T-7A, the impact was not due to any performance challenge within the quarter and was more associated with our estimates for higher supply chain and production costs in the future, similar to what many in the industry are facing. Even with the cost growth, we are hitting some key milestones on the program. The Air Force successfully completed its first flight of the T-7. We are heading towards the start of a flight test in earnest. We are looking at the program. And if you look at the program from award to this moment, we have had some very important successes. We moved from firm concept to early flight testing in just 36 months on this program. And a combination of model based engineering, 3D design and our advanced manufacturing increased first-time quality by 75% and reduced our assembly hours by 80%. We are also making progress on other key BDS programs. On the tanker, for example, we have now completed rework on the production aircraft acquiring it and we have resumed deliveries to the Air Force. As we move through each quarter, we are progressing through these contracts and getting closer to putting them in the rearview mirror. Despite the challenges, we are hitting some important milestones that increase our confidence. Most importantly, these programs will meet or beat the high-performance standards of the war fighter. Given the fixed price nature of some of our contracts, we are very transparent about these financial impacts and we are working to stabilize, to derisk and mature them through development. Quarterly charges have declined significantly over the last 18 months. Demand side of BDS is strong. We see solid order activity. In the quarter, we booked orders valued at $6 billion, including key contracts from the U.S. Army for 19 Chinooks and Germany also shared its plans to purchase 60 Chinooks. We remain confident in our defense business. Demand is strong and we will continue to improve operational performance to more normalized levels. Following Global Services, another very strong quarter both on the commercial and government side of BGS, healthy revenue and expanding earnings and margin. We are really proud of this team. They have had solid, steady performance. And they have enabled both commercial and military customers to keep fleets flying through a very dynamic time. Some of our highlights this quarter include the expansion in Poland with a new parts distribution site, Japan Airlines adopting Boeing Insight Accelerator, our digital predictive maintenance solution for the 787 fleet. To wrap up my comments, we have had no shortage of challenges pop up to the start of this year and we knew that would be the case. We have had conformance items that we have identified or external challenges within the supply chain, even logistic routes, including washed out bridges. This is a complex business. We expect items to come up. And when they do, we are transparent. We take action and we move forward. This is what progress looks like. We are proud of the team. We are well positioned for the year and for the long-term. Relative to the strong demand, we will remain in a supply-constrained world for the foreseeable future. And with that, I will turn it over to Brian. Brian West : Thanks, Dave and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s start with the total company financial performance. Second quarter revenue was $19.8 billion, that\u2019s up 18% year-over-year. The growth was primarily driven by higher commercial volume, including increased 787 deliveries. Core operating margin in the quarter was minus 2% and the core loss per share was $0.82. Margins and EPS were driven by expected abnormal costs and period expenses as well as losses on three fixed price development programs in our defense business, which I will cover later. Free cash flow, as Dave mentioned, was positive $2.6 billion in the quarter, significantly better versus last year and last quarter driven by higher commercial deliveries and favorable receipt timing. Relative to our expectations shared at the last earnings call, the strong order activity in the quarter drove over $2 billion of favorable advanced payment timing. Keep in mind, most of this was expected to incur in the third quarter. Turning to the next page, I will cover Commercial Airplanes. BCA booked 460 net orders in the quarter, including 220 with Air India, 39 with Riyadh Air and signed a purchase agreement with Ryanair for up to 300 737 MAX-10s. We now have over 4,800 airplanes in backlog valued at $363 billion. Revenue was $8.8 billion, up 41% year-over-year on 136 airplane deliveries driven by the 87 program. Operating margin was minus 4.3%, a sequential improvement versus the first quarter as anticipated, but remains negative as we continue to be impacted by expected abnormal costs and period expenses, including higher R&D spending. As Dave noted, we worked through a number of operational challenges so far this year. We are making steady progress and we will continue to focus on stability as we look to increase production on key programs. On the Spirit work stoppage, we were pleased to see a quick resolution and we will work through any limited impacts to production. Overall, this is not expected to change our production and delivery outlook. On to the programs. On the 737, we had 103 deliveries in the quarter, including 49 in June, a positive proof point that the production system is stabilizing. In regards to the Spirit fitting issue that we discussed last quarter, in May, we resumed deliveries of rework airplanes and also began producing newly built airplanes meeting our specifications. In light of this progress, we are now transitioning production to 38 per month and still plan to increase to 50 per month in the \u201825-26 timeframe. As we move to the higher rate, we will continue to prioritize stability and it will take some time to consistently deliver at 38 per month off the line. We still project full year 737 deliveries of 400 to 450 with sequential improvement in the second half. We ended the quarter with approximately 228 MAX airplanes in inventory. This includes 85 for customers in China and 55 that have now been remarketed as part of the plan we have previously discussed. We still expect most MAX inventory airplane to be delivered by the end of 2024. Moving on to the 87 program, we had 20 deliveries in the quarter and still expect between 70 and 80 deliveries this year. We increased production to 4 per month during the quarter and still plan to reach 5 per month by year end. We ended the quarter with 85 airplanes in inventory and rework is progressing nicely. And we still expect most to be delivered by the end of 2024. We booked $314 million of abnormal costs in the quarter in line with expectations and there is no change to the total estimate of $2.8 billion, which is largely done by year end. Finally, on the 777X program, efforts are ongoing and the program timeline is unchanged. Abnormal costs were $136 million as expected and we have lowered our total estimate from $1.5 billion to $1 billion, which reflects plans to resume production later this year rather than early 2024. Moving on to the next page and defense and space. BDS booked $6 billion in orders in the quarter, including an award from the U.S. Army for 19 CH-47 Chinooks and the backlog is now at $58 billion. Revenue was flat at $6.2 billion and we delivered 38 aircraft in the quarter. Operating margin was minus 8.5% primarily driven by three fixed price development programs. The first was related to commercial crew tied to scheduled delays that we have previously shared and had a $257 million impact; the second on MQ-25 related to a schedule shift that drove a $68 million impact; and lastly, on the T-7A production contract, we revised the long-term production cost estimates that will occur over several years starting in the 2025 timeframe, which drove an impact of $189 million. These determinations were mostly made over the last few weeks as we closed out the quarter. Similar to last quarter, roughly 60% of the portfolio is generating solid levels of performance, in line with historical margins. But we continue to see operational impacts from labor instability and supply chain disruption on other programs that contributed to lower margins. Looking at BDS in aggregate, it will take time to return to normalized levels of performance. We are confident and we are focused on the path to high single-digit margins in 2025-2026. The strong demand across the customer base, the portfolio is well positioned, and we are focused on execution. Moving on to the next page, let\u2019s cover services. BGS had another very strong quarter. BGS received $4 billion in orders during the quarter and the backlog is $18 billion. Revenue was $4.7 billion, up 10% year-over-year primarily driven by favorable volume and mix in both commercial and government services. Operating margin was 18%, an expansion of 110 basis points versus last year with both our commercial and government businesses delivering double-digit margins. Operating margins in the quarter were higher than expected due to favorable mix, which we don\u2019t expect to continue at these levels. In the quarter, BGS announced an expansion in Poland with a new parts distribution site, a collaboration with CAE. And the Japan Airlines has adopted the Boeing Insight Accelerator for their 787 fleet. Turning to the next page, I\u2019ll cover cash and debt. We ended the quarter with $13.8 billion of cash and marketable securities. And our debt balance decreased to $52.3 billion. In the quarter, we repaid $3.4 billion of maturing debt and provided a $180 million cash advance to Spirit as previously shared. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve repaid $5.1 billion of debt, which is essentially all of our maturities for the year. We also maintained $12 billion revolving credit facilities at the end of the quarter, all of which remain undrawn. Our liquidity position is strong. Investment-grade credit rating continues to be important. And we\u2019re deploying capital in line with the priorities we\u2019 ve shared : invest in the business and pay down debt, strong cash flow generation. And flipping to the last page, I\u2019ll cover our outlook. The 2023 overall financial outlook is unchanged from what we previously shared, including $3 billion to $5 billion of free cash flow generation. The operating cash makeup by division will likely be different with BCA and BGS better than expected and BDS lower than expected due to the lower operating performance. Net-net, we still have confidence in the $3 billion to $5 billion of free cash flow for the year. Stepping back to address the state of the market. Commercial demand remains strong across our key programs and services. Cargo remains healthy. Global passenger traffic was up 39% in May and is at 96% of pre-pandemic levels, 105% domestic and 91% international. China pass-through traffic in May was at 87% of pre-pandemic levels with domestic traffic up more than 300% year-on-year and above pre-pandemic levels. Defense demand is also robust, and the FY \u201824 budget continues to progress in line with our expectations. Our portfolio and capabilities are well positioned to support the needs of the nation and of our allies. With demand strong, we still find ourselves in a supply-constrained environment. And our focus continues to be on execution, both within our factories and the supply chain as we steadily increase production. Relative to the first half of 2023, we continue to expect operating and financial performance to improve in the second half. On the third quarter specifically, we expect BCA margins to improve sequentially but remain negative, and we\u2019re not anticipating much in terms of BDS profitability. The 2Q effective tax rate of 63% included cumulative adjustments related to the projected valuation allowance. These adjustments will continue to weigh on the tax rate for the remainder of the year. And given the strong results in 2Q cash flow, 3Q will be lower sequentially, still positive and likely in the hundreds of millions of dollars. All things considered, we feel good about where we\u2019re at on the road to recovery. Right now, we\u2019re squarely focused on meaningful operating performance improvement, including deliveries, revenue, margins and cash flow, all of which will improve as we progress through 2023. And while the challenges remain, we\u2019re headed in the right direction. Ultimately, we expect our operational and financial performance to continue to accelerate, aligned with the plan we laid out at our IR Day last November. And we are confident in $10 billion of free cash flow in 2025, 2026. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave with some final remarks. Dave Calhoun : Again, a solid quarter. We are wrestling our way through the BDS contract, fixed price contract exposures that we have. We\u2019re confident we will see them through. And as I\u2019ve said before, most importantly, the products that we deliver, warfighter will perform as or better than expected. So with that, I\u2019ll open it up to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you. Good morning, Dave, Brian and Matt. So just digging into Commercial Airplanes operating loss of $383 million in the quarter, how do we think about this turning positive? Can you maybe talk about the biggest drivers thinking about production rates stabilizing and then going up what that does to operating margins? And how do you think about finalizing abnormal cost concessions and just pricing playing into the mix? Brian West : Hi, Sheila, I\u2019ll start off with that. Last quarter \u2013 first quarter, I should say, BCA margins were negative 9%, and we knew that they were going to get sequentially better, and they did. They got down to negative 4%. So it\u2019s good progress. In terms of where we\u2019re headed, as we think about the back half of the year, we will still have some negativity, although sequentially better in the third quarter. And then as we exit the year and moving over into the first quarter of next year, those margins will move positive. We\u2019re confident in that. And some of the things are the ones you mentioned, which is rate ramp. You\u2019ll have some of this abnormal behind us in the rearview mirror and will be done. And of course, the pricing environment is pretty good. So all of that give us confidence that we will get these margins positive. And it will likely be towards the end of the year, early next year. And the team is laser-like focused on meeting those expectations. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead. Peter Arment : Yes, thanks. Good morning, Dave and Brian. Brian, staying on that same line of questioning on MAX profitability. Maybe you can just walk us through how we think about cash profitability will improve with the scheduled rate breaks. Do we need to hit like a higher rate of 42 a month before we see meaningful improvement there? Or is it more about the \u2013 once the liquidations are complete in 2024? Thanks. Brian West : Well, it\u2019s both. Certainly, the liquidation benefit is something we\u2019re very focused on because when you get rid of both on the 377, those dual factories, it\u2019s just going to be a huge relief for the business to put that behind us. And we\u2019re tracking, and we\u2019re going to make good progress. And that will be substantially behind us as we move out of 2024. So that, no doubt, is a very big deal, coupled with the rate breaks. We just announced going to 38. That\u2019s a big important move, and there\u2019ll be subsequent rate breaks beyond that. And all of that is going to play into a margin trajectory that\u2019s going to start to look a lot more normal. And by the time we get through 2024, and we\u2019re focused on that \u201825-26 timeframe, as we\u2019ve said, BCA margins will look a lot like that before in that low double-digit area. So we know what we have to go do. The levers are clear. We just got to execute. Peter Arment : Thanks, Brian. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Myles Walton : Thanks. One clarification, one question. So I think, Brian, you said that you expected second half improvement in 37 deliveries so are you implying that we\u2019re now going to be at the top end of the delivery range for the 737? And then I was intrigued by the 777X pull forward of resuming production there. Dave, was there something on the regulatory front in terms of progress that\u2019s helping you pull forward that schedule at this point? Dave Calhoun : No, I wouldn\u2019t say anything has changed. We\u2019re still confident in the regulatory process. This is our desire to simply get ahead of the production curve. There is no \u2013 yes, no breaks on the regulatory side. We still have margin in that. And hopefully, we can beat it. But all the projections we\u2019ve given you, I think, are still intact. Brian West : Myles, in answer to the 737 forecast that we get to the high end, we \u2013 of course, we did 103 in the second quarter, and the quarterly rates will be higher than 103 is our expectation. Of course, we had a little bit of the Spirit impact in there. That\u2019s why that will get sequentially better. And in terms of the rate itself, we squarely see the middle of that range as high confidence. And the question is going to be how much can we move from the middle of the range up to the higher end. And we will prove that out day in and day out as we execute and build more airplanes. So we feel very good about the range, and we will keep reporting as we see the execution, but right now, a degree of confidence in that front. Myles Walton : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead. Jason Gursky : Good morning, everybody. Brian, one just bookkeeping question and then one question on defense margins. On the more bookkeeping one, the services business is posting some pretty good margins here, and you\u2019re noting mix. I\u2019m just wondering when you \u2013 if you could just talk a little bit about when you kind of go back to more normalized margins in that business based on what you\u2019re seeing in your inventory mix there. And then on the defense, you\u2019ve historically talked about 60% doing pretty well, 15% of these development programs and then 25% some legacy programs. That\u2019s how you\u2019ve talked about the margins in that business. Can you confirm that 60%, 15%, 25% is still the right mix of things? And then kind of what\u2019s based \u2013 or what\u2019s in your assumptions on getting back to that high single-digit rate in that \u201825-26 timeframe in those three buckets? Brian West : Sure. So let\u2019s take services. Yes, they just had an excellent quarter. And both the commercial and the government businesses were performing incredibly well. We still have expectations of that business, and we want them to be doing margins that are in the teens. Will it be 18? No, it will come back a little bit. But when I say come back a little bit, we still feel like our long-term view of that business should be in the mid-teens. And from time to time, it will be a little better and that we will keep pushing the business to be just as good as they can be. But I don\u2019t expect it to step back dramatically. We feel really good about where that business is positioned. Dave Calhoun : I just comment on that. It\u2019s just important to note that they are still in an extremely supply-constrained world. Everything they do is supply constrained. So pricing is a little favorable. Anything that they can get out of their shops are being taken. That has not changed. And so how long that lasts? My prediction is it\u2019s going to be quite a while. I don\u2019t see any let up with respect to the need for lift out there, and everybody is fighting for the next part. So I think that\u2019s just the moment we\u2019re in. Brian West : And in regards to the defense business, you\u2019ve got the pieces correct. The way we think about the fixed price development programs that we\u2019ve talked about, 15%, we just have to stabilize those and execute and know that every quarter, we\u2019re getting closer to having those products over and delivering behind us. The next piece of the 60%, very stable, there is a lot of very nice products in there, and we have to keep them stable. And with lean efforts and other things, we actually could get a little bit of productivity out of those programs to get better and better and better. But that\u2019s \u2013 keep that 60% stable and keep it moving. And it\u2019s the 25% that\u2019s left over, that\u2019s the part of the portfolio, it\u2019s a handful of programs, and they are not where they need to be. They are negative. They need to swing positive, and there is a plan to go do that, but it\u2019s just going to take us a little bit of time. In terms of what this portfolio looks like in the \u201825-26 timeframe, we believe the 15% will be stable, right? We will be at certain milestones, where a lot of the stuff will be in the rearview mirror. And the 85% that\u2019s left over is going to be performing at very attractive margins because we\u2019ve done the hard work of stabilizing and then trying to bring in more productivity programs, including lean manufacturing, so that these businesses can get even healthier and stronger. So the road map is clear. It\u2019s on us to execute it, but we think we\u2019ve got all the levers working. And the team is very motivated and laser-like focused. Jason Gursky : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr : Yes. Thank you very much for taking the call. So basically, to follow-up on Jason\u2019s question, if we take out the loss programs, BDS still was marginally red. And if we take the 60% that should be earning, they should be earning $300 million. So if the 25% losing $300 million, that\u2019s the one I really don\u2019t understand. How bad is that? And if you say you\u2019re going to have modest profits in the third quarter, I mean, again, it looks like there is fairly significant underperformance there. Maybe give us a little more color on the programs involved and what it takes to get them back? Thanks so much. Brian West : Yes. Sure, Cai. So we\u2019re not going to have modest profitability in the quarter. I think we said that we\u2019re not expecting much at all from the BDS portfolio, just to be clear, because these things aren\u2019t going to solve themselves in the near-term. Yes, it\u2019s a significant gap. It\u2019s a hundreds of millions of dollars of swing that we have to go execute to get these handful of programs in a better spot. And they are complicated situations with complicated products and factories that almost went dark during the pandemic. And we\u2019ve had to bring them back to life. And that takes time because one is to get them up and moving and then also to get the right labor that\u2019s trained and knows how to do some very complicated work. So we know what the programs are and how we got to go attack them. It just takes a little bit of time and a little bit longer than anyone expected. But we will make progress, and we will work our way through it because we know how to make these programs and these products because we\u2019ve been doing it for a while. Cai von Rumohr : Is there a \u2013 is part of the problem that you got stuck with contracts, those are mostly fixed price contracts and with inflation and all this disruption, that\u2019s the problem? And if so, do any of those contracts reach their end so that you can basically get better pricing going forward? Dave Calhoun : Yes. Let me just comment on that. Not really. So we\u2019re going to have to live within this envelope with respect to pricing and contracts. We might get some ups here and there and modifications here and there, but I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s the answer to this. The answer is really to get a line that started from zero, because it was more or less dark, as Brian said, and get it up to pace. A couple of these products are \u2013 they are not the same old product. There is actually a lot of new, I will call it capabilities embedded in these products. You can imagine with what those are. I can\u2019t talk about them on the call. And so we are just working our way through learning curves. If we didn\u2019t see progress on those learning curves, we wouldn\u2019t be giving you the guidance that we are going to be back to where we were. We do see progress. It\u2019s not an act we haven\u2019t seen before. It does take time, frustrating for everybody, but we are getting there. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Robert Spingarn from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Robert Spingarn : Hey. Good morning. Dave Calhoun : Good morning. Robert Spingarn : Dave, you have been really clear on no new airplane right now. But at the same time, you have talked about and Boeing is working on the Transonic Truss-Braced Wing aircraft, which seems to be a pretty exciting design for the narrow-body market. And while I know it\u2019s early in that process, do you think it has a chance to enter service with current gen engines like the LEAP or the GTF and then maybe later take on a CFM rise? And then as a second part to this question, could this aircraft actually service the large narrow-body market as well, something against the 321? Dave Calhoun : Yes. Look, I am glad to get the question. We are heavily invested in this. We like what it could potentially deliver to this market a level of performance that the industry is used to seeing with brand-new programs. So, now for me to pick and choose the variations and the power plants at this stage is probably not smart. Suffice to say, we are intent on improving this technology. We are hopeful. And if it matures the way we think it will and the NASA, frankly, thinks it will, I do think it will see service. And then those power plant decisions will be exciting. You are right, we can use existing power, but we would prefer frankly to have a bigger fan diameter ultimately and maybe even open rotor someday. So, those are all considerations without a doubt. I don\u2019t want to make a choice. It\u2019s too early. But all of those options that you are talking about are still out there. We just have to prove and deploy the technology. If it behaved like it did in the wind tunnel, we are in a pretty good place. Robert Spingarn : Great. Thanks so much. Dave Calhoun : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Kristine Liwag : Hey, good morning guys. Dave Calhoun : Hi Kristine. Brian West : Hi Kristine. Kristine Liwag : On the 737 MAX production rate increases to 38 per month, can you just give us more insight in terms of what\u2019s happening with the supply chain? What\u2019s their health? And any particular bottlenecks that you are monitoring in order for you to get to that rate? And any other additional color regarding the timing of this step-up would be appreciated as well. Brian West : Yes. Kristine, we are there. And we are confident that the supply chain is coordinated to deliver on this. They have known about it for a while, and we are happy to be able to move forward. So, we feel very confident. In terms of subsequent step-ups, the master schedule that\u2019s been out there is clear on what those look like. And we will do it a step at a time, and we are happy we can make this first move to 38. Dave Calhoun : Most of our time and applied effort with respect to the supply chain is focused on readiness for the 50. Kristine Liwag : Great. And then you guys had mentioned that after 38, it would be 42 after you have seen some stability. That stability, I mean what are you guys looking for? Is it a few months of 38? Is it six months of 38? And what do you have to see to get you confident to move over to the next step-up of 42 per month? Dave Calhoun : Yes. It is. As you suggest, 38 has to come and has to come in a stable form so that we are not up and down every month. But maybe more important than that, we now have such good visibility into the supply chain. We know whether they are ready for the next \u2013 for 40, 42, 44, etcetera. So, I just think it\u2019s the combination of much better visibility on each of those step-ups and yes, our own factories assembling and delivering at a steady pace. But you will see all that just like we do. Kristine Liwag : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss : Great. Thank you. Dave, on 787, it looks like deliveries are off to a slow start here in July. I know you reiterated 70 to 80. There are some things swirling around out there that you are encountering some sort of new issue on the 87. Can you just address that? Brian West : Yes. There is no new issue on the 87. Let\u2019s be very clear. There might have been a tick up in the stringer a few weeks ago, but we are very focused on both the joint verification work on the 87 and then getting stable at four and then work our way to five. So, 87, we feel particularly good about. And we are very confident in that 70 to 80 deliveries for this year. Dave Calhoun : Yes, I will just reiterate, Brian jumped me. But yes, we are actually feeling pretty good about the stability of the line and there is no new issue. David Strauss : Okay. Great. Quick follow-up probably for Brian, so the BCA forecast, the 2.5 to 3.5 operating cash flow this year, you have got an up arrow there. So, what is surprising to the upside? I mean you are still running through big unit losses. Is it just upside from working capital, advances coming in sooner than expected or better than expected? Is that the upside in terms of what that up arrow signifies? Brian West : The orders and the advances, that\u2019s just better than we have thought. David Strauss : Got it. Alright. Thank you very much. Brian West : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Doug Harned : Good morning. Thank you. Dave Calhoun : Hi Doug. Doug Harned : Hi. You have maintained your guidance for 2025, \u201826 to 50 a month on the MAX. It appears you have got demand that can be well in excess of that. And you have talked about the likelihood of even new orders coming in. And you have got the new line that should be finished in Everett next year some time. Can you talk about how you think about that line, where you could potentially go on rate? And how you deal with potential new orders coming in when kind of the skyline you have got laid out here is it probably pushes you out to like 2028 or so and the ability to take an order? Dave Calhoun : Yes. Doug, why don\u2019t I take this. You are right. I guess the truth is, I think both us and our competitors face that circumstance of having to take orders now quite a ways out there. I would love to get to 60, and the market is there for it. There is no doubt about it. For me, there is a moment in time that is really important with respect to execution and the subject of stability, and that is second half of next year when we wind down all of our shadow factory efforts that we can apply all of the labor to those rate increases. So, we already have the labor in-house, but now we get them to work on new airplanes. And that\u2019s a very good thing, and you know the economics attached to that. It\u2019s just not a simple thing to do. And I don\u2019t want any of us to get ahead of ourselves on this front. So, we are just going to stay focused. We are going to work hard on stability. Second half of \u201824 is a very important moment in time because I believe that\u2019s the step change for BCA in pretty much every way. And if we get through that well and we execute well, then we will be talking to all of you about 60. But I don\u2019t want to get ahead of myself on this one and either as a team. Doug Harned : But in principle, you can do the 50 out of rent on your current three lines. So, how are you thinking about there would be some more logistical complexity presumably doing one line in Everett. How would you use that even if you aren\u2019t up at 60 yet? Dave Calhoun : Again, I am \u2013 having a little too much capacity is not a problem for us right now when you are trying to knock down stability. So, if we run something at a suboptimal level, it\u2019s not going to cost us much, and it\u2019s going to improve stability and delivery and all of those things. So again, I don\u2019t \u2013 I want to be careful. I don\u2019t want to get out that far and talk about trades at that moment. But right now, we are just focused on stability. We want to have more capacity than we need so that we are ready for that next increment. And that workforce transition is probably the most important part of all of it. Doug Harned : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman : Good morning. Thanks very much. Brian, I wanted to ask about the 787 and kind of you talked about some confidence in the pace of the production ramps and deliveries there. First, any particular items to watch in the supply chain? And second, if you could start to help us think a little bit about deliveries next year because if you are building 60 or 70 planes and you are supposed to deliver most of the remaining inventory, it suggests potential for a pretty big delivery hall next year. So, both in terms of a, what is the potential for that to make sure that we understand what is and also so we don\u2019t get overly exuberant about what it might be. Brian West : Well, I will be less than satisfying for you because I just can\u2019t \u2013 I really can\u2019t talk about next year delivery numbers. And it\u2019s just not the right time to do that. Although we still have confidence as we get out of the first half of this year, the second half will be better. And then we will just want to make sure we are always sequentially improving. As it pertains to the 87, very proud of that team, given where they have been over the last couple of years. They have got the joint verification work, very steady, consistent. They are working on their share of escapes that they knock down as fast as they see them. And they are getting to production rates that are steady. And they are getting to that five per month by the end of the year is a big deal and no longer they are in the abnormal category. They are back towards a path where we expect them. And then there will be, obviously, increases from there to get to the 10 by \u201825, \u201826. So, there is nothing in particular right now that is a major worry be for 87. And the supply chain still feels like it\u2019s getting better, a little more stable, a little more coordinated. And we got to keep executing. Seth Seifman : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And your next question is from Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ron Epstein : Hi. Yes. Good morning guys. Dave Calhoun : Hi Ron. Ron Epstein : One topic we just haven\u2019t talked about much so far is China. Maybe can you update us on kind of how that\u2019s going? And your sense on delivering new aircraft into China and what\u2019s going on there? I think that could be pretty helpful. Dave Calhoun : Yes, Ron. So, you probably saw in our disclosures that we reduced our exposure, at least with respect to the finished goods inventory down to 85. Of course, we did that with the permission and constructed dialogue with our customers in China. The return-to-service work in China with respect to the airplanes that were already there is largely complete. Everybody is very happy with the performance. In fact, the reliability of the fleet has been fantastic. And we are getting a lot of good signs that they will resume delivery, but I am not going to predict that for you. We are just going to keep managing it exactly the way we have been. We are not dependent on it. We want to do it, and we certainly want to support our customers in China. And we will be the free trade beacon with respect to our administration and all the political influences. But I am just going to leave it, posture just the way it has been. I know that we have 85 airplanes that we would like to begin delivery on. We are getting good signals. I hope it can happen. Our guidance is not dependent on it. Ron Epstein : Got it. And then maybe one quick follow-up, if I may. We have talked a little bit about product development. Just wanted to get your thoughts on what A220 stretch 500 may or may not mean. It seems like Airbus is going to do it, at least that\u2019s the signals they are sending and just how you guys think about it? Dave Calhoun : Honestly, I probably been curt and maybe too curt with my answer is, but I really don\u2019t think about it. I don\u2019t view it as a meaningful competitor. There is nothing that I would want to do on the product development front to respond to it. It\u2019s not the world that we\u2019re interested in. We like our portfolio. The next airplane, in my view, with respect to development has to be a meaningful change, 25%, 30% better than what flies today. That\u2019s why we are focused on Transonic wings. That\u2019s just our game plan. And I don\u2019t think based on all the competitions that we have touched and all the speculation that we hear, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a meaningful difference. Ron Epstein : Got it. Okay. Thank you very much. Matt Welch : Louise, we have time for one final question. Operator : Thank you. And that question will come from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Noah Poponak : Hey. Good morning everyone. Dave Calhoun : Good morning. Noah Poponak : Maybe just a few, since I am last follow-ups or things that haven\u2019t been asked. The leadership of the company had been out around the air show talking about the MAX maybe getting to 42 a month by the end of the year. I mean is that the official plan, or can you talk about that? Pricing, the checks that we have access to are saying that new aircraft pricing is up a double-digit percentage compared to pre-pandemic. Is that what you are seeing? And then in the defense margin next year with the way you see the milestones laying out and the progress on the cost that you are maybe going after, can you have some reasonable low to mid-single digit margin in the defense business next year, or is that 2025 plan more back-end loaded? Brian West : So, I will take the last one. Our defense margins has to get better next year period. I won\u2019t guess in terms of at what level, but they got to get better as we go in the trajectory to that \u201825, \u201826 timeframe. And as it pertains to that 42 number, we are talking about 38 today and happy to talk about 38. There is a master schedule that the supply chain has, and they know all those rate breaks. And we will talk about that more specifically when we want to move to it. But there is no confusion about where the next rate breaks are. We just want to be focused on one, 38 and then as Dave mentioned, the preparation for the entire supply chain to get to a number of 50 in that \u201825, \u201826 timeframe. As Dave mentioned, that\u2019s where most of the focus is. All those interim breaks, they will be where they are. And we will get excited to get to them as we have stability from one point to another. Dave Calhoun : And the good news is I am not surprised at all that our team is conveying those messages. I am not surprised because we are all in that prep mode. Noah Poponak : Okay. And anything you could say on current realized aircraft pricing? Dave Calhoun : Yes, I can\u2019t \u2013 I am not going to give you any specific numbers. Let me just say that the industry is short of airplanes by a reasonably large margin. Boy, do we compete, I will tell you that, for every one of these orders because they are big and they are important. But as you might expect in a constrained market, things probably get better. Noah Poponak : Okay. Appreciate all the details. Thank you. Matt Welch : And that concludes our second quarter earnings call. Thank you for joining. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for joining Boeing\u2019s Company\u2019s second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analysts' question-and-answer session are being broadcast live over the internet. [Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the conference over to Mr. Matt Welch, Vice President of Investor Relations for Boeing Company. Mr. Welch, please go ahead. Matt Welch : Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's quarterly earnings call. I am Matt Welch, and with me today are Dave Calhoun, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian West, Boeing's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation at boeing.com. As always, detailed financial information is included in today's press release. Furthermore, projections, estimates and goals included in today's discussion involve risks, including those described in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of the web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures. Now I will turn the call over to Dave Calhoun. Dave Calhoun : Thank you, Matt, and thanks to all for joining us this morning. Let me start with a comment on the conflict in Israel and Gaza. We were saddened to see the horrific attacks on Israel and the escalating conflict in the region that is resulting in a significant humanitarian emergency. We will continue to monitor the situation. We will focus on the safety of our employees and we will aid those in need. As always, we'll follow the lead of the U.S. government and we'll coordinate closely with government agencies, customers and suppliers, always with safety, security and well-being as our top priority. Now let me turn to the quarter. As you know, we ran into a few challenges over the last several months, but we've demonstrated that we know how to overcome obstacles and it will continue to do just that. We knew 2023 would be a bumpy ride. We have more work to do, but overall, we're making progress in our recovery and we are on track to meet the financial goals we shared for this year and for the 2025/2026 time frame. A time frame I refer to as stability. As you know, free cash flow has been our primary financial metric through this recovery. And based on our performance year-to-date, we still plan to be in the guidance range for the year as well as the $10 billion target by 2025 and 2026. This is a complex long cycle business and driving stability takes time, especially as an entire industry works its way back from the impact of a global pandemic. We expect challenges to come our way. And when they do, we are transparent. We take action and we move forward. So month to month and quarter to quarter, it can be tough to predict, but we're focused on the long-term and we're taking the tough actions now to ensure that the long-term future is strong. So with that, I'll highlight a few key updates around the business. Boeing Commercial, BCA, in commercial, demand continues to be incredibly robust. We booked about 400 net orders in the quarter, including 150 737 MAX-10s for Ryanair, 50 787s for United Airlines, and 39 787s for Saudi Arabian Airlines. With demand strong, our focus remains on delivering airplanes. We are seeing increased stability and quality performance within our own factories, but we're working to get the supply chain caught up to the same standards. Our production system is poised for steady and efficient increases, but we won't push the system too fast and will ensure the supply base is in lockstep with us. On the 737, we're moving through rework on the most recent non-conformance in the aft pressure bulkhead. That work slowed production and deliveries down in the course of the quarter, and given our year-to-date total, we now expect 737 deliveries for the year to be in this 375 to 400 range. While a setback, we'll regain our momentum as we progress through the issue. We are keeping our suppliers hot, according to the master schedule. We plan to complete the production transition to 38 per month by the end of the year, and still plan to reach the key rate of 50 per month by that 2025 and 2026 time frame. Important to note, with respect to our supply chain, delivery shortfalls have been driven by non-conformances, not actual supply chain constraints. On the 787, the program is demonstrating improved stability. We are now transitioning production from four to five per month and expect to meet our delivery range of 70 to 80 for the year. And longer term, we're on track for the rate step up to ten per month by 2025 and 2026. To ensure our broader recovery and return to more normal margins, the key focus continues to be on liquidating our 787 and 737 inventory so that we can eliminate those shadow factories and focus our resources on the production floor, all of our resources. Nonconformance costs are exponentially higher on all of those finished airplanes. We still plan to deliver most, if not all, of the inventory by the end of next year, which will set us on a strong path for 2025 and 2026. With respect to China, we are encouraged by recent signs of progress and continue to work closely with our customers on the timing of returning to delivery. As I mentioned, supply chain performance will be a key enabler. As Spirit Aerospace Systems brings in new leadership, we're looking forward to working with Pat. Pat Shanahan is known by The Boeing Company. We have great respect for his abilities on the shop floor, and we're pleased to have recently established a mutually beneficial agreement that will enhance stability of our production system and help us deliver on our customer commitments, a true win-win. Lastly, on the development side, we're progressing across our commercial programs, and our timelines are unchanged on the 737-7 and the 737-10 and the 777X and 777-8 freighter. A reminder, as always, the FAA will ultimately control the timing. Boeing Defense Systems, BDS, in Defense and Space, we still have more work to improve operating performance. Results this quarter were impacted by higher estimated costs on the VC-25B program. We are maturing through this build process, incorporating engineering changes to better support the installation process, and we resolved important supplier negotiations over the course of the quarter. I'll note that none of these items will impact the performance and capability of the end product. The increased estimates reflect the process by which we build the airplanes. And in a fixed price environment, any unplanned hurdles can introduce unrecoverable costs. At the end of the day, we have two airplanes to build. We are getting past these hurdles and are committed to delivering two exceptional airplanes for our customer. Separately, as you saw, we are also expecting higher costs on a satellite program as we build out the Constellation and meet our life cycle commitments for our customer. We're working on real innovation and advanced capabilities in this space and see real potential market as we deliver against this commitment. More broadly across BDS, we're stabilizing operations and taking comprehensive actions to improve performance, including lean initiatives, contracting disciplines, factory improvements, engineering investments and more. We're seeing some early signs of progress, but financial improvement at BDS' lower volumes takes time. Recovery in BDS is slower than we'd like, slower than I'd like, but we're confident in the future and our path to normalizing BDS margin performance by that 2025 and 2026 time frame is intact. The confidence is due in part to key milestones we're starting to hit and the strong demand we're seeing. For example, we delivered the first T-7A to the U.S. Air Force this quarter. We also captured a key award from the U.S. Army for 21 Apache helicopters. Additionally, we continue to invest and position ourselves for significant opportunities in proprietary programs. The backlog at BDS is $58 billion, and nearly 30% of that is outside the United States. We're proud of the role our products play in protecting global security and national defense. Demand is strong, we're confident in the business, and we will continue to improve operational performance to more normalized levels. Boeing Global Services, BGS, in Global Services, the team had another strong quarter, both on the commercial and the government side with improved revenue and earnings relative to the third quarter of 2022. The financials were again driven by strong operating performance and the team's ability to hit key milestones and capture new business. In the quarter, BGS delivered the 150th 737-800 Boeing Converted Freighter, received an award from the U.S. Navy for P-8 trainer upgrades and signed a digital maintenance agreement with multiple airlines. Our services team represents Boeing with our customers nearly every minute of every day. The work they do to keep military and commercial fleets flying is best-in-class, and we're proud of the performance that they're delivering. A step back with respect to the market outlook. Looking across all three business units, demand for our products and services continues to be incredibly strong. Our backlog is at $469 billion, including over 5,100 commercial airplanes. Over the next ten years, the value of the markets we serve across commercial, defense, space and services is estimated at $10.7 trillion according to our most recent Boeing market outlook. Our products deliver exceptional capability in strong and growing markets, and our portfolio is well aligned with our customers' needs. The demand is there to support our recovery. It is on us to perform, and we will remain disciplined and patient in the process. Brian, I'll turn it over to you. Brian West : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's go to the next slide and start with total company financial performance. Third quarter revenue was $18.1 billion. That's up 13% year-over-year. Growth was driven by higher commercial volume, primarily on higher 787 deliveries. Core operating margin in the quarter was minus 6%, and the core loss per share was $3.26. Margins and EPS were negatively impacted by unfavorable defense performance, which I'll cover in a moment; lower 737 deliveries that were in line with expectations set last month; and expected abnormal costs and period expenses. Free cash flow was a usage of $310 million in the quarter. This reflects the lower 737 deliveries and in line with our expectations. With that, I'll turn to the next page and cover Boeing Commercial Airplanes. BCA booked 398 net orders in the quarter, including 150 MAX-10s for Ryanair, 50 87s for United and 39 87s for Saudi Arabian Airlines. BCA now has over 5,100 airplanes in the backlog valued at $392 billion. BCA delivered 105 airplanes in the quarter, and revenue was $7.9 billion. That's up 25% year-over-year driven by the higher 787 deliveries. Operating margin was minus 8.6%. We saw the impact of the lower 737 deliveries as well as expected abnormal costs and period expenses, including higher R&D spending primarily on the 777X investment. Now I'll give a little more color on the key programs. On 737, we delivered 70 airplanes in the quarter, reflecting the impact of the recent supplier fuselage nonconformance. Since our early September update, additional areas of the aft pressure bulkhead were identified that require further inspection and rework, which you likely read about. This additional scope impacts units that had already gone through the initial rework and will take us more time to stabilize production and deliveries. We founded the issue, understand the rework steps required and booked a nonmaterial financial impact in the quarter. Considering these latest facts, we expect October deliveries to be in line with September and now expect to deliver between 375 and 400 airplanes for the year. Performance ultimately will be dictated by the pace of a fuselage recovery. The quarter ended with approximately 250 MAX airplanes in inventory, 85 of which are being held for customers in China. We still expect most of the MAX inventory aircraft to be delivered by the end of 2024 but more are likely to slip into 2025 tied to the fuselage recovery. To support stability, suppliers are continuing with planned rate increases and we're selectively managing inventory levels on certain parts where prudent. We expect to complete the 737 transition to 38 per month by year-end, and we're maintaining plans to increase to 50 per month in the 2025, 2026 time frame. On the 787 program, we had 19 deliveries in the quarter and 50 year-to-date. We still expect 70 to 80 deliveries this year. We started transitioning production to five per month in October and still plan to reach 10 per month in the 2025, 2026 time frame. We ended the quarter with 75 airplanes in inventory. Rework is progressing nicely, and we still expect most to be delivered by the end of 2024. We booked $244 million of abnormal costs, in line with expectations. The total estimate is now $3 billion, up a bit, and we still expect to be largely done by year-end. Moving to the 777X program. Efforts are ongoing. The program timeline is unchanged, and we plan to resume production later this year. We booked $180 million of abnormal costs in the quarter, in line with expectations. The total estimate is unchanged at $1 billion, and we expect to be done this quarter. Importantly, as Dave mentioned, we recently reached an agreement with Spirit on commercial terms associated with the 737 and 787 programs. We believe this agreement is a win-win for both companies and directly promotes our goal to drive stability and support our airline customers. Moving on to the next page, Boeing Defense and Space. BDS booked $6 billion in orders during the quarter, and the backlog now stands at $58 billion. Revenue was $5.5 billion, essentially flat year-over-year, and we delivered 28 aircraft. Operating margin was minus 16.9% in the quarter. In early September, we indicated that margins would be around minus 9%, the driver being a $482 million charge on the VC-25B fixed price development program due to higher estimated manufacturing costs related to engineering changes, labor instability, and the resolution of supplier negotiations. As we closed the books at quarter end, we saw another 8 points of margin erosion driven by first a $315 million loss tied to customer considerations and higher estimated costs to deliver a highly innovative satellite constellation contract that we signed several years ago. And second, we had smaller, less material cost pressures across a couple programs totaling $136 million primarily driven by the MQ-25program. These are disappointing results in the quarter and year-to-date. This performance is below our expectations, and we acknowledge that we aren\u2019t as far along in this recovery as we expected to be at this stage. I\u2019d like to point out that the team is executing a game plan to get BDS back to the high-single digit margins by the 2025, 2026 time frame. As you can see on the right hand side of the slide, we\u2019re driving lean manufacturing, program management rigor and cost productivity consistently across the division. We have invested in new training programs to accelerate performance on the factory floor, and we\u2019ve deployed resources at our suppliers to support their recovery. Perhaps most importantly, we instituted much tighter underwriting standards. As you know, part of the challenge we\u2019re dealing with are legacy contracts that we need to get out from under. Rest assured, we haven\u2019t signed any fixed price development contracts nor intend to. These moves are all fundamental to accelerating the recovery by the 2025, 2026 time frame. We have detailed metrics and milestones to evaluate our performance and progress across the three areas that we\u2019ve previously highlighted. First, we have a solid core business representing about 60% of our revenue that performs in the mid to high-single digit margin range. The demand for these products is strong. In particular, volume for our missile and weapons products as well as the Apache are very robust given the current threat environment, and we need to keep executing, competing and growing these offerings. Then we have the 25% of the portfolio representing specific fighter and satellite programs that have negatively impacted margins the past several quarters. In these areas, we took on fixed price production contracts in a pre-pandemic environment with real technical innovation that we\u2019re working our way through. We fully expect to see recovery in these areas as we improve execution, deliver next generation capabilities, and roll into new contracts with stronger underwriting disciplines that more accurately reflect the prevailing economic conditions. We expect to return to the strong performance levels that we\u2019ve demonstrated historically on these programs as we move into the 2025, 2026 time frame. Lastly, we have our large fixed price development programs that represent the remaining 15% of the portfolio, and we continue to be focused on maturing and retiring these risks. Specifically, on the KC-46A program, we\u2019re stabilizing the production system. We\u2019ve seen signs of progress and improved productivity, and as of this month, we have delivered 77 tankers to the customer. For the VC-25B, we\u2019re now maturing through the build process, and the key milestones ahead are power on and first flight, both of which will essentially be behind us as we move through the 2025, 2026 time frame and represent a significant derisking of the program. For commercial crew, while it has been a long road, we\u2019re preparing to execute a successful crewed flight test next year and then fulfill operational launch commitments, all of which will be completed as we exit 2025, 2026. On T-7A, we just delivered the first aircraft to the Air Force this quarter and have begun critical phases of the flight test program. On MQ-25, we\u2019ll get through key build and flight test milestones and transition out of the development phase as we move through the 2025, 2026 time frame. We remain very confident in the T-7A and MQ-25 investments that will deliver innovative performance to the customer with a strong long-term demand profile. So for BDS, this recovery is challenging at the moment, but we believe the actions we\u2019re taking will begin to gain traction and then accelerate. Fast forward to that 2025, 2026 time frame, fixed price development contracts will be substantially derisked. We\u2019ll have a healthy order book underwritten with much better economics and underwriting disciplines, and a resilient employee base and supply chain that\u2019s executing at a much higher level. Moving on to the next slide Boeing Global Services. BGS had another strong quarter. They received $5 billion in orders during the quarter, and the backlog sits at $18 billion. Revenue was $4.8 billion, up 9% year-over-year, primarily on favorable commercial volume and mix. Operating margins were a strong 16.3% in line with our expectations. Importantly, our commercial and government businesses continued to deliver double-digit margins. With that, we\u2019ll turn to the next page and cover cash and debt. On cash marketable securities, we ended the quarter at $13.4 billion, and on debt, the balance remained flat at $52.3 billion. We had access to $10 billion of revolving credit facilities at the end of the quarter, all of which was undrawn. Our liquidity position is strong. The investment grade credit rating continues to be a priority, and we're deploying capital in line with the priorities that we've shared, invest in the business and pay down debt through strong cash flow generation. And flip into the last page on our outlook. The overall financial outlook for 2023 is unchanged from what we previously shared, including $3 billion to $5 billion of free cash flow generation, although the updated 737 deliveries now point more toward the low end of the free cash flow range. We also expect R&D to come in slightly above our original guide, tied to the higher 777X investments that I touched on earlier. Stepping back to address the state of the market. Commercial demand remains strong across our key programs and services. Global passenger traffic was up nearly 30% year-on-year in August and is at 96% of pre-pandemic levels, 109% domestic and 89% international. Cargo remains healthy and August was the first month with annual cargo growth since early 2022. Defense demand is also robust, and FY2024 budget continues to be in line with our expectations. Our portfolio and capabilities are well position to support the needs of the nation and of our allies. With demand strong, we still find ourselves in a supply constrained environment and our focus continues to be on execution both within our factories and the supply chain as we steadily increase production. We're squarely focused on a meaningful step up in operating performance, including deliveries, revenue, margins and cash flow, all of which we expect to improve as we finish out the year. On 4Q specifically, we expect BCA margins to improve sequentially, but remain negative more in line with 2Q, and we're still not anticipating much in terms of BDS profitability. On the tax expense side, we still expect full year tax expense of approximately $250 million. As we look into early 2024, we see a number of key milestones that give us confidence in building momentum across the business. The 737 factory should be recovered from the current non-conformance and will be stabilizing production at 38 per month with step ups as we move to 50 per month by 2025, 2026. 787 will be stabilizing production at five per month with a focus on stepping up to 10 per month by 2025, 2026. We'll be further along in our inventory unwind with better line of sight to the elimination of the 737 and 787 dual factories. Keep in mind that correcting non-conformances gets exponentially easier when this inventory has been delivered to our customers. BDS will be further along in recovery as I described earlier. BGS will still be generating mid-teen margins, executing on its high cash conversion, capital efficient, disciplined growth model. And all of this will underwrite our continued strong liquidity position and enable us to further delever the balance sheet early next year. With that, back over to Dave for closing comments. Dave Calhoun : Yes. Thanks, Brian. In closing, I just want to make a couple of comments and double down on the resiliency of our recovery. We've had no shortage of challenges this year. You all know that. Conformance items, development hurdles, external challenges within the supply chain and even logistics routes. These are not uncommon in our industry. I've heard from a few of you wondering if we've lost a step in this recovery. You might not be surprised to hear that I view it as exactly the opposite. Over the last several years, we've added rigor around our quality processes. We've worked hard to instill a culture of speaking up and transparently bringing forward any issue, no matter the size, so that we can get things right for a bright future. As a result, we're finding items that we need to resolve. They're not newly created defects in the system. Instead, thanks to the culture we're building, we identified items from the past that we now have the rigor and the focus to fix once and for all. Our shadow factories will be shut down. So this process of transparency and change can be difficult in the moment, but I'm proud of our team. I'm confident; we'll look back on this time period as when we got things right and we set Boeing on the right course. We still have work to do, but progress is clear and our focus is long-term. We're on the right path to restoring our operational and financial strength. And we thank you for your patience. Okay. Now, let's turn it over to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Doug Harned : Yes, good morning. Thank you. Talking about the recovery here, when we look at the 737 MAX ramp, we had thought you'd be at 38 a month production back in August, and we were looking forward to a new line that should be up and running at Everett in 2025, which looks to us that we give you capacity for well over 60 a month. But now that 38 a month rate is coming \u2013 is still to come later this year. And if I separate the bottlenecks here into three topics, sort of engines, Spirit, and everything else, engines appear fine. You\u2019ve got a new leadership at Spirit, a new agreement. So this is not just one part, but I guess how much has your longer-term ramp outlook changed, given the Spirit issues you\u2019ve had this year? And if you could take those Spirit risks off the table, what bottlenecks are still out there in the everything else category for the MAX? And to put it all together, what could this ramp look like if you can avoid quality escapes like the ones we have seen this year? Dave Calhoun : Yes, Doug, that\u2019s the money question. We think we are synced perfectly with the constraints that we know. You talked about engine constraints. We have as clear and as transparent a relationship as we could possibly have with the GE and CFM teams. The rates that we have outlined in our guidance reflect those constraints. We all could go much higher, much faster, if it were strictly a demand question. But we have to listen hard to those constraints. So we are there. On Spirit, we really do believe that the commercial agreement and I can have Brian make a comment on; he was in the center of that negotiation. The commercial agreement gives them the resources and the breathing room they need to get ahead of our rate forecast. And maybe even more importantly, I think the selection of Pat at exactly this moment in time to sort of get them really focused on factory performance I\u2019m quite optimistic and quite pleased with. We\u2019ve had just in the last 30 days as many interactions with Pat as we\u2019ve had over the last year, even though we\u2019ve had more than 100 people embedded at Spirit. So, all the signs are good there. I feel like we took a major step forward on relieving that particular constraint. And as you know, that is mostly a conformance constraint. I got to tell you, these fuselages, man, they have been gone over with a microscope in light of what we\u2019ve experienced here in the last four months. So all that said, those are \u2013 you correctly articulated the constraints that we\u2019ve had to deal with. On the all other, we had one that has really taken aggressive steps and gotten ahead of us. And so I\u2019m feeling better about all other than I have in quite a long time just because there was another one embedded. I\u2019m not going to mention names. So anyway, that\u2019s it in a nutshell, I am always tempted based on demand to tell you we can do more than 50 and get to 60 and we are physically capacitized to do it. You\u2019re correct in that. But I can\u2019t call it out until the supply chain constraints can make it. And they haven\u2019t yet to get to those kinds of numbers. But we have a couple of years to work it, and we\u2019ll continue to work it. But right now, everything we\u2019re doing is based on the constraints we know. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve outlined to the industry. And even in these last just several months with the non-conformance issues that have sort of constrained our delivery, as we\u2019ve said many times, we have kept our master schedule intact to get to that 38. We\u2019re definitely building inventory in the process, and we\u2019re paying our suppliers. So they\u2019re not second guessing where we\u2019re going to end up. And we think we\u2019re going to have a little bit of buffer, particularly at the front end in light of what we\u2019ve just experienced. Doug Harned : And is there any point that we should be looking toward where you might have more clarity on how that whole supply chain is going to come together for this? Dave Calhoun : Yes, first of all, we\u2019ll definitely update guidance for next year as we get into the early part of next year, put these non-conformances in a rear view mirror once and for all, get to a stable rate at 38, and then we\u2019re going to be anxious to build from there as fast as we can. We will give guidance based on everything we know early in that year. So not avoiding it now, but its best we get these things in a rear view mirror. And the good news is we really do have these in a box with respect to the scope of work that\u2019s required and now it\u2019s just executing against it. And our teams have done a pretty good job on that. Doug Harned : Okay. Thank you. Dave Calhoun : Yes. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead. Jason Gursky : Good morning, everybody. Brian, you made some comments in September about expectations for cash flow in 2024 and the past two year goals in 2025 and described things back in September potentially being nonlinear. So you\u2019ve had some things that have happened since then, including the push out of some deliveries into 2024. You\u2019ve incurred some more charges, I think that were a bit greater than you were expecting in the Defense business. I\u2019m wondering if you can kind of update us on the current thought on 2024 cash flow and kind of the puts and takes that you\u2019re expecting. What are the good guys, what are the bad guys relative to 2023? And then maybe just provide us some thoughts on the quantum of cash that you expect to generate at the company, 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, given all that\u2019s occurred here, particularly in the defense business here since you lead out those goals at your Investor Day last year, whether the quantum of cash that you expect to generate over those four years has changed materially? Thanks. Brian West : Yes. Thanks, Jason. Let me start with the quantum and the 2025, 2026 time frame. It\u2019s $10 billion. And we continue to have line of sight to hitting that target. I think that\u2019s most important. In terms of how we get from where we land in 2023 to that moment, yes, going to be some things we\u2019ve got to deal with, not going to be linear, but we\u2019ve got some things that feel good about in terms of momentum. Let me just highlight a few. Of course, we\u2019ll be more specific in January on next year\u2019s free cash flow guidance. But we expect to be higher. It\u2019s too early to be that specific, but it will be underwritten by higher BCA deliveries, both on the 37 and the 87. We\u2019ll have made progress on the inventory wind down that Dave mentioned. And we\u2019re also going to factor in the 777X ramp. So those things are pretty discrete, and we just got to follow our ability to deliver in a stable environment. BGS will be steady. BDS, as you point out, we expect cash flows next year to be better than there this year, but still likely a drag, mostly factoring in the impact of some of the charges that you mentioned that we just got to put behind us. So, we\u2019ll spell all of this out in January once we finish our planning cycle and get through 2023. But the most important thing to remember is that quantum in 2025, 2026 is $10 billion. And all of the levers that we have to go from where we land this year to at that point are still very clear to us and underwritten by execution, and we know how to do that. Jason Gursky : Okay. And then, Brian, just if you don\u2019t mind, the $10 billion quantum out in 2025, 2026, can you talk about the potential for \u2013 where we might go from there? What are some of the puts and takes that we might see from a growth perspective beyond that $10 billion? Brian West : Yes. We\u2019re still looking forward to that stability, as Dave called it, in the 2025, 2026 time frame in that $10 billion. That\u2019s where we\u2019re laser-like focused. Anything beyond that is going to be outside of our planning window. And hopefully, it\u2019s going to be underwritten by a very attractive robust demand environment, but let\u2019s get there first. Jason Gursky : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Peter Arment from RW Baird. Please go ahead. Peter Arment : Yes, thanks. Good morning Dave and Brian. Dave Calhoun : Hi Peter. Peter Arment : Hey Brian, maybe just to talk about stability there because you just brought it up on \u2013 if we look at just the remaining two months of the year, if you\u2019re going to deliver about 15 737s in the \u2013 in October, that kind of implies that you need to deliver high 30s or high 40s if you\u2019re going to be at the upper end of your range. Just kind of the confidence level around that for November, December, I mean. And if you could update us on when you talked about the \u2013 in September, I think about the 75% of the MAX aircraft in storage had to be inspected. What\u2019s the latest there? And just lastly, is there \u2013 is the \u2013 getting to 38 a month later in the year, does that impact any of your rate break decisions when you\u2019re thinking about 2024? Thanks again. Brian West : Yes, sure. So October will be a little bit light, as I mentioned, with November and December being picked up. Remember, we had a number of airplanes that were ready to be delivered prior to this latest spear NOE, and now we have to work them through the system. We do have a good line of sight to finish in the year, and the team is laser-like focused on meeting this updated set of numbers. And then, of course, we feel good about the free cash flow that will be dragged along with that. In terms of the 75%, that is still the way to think about how we have to touch those inventory airplanes. As we\u2019ve mentioned, we know the scope. We know what\u2019s got to happen, and we\u2019re working our way through finishing that work across that cohort of airplanes. So that has remained unchanged, and it\u2019s just all the work we have to do in front of us, clear line of sight. And in terms of the rate breaks, largely speaking, we\u2019ve had a master schedule out there for some time with the required rate breaks. Of course, we\u2019re trying to get our way to 50 per month by the 2025, 2026 time frame. None of that\u2019s changed. And we\u2019re still focused on executing that once we can get to that 38 as we exit this year and then move the supply chain with us considering everything Dave described about how we see the supply chain coordinating going forward. Peter Arment : Appreciate the color. Thanks guys. Operator : The next question is from the line of Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Myles Walton : Hi guys, good morning. Brian or Dave, looking at the $10 billion target for 2025, 2026, is there a way that we can have confidence yet that even if BDS is nearly neutral that the rest of the organization can still get to that number? And then also, if you can just highlight the space satellite constellation charge. I\u2019m always a little bit curious when I first hear about it if I\u2019m going to hear about it again, so maybe just lay out the trajectory of that program. Thanks. Brian West : Sure. So I\u2019ll take the last one first. This is a particular contract with the customer that really isn\u2019t in the category of development. The way we talk about the fixed price development contracts is very different. We are completing the requirements for the customer. We have additional work to do to make this constellation very robust with new technology. It\u2019s very innovative, and we have to work our way through, and we will in short order. This is not going to be one that\u2019s going to be dragged out for a long period of time. And in terms of the 10 billion, we always built that with some understanding that not every piece was going to go exactly correct. There were going to be some puts and takes and we provide ourselves the room with which we could have certain things not go quite perfectly. And in the case of BDS, even though it might be a bit different than we had thought even a year ago, it\u2019s still within the quantum of us being able to deliver that 10 billion. And we have a lot of confidence that they will be contributing to that 10 billion. Maybe not quite as much, but they\u2019re going to be positive. And of course, BGS remains strong. BCA, we always get more and more confident. So we still have a path to that 10 billion and just reinforce how confident we are in get \u2013 being able to get the whole enterprise there. Myles Walton : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good morning, Dave, Brian, and Matt. Thanks so much. And I just wanted to dig into commercial airplanes and just the operating loss there of $678 million. Brian, I know you\u2019ve been out there in the trenches working with suppliers. You called out another loss in Q4. So maybe as you think about the production rates normalizing, can you maybe parse out how much of the losses are linked to concessions, pricing, supply chain constraints, and how you expect that to turn? Brian West : Yes. Thanks, Sheila. So it\u2019s largely \u2013 the fact that we were negative again in the quarter is all the spirit impact that we\u2019ve described. And fourth quarter is going to be sequentially better, but it\u2019s still going to be negative. And that\u2019s again, as we work our way through this factory disruption and we still have this abnormal running through the BCA P&L. I will tell you that in 2024, we expect margins to be positive and that\u2019s going to be underwritten by two things primarily BCA. It\u2019s going to be driven by higher volume for sure. And remember all this abnormal will be essentially done which has been a drag on the BCA margins for quite some time. So we just got to work our way out of that, which we will by the end of this year, and then work towards executing on the delivery targets for next year. And that will get back at a positive territory. And then the good news is by 2025, 2026, we still have a view where they will be double-digit margins as they have been historically. And that will be underwritten by this. These dual factories that Dave\u2019s talked about will be behind us. And all that labor that today is working on inventory airplanes for both the 37 and the 87 is going to go be applied to these ramps in the rates up to 50 and 10 respectively in the 37 and the 87. So all of that still is right in front of us and it all still give us confidence that we\u2019re going to be able to hit those kind of targets. And the BCA team is very focused on delivering that. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr : Yes, thanks a lot. So Brian, 777X R&D spiked up. It looks like total R&D at BCA was up about $150 million sequentially. Where do those \u2013 where does the 777X sort of R&D number go moving forward? When does it peak? When does it come down? And also maybe you could update us on the certification status given we\u2019re in a CR, [ph] are we going to make it on MAX 7 by year end? What about MAX 10? What about achieving TIA on the 777X? Brian West : Yes. So let\u2019s start with the R&D question. So overall R&D, we continue to spend on the dash seven and the dash 10 and the uptick is as I pointed out and as you mentioned on the 777X and the 777-8 Freighter. Now as we move forward, that range of three \u2013 call it three, four-ish billion of R&D, that\u2019s going to modestly go up over the next couple years. But it\u2019s not going to do anything to disrupt our free cash flow target. And if it goes up a little bit, I think that\u2019ll be good news because we\u2019re investing in programs. So we\u2019re not necessarily worried about that at all. And it\u2019s all within our expectations, both near term and longer term. And in terms of the certification milestones that we have in front of us, as Dave mentioned, there\u2019s been no change to either the dash seven, the dash 10 or the 777X we move forward and particularly the 777X team\u2019s hard at work at trying to meet that commitment. So there\u2019s really nothing to say other than there\u2019s a lot of people hard at work, which is why we continue to invest in those spots. Dave Calhoun : I always have to add because I don\u2019t want to get in a trap like we did a long time ago. The FAA makes that call and we\u2019re going to give them all the flexibility they need. We try to interpret it the best we can, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. Know that there haven\u2019t been any real changes to the airplanes. So we are mostly working design assurance documentation as required by the new legislation back at the end of 2020. Cai von Rumohr : And on the issue of 777X, TIA, when do you expect that? Brian West : I don\u2019t think that we\u2019ve necessarily put a date out on that for obvious reasons. So we\u2019ll let the teams do the work and we\u2019ll let the regulators dictate those specifics and we\u2019re just going to follow their lead. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman : Hey. Thanks very much. Good morning everyone. Brian, with your comment that the 2023 cash flow is going to come in at the low end of the range, your expectation for growth in 2024. I guess, should we be expecting 2024 to be in the 2023 range when we're trying to get a draw beat on where 2024 is? And then within that, the 737s, sometimes I think it's hard to bridge between production and deliveries. If it's 38 a month exiting the year, can we say at least 38 times 12 next year plus some chunk of the inventory that's remaining? Brian West : Yes. So Seth, we're just going to wait until January to be able to describe any kind of range for cash flow next year. We just got to get through our planning cycle. We had to close the year. So just be patient with us. But we will be specific in January, the same way we were this year. And I'll also probably let you know that, that would apply to your question on deliveries or how to think about them. Delivery is going to be higher next year. We're going to have momentum going on this year. All of those details, we're going to flesh out and share at the beginning of the year and at the right time, and we look forward to doing that. Seth Seifman : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : The next question is from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Noah Poponak : Hey. Good morning everyone. Dave Calhoun : Hi Noah. Brian West : Hi Noah Noah Poponak : Brian, just staying on the 737 pace for me, recognizing you're not going to give a number for next year, it sounds like. But if October is similar to September, it implies November, December are decent delivery numbers. So is it the case that the aft fuselage issue and the incremental inspection of hand-drilled in addition to laser-drilled fasteners, that, that is kind of behind you as you get to January 1st? It's not impacting 2024, 737 deliveries. And then when you're talking about being at 38 a month out in the off-the-line final assembly versus where the system is, is a different number, is there a wide gap in that to start the year? Or can we think out a real clean stable 38 a month to start the year? Brian West : Answer your first question, the answer is yes, for sure. And in terms of how we think about the rate, we, the system, as Dave mentioned has always maintained to be hot because we want to make sure that they know that the demand signal is there. And we want them to continue focus on that master schedule. How exactly as we start the year we'll be able to count deliveries relative to that 38, we'll see. But right now, job one is to exit \u2013 get the non-conformance behind us. Remember, we had about a 30 aircraft growth between the second quarter and the third quarter into the inventory airplane. So that's going to be working its way out of the system relatively quickly, which gives us confidence in the November, December time frame. And then as we think about prime of the pump for 38 per month, we're going to move towards January and beyond and hopefully some pretty good execution. So we'll have to wait and see exactly how that plays out, but the underlying system is going to stay at 38. And as we get through next year, obviously, there'll be certain rate ramps that we'll describe later. But right now, if we have everything be coordinated across the broad supply chain, I think we'll be fine. Noah Poponak : Okay. And I guess putting a lot of this together and everybody trying to figure out where the 2024 free cash is going to land. Is it kind of reasonable to think of 2024 as just two halves and that some of your hesitation in giving some of those numbers is you just don't know exactly where the year starts. Is there still some 737 disruption? 787 at five is a different margin than 787 at 10? Maybe BDS margins are still negative in the first half, but they're positive in the second half. And so this next year's first half free cash flow just still have some of 2023 elements lingering in it, but that the second half will be kind of run rating into more of what your stable looks like and maybe second half 2024 looks, the numbers look more like second half of 2022 type of free cash flow numbers. And we can comfortably think of that as run rating into your future? Brian West : Yes. No, all of that is going to have to be something we talk about in January. Right now, we have to get the non-conformance behind us. We have to be able to hit this delivery range that we've just described. And we have a lot to do, but confidence we'll get there. And then we'll describe the shape of next year at the right time. I just don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves. And I do believe that as \u2013 I do believe next year will be better, and I do believe we'll exit next year better. How that folds up between halves, you're just going to have to give us a little bit more time as we work our way through our planning cycle and we get to January. Dave Calhoun : Noah, if I could just maybe add one thing to make sure everybody knows what, at least what I'm all focused on. We're going to exit this year with a little more than 100 of the return-to-service airplanes that we had at the end of 2020. That is what our shadow factories are focused on in a big way to make sure that we can bleed that down to basically nothing by the end of next year. So the pace at which we bleed that down, we complete that rework, deliver all those airplanes dictates a lot about that cash flow. It gets better every month. But it's going to be all about the pace at which we can do it and transfer that workforce into the production rate increases. So we need \u2013 there's a lot to know about that. We're going to give you our best shot at what that guidance looks like. But by way of proxy, that is a very important achievement for us. And I'm 100% focused on it, and I know Brian is and the team at BCA. Noah Poponak : Okay, thanks so much. Dave Calhoun : Yep. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Dave Calhoun : Good morning. David Strauss : Wanted to ask about the supply chain. Are there any other spots \u2013 hot spots in the supply chain where you've either had to infuse a meaningful amount of cash like you did with Spirit or are in negotiations to do something similar to what you've done with Spirit? That's the first question. And then the second question, I guess a clarifying comment for Brian. On the BCA margin progression next year turning positive, is that both on a program on a unit basis or would that just be on a program basis? Thanks. Dave Calhoun : Brian, how about I answer the first part of this one? I consider the Spirit remedy fairly unique, in fact, totally unique. I don't think that's going to have any ramifications anywhere else, and there aren't any signals that way. But the linkage really is important. As Spirit becomes stable and we get to our rates, rates solve most of the supply chain's problems. We got to get to those rates so that they can make the kind of money that they associate with those rates and we get to where we need. So there is a linkage, but it's not a copycat linkage, and there's no sign of that happening. Brian West : And in terms of the margins on both unit and program, they'll be positive. And program, we'll have growth. So we look forward to describing that as we get closer to January but both. David Strauss : Great. Thanks very much. Dave Calhoun : Yep. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Rich Safran from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead. Rich Safran : Thanks, Brian, Matt. Good morning. I got a two part tanker-related question for you. First, with Lockheed dropping out, when do you expect an award? And what could that do to your overall assessment of program profitability? I'm basically assuming here that you would have to review the accounting on the program. Second part is with deliveries restarting, what's being anticipated? I mean, how much of a catch-up should we expect in 4Q? And is that being factored in your guide? Dave Calhoun : Well, let me just comment on the tanker. I'm not surprised at what we all read with respect to Airbus now going on their own. They will go. So we shouldn't expect them to sort of vacate. I do like what it ultimately does for us and the competition. We are not afraid of competition. And yes, that next contract matters a lot. We have to ultimately underwrite the cost and get this right. And as we've committed to you all along, we're going to stay disciplined on that front. And no, there's not \u2013 this isn't program accounting, it's contract accounting. So I don't think we're going to have any implication associated with lots and an additional contract. Now I'm not the accountant. So I'll ask Brian to collaborate. Brian West : Yes. No, exactly. We don't see that changing. We'll just add to volume like we do with any kind of extension. And in terms of your question in the fourth quarter, of course, any kind of deliveries and cash flow are going to be factored into our look for the quarter and going forward. So that's all baked in. Rich Safran : Thanks a lot. Dave Calhoun : Yes. Matt Welch : And that concludes our call this morning. I appreciate everybody joining. Thank you again. Dave Calhoun : Thank you. Brian West : Thanks. Operator : Thank you and that completes The Boeing Company's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you all for joining and you may now disconnect.",

Dave Calhoun : Thank you, Matt. Good morning everybody and thanks for joining us. While we report on our fourth quarter results today, my focus is on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 and the actions we are taking as a company that strengthen quality and earn the confidence of our customers, the confidence of our regulators, and the flying public. Brian will cover the financials. I will keep my comments strictly to the issue at hand. I'll start upfront by apologizing again to Alaska Airlines, to their crew and to their passengers and more broadly, to all of our customers who were affected by the 737 MAX 9 grounding. The NTSB's investigation into the accident is ongoing. I have an amazing amount of confidence in the work that they do. They bring experts to the investigation. And they take all the time that's necessary to draw accurate conclusions, and we intend to be there with them. As part of that NTSB process, I cannot comment on any specific root cause or speculate a root cause. As a participant in the process, I do believe the investigation will narrow quickly. Whatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened. Whatever the specific cause of the accident might turn out to be, an event like this simply must not happen on an airplane that leaves one of other factories. We simply must be better. Our customers deserve better. I want to remind everybody what a great job the pilots and the crew at Alaska Airlines did in responding to a desperate moment. I also want to remind everybody what a terrific job the leadership at Alaska Airlines did, grounding the airplanes and ensuring safety. Alaska Airlines did exactly what companies like Boeing would hope that they do at a moment like that and that is why the airline industry is as safe as it is. We caused the problem, and we understand that. Over these last few weeks, I've had tough conversations with our customers, with our regulators, congressional leaders and more. We understand why they are angry, and we will work to earn their confidence. There is no message, no slogan that will accomplish that. It's all about real, demonstrated action and absolute transparency every step of the way. So, let's talk about those steps. Our team has worked diligently to help our customers restore their 737-9 airplanes to service. The FAA approved the detailed inspection protocol last Wednesday. And today, all 737-9 operators are safely returning their airplanes in service. More broadly, we are taking immediate and comprehensive actions to strengthen quality of Boeing and within our supply chain. We instituted additional quality controls and inspections at Boeing and at our supplier. We issued bulletins to suppliers to strengthen the focus on conformance and reducing the risks of quality escapes. We opened our factories to 737 operators for additional direct oversight and we appointed an expert quality adviser to conduct a comprehensive and independent review of our commercial airplane quality management system, and they will remain with us for many years. Most importantly, last week, we paused 737 production for the day as more than 10,000 teammates across Renton, Seattle, and Moses Lake stopped to focus on safety and quality and only safety and quality. This was a quality stand-down at a scale we have never done before, and we're going to keep doing them across our commercial factories. In addition to our internal actions, the FAA has announced new oversight of our 737 manufacturing. We will cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA at every turn. We respect their role as our regulator, and we will follow their direction in every step on production. Today, we're producing 737s at a rate of 38 per month and we will remain at that rate until the FAA and Boeing is satisfied with our quality and manufacturing process. This increased scrutiny, whether it comes from us, from our regulator or from third-parties, will make us better. It's that simple. Over the last several years, we've taken close care not to push the system too fast. And we have never hesitated to slow down, to hold production or to stop deliveries to take the time we need to get things right. Nobody knows that better than our investors. As you know, we stopped delivering 787s for over a year to ensure that each conform to our exacting specifications prior to delivery. And on the 737 line, we have regularly slowed rate breaks to support the stability of the overall production system and to correct non-conformances when identified. But this actually makes it absolutely clear we have more work to do. I know that these moments that impact delivery schedules can frustrate our customers and our investors. But quality and safety must come above all else. And our customers and our investors know that and are in there with us. On that note, as you will see, we are not issuing financial outlook for 2024 today. Now is not the time for that. We won't predict timing. We won't get ahead of our regulator. We will go slow to go fast. And we will encourage and reward employees for speaking up to slow things down if that's what's needed. We will simply focus on every next airplane and ensuring we meet all the standards that we have, all the standards that our regulator has and that our customers demand. As we go about that work, we remain confident in our recovery. Since day one, we've been focused squarely on inculcating safety and quality to everything that we do and getting back to our legacy of having engineering excellence at the center of our business. That focus and commitment is unwavering. And we will continue to strengthen our processes and our execution every step of the way. Most importantly, we will be transparent every step of the way. And with our 170,000 employees in mind, I'd like to close with a message directly to our team. We have confidence in you, and we have confidence in Boeing. We have confidence in our airplanes. I know how seriously you take your work. Our men and women on the manufacturing floor and in our engineering offices know exactly what we must do. You know your work better than anyone else on the planet. Use your voice, speak up, focus on every next detail. We will seek out and act on your feedback. We're in a challenging moment. We will earn trust back through demonstrated action and a commitment to total transparency. I'm confident in you, I'm confident in our company and that together, we will do just that. Brian, over to you. Brian West : Thanks Dave and good morning everyone. Let's start off with the total company financial performance for the quarter. Revenue was $22 billion. That's up 10% year-over-year. Growth was driven by higher commercial volume and favorable mix. The core loss per share was $0.47, better than last year primarily on improved commercial volume, better mix and lower abnormal costs. They were offset by lower defense margins and higher period expenses, including R&D, which we expected. Free cash flow was $3 billion in the quarter, in line with the prior year and up sequentially from the third quarter primarily due to improved commercial deliveries and strong order activity, which show favorable advanced payment timing, some of which was anticipated in the first quarter of 2024. Turning to the next page, I'll cover Boeing Commercial Airplanes. BCA booked 611 net orders in the quarter with 411 737s, including an order with Akasa, 98 777Xs largely an Emirates order and 83 787s. We have over 5,600 airplanes in backlog valued at $441 billion. BCA delivered 157 airplanes in the quarter and revenue was $10.5 billion. That's up 13% driven by higher widebody deliveries and favorable mix. Operating margin was just positive at 0.4%, driven by returning to normal 737 delivery levels in the quarter, improved mix as well as lower abnormal costs associated with getting to five per month on the 87 and resuming production on the 777X. Now, I'll give more color on the key programs. On the 737, we delivered 110 airplanes in the quarter and 45 in December. The program also began FAA certification flight testing on the 737-10 in December. For the year, we delivered 396 airplanes, on the upper end of the revised guidance range we provided in October. Per the FAA announcement, we'll maintain production at 38 per month and work transparently with the FAA to complete all requirements for future increases. At the same time, we'll continue to prioritize the master schedule to avoid disruption in our supply chain. On the 737-9, we're actively supporting our customers' return to service activities. And as of today, the majority are back flying. In our factory, we have 10 -9s in production, all of which will undergo the FAA group inspection process prior to delivery. Spirit has also adopted this inspection routine in its factory. The quarter ended with about 200 MAX airplanes in inventory. It's important to think about this inventory in three buckets. First, there are 140 737-8s built prior to 2023. The vast majority are for customers in China and India. We still expect to deliver most of these airplanes by year-end as we work towards shutting down the shadow factory. In the second bucket, there are around 25 airplanes produced in 2023 that are still in WIP, given the disruptions in the second half of last year. And we expect these to deliver in 2024. And lastly, there are approximately 35 -7 to -10s that we will deliver once those airplanes are certified, the timing of which will be determined by the FAA. Moving on to the 787. We delivered 23 airplanes in the quarter, including 11 in December. For the year, we delivered 73 airplanes, within the guidance range we originally outlined for 2023. The program successfully transitioned production to five per month in the quarter and still plan to steadily work our way to 10 per month in the 2025, 2026 timeframe. We ended the quarter with approximately 60 airplanes in inventory, about 50 of which require rework, which continues to progress steadily. We still expect to deliver most of these airplanes by year-end as we finish the rework and shut down the shadow factory. We booked $77 million of abnormal costs in the quarter and have approximately $300 million left to go that will wind down by year-end, in line with our expectations. On the 777X, we resumed production in the quarter and continue to progress along the program timeline, which remains unchanged. During the quarter, the Emirates order for 90 777Xs brought the program backlog to more than 400 airplanes and also extended the accounting quantity. We continue to follow the lead of the FAA as we progress through the certification process, including working to obtain approval from the FAA to begin certification flight testing. We booked $71 million of abnormal costs in the quarter, which is now fully behind us after resuming production, in line with our expectations. Moving to the next page, Boeing Defense and Space. BDS booked $8 billion in orders during the quarter, including the Lot 10 Award from the US Air Force for 15 KC-46A Tankers. The backlog is now at $59 billion. Revenue was $6.7 billion, up 9% on the tanker award and improved volume and BDS delivered 52 aircraft and two satellites in the quarter. Operating margin was minus 1.5% in the quarter, a sequential improvement from 3Q, but still we have more work to do. 4Q results were impacted by cost true-ups on three fixed-price development programs totaling $139 million as well as unfavorable performance and mix on other programs. Our game plan to get BDS back to high single-digit margins by the 2025-2026 timeframe remains unchanged. Our core business remains solid, representing 60% of our revenue and performing in the mid to high single-digit margin range. The demand for these products is very strong and we need to execute, compete and grow these offerings. On the 25% of the portfolio primarily comprised of fighter and satellite programs, operational performance stabilized as we exit the year. And as a result, the fourth quarter saw improved margin trends, although still negative. We still expect to return to the strong historical performance levels as we roll out new contracts with tighter underwriting disciplines as we move into the 2025-2026 timeframe. Lastly, we have our fixed-price development programs that represent the remaining 15% of revenue. Despite the relatively modest cost trips [ph] in the quarter, we continue to focus on maturing these programs and retiring risks quarter in, quarter out. And we made some good progress in the fourth quarter. In addition to capturing the tanker award from the US Air Force, the program delivered nine aircraft in the fourth quarter, continuing to build positive momentum in spite of the supply-related disruptions to the factory that we faced earlier last year. And on the T-7A, the first Red Hawk arrived at Edwards Air Force Base in November, formally starting the Air Force development flight test campaign for the aircraft. Overall, the defense portfolio is poised to improve. The strong demand across the customer base, the products are performing in the field, and we're confident that our efforts to drive execution and stability will return this business to performance levels that our investors recognize. Moving now to the next page, Boeing Global Services. BGS had another strong quarter. They received $6 billion in orders and the backlog is now at $20 billion. Revenue was $4.8 billion, up 6% primarily on favorable commercial volume and mix. Operating margins were a very strong 17.4%, an expansion of 350 basis points versus last year as both our commercial and government businesses were delivering double-digit margins. In the quarter, BGS opened a parts distribution center in India and received a follow-on contract to provide sustainment for the C-17. Turning now to the next page, I'll cover cash and debt. On cash and marketable securities, we ended the quarter at $16 billion. On debt, the balance remained flat at $52.3 billion and over the next few days, we'll pay down $4 billion of the $5 billion of maturities coming due this year from our available cash on hand. We continue to maintain access to $10 billion of revolving credit facilities, all of which remain undrawn. Our liquidity position remains strong. Our investment-grade credit rating continues to be a priority. And we're developing -- deploying capital in line with the portage [ph] we've shared previously : invest in the business and pay down debt. Turning to the next page, I'll cover our full year financials. Full year revenue was $77.8 billion, up 17% year-over-year. Growth was driven by improved commercial volume primarily on higher 787 deliveries. The core loss per share was $5.81, better than prior year primarily on improved commercial volume and mix as well as lower fixed price development charges in defense. Free cash flow was $4.4 billion for the year, up versus prior year primarily on higher 787 deliveries and favorable receipt timing that was partially offset by higher expenditures as we increase production rates and invest in the business. While we're postponing issuing 2024 guidance today, given our current focus, we're committed to sharing timely and transparent updates moving forward. I would like to provide some additional context on our path forward. We always knew 2024 was going to be an important year in our recovery. Based on what we know today, we expect another steady year of free cash flow, driven by the 737 production at 38 per month, ongoing execution of the 787 toward our long-term objectives, continued liquidation of our 737 and 787 inventory, and continued focus to wind down both shadow factories. Our defense business will continue to improve as we mature fixed-price programs and transition recently challenged programs with better underwriting disciplines that we've already started to see and BGS will continue to generate strong free cash flow. Longer term, we're focused on quality and stability, which will ultimately drive free cash flow. Nothing has changed on the demand front, and the backlog is strong and growing. Remember, our 2025-2026 guidance was based on achieving stability and we have to earn that by applying resources to fix our issues and demonstrate predictability one airplane at a time, side-by-side with our regulator. This team is up to the challenge, and we'll apply any and all resources to get back to deliveries that satisfy our customers and underwrite the long-term demand profile. We're still confident in the goals we laid out for 2025-2026 although it may take longer in that window than originally anticipated, and we won't rush the system. With that, I'll turn it back to Dave for closing comments. Dave Calhoun : Yes. Thanks Brian. We're addressing you from Renton, home of 737 MAX family. We're living in the here and now, and we're working with all of our people and I couldn't be more impressed with their commitment, dedication and the comprehensive nature around which they will look at this. Boeing will get better. I am confident in that. We will address everything that needs to be learned from the accident, and we'll move forward. So, thanks. Happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Peter Arment. Please go ahead. Peter Arment : Yes. good morning Dave and Brian. Dave Calhoun : Hi Peter. Peter Arment : Dave, thanks for the initial opening color on the MAX situation and the steps being taken. So, I guess just to follow on that, Dave, I wanted to ask you about where you assess you are in kind of the recovery of the MAX program when we think about what has been a successful transition to rate 38 and some of the progress in stabilizing the supply chain. And you've commenced deliveries to China and I know we're not talking about 2025-2026 targets, but directionally, there's been a lot of improvement since last fall and since your Investor Day when you laid out this long-term outlook. Thanks. Dave Calhoun : Yes, Peter, I appreciate that. By the way, one stat which I was just handed, which I track all the time is the number of our -9s that have been returned into service. We're at 129, and that is progressing at a very quick rate based on the inspection protocols that are FAA and we all agreed with. I am very proud of the progress that we've made, and I feel great about it, of course, with one exception, and it's too big an exception, which is the escape. I also know that as the NTSB investigation narrows and concludes, and I do believe that will happen in relatively short order, all the learning that can be extracted from it and all the learning that can be extracted from all those inspections of all those airplanes flying day in and day out, that will inform us on what improvements we can make on our quality systems. First and foremost, we will run the door plug literally from the second a door is received at Wichita through their lines, all 12 positions, through our 11 positions here. Inspections will be added at every turn. It is on lockdown, and we've had help from our FAA. We've had help from our customers, et cetera. So, that's sort of step two. The next one is how do you take all of that learning and apply it through all the supply chain lines. And we have some medium- and long-term efforts just beginning to make sure that we do that. My confidence comes from quality systems always can get better. And when you have a moment like this, you take everything. You literally look at everything, and we're all keenly aware of everything. So, we're going to run that play as hard as we can, and we're going to take the time to do it and the FAA -- I'm sort of glad they called out a pause because that's a good excuse to just take our time, do it right and I wish I had called that out in the first day, but maybe I would have. We've been good at taking pauses. I've probably taken more pauses in the last three years, and I'll apologize to all our investors now, than have been taken in 10 years before it. But this is what we do, and it's how we get better. And I also say, Peter, as you know, one of the nagging issues that we've been facing have been shortages here and there, where we have to pause our line. Buffer inventory is not quite as robust as we'd like them to be based on supply chain weaknesses. We will run our master schedule in accordance with the plans that preceded this. And each and every part we receive and all the buffer inventories that we get will stabilize production here on out, less traveled work in our line, all things good come from that. So, I feel really good about it. And I also have confidence in our airplanes that will be certified. I like the respect that the FAA and Boeing are showing one another. Again, maybe too long a diatribe, but there are lots of reasons for why I'm feeling good. And in some ways, this moment will accelerate recovery, not delay it. Peter Arment : And just initial progress on China? Thanks. Dave Calhoun : Yes. So, Peter, as we've talked many, many, many times, we have stood by our customers in China day in, day out. They have been flying MAXs now for the better part of the year. They are performing extremely well. And we'd always hoped and expected they would begin to take deliveries. And I think everybody has noticed that those deliveries have started. So, we are just going to stay diligent, stay with each and every one of them and make sure our Chinese customers get what they've ordered and paid for. Peter Arment : Thanks so much Dave. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Morning Dave and Brian. Maybe if you could update us on how you're thinking about the MAX 10 and the MAX 7 certification timing, just given MAX 7 exemption being withdrawn. What does it mean for the 10? And how does that phase in as you think about ramping production to 50 a month and the profit profile of the MAX side if there's no MAX 7 or 10? Dave Calhoun : Sheila, thanks for that question. I'm going to just give a little bit of a moment on why we made that decision on the time-limited exemption. I'll let Brian help quantify it. I visited Capitol Hill for a lot of reasons. My biggest one is to own the problem, be transparent and convey that to all of our workforce so that they know we're willing to do that. And then we can all be honest, clear with each other every step of the way in this process and so I'm glad I made the visit. I was not expecting when I met with Senator Duckworth, the conversation that we had. You know she's a pilot and a decorated pilot. She listened to everything I had to say. We didn't have a debate about the safety of the 7 and the 7 in its certification work was moving along at a pretty steady pace. She had a way different argument for me, and it was right. She said, you want to introduce this new airplane, a derivative, yes, but a new airplane. And nine months from now, you'll have an engineered solution to it, to this issue. And why is that the right call? And in my view, it was a sound, principled position to take. I went home for the weekend. I talked to our customer, and you know who that is, unbelievably constructive, and this is the right thing to do for aviation. So, that is really how it happened, and it was that simple. But the passion and the argument that Senator Duckworth presented to me, I'm so glad I heard. Anyway, that's what happened. The 7 will have to move until we get that engineered fix in place. And then I'll let Brian sort of quantify the, okay, now what. Brian West : Yes, and on the 7, the work at hand, we will design engineering solution. We're applying the resources. Our view that, that could be within a year. But on the 7, remember, while it's a very, very important customer, the number of deliveries you're talking about is relatively small. As I mentioned, we've got 35 of -7 and -10 in inventory at the end of the quarter. There are a handful of 10s. They're mostly 7. So, we'll sort that out as the process works in that airplane for the FAA gets certified. On your question on the -10, I prefer not to get into what if. It is a great airplane. Customers love it, and there's great demand for it, and it will get certified at some point when the FAA decides. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Myles Walton : Thanks. Brian, you alluded to 2024 being another -- I think the words were steady year of free cash flow. I think in sort of follow-on descriptions, you gave a lot of uppers to what's going to happen year-on-year. So, is steady meaning growth in free cash flow and/or can you give some of the offsets to the uppers? Thanks. Brian West : Yes. Thanks Myles. So, I did describe some of the key ones. Obviously, BCA volume up, BDS less of a drag, BGS steady. There's a big investment in there that I probably should have called out now that you're asking is the 777X investment. That's important, and that's big. And also, we got a plan for making sure that we stay laser like our supply based on the master schedule. We don't want them to take their foot off what they're doing. And if that means we got to hold more inventory, so be it. It's important because at this moment, it will allow us to have any of our suppliers that might have been at the live meet, short of the line, they get a chance to catch up. So, all of that in the mix are levers that we got to deal with as we move into the year. And in terms of what steady means, our belief we stand here today, the bottom end will look a lot like it did last year and maybe a little bit of growth. And once we know more, we'll put more specificity around it, and we'll give normal guidance when adequate, when appropriate. Myles Walton : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman : Hey, thanks very much and good morning. Dave Calhoun : Good morning Seth. Seth Seifman : Brian, you talked a couple of times about the shadow factories and the path towards winding them down over the next year and change. Is there any way to quantify how you think about what the cost of the shadow factories was in 2023 or what you expect it to be in 2024? Brian West : Yes. So -- thanks. I would -- the impact you're not going to see in 2024, just because we still have to move that work through the system. But as we exit, it will largely behind us. As we think about our expectations on BCA profitability over time, we've always talked to it getting back to normal. A lot of that productivity will be not only what volume might look like. I can't say a lot about that now. But also, we don't have this resource with the shadow factories. So, we won't quantify it specifically, but it is an important component as we think about going from what our profitability has looked like at BCA historically and where we think we can get to. Dave Calhoun : Maybe I'll just add and refresh everybody's memory because we've talked about it a couple of times. In our shadow factories, we put more hours into those airplanes than we do to produce it in the first place. So, anyway, that's a metric I know everybody understands. Seth Seifman : Great. And maybe if I could sneak in one more to -- the advances, it was a nice tailwind in 2023. How do you think about that in 2024? Brian West : Right now, we plan for, obviously, not to be quite what it was in 2023. That's factored into my comments. The good news is, is that we still have a pretty robust demand environment. Our commercial teams are working hard to chase every next order. So, we're not counting on a big one, but we know that our teams can go win campaigns. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead. Jason Gursky : Hey, good morning everybody. Brian, just maybe a quick clarification or maybe, Dave, and then a question on defense. The clarification on the rate 38 a month, you guys still firing some blanks so that the number that you're actually producing is a little bit less than that? Just kind of curious what rate 38 means. And then on defense, Brian, you've historically broken things down into that 60, 25, 15 bucket. You talked a little bit about the 25% bucket and the 15% bucket in your remarks. So, I was wondering if you can just comment on the 60%, the remaining part of the portfolio and how that's performing and where maybe margins are in that slug of business at this point? Thanks. Brian West : Sure, I'll take the first one. Yes, we've cycled to 38 per month. We said that. Keep in mind, it always takes time for that to equate it to deliveries, but we're not firing blanks. On your question on the 60% of the portfolio on BDS, look, they've consistently quarter in, quarter out has still been able to deliver some very good performance on some products that the customers need. And you know the laundry list that we talked about, things like Apache and all that sort of stuff, missiles and weapons, things that are needed right now in this environment that we live in. And they're performing well and they're in that mid to high single-digit margin rate. And when we step back, if we think about going from where BDS is with margins, two things have to happen. That 25% that's wrapped around fighters and satellites, that has to get better. We expect it to get better and look a lot like it used to. So, then you've got 85% of your portfolio clicking at stable, consistent mid- to high single-digit rates. And we know we can get there. And then you've got this 15% of the portfolio on fixed-price development programs that we expect to be less of a drag as we retire risk over time. And we expect that to play out. Jason Gursky : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Doug Harned : Good morning. Thank you. Dave Calhoun : Hi Doug. Doug Harned : Hi. I want to go back to the MAX 7 and the MAX 10 certification. And the question I have is when you look forward and given there is uncertainty on the timing of the certification of each one of those, and you look at both the mix and your customer demand. And certainly, you've had more demand than you can respond to, given supply chain issues. First, let's say that mix changes because of the timing of certification on those two variants. Are you still -- do you still see your line as full because it could be moved around between -7s, 8s, 9s, 10s? And then second, what kind of operational challenges, if any, do you have when you have to have some flexibility about what variant you're producing? Dave Calhoun : Doug, I'll just start by saying I think it's manageable. We will have this -- if there's a delay in any way, we're not going to know at the last second. We're going to know with a considerable timeframe in my view. And by the way, right now, the status on the 7 and the 10 was progressing reasonably well. I don't believe the FAA has taken anybody off the course, and we haven't taken anybody off the course and so they are making real progress. And I think we were almost close to the finish line had we not pulled the time-limited exemption. So, I don't -- again, I'm never going to suggest a date or anything like that for the FAA. But they're working diligently on it, and they know how to separate these two -- these -- the issue we're wrestling within our factory from the cert efforts. And I believe we're going to have plenty of time, and we'll be able to manage our product mix reasonably well. There won't be anything dramatic by way of change. If there are some change from quarter-to-quarter, first or second, you'll know it pretty early, and so will we and I think it's quite manageable. Doug Harned : So, is it fair to say that the supply chain ramp is probably still the governing constraint on your production ramp, not things like mix here? Dave Calhoun : Yes. Although I will say, if this pause goes on for a little while, I like -- I don't want to pause my customers. But the pause is going to be helpful for us in so many ways in the sense that, that supply chain, they're going to keep running according to that master schedule. It's good for us if some buffers get developed and some of the more stressed suppliers get ahead of the game. So there is important progress that will get made despite this momentary pause. Doug Harned : Very good. Thank you. Dave Calhoun : Thanks Doug. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ron Epstein : Hey, good morning. How are you? If I may, I got a two-part question if that's okay. The first one, if you guys could walk through 787 a little bit. You mentioned the rate -- what's going on in that line, that sort of thing. We get questions about that. And then I'll come back with the second part in a second. Brian West : Yes. So, on the 787, there's nothing new on the 87. Team is doing a very nice job. We'll produce at the five per month rate like we described. We expect to steadily increase those rates over time and liquidate a lot of inventory, a lot of inventory. And we'll give more dimensions around the specifics in line with normal guidance, but the program is doing just fine and the backlog is big. Ron Epstein : Yes, that's been doing great. And then maybe the second question, this one is a little more difficult. The -- I'm still trying to get my head around how we got here. Meaning if you go back to the beginning of the MAX issue, wasn't the 737 line like the most scrutinized production line in the world? So, what happened to get to where we got today? I understand that revamping the quality system and all that is all great news. It's a positive move forward. But why did that have to happen now? And I just don't understand that. Dave Calhoun : Well, Ron, it's a -- it should never happen. So, the question about now is not so relevant. It should never and can never happen. I am incredibly proud of the work that our people do on the 37 line. I think it has steadily progressed. Quality numbers have gotten better. But when you have an escape and then when everybody concludes exactly what happened in that escape, lights another fire. So, you take another step forward with respect to all things quality. And you make certain that whatever it was that created that opportunity for failure in the sky or in flight can never happen again. And that has already happened, and then we'll learn from everything. So, yes, I think I understand your underlying context for the question, but I probably take exception to that premise. Ron Epstein : Okay. Operator : The next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr : Yes. Thanks so much. So, now that you've waived the exemption on the engine anti-icing and you're designing the new system, you said it would take about a year. Have you accelerated that at all? And could you accelerate it more because my assumption is that is going to be the long pole in the tent in terms of when you -- when the FAA can certify the MAX 7 and 10? Dave Calhoun : I think that is an accurate statement that you just made. Given the fact that we made this decision just a couple of days ago, needless to say, we will throw more engineers at it. We're going to put more work in it and can accelerate it. And the nine months that I discussed with Senator Duckworth was based on my understanding of that project before I made this decision. So, the answer is yes, we'll step up resources. We'll step up whatever testing is required. We will do everything we can to inform the FAA about that particular part of that program. So, -- and that's where we stand today. And you are correct. That is the pole in the tent. All of us should be watching. Cai von Rumohr : Terrific. Thank you. And then another quick one. With the supply chain running at the master schedule but you're delivering not quite as many, should we think about a fairly large build in the inventory account here in the next couple of quarters until you get beyond that? Brian West : Yes, there's two things, Cai, that are going to be things we have to deal with in cash flow. One is going to be the 777X investment I discussed as well as what you just described. And that's contemplated in my description of what we thought the bottom look like. And then we just got to go run the play and work through what's in front of us. But more work ahead, and we'll describe it more specifically as we move through the year. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you. Matt Welch : Hey Lois, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. And that question comes from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Noah Poponak : Hey, good morning everyone. Dave Calhoun : Hey Noah. Brian West : Hi Noah. Noah Poponak : Might go over one if I'm last. But Brian, recognizing that there's some limitation here in how you can discuss it, but maybe just trying to talk out MAX units this year with assumptions of not breaking to higher rates. You made it a point to say you're at 38. I know that rate final assembly, where the entire supply chain is, is always a different number. But if I just simply said 31 for six months and 38 for six months, that's in the low 400s and then you unwind five to 10 of inventory a month. I can kind of get somewhere near 500 or just decent growth from 2023. Is that just a reasonable starting point as we wait to learn more from the FAA? Brian West : Noah, I completely understand the question. Those are the inputs I described. But out of respect for the process that we need to go through the FAA, I just got to steer away from specificity. It's just not the right time. We've got work in front of us. And I promise when appropriate, we are going to be more specific. But anyway, that's -- it's probably going to be on the specificity of those numbers, wait and see. It's just not appropriate. Noah Poponak : Yes, fair enough. Fair enough. Are you willing and able to speak to just updating what the cap is these days on the monthly inventory unwind and how China plays into that? Brian West : I don't know we think about a cap. We've got the shadow factories that have been working for quite a while. And they know the routines, and they've been pretty steadily on both 37 and the 87, consistently meeting month in, month out liquidation targets and expectations for customers. So, I don't think there's any kind of cap. We're just focused on we know exactly the piles of inventory. It's 140 on the 37 that I described. It's 50 on the 87 that have to get the rework. And we're just going to move through this year with real focus in order to be in a position where we start shutting these shadow factories down. And then we're just going to run that play as hard as we can. Noah Poponak : Okay. And is China officially fully 100% taking deliveries? We see it in the press. We see the reading of the tail number of websites. But can you just declare that, that's just fully officially on at this point? Dave Calhoun : One at a time, and yes. Noah Poponak : Okay. And then, Brian, just one more, defense. The margin is still not where you want it but better sequentially. Any framework you can provide around how that progresses through 2024? And what was the final defense cash burn in the 2023 cash, so we can think about where -- what to work off of as we go into 2024. Brian West : Yes. So, the cash burn, we put out some numbers a year ago, and we thought the operating cash flows by division. BDS, the worst case and for them in that range. They were much worse than that. And it's all what we described last year, and we expect it to be better this year. And that's behind us. But yes, they did a lot worse, obviously, offset by BGS and BCA doing better. But it was worse. And then the first part of your question on margins, we expect margin trajectories to get better over time, particularly as we focus on this 25% of the portfolio that is very specific, and there's a lot of actions or activity around it. But we will get better. They will eventually get to the point where we're putting positives on the board. What I'm most interested is the team that's got to execute over the next -- between now and 2025-2026 in order to get these margins back in the high single-digit range. And I will remind you that that's how we describe our defense margins. You really got to put two points on top of that, which is what we account for in our Global Services division for the defense side. So, it's really more like a double-digit defense external view that we are aiming to get towards because we think that's a pretty decent business. Noah Poponak : Right. okay. Matt Welch : You squeezed in three. Noah Poponak : We got in and we got them all in. got the rest in. Thanks so much for the time. I appreciate it. Dave Calhoun : Thanks Noah. Thanks everyone. Matt Welch : Thanks everybody. Operator : That completes the Boeing Company's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

The management discussion and the slide presentation plus the analyst question-and-answer session are being broadcast live over the Internet. [Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Matt Welch, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Mr. Welch, please go ahead. Matt Welch : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Boeing's quarterly earnings call. I am Matt Welch, and with me today are Dave Calhoun, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian West, Boeing's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation at boeing.com. As always, detailed financial information is included in today's press release.

In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures. Now I will turn the call over to Dave Calhoun. David Calhoun : Thanks, Matt. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Although we report first quarter financial results today, I will direct my comments toward the dramatic actions we've taken since the Alaska Airlines accident in January. First, we began with taking responsibility. We immediately and transparently began supporting the NTSB to identify the cause of the accident. We supported the FAA investigation of the 737-9 fleet in its entirety to do comprehensive airline inspections, and the aircraft were cleared to go back into service. We immediately acted, working alongside our supply chain, to ensure the door plug depressurization event doesn't ever happen again. We held quality stand-downs across all of our production lines in BCA, and sought the advice and counsel of more than 70,000 employees to improve our factory disciplines and adherence to our quality standards. All in all, we collected over 30,000 ideas, and the list continues to grow. We have categorized and prioritized all. Employee engagement has been energizing for all. Actions are being taken across all of our factories, and areas of focus include : training, particularly on the job, taking advantage of our slowdown and adding hundreds of hours of training for each of our manufacturing employees; tooling, more of it and improve maintenance; work instructions, simplify, simplify, simplify; compliance checks, discipline; traveled work controls, don't travel work; incentive structures; employee listening; and maybe above all, culture improvement. We transparently engaged with the FAA and immediately went to work on a 90-day plan of quality action to drive improvements throughout our production system. We completed our 30-day review, and we're regularly checking in with the FAA as we complete our 90-day plan. We engaged a team of independent quality experts to systematically review our quality control process and bring forward long-term recommendations. They are roughly 60 days into their work beginning with Renton and Spirit. And we expect them to stay for several years. We have appointed several new leaders into critical BCA leadership roles in the last couple of months. All have jumped in with both feet, alongside our world-class workforce. They are seasoned operators and all with a critical eye.  Effective March 1, we moved inspection and rework teams to Wichita. Since then, we have only allowed fully inspected fuselages to be shipped to Renton, which has dramatically reduced our nonconformances entering the Renton factory. This started as a trickle, and it has been slowly improving as time goes on. The visibility in Wichita will help the Spirit team prevent nonconformances from being created in the first place. We are already beginning to see signs of more predictable and reduced cycle times in our factory as a result of these enhanced quality control standards. We expect this will continue to improve. We've extended our commitment to reduce traveled work across all of our assembly lines and deep into our supply chain. While near-term delivery shortfalls hurt and will affect our performance during our first half of the year, the long-term benefits from a synchronized supply chain will be substantial. We are absolutely committed to doing everything that we can to make certain our regulators, our customers and most importantly, our employees and the flying public are 100% confident in Boeing. And while I have shared my plans to step down as CEO by the end of the year, I will be very focused every day on seeing that commitment through. As we move through this period, it is important that our people and our stakeholders understand how promising Boeing's future looks. Demand across our portfolio remains incredibly strong. Our people are world-class. There's a lot of work in front of us, but I'm proud of our team and remain fully confident in our future. While this effort will slow our recovery timing, we are now seeing these proof points that give us confidence that we'll begin to stabilize and improve performance moving forward. By the end of this year, we expect to have largely delivered our 737 and 787 inventory, effectively shutting down our 2 large shadow factories. Our commercial business will be more stable. Our defense unit will be progressing towards more historic levels of performance. And our services team will continue to deliver exceptional results. And most importantly, we will have embedded all of the important lessons we've learned in the last few months and over the last several years. During that time, I've had the opportunity to speak to many of our frontline team members, engineers and mechanics. I continue to be amazed by the pride they take in their work, their commitment to getting things done the right way, the safe way, their willingness to raise their hands and offer ideas for how to do things better. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Brian West : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with the total company financial performance for the quarter. Revenue was $16.6 billion, down 8% versus last year, primarily reflecting lower 737 delivery volume. The core loss per share was $1.13, a slight improvement versus last year, also reflecting lower 737 deliveries. Free cash flow was a usage of $3.9 billion in the quarter, a higher usage than last year and in line with the expectations shared last month. Cash was impacted by lower commercial deliveries and unfavorable timing of receipts and expenditures. Turning to the next page, I'll cover Boeing Commercial Airplanes. BCA booked 125 net orders in the quarter, including 85 737-10s for American Airlines and 28 777Xs for customers, including Ethiopian Airlines. The backlog grew to $448 billion and includes more than 5,600 airplanes. BCA delivered 83 airplanes in the quarter. Revenue was $4.7 billion, and operating margin was minus 24.6%. These results were significantly lower than last year, primarily reflecting lower 737 deliveries and the 737-9 grounding impact for customer considerations of $443 million. Now I'll give more color on the key programs. On the 737, we delivered 67 airplanes in the first quarter as we deliberately slowed production below 38 per month to incorporate improvements to our quality and safety management systems, including reducing traveled work and addressing supplier nonconformances. These continued efforts will cause April deliveries to be more in line with February levels as we complete our work. Production [ ordering ] below 38 per month for the first half of the year and will be higher in the second half as we move back to 38 per month, with the timing of rates beyond 38 predicated on the work we're doing with the FAA. We've recently made adjustments to the master schedule, and we'll continue to manage supplier by supplier based on inventory levels and rate ramp readiness. Our objective remains to keep the supply chain paced ahead of final assembly to support stability and minimize traveled work. The quarter ended with approximately 110 737-8s built prior to 2023, the vast majority for customers in China and India. This is down 30 airplanes from last quarter and in line with our plans. We still expect to deliver most of these inventoried airplanes by year-end as we work towards shutting down the shadow factory. There were [ approximately ] 95 additional airplanes in inventory, about 35 of which were -7 and -10s, and the remaining are WIP airplanes impacted by factory and supply chain constraints. On the anti-icing, the timeline is unchanged, and we're making good progress towards resolution. As it pertains to the certification of the -7 and the -10, we coordinated with our customers and added more 8s and 9s into the skyline in the near term to mitigate impacts to their fleet needs and stabilize our production plans. And the program margin has been updated to reflect these impacts as well as the slower production ramp. On the 787, we delivered 13 airplanes in the quarter. We're slowing near-term production and plan to return to 5 per month later this year. We expect to achieve rate increases, including 10 per month by 2026. We ended the quarter with about 60 airplanes of inventory, about 40 of which require rework, which continues to progress steadily and in line with our expectations. We still expect to finish the reworked airplanes and shut down the shadow factory by year-end, with most of these airplanes delivering in the year. Finally, on 777X. We continue to progress along the program time line and still expect first delivery in 2025. We'll follow the lead of the FAA as we progress through the process, including working to obtain approval from the FAA to begin certification flight testing. Moving on to the next page, we'll go to Boeing Defense and Space. BDS booked $9 billion in orders during the quarter, including awards for 17 P-8 aircraft for the Royal Canadian Air Force and the German Navy and securing the final F/A-18 newbuild production contract from the U.S. Navy. The backlog grew to $61 billion. Revenue was $7 billion, up 6% on improved volume, and BDS delivered 14 aircraft in the quarter. Operating margin was 2.2%, another quarter of sequential improvement, but still more work to do. First quarter results were impacted by losses on 2 fixed-price development programs totaling $222 million, $128 million on the tanker and $94 million on the T-7A. Our game plan to get BDS back to high single-digit margins by the '25, '26 time frame remains intact. We've made important progress in 1Q. Our core business, representing about 60% of our revenue, is seeing solid consistent performance in the mid- to high single-digit margin range with strong demand across the board. On the 25% of the portfolio, primarily comprised of fighter and satellite programs, operational performance further stabilized in the quarter, which drove improved margin trends. We still expect to return to the strong historical performance levels as we roll into new contracts with tighter underwriting disciplines as we move into the '25, '26 time frame. Lastly, we have our fixed-price development programs that represent the remaining 15% of revenue. Despite the relatively modest updates in the quarter, we continue to retire risks and remain focused on maturing these programs quarter in and quarter out. Importantly, on the MQ-25 program, the program was awarded a cost-type contract modification from the U.S. Navy that included 2 additional test aircraft, demonstrating our progress and our commitment to stronger underwriting disciplines in the area of the development programs. The program also delivered the first static test article to the Navy, and the airframe is ready to begin stress testing. And on the Starliner, the program continues to progress towards a May 6 crew flight test as the spacecraft was recently integrated on top of its Atlas V rocket, and prelaunch testing is underway. Lastly, the T-7A test aircraft completed climate lab testing in February, and the program continues to progress with Air Force flight testing. Overall, the defense portfolio is well positioned. As seen in the initial FY '25 presidential budget, there's strong demand across the customer base. The products are performing in the field, and we're confident that our efforts to drive [ execution stability ] will return this business to performance levels that our investors recognize. Moving on to the next page, Boeing Global Services. BGS had another strong quarter. They received $5 billion in orders, and backlog is at $20 billion. Revenue was $5 billion, up 7% primarily on higher commercial volume and favorable mix. Operating margin was a strong 18.2%, an expansion of 30 basis points compared to last year. In the quarter, BGS opened a maintenance facility in Jacksonville, Florida, supporting our military customers. And the U.S. Navy exercised options on a P-8 sustainment modification contract. Turning to the next page, I'll cover cash and debt. On cash and marketable securities, we ended the quarter at $7.5 billion, reflecting the debt repayment activity and use of free cash in the quarter. The debt balance decreased to $47.9 billion as we paid down $4.4 billion of the $5 billion of maturities due this year. We continue to maintain access to $10 billion of revolving credit facilities, all of which remain undrawn. While we're still not in a position to provide a more detailed 2024 outlook today, I want to provide some additional context on the path forward. The 2024 free cash flow outlook I shared last month is still expected to be a generation in the low single-digit billions. Cash flow should improve as we move through the year and be back-end loaded, driven by BCA deliveries and receipt timing, including an expected Lot 11 award on the tanker. Second quarter free cash flow is expected to improve sequentially but be another sizable use of cash. We're committed to managing the balance sheet in a prudent manner with two main objectives : one, prioritize the investment-grade rating; and two, allow the factory and supply chain to stabilize for a stronger trajectory as we exit this year. As we operate at these lower production rates, we're actively monitoring our liquidity levels and believe we have significant market access, and are continuously monitoring and evaluating opportunities should we decide to supplement our liquidity position. Longer term, we remain confident in our ability to achieve $10 billion of free cash flow. However, given our continued focus on safety, quality and stability, we continue to expect that this goal will take us longer than we originally planned and later in the '25, '26 window, primarily tied to the 737 and 787 production delivery ramps of 50 per month and 10 per month, respectively. Moving on, discussions with Spirit are ongoing. As with any large and complex deal, there are a number of terms and issues we need to work through, including price, financing and other key items and the best approach to handling and potentially divesting certain work that Spirit does for other customers. We believe in the strategic logic of a deal, but we'll take the time needed to get this right before we decide to enter into agreement. In the meantime, the focus is on factory stability in Wichita and in Renton. And as you saw yesterday, we agreed to advance Spirit $425 million, virtually all of which will be repaid in the third quarter. This will be accounted for as investing cash. Looking forward to the balance of the year. We're taking the time now to ensure our BCA factories are stable and positioned to ramp production. We'll also continue to make progress on other important objectives, including shutting down the shadow factories, maturing and derisking the defense fixed-price development programs and building on the continued strong results in services. Our backlog of nearly $530 billion speaks to the breadth of our portfolio, and this demand backdrop underpins our commitment to drive long-term results, all enabled by the everyday execution of 170,000 incredibly talented and dedicated team of Boeing employees. With that, why don't we turn it over to questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Myles Walton : You gave color on the April MAX deliveries similar to February, but I'm really more interested in the production output, how it's going on the line, where you are relative to where you were when you started to give the no traveled work policy, how that's improving or not? And what specific metrics you're looking at to allow you to go higher over the next 6 months? David Calhoun : So why don't I start this off? It is going to stay sporadic through 2Q. The real pivot for us is the number of clean fuselages we get out of Spirit with the new inspection protocols. It started slow. In the meantime, we've been working on all the fuselages that were already trapped in the pipeline that did not go through that inspection process. So that's why it's slow and lumpy here in these couple of months, but we will be through that process within the next 60 days. And then we will just be dealing with clean fuselages out of Wichita. So far, we're quite encouraged at just how clean they are and how quickly they move through our production cycle, substantially better, faster than before. So as we exit 2Q, we will know exactly what numbers are coming out of Wichita and what expectations are. We are not going to rush it. We're simply going to demand that they be clean. But I like all the signals. I was walking through the factory yesterday. When we get a clean one, it whistles through the factory, and that's the most important thing. Operator : The next question is from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Douglas Harned : When you look at production on the 737, when you talk about going to $10 billion in free cash flow maybe by late -- by the end of 2026 or even 2027, this seems to be very much contingent on getting to this 50 a month rate. But when you look at that process, if I go back even pre-grounding for the MAX, Spirit had never successfully done a rate break to 50 a month before. And given the restart mode that they're in right now, how do you see the pathway to getting up from where they are today, getting through the quality issues and getting to 50 a month there within 2 years? David Calhoun : We do. Spirit's committed to it. I think the acquisition of Spirit will factor in significantly into that prospect. Clean fuselages in Spirit and in Wichita and fix on all those nonconformances will reduce their cycle and improve their output. So there's a lot of things that contribute to it, Doug. If we get ourselves to 38, which is our first objective, and we do it in a steady fashion moving up another 12 in my view, is doable in the window that we're talking about. So that's the bet we're making, and I'm confident we can get there. But job 1 is the 6 months that commenced post Alaska and the inspection protocols and the nonconformance fixes that are then embedded into the Wichita facility. Operator : The next question is from Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen. Cai Von Rumohr : Yes. So as a result of the production slowdown, you've had some -- presumably, you'll have late deliveries to customers. And traditionally, late deliveries require compensation. Could you give us some color in terms of what sort of a number we're going to look at? And basically, where are we going to see it? Is that going to be front-loaded, back-loaded? How should we think about that? Brian West : Cai, I'll take that one. Why don't we talk about in the context of 737 overall margins? The program booked about 300 basis points of impact in the quarter. And that was primarily driven by the delayed rate ramp that you're describing as well as mixing in more 8s and 9s for 10s in the near term so that we can support our customers in their fleet planning. So that will all roll through, and the timing will be expanded over the next couple of years. What our expectation is that over time that while these program margins won't get back to the 2018 levels, they will expand. And that will largely be driven by the rate ramps that Dave described. And the reason why they'll be different from where they were in 2018 is largely, as you know, is because of the customer mix and these delayed considerations. So all in all, when we step back and think about long term, structurally, particularly on the cash margin front, not a lot has changed. We just have to work through getting from here to those higher levels, including the consideration that we've described that we booked in the quarter. Overall long term, we still think we get there. Operator : The next question is from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Seth Seifman : Brian, you talked a little bit about the cash balance and liquidity. I don't know if this is necessarily the right way to think about it, but I feel like there's this conventional wisdom out there that Boeing should have roughly $10 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Maybe that can dip a little bit lower intra-year as we see now. But burning cash in the second quarter, kind of how low can that cash balance get before you have to do something? When you talked about additional sources of liquidity, what were you talking about? And how much room do you think you still have with the rating agencies to avoid getting put on a negative watch? Brian West : Thanks, Seth. First and foremost, I remind everyone that we do have $17 billion of liquidity today, comprised of the cash on hand as well as our credit lines. What we're focused on is a first half cash usage that is resulting from all of the actions we're taking to stabilize both the factory and the supply chain to set ourselves up for success as we move to the second half and into 2025. And to that end, any supplemental funding that I talked about would do two things. First of all, it would restore our cash balance to the historical level that you point out, that $10 billion-ish. But it also means that we want to continue our practice to stay well ahead of our near-term maturities. And by near term, I mean roughly the next 12 months. So that's what we're thinking about as we sit here today. We will be prudent and thoughtful. We believe the market would be open to us. And as we've said consistently, the most important thing is our investment-grade credit rating that we think a lot about, and it is a priority. Operator : Our next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Sheila  Kahyaoglu: Can we talk about the 737 rate again? How much of that is self-inflicted versus the FAA processes that are in place? And when we think about the 90-day time line that comes to a head with the IAM negotiations over the summertime, I would assume. So how do we think about the IAM progressing as well? And how much was incorporated into the $10 billion free cash flow target? David Calhoun : Okay, Sheila, that's like a 3-parter. Sheila  Kahyaoglu: Sorry about that. David Calhoun : Yes. I'll do my best. So I -- all of the 737 disruption that it goes on today, in my view, is self-inflicted in the sense that we've made the decision that the amount of traveled work, particularly as it relates to the fuselage that was embedded and normalized in our factory, that we would make a dramatic reduction in it. So that move we made with all the inspectors and all the rework operators down to Wichita, the visibility we've provided to the Wichita workforce with respect to the rework that we were doing, the FAA didn't demand that. We demanded it because it's -- we're determined to get ahead of it. What the FAA is doing, and they have been very diligent and business-like in the way they've approached this is they want a control plan. And they want a control plan in 90 days that, in essence, monitors and measures whether our production system is in control moving forward. And if it ever gets out of control, the signals are clear, both to the FAA and to us even more importantly. And if we don't, we won't extend. We won't rate up. We won't do anything until it is under control, and that has to stay that way. So 90 days isn't like a wave a magic flag and everything is great, and you guys can go from 38 to 40. It's quite different. It is simply a set of metrics and controls that we both agree are the right ones to monitor the performance of our factories. And I am confident it will be a good set of controls and something that we can live up to. And we're going to work our way through this one. As I said, the most important thing that occurs over the next 6 months or frankly, starting in January when we launched this effort is going to be the pace at which clean fuselages come out of Wichita. That is the most essential part of this equation. With respect to IAM, as you know, we worked through the summer. There's a lot of discussions going on between our team and their teams. It feels productive. While we're doing that, we have huge engagement with a relatively new workforce across our factories in light of what we've just experienced. That engagement helps. It doesn't hurt. I am -- I can't ever tell you I'm perfectly confident that we rush to an agreement. But we're all going to try to solve for continuous production. And I think we -- I think our chances are good. So -- but we're not going to know until we get really close to the deadline, and that's just real life and labor negotiation. I think that covers most of what you asked. Was there any other part I missed? Sheila  Kahyaoglu: The $10 billion free cash flow, does it incorporate the IAM negotiation? David Calhoun : Oh, yes. Yes, yes. Operator : And the next question is from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Noah Poponak : I guess this is sort of asked and you've alluded to pieces of the answer to this, but I'm just going to ask it anyway because it seems to be the most important thing, which is just how long does it take to do everything you need to do on product quality? And how much of it needs to be done before you can increase production again versus how much of it can be done as you're increasing production again? Because I've heard you now reference 6 months a few times, and you've referenced the back half of the year looking a lot different than the first half of the year. And 6 months isn't a short window of time. But in the context of what you're doing and referencing 30,000 ideas and if you're going to take Spirit in, that hasn't even happened yet, and it's almost May. When you were working with the FAA on 787 a few years ago, you didn't deliver one for 18 months. So I don't know what you can say to that, but how do we get confident that the time just doesn't keep ripping by, and you're not iterating back and forth and there isn't a much longer window of time needed to do everything you need to do to start to ramp again? David Calhoun : Yes. So Noah, I'll address this one. First of all, I'm glad you asked about the 6 months. When I say 6 months, I'm talking about the first half of this year because remember, we commenced all of these actions the day after the Alaska Air accident. Our determination -- the big factor here, in my view with respect to the essence of the question, is this move to eliminate traveled work in our factory and specifically and most importantly, the fuselage. So that action was commenced on March 1, inspection line in place, full inspections being performed in Wichita. Our rework teams with respect to nonconformances that were worked up in Seattle, those teams have been visiting regularly down to Wichita. And I fully expect, I fully expect for them to come up to rate with clean fuselages here as we get into the second half. That, again, is the big productivity driver in the Renton factory. And the cycle time improvements also double up as capacity improvements for pretty much for us and for them. So that is the big question. The 30,000 ideas, that is a long list of stuff that just provides for continuous improvement from this day until forever. So that's not something that all has to get processed and completed before we can sort of flip the switch and go. It's quite the opposite.  It is a set of continuous improvement concepts and ideas that we simply set out with our workforce and our leadership team over time. And that's recognized by our employees and by our leadership team. So that's how I think about this sequence. Noah Poponak : Okay. Have you guys thought about framing and disclosing some version of that time line of work maybe in big buckets or categories that you would provide to the investment community? Because it feels like everybody is guessing and has no visibility. And if you said, traveled work is one category, Wichita, I don't know what the categories would even be. But if there was 4 or 5 of them, and you could provide an update on which are complete and how complete the other ones are as you report just some version of milestones that investors could follow on your progress here? David Calhoun : I think that's fair. Noah, the most important one, the essential one and that we will have to report as we close the second quarter is going to be the number of clean fuselages that we're receiving from Wichita and the prognosis for that going forward. So that will be the most essential part of the equation I think you're trying to solve. I think all the other stuff, we'll categorize for you. That's not hard. We do it for the FAA. We do it for our own teams. But that is not going to be rate limiting. It's not -- none of that is going to factor into the rate limits.  What is going to factor in is this determination, it's to make sure traveled work doesn't come back to us and that Wichita is up to the rate increases. Operator : Our next question is from Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Kristine Liwag : Dave, Brian, you mentioned that the first half deliveries for the 737 will be under pressure as you focus on quality. But then again, stability of the supply chain is also a priority. So in the event that 737 MAX production and deliveries continue to be under pressure beyond the first half of this year, how long can you keep the supply chain at a higher rate?  What does it mean to keep them stable? And then also as a follow-on to that, if this were to play out, can you talk about the puts and takes of free cash flow generation in the second half of the year? David Calhoun : Yes. I'm sure Brian is going to answer this one, but let me start. We have a rate increase plan. And as everyone knows, it gets us up to 50 here as we get into that '25, '26 window. So our job now, given the slowdown here in these 6 months and then sort of the pushout of those rate increases is to make sure we have all the inventory we need to satisfy that 50 number and have the buffers where they need to be to make sure that the supply chain can demonstrate the capacity to meet those numbers. So this slowdown, in my view, is an opportunity for us to shore up whatever supply chain issues were out there sort of one supplier at a time and to get there. Now if we get to a moment because the slowdown has gone on too long, if we get to a moment where the buffers exceed that requirement, we will curtail but not until they exceed that requirement. Brian? Brian West : Only thing I would add is that tactically, we have adjusted the master schedule at a supplier-by-supplier basis. It's all out there. They know it. We will continue to pace final assembly in line with that master schedule so that we don't sacrifice stability because what we're talking about is a very important near-term investment that we have to stay laser-like focused on so that we don't take a step back.  And that's what we're focused on. And we believe that we can handle the cash flow fluctuations as we get through the first half into the second half and position ourselves for 2025. Operator : And our next question is from Scott Deuschle from Deutsche Bank. Scott Deuschle : Dave, could you further characterize what you're seeing with respect to supply chain performance on the 87? And where the constraints are that are driving you to drop back below 5 a month? And then I'm curious if there's been any change to the plan on the 777X ramp. David Calhoun : Yes. No change on the latter. But we really have two constraints to think about on the 87. One is discrete. It's well understood and known, and it's heat exchangers. This is a product that used to be built in Russia. When the invasion happened, it got moved, and the capacity of that supplier has not kept pace with us. But the improvement plan that we all see gets us where we need to be by the fourth quarter, and we have a lot of confidence in it. So again, discrete, well known, et cetera. The other one that is -- that affects us is not necessarily our suppliers. But as you may know, the seat suppliers out there are in shorter capacity. A lot of that is buyer furnished. But nevertheless, it holds up an airplane. And so that one is a little more medium term-ish. Capacity is being built out. I think people will get ahead of it, but that will be a little longer than the heat exchanger. And anyway, so that will affect us a bit. And when you have a buyer-furnished problem like that, you don't have a consequence attached to it, as you probably know. Scott Deuschle : Got it. And then, Brian, can you get an advance on the large P-8 contract that you won this quarter? Brian West : So we're going to not talk about that specifically in terms of that award. But I did want to come back to two things that you asked about. I want to make sure there's color out there. 777X, as we described, no changes. But I would like to indicate that we're starting to see the inventory implications of that ramp. And that's something that's big and important as we move through this year, and we're excited to be able to put that in service.  But that does create some working capital pressure that I don't want to be -- have lost on anyone. And as it pertains to the 87, very nice progress in terms of our inventory liquidation progressing well. Keep in mind, not all of that will get delivered. All that will get reworked and completed, but the deliveries are going to lag. And as far as production is concerned, we will be a couple lower than that 5 per month for most of the year as the supply chain catches up. And as Dave mentioned, we do have a recovery plan, and we are optimistic. And one bright spot is that, that second line has now been activated. So as soon as that supply chain is positioned, we'll be ready to go, but it will be lower as we move through this year. Operator : And the next question is from David Strauss from Barclays. David Strauss : Just wanted to clarify on your comments around the balance sheet and liquidity. Is equity -- considering equity issuance, is that still off the table as you think about the balance sheet and potentially funding Spirit? Brian West : Well, as we stand for what I described in terms of what we're looking at right now, working closely with the rating agencies, we believe we can do the move I described in the near term with market access without that. As it pertains to Spirit, we talked about that this is a deal where discussions are ongoing. It's complicated. There's other parties involved. And what this means is that once it does get signed, we expect it to, that it's going to take time to close. And in that time between signing and closing, we're going to explore the optimal financing for that transaction in order to maintain the investment-grade credit rating. And that's important. How exactly that looks? Don't know. We've got the time. And importantly, at the same time, we're going to have a factory that we expect to get more and more stable. So we're going to get to the optimal answer. We're going to protect the investment-grade credit rating. And how the pieces play out, stay tuned. David Strauss : Okay. And a quick follow-up there as it relates to Spirit. How engaged is Airbus in this process at this point and thinking about potentially taking back their own work? And does the deal need to wait until you get full clarity on what might happen with that Airbus business? Or do you think you can move forward without full clarity there? David Calhoun : No. We can move forward without full clarity. And as you probably know, we're not going to get involved in that, whatever is going on there. We encourage Spirit to do whatever they need to do to try to remedy or improve their business relative to our potential acquisition. So I don't have a lot of insight into that, but I encourage Spirit to try to resolve that kind of stuff as quickly as they can. But we are not -- we're not being held hostage to that. Operator : Our next question is from Peter Arment from Baird. Peter Arment : Dave, can you talk about your pending kind of leadership change? I mean you've been on the Board for many years. You've been CEO for 5 years during what's obviously been a very challenging environment with MAX, COVID, 787. But it kind of -- as we think about it in reality, Boeing is in kind of a position to have a multiyear improvement story. So what do you think is the right leader that's needed to execute kind of what is a very complex company? David Calhoun : Yes. I always -- I appreciate you're asking that, Peter. First of all, the process we have in place is a good one. Steve Mollenkopf in the Chair role, Bob Bradway in the governance role. The Board at large, they're going to look at the market every way they can. They know I have an internal candidate that I think the world of. They will balance sort of their perspective and get to the right conclusion with my full support. I do not expect that to happen in the next month or 2. So let's all be clear about that. Look, my prescription is pretty simple. You know as well as anybody, maybe better than anybody how long term this business is.  You also know that mistakes that matter are usually in the development of another airplane, not so much in the production issues that we face today or the supply chain issues that were created from COVID. These are in the context of aviation, short-term issues that have to get wrestled through slowly in a disciplined way. On the other hand, when you get big development programs wrong, you pay a price, and you pay it for a long time, and I know an awful lot about that. So my view is that next leader has to be prepared to make smart long-term decisions and get the development programs right. So that's the prescription that I've offered to the Board, that I offer to pretty much everybody. And again, I have an internal succession plan broadly that I like. And anyway, we'll see where things turn out. But either way, they have my full support. Operator : And that question will come from the line of Jason Gursky from Citigroup. Jason Gursky : Okay. Great. Recognizing that you've got 2 other segments, the last caller here, nobody has touched on BDS. David Calhoun : Go Jason. Thank you. Jason Gursky : So first on the services business. Look, the operating margins there have been quite healthy over the last year or so, and I think are operating well above kind of your targeted margin range for that medium-term targets out there in '25, '26. So the question is, can we sustain the margins that we've got that we're seeing today out into that period? And then over on BDS, the incremental charges seem like they're coming down quarter-on-quarter. But Brian, just kind of curious, are there some -- any significant milestones or risk retirements that you're -- that you could point to here over the next 12, 18 months that kind of give us a little bit of an idea of when those things completely go away and we begin to start seeing that financial model that you've talked about start to lock in for that '25, '26 time frame? David Calhoun : Let's split this, Brian. I'll do the services. You can handle the defense contracts. So services. The one thing that I don't think anybody's factored into margin for us in services, a big profit pool that we have is our distribution business. This was the acquisitions of Aviall, KLX over the years. This calendar year, we have a full integration of those 2 distribution companies in mind. I've reviewed this program. This will be another important productivity stepping stone for the business that, in my view, provides for a sustainable margin improvement and just a better, smarter, simpler way of doing business around the world. So that project is in full swing. We will likely do the change somewhere in the fourth or first quarter of next -- fourth quarter this year or the first quarter of next year. We'll let that team tell us when they want to pull the trigger. But that one is a pretty big one, and it's a pretty important one. It's one I've always wanted to get done. It will take those brands out of play. It will simply be a Boeing brand. And the integration in the warehouses broadly across our company, it's pretty significant. So you want to hit that? Brian West : Sure. On BDS, Jason, characterized in a couple of ways, we're retiring risk every day, particularly on a program like VC-25B, which will move our way through. And we will deliver 2 airplanes, and then that will be over as a program. The ones that are interesting to us in terms of the development side would be the T-7 and the MQ. T-7, we expect to get through the flight test program. Good progress with the customer. It's proceeding well. That's an important milestone as we exit this year. Similarly, on MQ-25, we will get to the build, we will get to the software integration, and we will be able to get through an important milestone with the customer as we exit this year. Importantly on the MQ-25, as I mentioned, we just signed with the customer 2 additional airplanes that are going to be cost type. That's important. Another move towards our intent to derisk. And then on the commercial crew, we've got a launch coming up. That will continue to derisk that program. And the tanker, the tanker continues to show good progress. It does get impacted somewhat by our determination to reduce traveled work. But long term, the tankers are performing in the field. We're getting a better handle on what that needs to look like over time, and we're confident that we're derisking it. So by and large, we still feel confident that we'll work our way through it. And that will result in a BDS margin level as we get into the '25, '26 time frame that we believe is going to be in the high single digits. Nothing has taken us off that, and we look forward to retiring these risks. Matt Welch : And that concludes our call today. Thank you, everybody, for joining. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

The management discussion and the slide presentation plus the analyst question-and-answer session are being broadcast live over the Internet. [Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Matt Welch, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Boeing Company. Mr. Welch, please go ahead. Matt Welch : Thank you, Lois, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Boeing's quarterly earnings call. I am Matt Welch, and with me today are Dave Calhoun, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian West, Boeing's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation at boeing.com. Projections, estimates and goals included in today's discussion involves risks, including those described in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the beginning of the presentation. We also refer you to the additional disclaimers related to the Spirit AeroSystems transaction at the beginning of the presentation as well the disclosures relating to non-GAAP measures in our earnings release and presentation. Now, I will turn the call over to Dave Calhoun. Dave Calhoun : Thanks, Matt. Good morning to all, and thanks for joining us. First, you saw the news that the company has announced the appointment of Kelly Ortberg as my successor commencing August 8 of this calendar year. As you know, the Board conducted an extensive search process. It was led by Steve Mollenkopf. I am incredibly grateful to the way in which he conducted it, the extent to which he conducted it. And I'm extremely confident in their selection of Kelly as the next leader for Boeing. He's had more than 35 years of experience in aerospace and is tremendously respected in the industry. I look forward to working with him to ensure a smooth transition. I want to focus my upfront comments on the progress that we are making on our recovery as we strengthen our quality management systems and position the company in best possible way as we move forward. Brian will cover the financials following my remarks. As a company, we've been on a multiyear path to strengthen our safety and quality management systems. We've stressed our commitment to transparency every step of the way. The January accident obviously sharpened this focus, leading us to take multiple additional steps to improve the stability of our operations, including major elements of our supply chain. First, among our actions was to slow things down and control travel work, allowing our supply chain to catch up and provide the buffer we need to improve quality and stabilize deliveries going forward. Our second quarter financial results reflect the reality of that continuing recovery post the Alaska accident. We're committed to doing all of the work necessary to ensure Boeing is the company the world needed to be, safe and predictable. Over the last seven months, we have made meaningful progress toward that goal. At the end of May, we provided our comprehensive safety and quality plan to the FAA, which continues to provide strong oversight of the delivery process. The planned notes are key performance indicators, by which we and our regulators will monitor the health and the quality of our production system. These measures include employee proficiency, notice of escapes, supplier shortages, rework hours, travelers at factory rollout and ticketing performance. All of these key performance indicators, KPIs, are established and operationalized across our BCA employee programs and they provide real-time insight to support stability, quality and safety. We are seeing improved performance across the majority of the metrics and remain confident in our ability to meet these KPIs as we expand production. An important element of this plan is the control limits we've established by which the FAA and more importantly, our own team hold ourselves accountable. Furthermore, our plan doubles down on four key investments; workforce training, simplification of manufacturing plan and processes, eliminating defects and elevating our safety and quality culture. We continue to seek feedback from our employees, from our customers, our regulators, policymakers, shareholders and many others as we move forward. One of the most important actions we took was the transfer of our rent in fuselage inspection process to Wichita. On-site Boeing inspectors at Spirit increased by almost three times, the number that we had before January. And defects we initially caught and reworked in Renton are now caught and reworked in Wichita. While this dramatically reduced the number of clean fuselages coming from Spirit in the first few months, we have seen steady improvement ever since. The improvements in quality have significantly improved our rent and flow times over that same period. While our focus remains on our factories to ensure we can meet our customer commitments, we are also making important progress on our development programs, including the 737-7, the -10 and our 777X. Most notably, this month, we received type inspection authorization, TIA, for the 777-9 and began cert flight testing with FAA personnel on board the aircraft. Our team has put the 777-9 test fleet through more than 1,200 flights, 3,500 flight hours across a wide range of regions and climate condition. And the certification of flight testing will continue validating the airplane safety, reliability and performance. In addition, we've identified an engineering solution for the engine anti-ICE system for in-production aircraft that will be implemented and certified in 2025 to support the first delivery of our -7 and -10 in MAX family. A comment on Boeing Defense, Space & Security performance. Clearly, the results this quarter are disappointing. Brian and I have mentioned before that we expected the fixed price development programs to remain bumpy until we complete the development phase and transition to mature long-term franchise programs. Based on the lessons that we've learned in taking on these fixed-price development programs, we have maintained contracting discipline for all future opportunities. We remain cautiously optimistic about the long-term prospects of our defense business, and we believe we can progress toward a more historical level of performance over time. Finally, Global Services remains a bright spot and continues to deliver solid results. We have a strong franchise and the team remains dedicated to supporting our commercial and defense customers. Before turning it over to Brian, let me touch on the recently announced agreement to acquire Spirit AeroSystems. This is an important shift in strategic direction, and it would course correct as -- made decades ago. This planned acquisition is a very significant demonstration of our resolve to invest heavily in quality and safety and to take the additional actions needed to reshape our company. As we have said, we believe this proposed deal is in in the best interest of the flying public, the best interest of our airline customers and the employees of Spirit and Boeing and the country more broadly. By bringing in critical manufacturing work back within our four walls, we can unify our safety and quality management systems and ensure our engineers mechanics are working together as one team day-in and day-out. I'll close with a comment to our employees. Thank you for all that you do every single day. You care deeply about our mission, about our company and about each other. Your passion, your resilience and commitment are inspiring. This is a challenging period of time for all of us. There is no doubt, but I am confident, maybe more confident than I've ever been in our future because of you. And thank you, and Brian, I'll turn it over to you. Brian West : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Before jumping into the financial results, let me take a moment on our planned acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems. On July 1, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Spirit in an all-stock transaction worth approximately $4.7 billion with a total enterprise value of approximately $8.3 billion. As our materials indicated, we expect the transaction to close mid-2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory and Spirit shareholder approvals as well as the sale of Spirit operations related to certain Airbus commercial work packages. This agreement contemplates us acquiring substantially all Boeing related commercial operations primarily consisting of the Wichita, Kansas, Tulsa, Oklahoma and Dallas, Texas facilities as well as other commercial, defense and aftermarket operations that would further augment our capabilities and offerings across the portfolio. Regarding the defense programs, we're committed to working with Spirit, its customers and the DoD to ensure continuity in order to support these critical missions. We continue to believe that this reintegration leverages and builds on our capabilities, support supply chain stability, integrates critical manufacturing and engineering workforces that allows for the ultimate unification of safety and quality management systems. Fully aligning to the same priorities, incentives and -- centered on safety and quality is in the best interest of our customers, the aviation industry and all stakeholders, including the flying public. All of this demonstrates our ongoing commitment to aviation safety, quality and stability. Turning to the next page, I'll cover the total company financial performance for the quarter. Revenue was $16.9 billion, primarily reflecting lower commercial delivery volume. The quarter loss per share was $2.90, reflecting lower commercial delivery volume and losses of $1 billion on fixed price defense development programs, which I'll get into later. Free cash flow was a usage of $4.3 billion in the quarter, which was generally in line with the expectations shared in May. Results impacted by lower commercial deliveries and unfavorable working capital timing. Turning to the next page, I'll cover Boeing Commercial Airplanes. BCA delivered 92 airplanes in the quarter. Revenue was $6 billion, and operating margin was minus -- 11.9%, primarily reflecting lower deliveries and expected higher period costs, including R&D. The backlog in the quarter ended at $437 billion and includes more than 5,400 airplanes. Last week's Farnborough Airshow continue to highlight the robust demand for our product lineup as we announced orders and commitments for over 150 airplanes, including nearly 100 widebodies. Now I'll give more color on the key programs. The 737 program delivered 70 airplanes in the second quarter, including a meaningful step up to 35 in June. July will be more or less in line with June levels despite normal seasonality. On production, we gradually increased during the quarter and still expect to be higher in the second half, as we move to 38 per month by year-end. We've reactivated the third line in our rented factory and monthly production improvement from high single digits at the end of the first quarter to roughly 25 in June and July. As Dave noted, the factory is currently operating within or near the KPI control limits laid out with the FAA as part of the safety and quality plan. The factory is operating with all fully inspected fuselages today and near-term production will continue to be paced by fuselages from Wichita. More broadly on the master schedule, we continue to make adjustments as needed and manage supplier by supplier based on inventory levels. Our objective remains to keep the supply chain paced ahead of final assembly to support stability and minimize traveled work. The quarter ended with approximately 90 737-8s built prior to 2023, the vast majority for customers in China and India. This is down 20 from last quarter's value, and we expect approximately 10 more delivered in the month of July. We still expect to deliver most of these airplanes by year-end as we work towards shutting down the shadow factory. Regarding the -7 and the -10 models, inventory levels remained stable at approximately 35 airplanes and the certification timelines remain unchanged. On the 787, we delivered nine airplanes in the quarter, although the quarter was impacted by lower production, seat delays and other delivery timing items noted previously. We're starting to work through these issues and delivered six airplanes in July. The program produced below five per month in the quarter as expected and still plans to return to five per month by year-end. We ended the quarter with around 35 airplanes of inventory built prior to 2023 that required rework, which continues to progress steadily. We still expect to finish the rework and shut down the shadow factory by year-end with most of these airplanes delivering this year. Finally, on the 777X program, as Dave noted, we took a very important step on the certification timeline earlier this month as the program obtained type inspection authorization and began FAA certification flight testing. We'll continue to follow the lead of the FAA as we progress through the certification process and still expect first delivery in 2025. Inventory in the quarter grew approximately $800 million in line with recent quarterly trends and will continue to grow as we move towards entry into service as we've previously contemplated. Moving on to the next page, Boeing Defense & Space. BDS booked $4 billion in orders during quarter, including capturing an award from the US Air Force for seven MH-139 helicopters and the backlog ended at $59 billion. Revenue was $6 billion, down 2%, driven by fixed price development losses and BDS delivered 28 aircraft in the quarter, including the first CH-47F Block 2 Chinook to the US Army. We took a $1 billion loss on certain fixed-price development contracts in the quarter and operating margin was minus 15.2%. In late May, we indicated that margins would take a step back and be negative due to a couple of things. First, the deliberate slowdown of the Puget Sound factories has impacted the derivative programs, specifically, a $391 million loss on the KC-46A Tanker, as well as margin compression on the profitable P8 program. Second, we've seen additional fixed price development cost pressures, resulting in additional losses on T-7A, VC-25B and commercial crew, primarily related to higher estimated engineering and manufacturing costs and inefficiencies associated with meeting certain technical requirements. Given the fixed price nature of these contracts, we continue to be transparent about impacts as we work to stabilize and mature these programs. While acknowledging these are disappointing results, there's a complicated development programs, and we continue to put milestones behind us and remain focused on retiring risk each quarter and ultimately delivering these mission-critical commitments to our customers. Stepping back, the game plan to get BDS back to high single-digit margins in the medium to long term remains unchanged. The core business remains solid, representing approximately 60% of our revenue and performing in the mid to high single-digit margin range. The demand for these products continue to be very strong, supported by the geopolitical threat environment confronting our nation and our allies. And the 25% of the portfolio primarily comprised of fighter and satellite programs, the quarter again saw improved margin trends as we continue to make important progress including delivering our eight F-15EX aircraft to the US Air Force, which enabled the program to achieve its initial operating capability milestone in July. We still expect to return strong historical performance level as we roll to new contracts with tighter underwriting standards. Overall, the defense portfolio is well positioned for the long term. There's strong demand across the customer base, the products are performing well in the field, and we're confident that our efforts to drive execution and stability will return this business performance levels that our investors will recognize. Moving on to the next page, Boeing Global Services. BGS continued to perform well in the second quarter, delivering very strong results across a globally deployed team that is focused on supporting its customers on both the defense and commercial sides. They received $4 billion in orders and the backlog ended at $19 billion. Revenue was $4.9 billion, up 3%, primarily on higher commercial volume. Operating margin was 17.8%, down slightly compared to last year, but still strong performance. In the quarter, BGS secured an Apache performance-based logistics contract from the US Army and captured FliteDeck Pro service contracts with Hainan Airlines and Ryanair. Importantly, BGS continued to deliver very strong operating margins for the first half of the year, matching the record levels from 2023. It's a terrific franchise that's set up for years to come. The team is focused on profitable, capital-efficient high IP offerings, and we still expect it to grow at solid mid-single-digit revenue levels and throw off mid-teen margins with very high free cash flow conversion. Turning to the next page, I'll cover cash and cash and debt. On cash and marketable securities, we ended the quarter at $12.6 billion, reflecting the $10 billion issuance of new debt in May, partially offset by the use of free cash flow in the quarter. The debt balance increased to $57.9 billion driven by the new debt issuance. We continue to maintain access to $10 billion of revolving credit facilities, all of which remain undrawn. The deliberate actions we're taking demonstrate our commitment to improve safety and quality, and we continue to manage the business with a long-term view. We acknowledge the impact these actions are having on calendar year cash flows. So let me provide some additional context on near-term expectations. While commercial production and deliveries are improving, additional losses in BDS and working capital timing continue to weigh on near-term cash flow. Inventory will remain a near-term headwind as we prioritize supply chain stability to support future rate increases and advanced payments will take time to improve as we stabilize production and improve profitability of deliveries to our customers. Given these near-term working capital pressures, third quarter is expected to be another use of cash. We expect these working capital timing impacts will be -- unwind as deliveries and production stabilize later this year. On the free cash flow outlook for the year, we are now expecting a larger use of cash than previously forecasted. As you know, operating leverage in our business is meaningful. And as we ramp up deliveries, free cash flow will grow. We are deliberately investing today and taking the time necessary to get it right to ensure we're positioned to ramp -- in a more predictable and stable fashion. We remain committed to managing the balance sheet in a prudent manner with two main objectives : First, prioritize the investment grade rating; and second, allow the factory and supply chain to reset, both of which were supported by our decision to acquire Spirit with all stock financing. We'll continue to actively monitor our liquidity levels and as needed, we'll supplement our liquidity position with these two objectives in mind. We're confident that over time, the business performance and capital structure will return to levels fully aligned with an investment-grade profile. Looking forward, we're taking the time now to ensure that our BCA factories are positioned to ramp production in a stable fashion for years to come. We'll also continue make progress on other important objectives, including shutting down the shadow factories, maturing and derisking the defense fixed-price development programs and building on the continued strong results and services. Entering 2025 will be in a much stronger position because of the work we're doing now. As noted in the commercial market outlook published this month, we continue to see robust demand and the fundamentals are there for the next 20 years, where we expect the global fleet to almost double as nearly 44,000 new airplanes are delivered with about half of those full replacement demand. The commercial and defense markets we serve, along with our product portfolio underpin our confidence as we manage the business today with a long-term view built on safety, quality and delivering for our customers. With that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Doug Harned : Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to understand a little bit about the -- so the process, the production process on the 787 and the 737 because you're saying this inventory build, and it appears both from suppliers supplying it 38 a month for the MAX and five to six a month for the 787. On that end, I expect you're having inventory build. And then on the other end, difficulty with seats, so you would have things coming off the line and some of the inventory to China as well. It's difficult to get out of there. Can you talk about how you think of managing this inventory on both ends, given the production process or ramp that you're on right now? Brian West : Yes. Thanks, Doug. So the question, the inventory build is right in front of us as we make this investment for stability. The way I would think about going forward, we were on the 737 to start with. Our delivery rates in April, May were in the mid-teens. June, we did 35. July, we'll do somewhere in that ZIP code. So we are seeing demonstrated progress as we continue to move forward and rent in to stabilize and get better. So the progress evidence is there, and we expect that to continue as we move through the second half and, of course, then the inventory will begin to unwind. But it's really predicated on the continued progress. And as I mentioned, that third line in Renton is a very big deal for us to get moving as well resuming deliveries to China. So all those indications suggest that production is moving in the right direction, we're making progress and the inventory will unwind. On the 87, similarly, as I mentioned, second quarter, we had nine deliveries. In July, we've already got about six. So again, good progress, despite having some real supply chain constraints, as you mentioned. Those constraints aren't going to go away immediately, but they're going to get better. We've got a game plan in place. And we do believe that we'll get to that five per month as we get to the end of the year. And again, that inventory will liquidate as production performance improves. Doug Harned : If I can just follow up on that. The -- you all have talked about the bottleneck -- chief bottleneck, I believe, being the fuselage deliveries from Spirit. So as you bring that third line on, how does this work? It didn't seem like it was final assembly that was the bottleneck before. So how does that help you with Spirit at a point now where -- is your capacity that is limiting factor? Brian West : So Spirit has done a very nice job. We watch it very closely, but Dave had a nice steady improvement. They're ramping their way up. We've got confidence, Pat and the team. And we believe that we will be able to fill that third line, and we believe that that we'll be able to get to 38 per month as we get to the back half of the year. Dave Calhoun : The only thing I would add, Doug, is the third line, it also helps us with unforeseen issues, because it gives us flexibility across three lines as opposed to having to close two if we end up the nonconformance somewhere. So we are simply trying to over-capacitize accommodate things that appear and steady our production. Doug Harned : Okay. Very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead. Peter Arment : Yes, good morning Dave and Brian. Dave, thanks for calling out some of the KPIs that you were talking about. Obviously, they're all super important. You said you're getting some real-time insights on some of these metrics. Maybe is there any color you can give us on what you're seeing so far on the progress, whether it's the notice of escapes or shortages, or you about employee proficiency? Just trying to get at ultimately what the metrics that -- is there anything that's a long pole in the tent that is holding back for rate increases and just the confidence around getting to that rate 38? Thanks. Dave Calhoun : Peter, thanks. Every metric gets better when you slow things down. So yes, I don't want to kid anybody. The step we took to slow things down, it was very deliberate, very straightforward and every metric benefits from that moment. So we've had a step change improvement, traveled work, of course, being the big one. And the way to measure traveled work in my view, I think the view of our production team is when we get a clean fuselage and we move it through less than half the float time it would have taken in its prior state that reduces everything. And the reason is you don't have traveled work, you don't have defects moving down the line, you don't have any of that stuff. So we've been a beneficiary of a step change on that front, and we're now at the stage where we're only getting clean fuselages where, as you know, in the first two quarters, we were managing a mix of the prior regime and what we're getting now. So anyway, that's the big proxy for the way things are going to move forward and are moving forward. You\u2019ll know when we get out of kilt on any one of those metrics. I don't think any of them are going to stop us from the plans that we've announced and our expectations as we approach year-end. Probably the one we'll all just keep our eye on is the traveled work scenario where we cannot allow ourselves to get back into a scenario where we're traveling things too far down the line. And we got a lot of controls in place. So that won't happen. Peter Arment : Appreciate it. Thanks Dave. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you guys, and good morning Dave and Brian. Brian, this one's for you. Maybe if we could just think about what's the buffer on free cash flow and the cash balance? How do we think about tapping that RC if cash falls below $10 billion, which is what you're suggesting in Q3? And do you think about Q4 as cash usage or generation? And what's the cadence of inventories and advances maybe over the next two to four quarters, if you can? Brian West : Yeah, sure. Thanks, Sheila, for the question. So the working capital drag has been pretty meaningful in the first and second quarter, and it's the inventory as well as the advances as deliveries have been lower. Now the third quarter is going to be a similar working capital drag as it was in the first and second quarter. Inventory will still be a headwind, albeit a smaller one. And the advanced timing will be an additional headwind, which, again, that will gradually improve over time with deliveries. And we're seeing that customers are applying excess advances and lowering advanced payments as they want to see delivery performance improve. So, we've just got to deal with that timing because once the factory moves and we start delivering, all of that will unwind on both the advances and the inventory. But it is going to take us time to do that. Now, in the third quarter, deliveries will be better, but we still have these working capital headwinds. In the fourth quarter, we're going to have stronger deliveries. We're going to have real working capital improvement. And I'd also mentioned that we're going to have tanker 11 that we expect. So, the -- these cash flows can move fairly meaningful quarter-to-quarter and it's all predicated on our ability to deliver and get the factory stable and getting it improved. So that's the way we're thinking about the back half on cash. Sheila Kahyaoglu : What's the cash balance you feel comfortable with? Brian West : So, we've always said 10, but at any given moment, if that kind of moves a little bit given what's in front of us, we can be comfortable. I think there's a broader question around we're constantly looking at liquidity. You saw that with what we did in May. You saw that in how we treated the Spirit transaction. So, right now, we're comfortable with where we're at and how we get to the end of the year. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from of Myles Walton from with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning. Maybe to follow up briefly on that. Brian, can you comment on the abnormality of those advanced payments? You mentioned some are applying previous prepayments to the current profile and some are basically deferring their payments until they see better performance. Can you categorize where you are on advances? Have you over-collected in the past and therefore, we're in a divot? Or are you under-collecting now an actual beneficial recovery, if you will, at some point in the near-term? Brian West : So, both, to answer your question. We do have the excesses that people are applying as well as people are withholding the PDPs until they get that delivery structure -- delivery schedule more stable. So, it's both. I mean, what you saw in the quarter that we had a pullback of about $1 billion on the advance balance. Those two things are both happening in that balance, and we expect that in the second half to continue. But when we start to deliver with predictability, all that will begin to unwind. So, this really is timing. And it's timing over quarters is our best guess, and it's all, again, predicated on our ability to get deliveries in a different position. Dave Calhoun : And the overarching opportunity for us is still the shortage of airplanes and the demand scenario. So, this isn't a soft spot in the market where people are trying to sort of get something, create a fundamental change. This is short-term management, which we all understand and we're trying to accommodate. But the demand is still so strong for airplanes that, that provides the incentive for everybody to want to get us money so they can get their plane. Myles Walton : And on advances on 777X to offset that $800 million quarter inventory growth, is that a material offset to the $800 million? Or is it $800 million more or less the net 777X performance that we're seeing? Brian West : The $800 million is really the inventory specifically. The advance was not meaningful at this moment. It's the inventory that is the real one that we're dealing with, which, again, is the investment in the entry into service. Myles Walton : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss : Morning. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I know it's difficult to put a fine point on the cash burn. But I guess for the full year, are you looking at a number closer to a $5 billion order burn or a $10 billion order burn? That's the first question. And then, you've obviously said you're prioritizing your investment grade rating. To the extent that you need more funding, do expect the rating agency to allow you to issue debt again in key 5G? Or are you potentially thinking about having you to do an equity offering? Thank you. Brian West : Yes, David, I'm just not smart enough right at this moment to say whether it's 5 or 10. As you know, as we ramp deliveries, it's pretty meaningful movement in our cash balance. So I'm going to steer away from trying to get more specific. It will be a usage and we're working our way through it. And as we work through the timing elements, we know as we move forward, that's going to go in the right direction. In terms of the question around rating agencies, we are in regular conversations with all three rating agencies. They like us, are all focused on the operating performance of the company, our ability to generate free cash flow and the absolute debt reduction. And we tell them what we consistently said to everyone, the investment grade is the number one priority. And as we regularly monitor our liquidity, if we were able to bump up against maturities or do what it takes to protect that rating, period. And we've been consistent since April 2020 on that front and evidenced by the Spirit financing decision. So, we stay ready, we stay agile. That rating is the priority. David Strauss : Thanks very much. Operator : The next question is from Jason Gursky with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Jason Gursky : Good morning everyone. I just want to go back to the 777 for a minute. And Brian maybe ask you to talk a little bit about the expected future burn on that program from a cash flow perspective in the quarters leading up to certification and initial delivery. And then -- and I know a lot of that's being driven by inventory, of course. So maybe as well, talk about what the inventory burn looks like on back side of that and kind of what you are expecting at this point from production and we get out in that '25, '26 time frame and kind of what you're thinking on deliveries out in that '26 time frame, given the backlog, assuming that you get the certification done there in 2025 and first deliveries get started? Thanks. Brian West : Well, the good news on the last part of the question is the backlog is pretty robust and we just had some terrific performance of the air show on the wide-body front. I would say, in general, 777X cash is going to look similar all of the other development programs. We used cash prior to the entry in service. You've seen that. I talked about the $800 million this quarter. That's been consistent. And that is all driven by the natural inventory build as we prepare for that entry and service. Now, we also know that it will turn positive about a year after EIS as deliveries begin to ramp. And that will play out in a very normal way that most development programs play out. And yes, it's going to be underwritten by that robust backlog that we have a high confidence in and the customers love the airplane. So, we feel pretty good, and these are just investments and timing. And over the long term, it's going to be a great payoff. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Kristine Liwag : Hey, Dave, Brain, on the IAM labor negotiations, can you provide an update on where you are? How far apart are you in the union economics? And what operating contingencies are in place in case the union were to go on strike? Thank you. Dave Calhoun : Well, we're definitely not planning on a strike for starters. I can't really -- it's too early to call out a gap analysis with respect to the puts and takes, because we're too early in the process. And I like the framework. I like investments that we want to make with respect to training and development of people. We know that ASKs will be big. We know wage ASKs will be big. We're not afraid to treat our employees well in this process. So we're just going to work as hard as we can, not to have a strike. And anyway, I -- this will be in Kelly and Stephanie's backyard by the time we get to that negotiation. But as you know, as well I do until the last week is in play, don't know much. So I'll just leave it at that and try not to predict. Other than to tell you, we have an expressed intent to not have strike. Kristine Liwag : Great. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. The next question is from Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr : Yes. Thanks our much. So production in July looked like it remained pretty depressed. In August, you basically have vacations. So how should we think about the recovery in terms of production and deliveries, because it looks like August isn't that great? And so the related a number of your suppliers who are going at higher rates than you are producing are talking about -- they're keeping on inventory there because you don't pull it yet and they're asking you for advances. So what are you having to do with your suppliers in terms of giving them a lifeline of some advances, so that they can continue to produce won't have to cut back and then ramp up later? So yes, so what -- maybe talk about those two issues. Brian West : So in terms of your question around the 737 rate ramps, keep in mind, beginning part of this year, we were very, very low production, like single digit. And now we're getting to the point in June, July where we're kind of mid-20s. And August will likely be an improvement ahead of that. But then we're going to have a nice steady ramp through the back half of the year, again, predicated on a successful Line 3 being brought to bear and also the China resumption. So everything we see, we've got the labor, we've got the inventory, we've got the fuselages, it's all lined up for us to continue to improve our delivery ramp. And that's on us to go execute it. So we feel good about the progress we've made, and we've got proof points that says, a real ability to hit our 38 per month as we exit the year. In terms of the discussion of the supply chain, they're all unique. It's one-by-one. We're very careful to make sure that the way we're trying to protect stability in our own factory, we're trying to protect stability across the supply chain. And we do make certain moves here and there. Probably Spirit is the best example. And we have to do that that so when we move through the course of this year and going forward, we do it in a very stable, predictable way with the supply chain that's right there with us. Nothing that we see gives us any pause or concern. We've got all the assets and resources. We just have to start working our way through and delivering these airplanes for our customers. Cai von Rumohr : But -- so collectively, if you add all of your advances to suppliers, have those peaked? Or are they continuing to move up? Brian West : There's not really a material change, Cai. Here and there, there might be some differences, but nothing material and that's not contemplated in our forward look. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question is from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman : Hi. Thanks very much. Good morning. Wanted to ask on Spirit, which you mentioned on the last question. When you think about their ability to fund themselves through the close of this transaction in mid-2025, is that -- are you contemplating having to -- any additional action to fund Spirit through close? And then secondly, when you think about the investment plan for Boeing into Spirit when Spirit is part of Boeing, what can you tell us qualitatively or quantitatively to characterize that investment plan to prepare Spirit for the rate ramp ahead? Brian West : So I'd be careful not to speak for Spirit too much. On the other hand, they're performing well. We expect them to continue to perform well, and we've got confidence that we're going to get clean fuselages that helps coincide with our delivery schedule. So we feel pretty good about where they sit and their continued performance. So nothing there gives us any concern at the moment. And in terms of investing, we look forward to closing this acquisition. We look forward towards bringing them into the Boeing world. And we will not be shy or bashful with any investments that are needed in order for long-term stability. We feel really good about what is in front of us on that front, and we can't wait to close. Seth Seifman : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question is from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Noah Poponak : Hey, good morning, everyone. Can you talk a little bit more about the leadership decisions that you've made? I know Kelly has had a lot of experience in the industry, but kind of out of an operating role for a bit. What's the potential -- hit the reset button on a lot of the transitions you're in middle of right now versus ability to hit the ground running? And how should we think about Pat, Stephanie, other roles as you move forward here? Dave Calhoun : Well, I'll take a crack, and I'm not going to divulge anything that I'm not perfectly aware of. The Board made this decision. Over the last nine months, when I think about the number of people they've called around the industry, the supply side, the buy side, side, the regulatory pretty remarkable, thorough discussions. And at the end of the day, a couple of names surfaced and they landed on Kelly and I could not be happier with the call because I know Kelly. Kelly. I've been around He's a seasoned operator he's got experience. He knows what we do for a living and he'll bring that experience immediately to bear. So I wasn't really in the decision-making process, so I don't want to kid you about that. On the other hand, where it ended up is, in my view, a very, very strong place. And then with respect to Kelly, Kelly was quite informed about everything going on at Boeing, leadership team, et cetera. And anyway, I don't think he's coming in with a notion he want to change a lot of folks. And my guess is he's going to put his arms around Stephanie and the rest of the team in a big way and just try to support their work. He knows full well that we're in a recovery mode. And he knows full well we got to complete the recovery mode, and we got to get this stable and move forward. So that's me talking. And anyway, I don't think Brian can add much to this. But don't think this is intended to be a large leadership overhaul. Noah Poponak : Okay. Brian, just a quick one. Do you have a number whether billions of dollars or number of airplanes how much inventory you hold that specifically from having the supply chain stay ahead of you? Brian West : It's not a number that we disclose. It's not immaterial. The good news is, is that you see it right there in the cash flow statement total. That's a big driver, and the good news is that this is timing. This will unwind as we deliver airplanes for our customers, which we look forward to being able to do more predictably. Noah Poponak : Okay. Thank you. Matt Welch : Lois, we have time for one final question. Operator : Thank you. And that will come from Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Ken Herbert : Hey, good morning, Dave and Brian. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just wondered, Dave, maybe if you can provide a little bit more color on certification timing on the -7 and -10. I know it's now 2025 you're confident in the deicing certification, but can you give any more granularity on how we think about that timing and some of the next milestones for those two particular variants on MAX? Dave Calhoun : Well, really, the milestone is to complete the engineering work and make sure that it passes the certification tests, et cetera. And it literally is that one discrete item that is choke point. But high level of confidence that we're going to complete that and probably complete the engineering well before the end of the year. Then we've got to get through the test certification work and then we're off. I don't think there are any other sort of issues that we have to contend with other than to get that done and prove it out. Ken Herbert : So first half 2025 sounds realistic? Dave Calhoun : Sounds realistic to me. But they're in charge. Matt Welch : All right. Lois, everybody, that concludes our call. Thank you for joining. Operator : Thank you. That concludes the call. Thank you for joining the Boeing Company second quarter 2024 earnings conference call.",

The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analyst question-and-answer session are being broadcast live over the Internet. [Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I am turning the call over to Mr. Matt Welch, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Boeing Company. Mr. Welch, please go ahead. Matt Welch : Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's quarterly earnings call. I am Matt Welch, and with me today are Kelly Ortberg, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian West, Boeing's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And as a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation at boeing.com. Projections, estimates and goals included in today's discussion involve risks, including those described in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the beginning of the presentation. We also refer you to the disclosures relating to non-GAAP measures in our earnings release and presentation. Now I will turn the call over to Kelly Ortberg. Kelly Ortberg : Thanks, Matt, and thanks to everyone for joining today's call. Let me start by saying that it's an honor to be leading the Boeing Company. I've spent my entire career in the aerospace and defense business and one constant has always been the critical role that Boeing plays, not just to the A&D industry, but to our national security and the overall global economy. But we're clearly at a crossroads. The trust in our company has eroded or saddled with too much debt. We've had serious lapses in our performance across the company, which have disappointed many of our customers. But by the same token, we have great opportunities ahead. Our company backlog is roughly $0.5 trillion. We have a customer base that wants us and needs us to succeed. We have employees who are thirsty to get back to the iconic company they know, setting the standard for the products that we deliver. So my mission here is pretty straightforward, turn this big ship in the right direction and restore Boeing to the leadership position that we all know and want. Now to do this is going to require changes in four particular areas. And let me introduce them, and I'll come back and discuss each one. First, we need a fundamental culture change in the company; second, we must stabilize the business; third, we need to improve our execution discipline on new platform commitments across the company; and fourth, while doing the first three, we must build a new future for Boeing. So let me start with arguably the most important, changing the culture at Boeing. I spent the last two decades working with Boeing in the supply chain. So I have an outside-in view of Boeing, which is very helpful. That experience, combined now with seeing things from the inside the company, has helped provide an informed view of some of the actions we need to take. Much has been written about how we got to where we are, but most also recognize that Boeing was once a benchmark for what good culture looks like. And I believe we can return to that legacy. I know culture change starts at the top. Our leaders from me on down need to be closely integrated with our business and the people who are doing the design and production of our products. We need to be on the factory floors, in the back shops and in our engineering labs. We need to know what's going on, not only with our products, but with our people. And most importantly, we need to prevent the festering of issues and work better together to identify, fix and understand root cause. I've already introduced a much more detailed business cadence to drive this across the organization, and this process of change is underway. Culture's driven by values and we'll redefine those for the company together. This has to be more than the poster on the wall. These values will be used to hold leaders accountable in how they lead our teams and delivering safe, high-quality products and services to our customers. I recently had a meeting with our top executives in the company, and we talk specifically about this culture change. I see this more as a continuous process improvement rather than a milestone. We will be relentless in changing the Boeing culture through action, not just words on a page. Now let me shift to the second item, which is stabilizing the business. This has been central to my focus since starting the job in August. We have some really big rocks that we need to get behind us to move the company forward. The first and foremost on everybody's mind today is ending the IAM strike. We've been feverishly working to find a solution that works for the company and meets our employees' needs. I've met with the union leadership the first week on the job and let them know that I was committed to resetting the relationship. And I remain committed to getting the team back and improving our relationships, so we don't become so disconnected in the future. I'm very hopeful that the package we put forward will allow our employees to come back to work so we can immediately focus on restoring the company. Once we get back, we have the task of restarting the factories and the supply chain, and it's much harder to turn this on than it is to turn it off. So it's critical -- absolutely critical that we do this right. Our safety and quality management system will guide us through the restart, and we have a detailed return to work plan in place, and I'm really looking forward to getting everybody back and getting to work on that plan. One additional area of focus that is critical to our stability is the implementation of the safety and quality plan. As you know, this is a plan that we have reviewed with the FAA and will be part of the criteria we use to measure stability of our production system, which is necessary to gain authority to increase 737 rates. I'm encouraged with the progress we're making already, and we need to continue that momentum. Another big rock to stabilize the company is managing our balance sheet to best support retaining our investment-grade credit rating. We have a plan, and we're executing that plan. And I'm confident that we have a good path forward to manage the realities of our business and retain our investment-grade rating. So I've talked about culture and stability. Third area is improving the execution discipline on our new platforms, whether this be the commercial derivatives of the 737 MAX and 777 or the series of programs in our BDS business. We have to be better at understanding and managing the risk on these projects more proactively. This includes disciplined program and risk management in all phases of the project, including the bid phase. Again, this is an area where we need the management team much more focused on their programs and much more active working with their customers on ensuring success and anticipating risks before they happen. Supply chain management improvements will be critical to this effort. Clearly, we have some difficult contracts in our defense business, but we have to do a better job of executing on the things that we can control. So lastly, the fourth area to discuss is building a new future for Boeing. While we're somewhat consumed with the challenges of today, we need to be setting the foundation of the future for Boeing. Boeing's an airplane company. And at the right time in the future, we need to develop a new airplane but we have a lot of work to do before them. This includes stabilizing our business, improving the execution on the development programs, streamlining the portfolio to do what we do well and restoring the balance sheet so that we do have a path to the next commercial aircraft. We need to reset priorities and create a leaner, more focused organization. We've recently announced a workforce reduction, which will focus on consolidation of areas where we're not efficient, and we need to continue to focus on reducing nonessential activity. So before I hand it over to Brian, let me summarize by saying that we have a lot of work to do. We have a plan and changes already underway. This is a big shift that will take some time to turn, but when it does, it has the capacity to be great again. This is a company that ushered in the new era of air travel and helped plan the first man on the moon. Getting back to the values that help define this legacy is what will define our future. I'm excited about the opportunity, and I look forward to working with all of you. So with that, let me hand it off to Brian to cover the financials, and then we look forward to coming back and answering your questions. Brian? Brian West : Thanks Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with the total company financial performance for the quarter. Revenue was $17.8 billion, down 1%, primarily driven by lower commercial wide body deliveries, including impacts of the IAM work stoppage. The core loss per share was $10.44, primarily reflecting impacts from the IAM work stoppage and previously announced charges across certain commercial and defense programs. Free cash flow was a use of $2 billion in the quarter with results impacted by lower commercial wide body deliveries and unfavorable working capital timing, including impacts associated with the work stoppage. Improvement versus prior expectations was driven by better-than-expected BCA advanced payments. Turning to the next page, I'll cover Boeing Commercial Airplanes. BCA delivered 116 airplanes in the quarter. Revenue was $7.4 billion, and operating margin was minus 54%, primarily reflecting previously announced -- tax charges of $3 billion on the 777X and 767 programs, the IAM work stoppage and higher period costs, including R&D. Backlog in the quarter ended at $428 billion and includes more than 5,400 airplanes. Now I'll give more color on the key programs. The 737 program delivered 92 airplanes in the quarter. As noted in mid-September, we had been making good progress on stabilizing production and preparing for 38 per month by year-end, but those objectives will now take longer due to the IAM work stoppage. Given the strike and our need to conserve cash, we've made near-term adjustments to broadly stop supplier shipments. We continue to manage supplier by supplier based on inventory levels and for certain suppliers, this will allow them to catch up. We maintain our objective to position the supply chain to support our ramp post-strike. The quarter ended with approximately 60 737-8s built prior to 2023, the vast majority for customers in China and India, down 30 from last quarter. Additional progress on shutting down the shadow factory has been impacted by the work stoppage, which will now extend into next year. On the -7 and -10, inventory levels remained stable at approximately 35 airplanes and the certification time lines remain unchanged. On the 787 program, we delivered 14 airplanes in the quarter. And as previously noted, we continue to work through production recovery plans on heat exchangers and delivery delays associated with seat certifications. The program is currently producing at 4 per month and still plans to return to 5 per month by year-end. We ended the quarter with 30 airplanes in inventory built prior to 2023 that required rework, down 5 from last quarter. Our ability to finish the rework and shut down the shadow factory has also been impacted by the work stoppage and will now extend into next year. Finally, on the 777X program. As previously announced, the $2.6 billion pretax charge primarily reflects our latest assessment of the certification time lines to address the delays in flight testing of the 777-9 as well as anticipated delays associated with the IAM work stoppage. We'll continue to follow the lead of the FAA as we progress through the certification process and now expect first delivery in 2026. Year-to-date, 777X inventory spend has averaged a bit below $800 million per quarter. The cash profile will look similar to prior development programs with the year prior to first delivery, typically the largest use of cash driven by inventory build associated with the production ramp, which will unwind as deliveries commence. Moving on to the next page, Boeing Defense & Space. BDS booked $8 billion in orders during the quarter, including definitizing a $2.6 billion award from the U.S. Air Force for 2 rapid prototype E-7A Wedgetails aircraft and the backlog ended at $62 billion. Revenue was $5.5 billion, stable year-over-year, and BDS delivered 34 aircraft in the quarter, including the first production MH-139A Grey Wolf, to the U.S. Air Force. As previously announced, BDS recognized $2 billion of pretax charges on the T-7A, KC-46A, commercial crew and MQ-25 programs in the third quarter, and operating margin was minus 43.1%. In September, we indicated that margins would again be negative due to two things : First, on the 25% of the portfolio, primarily comprised of fighter and satellite programs. Our fighter programs recognized losses in third quarter due to disruption as the F-15EX ramps up on a shared production line as well as additional cost pressures and winding down F-18 production. Second, additional cost pressures on fixed price development programs. The magnitude of these losses expanded as we close the books, primarily reflecting higher estimated production costs on the T-7A program, mainly on contracts in 2026 and beyond and an updated assessment of impacts on the Case 46A program associated with the IAM work stoppage and the decision to conclude production on the 767 freighter. Given the fixed price nature for these contracts, we'll continue to be transparent about impact as we work to stabilize and mature these programs. While acknowledging these are disappointing results, these are complicated development programs, and we remain focused on retiring risk each quarter and ultimately delivering these mission-critical capabilities to our customers. The plan to improve BDS margins in the medium to long term remains unchanged. Our core business remains solid, representing about 60% of our revenue and generally performing in the mid-to-high single-digit margin range with commercial derivatives experiencing margin compression in 3Q due to the disruption in Puget Sound factories, including the work stoppage. Broadly, the demand for our defense products remains very strong, supported by the threat environment contracting our nation and our allies. We still expect the business to return to historical performance levels as we stabilize production, execute on development programs and transition to new contracts with tighter underwriting standards. Moving on to the next page, Boeing Global Services. BGS continues to perform well in the quarter. The business received $6 billion in orders and the backlog ended at $20 billion. Revenue was $4.9 billion, up 2%, primarily on higher commercial volume. Operating margin was 17%, up 70 basis points compared to last year on favorable volume and mix. In the quarter, BGS secured several key services agreements with ANA as well as a KC-135 spares contract from the U.S. Air Force. It's a terrific long-term franchise focused on profitable, capital-efficient service offerings and executing well with mid-single-digit revenue growth, mid-teen margins and very high cash flow conversion. Turning to the next page, I'll cover cash and debt. On cash and marketable securities, we ended the quarter at $10.5 billion, primarily reflecting the $2 billion use of free cash flow in the quarter. The debt balance remained stable, ending at $57.7 billion. Last week, we entered into a new $10 billion short-term credit facility and now have access to credit facilities totaling $20 billion, all of which remain undrawn. We expect 4Q free cash flow to be a usage driven by the timing of return to work, the pace of our production ramp and the unwind of inventory in the balance sheet. While we expect 2025 to be another use of cash, we anticipate a significant improvement over this year. Importantly, we expect to exit next year with real momentum in the business as we return to normal production rates. We continue to take a tough but necessary actions to preserve cash and safeguard our future. We've worked across our supply chain partners to significantly reduce expenditures while balancing the associated trade-offs. We shared plans to reduce our workforce to align with our financial reality and a more focused set of priorities. We're decisively implementing reductions to our discretionary spending across the company. As we move through this process, we'll maintain our steadfast focus on safety, quality and delivery for our customers. We remain committed to managing the balance sheet in a prudent manner with two main objectives : First, prioritize the investment-grade credit rating; and second, allowing the factory and supply chain to reset, which will take longer as a result of the work stoppage. We're constantly evaluating our capital structure and liquidity levels to ensure that we could satisfy our debt maturities over the next 18 months while keeping confidence in our credit rating as investment grade. The actions we've recently taken, including establishing the universal shelf registration, which is now effective, directly support these priorities, and we have a plan to comprehensively address the balance sheet in the near term that could include an offering of equity and equity-linked securities. We're confident that overtime, the business performance and capital structure will return to levels fully aligned with an investment-grade profile. Near term, we're focused on reaching an agreement with our representative workforce to allow our factories in the Puget Sound area to resume and then ramp production in a stable fashion for years to come. Stepping back, the markets we serve are significant, and our product portfolio is well positioned, demonstrated by our backlog of more than $0.5 trillion. Long-term, these fundamentals underpin our confidence as we manage the business with a long-term view built on safety, quality and delivering for our customers. With that, Matt, let's open up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Myles Walton : Thanks good morning. Nice to speak with you again, Kelly. In your remarks, you talked about Boeing as an airplane company. And so I just want to understand what is core and noncore outside of Boeing Commercial Airplanes as you see it and specifically, significant portfolio shaping and simplifying the business is in your turnaround you're describing looking forward? Kelly Ortberg : Yes. So first of all, good talking to you again, Myles. Look, as I look at the portfolio, and I've made this comment, I think that we're better off being -- doing less and doing it better than doing more and not doing it well. So we're in the process of taking an evaluation of the portfolio. It's something a new CEO always does when you come into a business and looking at those things and asking in the filter of what do we want this company to look like 5 and 10 years from now. And do these things add value to the company or distract us? So I'm in the process of going through that. Clearly, our core of commercial airplanes and defense systems are going to stay with the Boeing Company for the long run. But there's probably some things on the fringe there that we can be more efficient with or that distract us from our main goal here. So more to come on that, Myles, but I don't have a specific list in my hand today, and I'd ask everybody don't get ahead of me on this I don't have a specific list of things that we're going to keep, and we're not going to keep. That's something for us to evaluate and the process is underway to start that. Myles Walton : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss : Thanks. Hey Kelly. Kelly Ortberg : Hey David. David Strauss : So wanted to ask you about the balance sheet and the plan there. So how you're thinking around the parameters in terms of the size and timing of a potential capital raise? I'm sure this is a function of your discussions with the lead agencies as well as your ability to generate cash over the longer term. So maybe some color on what you're hearing from the credit -- from the rating agencies as well as your thoughts, maybe initial thoughts around the ability of the company to generate free cash flow in the future relative to that $10 billion target that's been out there? Thanks. Brian West : Thanks, David. I'll take a shot at that. We are in active engagement with the rating agencies, and it's a constructive dialogue, and they help inform the plan that we have. And we do have a plan to address the balance sheet. From a timing perspective, we've done everything necessary to be in a position to raise capital, and we're monitoring events closely and we'll access the markets whenever we determine it's the right time. In terms of the size question, here's what's important to us on size. We're focused on maintaining $10 billion of cash in addition to our revolver capacity as we historically have. And we're anticipating our near-term cash flows to be usage driven mostly by timing, both in the fourth quarter and next year as we ramp production. And the third piece of this is that we have debt maturities in the next couple of years. All of that is contextual for how we would think about a funding raise to address the capital needs and ensure sufficient liquidity as we execute our recovery game plan. So we have a plan. We're focused. And again, it's all on the priority to protect our investment grade. David Strauss : Okay. And Kelly, maybe if you could take that question around the $10 billion target that's out there. Is that a realistic target to think about any time over the next several years for this company based on what you've seen so far? Kelly Ortberg : Yes, it's too early for me to answer that. I would just say all the financial forecast, the long-term outlook are under review. And I need some time to assess that. And certainly, we need to see some stability in the business to be able to put any kind of target out there. So I'm evaluating that. But today, I'm not ready today to provide any update to that. David Strauss : Got it. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you. Kelly, nice speaking with you again. And Brian, thanks as always. So Brian, you mentioned free cash flow usage in Q4 and in 2025 as a total. Obviously, that assumes the vote is positive today. Can you talk about some of the drivers that were more positive in Q3? How do we think about the Q4 outflow? And what are you assuming for BCA delivery ranges in your free cash flow outflow next year in BDS losses? And does it become positive anytime in 2025? Brian West : Thanks, Sheila. So earlier in the third quarter, we had expected working capital to be a drag in line with the first two quarters. And as we closed the quarter, we had a timing benefit from BCA customer advances that cut the expected working capital about half -- working capital drag about in half. So as we look into the fourth quarter, a lot is going to depend upon the timing of the return to work and the pace the production ramp. But you could see a fourth quarter working capital drag similar to the first two quarters as we've essentially had a shift of deliveries to the right as we're building inventory. So net-net, free cash flow for the fourth quarter could look similar to the second quarter depending on a lot of things coming together as we move through the course of the end of the year. As it pertains to 2025, 2025 free cash flow will be significantly better than 2024. And we expect the first half to be a cash usage and the second half to turn positive and then build real momentum as we exit the year and return to more stable production rates. So the calendar year is likely to be usage, but the profile is important as we set ourselves up for the recovery and then for 2026 and beyond. In terms of the divisions, there's no doubt that BCA will be driven by those production rate ramps, which is too early to call those as we stand today. And then BDS is going to be impacted by some of the cash implications of some of the charges that we've announced, but we've got a good handle on that and we'll be more descriptive as we get in towards the end of the year. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Doug Harned : Hi, good morning. Thank you. Kelly, you've referred to the idea that Boeing was once a benchmark for culture. And that was a long time ago. I mean if you look over the last 5 years, Boeing's lost many experienced leaders from senior management to the factory floor, who were part of that culture. And you're also initiating a large headcount reduction. So how are you thinking about rebuilding leadership talent in this environment to make your goals for cultural change, stabilization of the business and execution achievable? And should this involve internal and external approaches? Kelly Ortberg : Yes, Doug. So first of all, I'm still in the process of traveling around, meeting our people, particularly 2 and 3 levels down. My first impression is we've got great people in the Boeing Company. Fantastic people. We just got to get everybody in the right position, running the right place, focused on the right things. And I think we've got some work to do there. Of course, I'll supplement the team as needed if we see that we need some additional resources from outside. I do think some outside view also helps us think a little bit when we're looking at culture change. But you're right, the culture I'm referring to at Boeing, probably most of the folks who lived in that culture have retired or moved on. So our culture change here is really going to be for the entire company. We've got to come back and reevaluate the values that we have. This starts at the top. I know that it starts at the top. I've had a meeting with the top leaders in the company, and we've talked explicitly about what we're going to do to change the culture. But it's going to take time, as I said in my prepared remarks. This isn't something that there's just a light switch that flips. We'll continue to work this. It's a never-ending process. We got to get to a point where the organization itself holds itself accountable to the cultural aspects and the values of the company. And I know what that looks like. I've been in a company where the values and the culture is very, very strong, and it becomes self-policing and self-developing as you bring new people in. So I think this is something that we can do. I think we may have to supplement in certain areas with some additional outside resources. But in the main, we need to turn the culture around with every employee here. We've got a large employee base. Now let me come to the 100 -- or the announcement on the workforce reduction. Look, as I've commented, we're inefficient. And one of the things I've heard from a lot of employees is there's just too much overhead. It slows them down in being able to get their work done. So we're going to really focus this workforce reduction in streamlining those overhead activities, consolidating things that can be consolidated. And I wouldn't think of it like we're going to take people off the production or out of the engineering labs. That's not our intent here. It's about around getting ourselves more efficient and have a more lean and mean machine going forward. And I think that's going to be really important as we ramp up the production, as Brian talked about, over the next year. Doug Harned : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ron Epstein : Hey good morning Kelly. Nice to talk to you again. Kelly Ortberg : Hi, Ron. Ron Epstein : When you sit back and you think about where you want the Boeing Company to be in 5 years, how do you think about that? I mean this kind of addresses some of the questions we've already hit. Where do you think you could feather in a new airplane? And where -- really, where could this company be? And as outsiders looking in, what should we expect that it will be? Kelly Ortberg : Well, look, I'm still -- as I said before, I'm still going through that process of, in detail, understanding what do we want to look like. But it's clear, I want to be the leader in the aerospace and defense market. I want to be setting the standard for the products that we deliver. I want our customers doing our marketing for us, not us doing our marketing. And we've got to get to a point where our engineering capability and our production capability is actually -- is doing the talk. So execution is going to be extremely critical. I do think we need to focus on the things that we can be good at. This is not a situation where we have to figure out what market opportunities are we going to go pursue. They're right in front of us. Our backlog is so strong. Our demand for our products is so strong. This is about getting ourselves focused on the things that we can do well and executing on those things. And what comes out of that? You can run the numbers. I mean the demand is fantastic for our product lines. And if we're efficient as we deliver those into the market, the sky is the limit for us. Ron Epstein : Yes, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman : Hey, thanks very much and good morning. And good to speak with you, Kelly. Maybe if I could do a question and a clarification. Kelly, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the defense business. I think a lot of us have been surprised by the magnitude of the charges there in recent years. There's obviously some tough contract terms, but the fact that the charges are so persistent suggest that there's an estimating problem there as well. And so what do you see as kind of the core of the problem at BDS? And what does it take to get to an acceptable level there? And then maybe, Brian, you talked about the -- getting to an acceptable production rate by the -- or normal production rates by the end of next year. What are those normal production rates? Kelly Ortberg : Okay. Let me start with the BDS portfolio. So everything you said is true. We've got some tough contracts, and there's no magic bullet to that. We're going to have to work our way through some of those tough contracts. Having said that, the discipline about what we can control on those contracts needs to get better. Our EAC process needs to get better. Our risk management -- this is the thing that I think is so important is that we're not admiring these risks, but we're acting on them. So we've been carrying risks in these programs. And I don't think we've been doing enough work with our customers to figure out how to derisk these things before it turns into an EAC overrun. So that's what I've got the team focused on doing, a lot more deep dives, a lot deeper look at the programs, a lot more looking around the corner, not just dealing with what today's problem is going to be because as you pointed out, we've gone from today's problem to today's problem to today's problem, and that's because we're not looking around the quarter enough on these programs. And some of that means that you've got to be better at working with your customer to define success on these programs going forward. So look, it's going to take a lot of work. We're not going to be able to just wave a wand and clean up these troubled contracts. We signed up to some things that are problematic. But we're also, I will tell you, really focusing on our bid and proposal activity, putting discipline around that to make sure that we absolutely understand the risks that we're taking on as we enter into new contracts as well. So burn down the tough ones, get better execution on the future, and I think the opportunities are there. We know how to run these programs. We just have lost a little bit of discipline. And I'll tell you, I don't think our people are close enough to the people in the labs, on the factory floor, identifying what's keeping us from being successful. And so we've started -- we've made some changes in that regard, and there's more to come to focus on these EACs. We just got to get better. Brian West : And Seth -- your BCA question, prior to the work stoppage, we had a plan in place to get to 38 per month on the 737. We were making very nice progress. We were starting to bring up that third line in Renton [ph] and then the work stoppage happened. So our expectation is, once we get back to work, we ramp production and move through next year, we'll get back on track. And then we'll be having discussions with the regulator about increasing beyond 38 per month. All that is not specific in timing, but those are kind of the milestones that we look forward to getting through as we go through next year. Seth Seifman : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead. Peter Arment : Yes good morning. Nice to talk to you again, Kelly. And Kelly, you spent a few decades in -- as a supplier and are very familiar with Boeing from the outside and now you're inside. Can you talk a little bit about -- you've got a -- Boeing has a deal to acquire Spirit and [Indiscernible] house, how you're thinking about kind of that and being vertically integrated and what kind of capabilities? I know you've got a lot on your plate still evaluating lots of things in the portfolio and things, but could you maybe address that point? Thanks. Kelly Ortberg : Yes. First of all, just to be clear, there's no change in our commitment to the Spirit acquisition and the integration. And that's clearly one of our major activities here in terms of stabilizing the business as they're a big part of the supply chain. Now the deal won't close until sometime next year. So it's very important that we work closely with Spirit, and we are in improving their performance so that they support our ramp-up. And I like what I see there, Peter. We're making good progress pushing the defects back into the system to where they're originating and then getting that root cause to fix those. And prior to the strike, we were starting to see some pretty good improvement in the overall quality of the fuselages coming back in. So no change in our strategy with Spirit. I think once we get that under our belt, it will be easier for us to integrate and tightly couple the improvements there. And I think that will be even a step change improvement from where we are today. But we've got a lot of work to do with Spirit. We've got several hundred people on their site every day, helping them work through some of their challenges. And that's going to be critical to our ramp-up. Peter Arment : Appreciate the color. Thanks Kelly. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Noah Poponak : Hey good morning everyone. Kelly Ortberg : Hi, Noah. Noah Poponak : Just to be 100% clear, you guys are saying you expect negative free cash flow for full year 2025? Brian West : Yes. Noah Poponak : So Brian, can you talk maybe a little bit more about the pieces of that? Because I guess I would have thought if you could have a little bit of MAX production rate recovery momentum exiting 2024 into 2025, you could certainly get that to a cash flow positive place. 8 7, it sounds like is on pretty decent footing exiting the year. You still have a ton of inventory to unwind. I guess I don't know where you stand with the advances relative to being behind schedule. And I guess, I don't know what you're assuming for defense? And maybe the MAX ramp back up post labor dispute takes -- is a lot tougher than I'm appreciating. But maybe you could just talk more about those moving pieces that roll up to that. Brian West : Sure. So first of all, we'll be significantly better as our expectation versus 2024. And the moving pieces are exactly that you laid out in terms of the commercial side of our business, in addition to the 777X which is going to be at that cash flow, most investment as it gets ready for an EIS in 2026, which is going to put further pressure on the cash flows. But broadly speaking, we have to have a return to work. We didn't have a ramp. We didn't have a ramp beyond 38, all things that we don't have clarity on as we sit here today, but one we're making some general forecast of what that might look like. And we know that the first thing we need to do is get back to work in the factory. So we'll get more specific as we move through the end of the year and into next year. and appreciate that all that is going to be that profile that I described, which is we typically have a first half cash usage clearly, first quarter but then it's going to turn in the second half, and then we're going to exit with more momentum as the production in the factories heal and recover. In terms of BDS, we've got charges that have been announced. Some of those charges are going to be more near-term focused and we have to acknowledge and we look forward to that team operating a game plan to execute with a much different level of performance as we exit next year. So it's all in the mix. It's hard to call at this moment, and we'll keep you posted on how all these levers are going to move as we get towards the early part of the year. Noah Poponak : I guess what's your best guess of number of months it takes to get the MAX back to what that first half of September was looking like once you have a labor resolution? Kelly Ortberg : Yes. Noah, this is Kelly. Let me -- I'm not going to give you an exact month because I don't know what the exact month is going to be. Let me tell you kind of some of the steps that we have to take that we've got in our plan. So first of all, it will probably be a couple of weeks to bring the members back. We have a recertification effort and a retraining effort that we're going to do. For those who haven't been -- who were trained on their job and didn't get enough time on an airplane before they went out on strike, we're going to go through a retraining activity. It is so much more important that we do this right than fast coming out of the chute. As you know, we've got the supply chain right now that we've turned off in many cases. So I'm anticipating we're probably going to have a little bumpy return from the supply chain. We've tried to manage that as best we could and keep folks like Spirit, for example, on fuselage, keep them funded and moving forward. But there are some folks who had to stop and are going to start back up. And so we've got to be realistic about some schedule issues associated with bringing the supply chain back on. The other thing that I think is really important is you know we have this 38 a month cap with the FAA. We've got a safety and quality management plan in place. We've laid that flat with the FAA, and that monitors a lot of key metrics within our production system. And those metrics have to be trending in the right direction and they have to be meeting certain thresholds for us to achieve a rate increase. And we actually won't take it to the FAA if we're not achieving those rate increases. We're going to make sure that we take care of that. But I'm anticipating the first rate increase. This is going to be the first time that we've done it and the FAA has done it. And so I think the first one's probably going to be the hardest going beyond rate 38. And so we just can't be overly aggressive in how we're forecasting that because anything in aerospace, the first time you do it, it's hard. And this will be the first time. There's a lot of dynamics around both the technical part of rate increases and the political dynamics around our rate increases. So we absolutely have to make sure that we're not increasing rate when we're not ready. And I'm in direct lockstep with the FAA on that. So those are things -- I think the first rate increase is something for us all to watch. I think they'll get easier for the sequential rate increases after that throughout the year. And as Brian said, we should exit next year in a much more, I'll call it, normal or recovered fashion. Noah Poponak : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Deuschle from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Scott Deuschle : Hey good morning. Kelly Ortberg : Good morning. Scott Deuschle : Kelly, just following up on supply chain. Can you provide more detail on how you're managing supply chain through this work stoppage? And also what specific steps you're taking to ensure that supply chain remains in a position to ramp up once the strike is over? And I asked because last time, there was a broad-based work stoppage and getting things back on track was clearly a challenge and frankly, we're still seeing the ghost of that 4 years later. And so just looking for some more clarity here on how we kind of avoid mistakes of the past. Thanks. Kelly Ortberg : Yes, the answer to that is we have to work with every supplier on each commodity relative to what their current situation is. Now I think in some cases, we've kept people hot, as I've said, either because we felt that they were behind or there was a need for -- there was too much risk associated with turning them down. Some of the larger companies, they're going to use this time to actually get in a healthier position themselves. So I think that will be okay. It will be the ones or twosies things that we have to deal with. You need all the parts to build the airplane. So as we bring that on, I'm not expecting a major issue. It's not like we've been out on strike for a long period such that someone's decommissioned a factory or changed a foundry or shifted a balance of their workforce. We have seen some furloughs but furloughs are temporary. That's why they furlough them because they want to be able to call those folks back. And we've done some furloughs ourselves. So we're managing that supplier by supplier, day in, day out, trying to keep close communication with all of our supply chain as we bring this back on. Scott Deuschle : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead. Jason Gursky : Yes. Good morning and Kelly, welcome back to the fun of quarterly earnings calls. Kelly Ortberg : Thanks, Jason. Jason Gursky : Let's see here, I want to just talk a little bit about the bigger picture turnaround here and particularly as it relates to the balance sheet. It seems to me like you're getting ready here to deploy a pretty well thought out plan. You've got some cost cutting that you're doing here. You've talked about you're going to look at the portfolio, there might be some divestitures potentially there. Brian's talked about the capital raise and you've talked about better execution. I think the one thing that may be missing from that list, I just wanted to try to get a sense from you on is the potential of just exiting some programs or some contracts that you've got absolutely no path to profitability or free cash flow on over the longer term. And whether there's an opportunity for you all to get out of some of these contracts or get out of some of these programs and how you go about doing that. And just want to get a really good sense of whether that is kind of on the menu of options that you have because I think we're all looking for ways on how you can kind of increase the pace of this turnaround. I know you say it's going to take a long time, but just kind of what are some of the tools at your disposal here? Kelly Ortberg : Yes. So look, I think if you're talking the big defense programs where we've got EAC problems, I don't think that's a viable option to us. I don't think we can just -- even if we wanted to, I don't think we can walk away from these contracts. These are our core customers that need this capability. We've got long-term commitments to them. So walking away isn't an answer to this. In my prepared remarks and comment to an earlier, we do have to work with the customers and see if there's areas where we can trade things off with them and help us and help them too. And I don't think we've been doing enough of that in the trade space with the customers. So we can come up with some win-wins and we don't sit here with these risks that are unmitigated going forward. So I think that's more the -- where I would focus on these things. Now there are some things that we can just stop doing that we're currently doing. And those are on the table in the streamlined effort that I'm talking about. There are some areas where we may be at one contract phase and do we want to go to the next contract phase that will sit and evaluate. And we've got to get it -- we do have to get in a position where we've got a portfolio much more balanced with less risky programs and more profitable programs. And we're going to be working that. But again, I don't think a wholesale walk away is just in the cards. Jason Gursky : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Kelly Ortberg : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from TD Securities. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr : Yes, thanks so much and welcome back, Kelly. So two questions for you. First, would you consider hiring from the outside to fill the BDS head slot because obviously, the folks there have really not been getting the job done? And secondly, if we look at your portfolio, you have several properties in Global Services on the commercial side that looked like they could be very highly valued, specifically Jefferson, you could argue are not directly required to build planes successfully. So would you consider divesting any of those because that would significantly reduce the amount you'd have to raise via equity? Kelly Ortberg : Yes. So Cai, I would say, I'm not going to specifically address the BDS position, but I'll just say generically, as I look at any of these positions and any changes we'll make, we'll take a look at internally. Do we have the right candidate? And if so, that's the way we'll head. If we need to supplement from the outside and bring some outside skills in, then we'll head that direction. So as I said before, I'm certainly not averse to bringing in some additional resources to help the team. And I don't think the teams are averse to that as well. So we'll see where that heads on specific positions. The second part of his question -- Jefferson... Cai von Rumohr : Yes, on the properties in Global Services that you've got things like Jefferson that arguably could command a very high price and don't look like they're totally required to build planes successfully. Would you consider divesting any of those to supplement an equity raise? Kelly Ortberg : Yes, I think that's what I'm talking about when I'm talking about looking at the portfolio and deciding what do we need for our future. I'm not going to specifically comment on Jefferson. But looking at all of our activities like that, whether it's in our services business or in either the core businesses, looking at what we're doing there and asking the question, does that really fit in our long-term strategy? Or would that property be better off somewhere else, and we could get more value -- we're destroying value by holding it in the Boeing Company. So those are the things that we'll look at as we do this portfolio review. And my guess is there'll be some things that we want to take action on. I just don't have that list to tell you right now what am I going to do? Cai von Rumohr : Do you have any time frame to make that decision? Like are we talking 3 months? Are we talking 9 months? Kelly Ortberg : Yes, I want to have a good feeling internally by the end of the year as to what I want that. We've got a process underway where we do our long-range planning, which will facilitate that. Now Cai, that some of these things can be actioned quickly. Some of these things are not actionable. Some of these things take a long time. So it sort of depends on what the opportunities are, can things be separated? Can we just stop doing work? An example, just the 767 freighter. We looked at that and said, hey, look, there's an incoming on the 767 freighter. It's coming soon. Let's make the decision now and get that distraction out of the way. We'll finish the deliveries, been a fantastic airplane and we'll continue to support our customers and support the mill variants of that. But let's declutter our minds with some of this stuff and get our resources really focused on what's going to make a difference for us going forward. And that's the type of stuff I want to really focus on. Cai von Rumohr : Terrific. Thank you very much. Matt Welch : And Greg, we have time for one final question. Operator : Okay. That question comes from the line of Richard Safran from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead. Richard Safran : Thanks, Kelly, Brian good morning. Kelly, great to be speaking with you again. So I thought I'd ask also about Global Services, but I think you may have some better visibility. We've seen some modest growth this year. We had about 70 basis points of margin improvement this quarter. I thought you might talk about your near and long-term outlook for the segment, how you see sales and margins trending? And Kelly, is there any read-through to Global Services from your core part structure? Or you're pretty happy with the way things are going there? Kelly Ortberg : Well, let me just say that that's not my focus right now. They're doing really well. Chris Raymond and his team are executing. And the one thing I want to do right now is just help them make sure they get all the support from the corporation they need to continue to execute. Having said that, absolutely, there's parts in this 4-part strategy that flow through our global service, particularly the cultural aspects of this. So that's a company-wide activity, and it has to permeate through our Global Services business as well. And there's areas in Global Services, they're doing well, but there's areas we could do better. There's areas we could get closer to our people and have better outcomes for our customers. So they're in this together, but I would just say Chris' team is doing really well, and it's not my priority right now. We want them to continue with their head down and delivering the results that they're delivering. Richard Safran : Thanks very much. Matt Welch : And that concludes our call today. Thank you, everybody, for joining. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that completes the Boeing Company's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Boeing Company's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and the slide presentation, plus the analyst question-and-answer session are being broadcast live over the internet. [Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Matt Welch, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Boeing Company. Mr. Welch, please go ahead. Matt Welch : Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's quarterly earnings call. I am Matt Welch, and with me today are Kelly Ortberg, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian West, Boeing's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And as a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation at Boeing.com. Projections, estimates, and goals included in today's discussion involve risks, including those described in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the beginning of the presentation. We also refer you to the disclosures relating to non-GAAP measures in our earnings release and presentation. Now, I will turn the call over to Kelly Ortberg. Kelly Ortberg : Thanks Matt, and thanks to everyone for joining today's call. Before I get into the fourth quarter earnings, let me first offer our thoughts and deepest condolences for the families and loved ones of those on-board Jeju Air Flight 2216. We continue to support the airline and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board as they assist the South Korean authorities in the accident investigation. Now, turning to the fourth quarter earnings. During the last call I highlighted four areas critical to our recovery, and as the New Year begins we're making steady progress in all four areas. The first area, stabilizing the business. Following the resolution of the IEM strike, our commercial team has been executing a methodical plan to restart our factories within the framework of our safety management system. This included ensuring all manufacturing employees were current on their training and certifications prior to returning to work on the factory floor. We took time to rebalance the production line, so that when we started up, we did so with a healthy production system. People are back to work and excited about the task ahead and you can see the energy when you are on the factory floor. For the 737 MAX we have sufficient parts inventory to enable producing at 38 a month, including fuselages which were a pacing item prior to the strike, and all three of the production lines in Renton are now cycling. In the past quarter we completed our safety management meeting with the FAA, in which they reviewed our safety management system and our production status, including spending time on the factory floor. They reported that they saw a significant improvement, and I'm pleased that we have an agreed-upon path for rate increases beyond 38 per month. It's all about adhering to our safety management system and a stable factory as measured through agreed-upon key performance indicators or KPIs. It's an early innings on the production ramp and we need to stay disciplined on maintaining a stable production system, but early signs are encouraging. The best news is that our customers are reporting that they are encouraged with what they are seeing as they monitor our production. Progress on the 787 also continues, and we finished last year at a production rate of five per month. Like the 737, we are working to ensure the 787 production system, including the supply chain, is stable prior to making the next rate increase. An important accomplishment to stabilize the business was to shore up our balance sheet. We are committed to recovering the business, while maintaining an investment grade credit rating, and delivering for our shareholders. I think the demand for our offering last year speaks volumes about the market's competence in our recovery. We're working across the supply chain, including the sub tiers to ensure readiness and stability with our production rates. Notably, supplier part shortages across all of our commercial programs are within their established control limits. We have instituted dedicated sessions with suppliers to provide insights, as well as to promote two-way communication to stay aligned as we operate together as one extended production system. The second element of our recovery is to improve performance on our development programs. While the charges for the quarter in BDS are disappointing, I have had the opportunity to complete deep dive EAC reviews on all the troubled programs. We are very focused on creating stability within the EACs, so we stop this quarterly drumbeat of cost growth. This means being more proactive and clear-eyed on the risks and our estimates to complete the projects. While I know it doesn't show in this past quarter's performance, we're making progress in working with our customers to actively manage the contracts to achieve better outcomes for both parties. You've seen that we've entered into an MOA with the U.S. Air Force on the T-7A program, and we're in active discussions on a second MOA on that program, all focused on improving the performance of the program. We're also in active discussions with our customer on the VC-25B program to make the necessary changes to improve the program performance and delivery. The U.S. Air Force has termed this as an Active Management, which is a term I really like. We're focused on actively managing all of our problematic programs to improve the performance for the company and our customers. While I said there's no silver bullet on these fixed price programs, I do feel better about our ability to better manage the performance in 2025. On the commercial side, we continue to focus on getting the 737-7 and -10, as well as the 777X through certification. There are no updates to the timelines we\u2019ve previously communicated on these programs. On the -7 and -10, we're still working through the testing phase, focused on finalizing the icing design solution, which we plan to include in the certification program. Working closely with the FAA, especially in light of their leadership changes, will be a key focus area for us this year. The 777X is back in flight test, and we have a good handle on fixing the thrust link issue we uncovered. Now, moving to the third area, culture change, this will be a multi-year journey, but we're already making progress. Our leaders are getting more engaged with their teams and customers. We're having the frank discussions about what we need to change. In 2025, we'll be rebaselining our core values and behaviors to make our expectations perfectly clear to all our Boeing teammates. These will be incorporated into our leadership development program and become fundamental elements of our performance management system. Leadership promotions will be grounded not only in what we get done, but how we get things done. We're going to help focus the teams on what it takes to make Boeing successful and promote a culture of unity and accountability by implementing a single enterprise score for all of our annual incentive plans. As I talk with employees, there's a growing swell of excitement around restoring trust and getting their Boeing back, and they want to be a part of this turnaround. So the last area is building a new future for Boeing. While workforce reductions are always difficult, I'm pleased that we have been able to reduce layers of management and redundant overheads in our system. This will serve us well as we establish a less bureaucratic, more focused and agile operating environment for our future. We're preparing for the road ahead by continuing to make important investments in our core business, while streamlining our portfolio in areas that aren't core to us. So let me wrap up by saying that the markets we serve are robust and growing. Demand for our core commercial and defense products and services remain strong. Our backlog of more than $0.5 trillion clearly demonstrates the value of our portfolio, and we're focused on meeting our commitments and delivering safe, high quality products to our customers. I do want to acknowledge and thank the incredibly talented employees at Boeing. Your resiliency and commitment gives me confidence in our path forward. It's going to take all of us working together. Next, let me turn it over to Brian to cover the operating results, and after that we'll be happy to take your questions. So Brian, over to you. Brian West : Thanks Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with the total company financial performance for the quarter. Revenue was $15.2 billion, down 31%, primarily driven by lower commercial deliveries associated with the IAM work stoppage. The core loss per share was $5.90, primarily reflecting previously announced impacts of the IAM work stoppage and agreement, charges on certain defense programs, as well as costs associated with workforce reductions announced last year. Pre-cash flow with the use of $4.1 billion in the quarter, in line with the expectations shared at our last earnings call. Results were impacted by lower commercial deliveries and unfavorable working capital timing, primarily driven by the IAM work stoppage. Turning to the next page, I'll cover Boeing commercial airplanes. BCA delivered 57 airplanes in the quarter. Revenue was $4.8 billion, and operating margin was minus 43.9%, primarily reflecting previously announced impacts from the IAM work stoppage and agreement, including pre-tax charges of $1.1 billion on the 777X and 767 programs. Backlog in the quarter ended at $435 billion and includes more than 5,500 airplanes. Now, I'll give more color on the key programs. The 737 program delivered 36 airplanes in 4Q, including a step up to 18 in December, and as of yesterday we've delivered 33 airplanes in January with four days to go. On production, we restarted the factory in December and plan to gradually increase rate. We expect to be in a position to go above 38 per month later in the year. All three lines in our rent and factory recycling and monthly production is already in the low to mid 20s for January. More broadly on the master schedule, we continue to make adjustments as needed and manage supplier-by-supplier based on inventory levels. Over the past year, our buffer inventory has grown to promote stability across our production system. As production stabilizes and rates increase over time, we plan to deliberately return buffer inventory to more normal levels. The quarter ended with 55 737-8s built prior to 2023, the majority for customers in China and India, down five from 3Q, with about another 10 already delivered in January. Given the impact of the strike, we now expect to shut down the shadow factory mid-year and deliver all remaining airplanes to customers within the year. On the -7 -10, inventory levels were stable at approximately 35 airplanes and testing on the anti-icing design solution is ongoing with certification expected to follow later in the year. On the 787 program, we delivered 15 airplanes in the quarter as we made progress on working through production recovery plans for heat exchangers and delivery delays associated with seat certifications. The program exited the year at a production rate of five per month and we recently announced plans to expand South Carolina operations as we prepared for anticipated future need of the commercial market. We are intent on ensuring the production system and the supply chain demonstrate stability prior to making the next increase on rates sometime this year. We ended the quarter with 25 airplanes in inventory built prior to 2023 that require rework, down five from last quarter. Our ability to finish the rework and shut down the shadow factory was also impacted by the work stoppage and we expect to complete this work in early 2025. Finally, on 777X, as previously announced, the $900 million pre-tax charge primarily reflects higher estimated labor costs associated with finalizing the IM Agreement and will be incurred over the next several years. Flight testing recently resumed and we still expect first delivery in 2026 and will continue to follow the lead of the FAA as we move through certification. 777X inventory spend in 2024 finished at $2.6 billion as 4Q spending levels moderated due to the work stoppage. As noted previously, we expect the cash profile to look similar to prior development programs, with a first year prior to first delivery typically the largest use of cash driven by inventory build associated with the production ramp, which will unwind as deliveries accelerate. Moving on to the next page in Boeing Defense and Space. BDS booked $8 billion in orders during the quarter, including awards for 15 KC-46A Tankers from the U.S. Air Force and seven P-8A aircraft from the U.S. Navy and the backlog ended at $64 billion. Revenue was $5.4 billion down 20% year-over-year on volume and program charges and operating margin was minus 41.9%. BDS delivered 34 aircraft and two satellites in the quarter, including the final T-7A EMD aircraft to the U.S. Air Force. The 15% of their portfolio comprised of fixed price development programs and recorded a $1.7 billion pre-tax charge as previously announced. The fixed price development cost pressures were driven by the KC-46A and T-7A programs with KC-46 primarily reflecting higher estimated manufacturing costs, including the impacts of the IAM work stoppage and agreement and T-7 driven by higher estimated production costs on contracts in 2026 and beyond. Roughly one-third of these new charges will work through the cash flows in the next few years with the remainder spread over the coming decade. Given the fixed price nature of these contracts, we'll continue to be transparent about impacts as we work to stabilize and mature these programs. We acknowledge that these are disappointing results. These are complicated development programs and we remain focused on retiring risk each quarter, and ultimately delivering these mission critical capabilities to our customers. As Kelly shared, we continue to make progress in 4Q, including key order and delivery milestones already noted. Importantly, the updated acquisition approach for the T-7A is a proof point for how we are working with our customers to find better overall outcomes for both parties, and those efforts will continue as we work through other parts of the portfolio. On the 25% of the portfolio, primarily it comprised of fighter and satellite programs. Our fighter programs again recognize losses in 4Q due to disruptions associated with the F-15 EX ramp-up and the F-18 production wind-down. We also recognize impacts across satellites and a few other legacy platforms tied to development realities as we work to refresh the capabilities of these platforms to support our customer needs. The remaining 60% of revenues of the portfolio are generally performing in the mid to high single-digit margin range. Although the P-8 commercial derivative program experienced margin compression in the fourth quarter due to the IAM work stoppage and agreement. While still more work in front of us, we continue to be confident that BDS margins can improve to high single-digit levels in the medium to longer term. The demand for our defense products remains very strong, supported by the threat environment confronting our nation and our allies. We still expect the business to return to historical performance levels as we stabilize production, execute on development programs, and transition to new contracts with tighter underwriting standards. Moving on to the next page, Boeing Global Services. BGS continued to perform well, delivering record operating margins in the quarter. The business received $6 billion in orders and the backlog ended at $21 billion. Revenue was $5.1 billion, up 6%, primarily on higher commercial volume. Operating margin was a record 19.5% in the quarter, up 210 basis points compared to last year, with both our commercial and government businesses delivering double-digit margins. In the quarter, BGS secured awards for C-17 sustainment, as well as a contract for F-15 Japan super interceptor upgrade and services from the U.S. Air Force. BGS is a terrific long-term franchise focused on profitable, capital-efficient service offerings and executing well with mid-single-digit revenue growth, mid-team margins, and very high cash flow conversion. Turning to the next page, I'll cover Cash and Debt. On cash and marketable securities, we ended the quarter at $26.3 billion, primarily reflecting the successful $24 billion capital raise in October, partially offset by the free cash flow usage and debt repayment. The debt balance ended at $53.9 billion, down $3.8 billion in the quarter, driven by the early repayment of a $3.5 billion bond originally set to mature in 2025. Importantly, this prepayment de-risks our 2025 maturity profile, resulting in $800 million of debt maturities remaining in the year. The company maintains access to $10 billion of revolving credit facilities, all of which remain undrawn. We remain committed to managing the balance sheet in a prudent manner with two main objectives. First, continue to prioritize the investment grade rating; and second, allow the factory and supply chain to reset. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to further supplement the balance sheet as we make certain portfolio decisions through the course of the year. Turning to the next page, I'll cover the total financial company results for the full year. Full year revenue was $66.5 billion, down 14% year-over-year, driven by lower commercial deliveries, including impacts of the IAM work stoppage. The core loss per share was $20.38, down from prior year, primarily on lower deliveries and commercial and defense program chargers, including impacts of the IAM work stoppage and agreement. Pre-cash flow was a $14.3 billion usage for the year, down versus prior year on commercial deliveries and unfavorable working capital timing, including the impact of the work stoppage. Stepping back, let me provide some additional context on 2025 free cash flow. 2025 will be an important year in our recovery, and while we still expect it to be a use of cash, we anticipate a significant improvement over 2024. Within 2025, we expect 1Q free cash flow will be a usage, and similar to 4Q\u201924, driven by continued working capital headwinds as we ramp production, as well as normal seasonality. We still expect the first half to be a use of cash, with the second half turning positive and accelerating as we exit 2025. CapEx investments stepped up last year and could increase by approximately $500 million in 2025 to support planned growth across both, the commercial and defense businesses. Importantly, we expect to exit the year with real momentum in the business as we return to normal production rates. This outlook will be underwritten by a few critical factors. Increasing 737 production rates through the year; moving 787 steadily towards its long-term production rates; liquidating our legacy 737 and 787 inventory and shutting down both shadow factories; strategically investing in the business, including the 777X production ramp and CapEx to support planned growth across the portfolio; Improving our defense business as we continue to mature the fixed price development programs and work to transition recently challenged programs with our renewed focus on disciplined program management and stabilizing the business. And finally, continuing to demonstrate strong performance across our services business. Broadly, the markets we serve continue to be significant and our backlog of more than $0.5 trillion demonstrates that our product portfolio is positioned to win. Long-term, these fundamentals underpin our confidence as we continue to manage the business with a long-term view built on safety, quality and delivering for our customers. With that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss : Thank you. Good morning. Kelly Ortberg : Good David. David Strauss : Kelly, I wanted to ask how you viewed the restart on MAX, how that's gone. You mentioned some of the \u2013 you mentioned KPP\u2019s that you have with the or KPI\u2019s that you have with the FAA. Can you maybe elaborate on what exactly those are? How close you are to hitting what's necessary to get to go above 30 a month? And then, Brian, can you just give us an idea of what to expect for all-in MAX and 787 deliveries in 2025? Thanks. Kelly Ortberg : Yeah, David. So let me talk about the production startup on MAX. So as you know, we came out of the strike and didn't actually jump right on building aircraft. We spent time training the workforce, getting them all up to speed, but also really as I said, balancing the line, which is really important, starting the lineup in a stable manner, and it already is paying dividends. We're seeing the production process come back very well, and I feel pretty good about where we are right now with the production rate. Remember that we've got a significant amount of inventory, both in airplanes and in supply parts. So I don't see any constraints right now from the supply chain for us in ramping up the 737 to the 38 a month rate. And notably, the work at Spirit during the strike has really paid off. That team has done a great job of improving the overall performance and quality of the fuselages, which are going to help flow through the factory. So as I said, you know its early days, but I feel really good. And I think our deliberate plan is going to pay dividends for us going forward. A - Brian West : David, a little bit on how to think about 737 deliveries for the year. We're not putting out formal guidance, a little too early for that. But let's just talk about a framework for the year. So January is off to a very solid start, and delivery should be in the high 30\u2019s for the month. Now, keep in mind, some of these airplanes are the benefit of clearing the delivery center ramp that had accumulated in the November or December time frame. So there's an advantage of a nice tailwind entering the year. We expect February will be lighter because there's fewer manufacturing days and also the timing of the factory restart, and then March is likely to be better than February as we begin to get more predictability. So as we've said, the first half is going to reflect our gradual, steady restart of the factory. And the second half is likely going to benefit from achieving higher production rates, which include the 38 per month target and possibly higher based on approval from the FAA, as Kelly mentioned. So, as we sit here today, we've got a lot of work in front of us. You know, 2025 in some ways could look like 2023, maybe a bit better if things go our way. Kelly Ortberg : Hey David, let me come back also and talk about the six KPIs that you asked about. So, these are KPIs that we've agreed with the FAA on what the threshold is and where the control limits we want to operate. And these are what we've collectively determined will measure the stability of our production system. I'll quickly tell you what the six are. They are NOE, notice of escape hours, shortages, part shortages, employee proficiency, rework byline, travel to work at rollout, and the ticketing performance. And so, I will say it's a little bit early, because we have a lot of inventory yet of planes that were in process that we're going through. But early indications is that all the KPI\u2019s are looking and trending in the right direction. So I feel so far so good, but it will be important to see and continue to measure these KPI\u2019s as we continue to ramp up. And remember, we need to get to 38 and show stability at 38 with these KPI\u2019s and we won\u2019t go to the FAA for a rate increase. We won\u2019t request one if we don\u2019t see these KPI\u2019s performing the way that we want to. And so , I think we\u2019ve got a disciplined approach. As I said in my remarks, I\u2019m pleased that it\u2019s pretty well grounded in facts and data, so there is no subjectivity here as far as what it\u2019s going to take. But we got to perform and Stephanie and the team were clearly focused on performing to these KPI\u2019s. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead. Peter Arment : Yes, good morning Kelly and Brian. Hey Brian, maybe if you could walk us through a little bit on the free cash flow dynamics for 2025. I know you called out a few things from the moving parts, but just thinking about working capital headwinds or 777X spend or BDS losses. We\u2019ve been estimating about a $5 billion outflow this year. I think it\u2019s a little above the consensus of $4 billion. Anything to highlight that you could help us maybe that potentially could be, you know reduce that outflow or how are you thinking? I know you gave us the first half versus second half dynamics, but anything else that you could provide more color on? Thanks. Kelly Ortberg : Yeah, sure Peter. So, 2025 free cash flow is largely going to be consistent with what we'd said at our October earnings call, with the two adjustments that I noted, which is CapEx a little bit higher based on some growth programs that we're anxious to invest in, and the impact of a few hundred million based on the updated BDS charges. So, it's consistent with those two adjustments. Now, in terms of profile, as we've discussed and you mentioned, the first half will be negative. The second half will be positive. It'll be a net usage in the calendar year, but importantly, positive momentum as we accelerate cash flows exiting the year that sets us up very nicely for 2026. Now, in terms of levers, the first half of the year, BCA is going to be negative driven by the working capital usage and continued investment in the 777X program. BDS is going to be negative due to the prior period charges running through, as well as normal seasonality as it pertains to customer receipts. And BGS is going to be nice and steady contributing to the first half. As we go to the second half, BCA is expected to flip positive, because then we'll get the benefit of the working capital as deliveries accelerate while we still invest in the 777X program. Again, it's all going to be a function of our ability to work those higher deliveries in the back half. Now, BDS is going to move positive despite a continued drag from the charges, primarily from the benefit of favorable receipt timing that's natural and seasonal in that part of the business. And then BGS, we tend to have a better second half than first half, so it's going to be a nice steady but growing profile for the second half. And as I mentioned, the CapEx is going to be a bit higher, but for good reason, because that's all about growth. So, in terms of the numbers that you described, that's a reasonable ballpark of what we're aiming at, and we're managing all the levers and keeping you updated as we move through the course of the year. Peter Arment : I appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Hey, good morning. Hey Kelly, maybe on the fixed price development programs within BDS, it seems like the timing to stabilize those keeps getting pushed to the right. How are you actively managing those programs, and what are you looking to change? And then Brian, related to that, you know, how do you correlate those charges? I think you mentioned one-third is now. Can you maybe size that cash outflow for \u201825? Is it $3 billion related to BDS, and then $1 billion in \u201826? Does the business become breakeven in \u201827, and when does it become positive? Kelly Ortberg :  Okay Sheila, I'll go first and then ask Brian to follow up. Yeah, so obviously, the quarter was disappointing here on the fixed price development programs, but as I said in my remarks, we're very actively now working all these programs with our customers. And, you know, we\u2019ve got \u2013 the U.S. Air Force is clearly working with us to find a better path forward on these programs, both for us and for them. So, de-risking through this active management process is different, and it's -- we still have to convert it, these MOAs, which are Memorandum of Agreements, we have to convert them to contract changes. So, we're in early stages, but the customers are working with us in that regard. And then I think, just as I said, taking a real clear look at the EACs and the estimates to complete, and making sure that we're, you know reflecting the realities of the risks that we have. And so I'm very hopeful that we're going to see a much more stable performance here this next year. But again, we're not done with these until we're done with these. And they are a fixed price, so we've got to continue to work at this. Our team is very, very focused on program management discipline, making sure we're managing the tasks at hand. But, you know a lot of work yet to do Sheila on these. So I think we're making progress, but I certainly can't claim victory yet. A - Brian West : And Sheila, in terms of the cash flow, you're correct. The new charge of $1.7 billion, we characterize. About a third of that is going to be over the next three years. So it's a little bit front-end loaded, so a few million dollars \u2013 a few hundred million dollars of pressure that we see in 2025 versus what we said back in October. Now, in terms of your broader question on the full weight of the charges, they are going to tend to flow through. I think BDS for 2025 from cash flow performance is going to look a little bit like 2023. And then once we get through 2025, it'll be in a much different spot, because a lot of that headwind from the charge will be behind us. And when we get exactly to breakeven positive, won't be this year, but can't wait to have that discussion as we move out beyond exiting this year. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Got it. So breakeven could be possible in \u201826 or maybe \u201827. A - Brian West : Yeah, for sure. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ron Epstein : Hey, yeah. Good morning, guys. Kelly Ortberg : Ron. Ron Epstein : Kelly, could you talk about how you're thinking about Boeing's portfolio? I mean, there's been a fair amount of press about maybe some things could be up for sale, maybe not. You know, what's core? What isn't? You know, so like the way I've been thinking about it, one of the things that's been talked about is maybe selling Jefferson. But on one hand, maybe that's a good idea. But on the other hand, that puts Boeing's name in pretty much every cockpit of every airplane on the planet. And is that a bad thing? So I mean, how are you thinking about it? A - Kelly Ortberg : Well, so first of all, Ron, we've been through the through the detailed portfolio review, which was one of my, you know one of my early tasks, and that's complete, highlighted areas that are questionable to our core, and we go through an analysis to look at each of those areas, and we're in process in that. You know, as I look at this, here's how I would think about it Ron. This is not going to be a major restructuring of the Boeing Company. The core business that you see us in, and we're going to continue to be in those core areas. But there are some areas, you named one, there are some areas where we can streamline the organization, or we may be better off focusing our energy elsewhere and we'll be actioning those over the coming months and year. The only thing I would say is that, you know as you look at those, part of that decision process is what do you do with something? You know, in some cases you have potential that you could sell it and there are buyers, in some cases that may not be a viable approach, we may want to just not continue with the next phase of the project or something like that. So we're going through that, but I think, if I give you any guidance, think of it as more pruning the portfolio, not cutting down the tree. Ron Epstein : Got it. Got it. And you'd expect maybe we'll know more about this in the next 12 to 18 months, something like that? A - Kelly Ortberg : Yeah, look, I can't really speak about individual portfolio decision areas, but as they come along, obviously, you'll see what we're doing there. Ron Epstein : Got it. Got it. All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Myles Walton from Wolf Research. Please go ahead. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning, still. So on the supply chain, and maybe the spirit integration, how key is that to your ability to get to 38 and then get above 38? And then if you could just quickly touch on the 787 and the supply chain constraints you are observing there, specifically on interiors, and if heat exchangers are still the issue, and how quickly you expect those to release within the context of 2025. Thanks. A - Kelly Ortberg : Yeah, Myles. So look, on spirit, I don't view Spirit fuselages as a constraint right now for us to get to rate 38. As I mentioned in the remarks, they've done a really, really nice job of improving the quality of the fuselage and the flow of the fuselages. So we're in really, really good shape on fuselages with Spirit, which sets up a very successful integration. We've got a team of Boeing folks at Spirit working hand-in-glove with them as they improve their production processes. And I think that sets us up well for the upcoming integration, which will happen sometime, still we're projecting middle of the year. Relating to 787 supply chain, as Brian said in his remarks, I think we're working through the heat exchangers. We still need some additional improvement there, but all the improvements look good. Seats remain a challenge for us, and it's not the seat. We call it seats, but it's the monuments really that go around the seats and the integration of the IFE and the certification associated with that. And we're still challenged in getting through cert on some new of type seats on 787. We've got a plan on that. It's really a customer-by-customer basis. One of the things we're looking at for the future is we've got to spread these new seat configurations. We call them code ones. We've got to spread these code ones out to allow ourselves and the regulators more time to get through the certification. These things are complex. They are not a seat. They are a complex monument. And particularly as we move to doors, doors are a real challenge in the certification process, and so we've got to work through some of that. We've got a team really focused on that, but I think it's going to continue to be a challenge for those 787 deliveries, where we have a new seat configuration that needs to be certified. So for example, Lufthansa, we've got a lot of completed airplanes that are held up still on seats, and we're working through that. Hopefully we'll get through that this year, and we'll have a more successful seat integration program as we ramp 787 up. Myles Walton : Okay. And Brian, the delivery number for 787 for this year, 75, 80, is that a doable number? A - Brian West : Yeah. So as we've said, we're at five per month. We want to get to seven sometime this year, and we've got, call it high teens, coming out of inventory. So when you add all that together, for sure, maybe a little bit better. Myles Walton : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Scott Deuschle from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Scott Deuschle : Hey, thanks for taking my question. Kelly, can you characterize the pace at which you think the business can liquidate 777X aircrafts from inventory once EIS hits? And then, are you expecting the first class cabin seats to be certified for the 777X launch customers by the time 777X itself is type certified? Or is there any risk of delay there on seating as well? Thank you. Kelly Ortberg : Yeah, let me take the seating first, and then I'll ask Brian to do the liquidation. So actually, the first delivery, 777X delivery is also to Lufthansa, which is what I just mentioned. We have had seat and continue to have seat challenges. So I guess the good news, bad news is we've had seat challenges, but we do know what those challenges are for Lufthansa deliveries. Now, 777X interior in general is a more complex interior, but that's baked into our overall certification program for the aircraft. So we got time to go work the seat certification issues, and we've learned from our 787 what those issues are. So I think we'll be able to manage that for the initial deliveries. A - Brian West : And Scott, in terms of cash flows, as is typical on our new program, heavy cash usage the year before EIS, which is going to be for 2025. In terms of 2026, when it goes into service, keep in mind the initial airplanes are going to be changing corp airplanes, which are going to be, you know not high-cal cash flow airplanes. But once you get through those and you get out of 2026 and into 2027, you are really going to start to generate pre-cash flows, and that's going to accelerate as deliveries accelerate. So we're going to be set up very nicely once we get through EIS. Scott Deuschle : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much and good morning. A - Kelly Ortberg : Good morning Seth. Seth Seifman : I guess I wanted to follow-up on maybe two other items as we think about the cash flow this year. You talked about winding down the shadow factories, but both of them, I guess, that was something that in the past we've talked about as a key enabler of enhanced profitability. How do we think about factoring that into the cash flow improvement that we're seeing this year? And then also the financial implications and cash flow implications of spirit integration in the second half. Kelly Ortberg :  Yeah, sure, let me take a stab at that one. So as you know, we've got two shadow factories. The 737 has largely been in Moses Lake. The 787 has been the joint verification work in Everett. And there is a lot of labor to go into reworking those airplanes. As it pertains to the 787, we expect the very early part of this year, that work will be done. Now we won't deliver all the airplanes this year, because we've got some customer fleet planning things we need to fit in with, so that'll bleed over into next year. But the factory itself and the labor associated with that is going to be over the early part of this year. And labor has already started to move towards other first run production. On the 737 equally, Moses Lake, we've begun to take labor and move it from Moses Lake into Renton. We expect to shut that shadow factory down by mid-year. And then the corresponding deliveries will tail off towards the end of this year. So it's been a long journey. We look forward to that. It's all contemplated into the numbers I discussed and described in terms of how cash flows are going to move this year. I would say that over time, the benefit you're going to start to see is a margin improvement at BCA, because you don't have these two very expensive shadow factories up and running anymore. They'll be done. So that'll be something that will be 2026 and beyond. As it pertains to Spirit integration, as Kelly said, we're anxious. One, they are doing a great job. We're anxious to get it closed. We're not really describing what the financial impact on that is until we close. But the good news is that we're on pace. It remains strategically important and the team's holding up really nicely at a pivotal point as we ramp production. Seth Seifman : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Noah Poponak : Hey, good morning, everyone. Kelly Ortberg :  Morning, Noah. A - Brian West : Hi, Noah. Noah Poponak : What is it about the T-7A specifically that it keeps having so much cost creep? And I guess, Kelly, as you look at this portfolio, everything in defense is complex and I appreciate the amount of work that goes into these, but I think there's been some investor confusion around the dollar size relative to the perceived complexity of these programs. So what is causing the cost creep and how do you fix it? And you mentioned the updated acquisition approach on that program specifically. Can you detail that a little bit further? Kelly Ortberg : Yeah, so the fundamental on T-7 is a fixed price development with a large fixed price production. And we did not have our supply chains back to back in the fixed price production. So it's much larger than what you would normally see, because very rarely do you see where you have, first of all, where you have a fixed price development, but certainly don't have multi-years of fixed price production. We've been burned on that on the tanker program and clearly that's been a challenge for us on T-7A. So we've taken our medicine. We're not going to do that anymore. Now, specific to the MOA, what we're doing is making changes. The Air Force wants some additional test aircraft, that will allow us to eliminate concurrency. And by concurrency, what I mean is we're still \u2013 we're building production airplanes while we're testing and certifying the design. And that's a disaster, because every time you come up with a change that comes out of that, you got to go ripple that change back through the production process, either in process or airplanes are complete. So the major milestone with the MOA-1 that we've got with the Air Force, really helps us get more aircraft into the test program, eliminates concurrency risk for us going forward. So it's not necessarily good news from an EAC write-up, but it's certainly going to eliminate risks that we are staring at on the program. And then on MOA-2, which is we're in active discussion with them. It's also on making some changes to equipment purchased by us versus purchased by the Air Force directly, which will also help them with their logistic support plans, but also de-risk our escalation risk associated with those commodity sets. So that's the type of stuff we've got to get better at, is working those things with the customer, but the fundamental to this is a fixed price development, with a fixed price production option, and not having your supply chain back-to-back is not a good recipe. We've learned and we're not going to do that anymore. Noah Poponak : So, I appreciate learning that lesson and not doing that again, but if you live with the decisions that were made on the existing programs for until the end of those programs, how do you have confidence in the cash flow improvement in the segment in the near term that you've expressed here? Kelly Ortberg :  Well so, I mean, we do an estimate at complete and look at the estimate to complete. So much of the charges that we're taking are not actual charges for overruns today. They are anticipated charges for increased costs from our supply chain. So we are getting the supply chain back-to-back in fixed price right now. Our goal is to get that 100% done. But as we're doing that, we're having to recognize the cost increases from the supply chain. So that's why I have confidence. We're getting closer to having that all back-to-back. So we've eliminated that large risk going forward. But obviously, it's resulting in pretty significant charges as we reach through that. A - Brian West : And what I would say long term, our objective has always been to get the 15% of the portfolio that's wrapped up in these fixed price development programs, including the T-7, to not be a drag, to just be neutral, right, to be at the zero profit and not consume cash. The rest of the portfolio, and we get the 25% fighter and satellites performing as they should, given they are legacy products, and 60% of the portfolio that's doing quite well. If we can get that all moving in the right direction, that gets you to the path to high single-digit margins in BDS, like they should be, even with a 50% of the portfolio that isn't going to do anything for us and that's fine, because long term, outside of the planning period in front of us, those development programs, including Tanker, including MQ, including T-7, there are longer-term opportunities with market demand, particularly internationally, that actually could have us do a little bit better. That we are not counting on, but longer term, those are the reasons why we stay in these programs and deliver capabilities to the customers that absolutely need. Noah Poponak : I appreciate all that detail. Thank you. Brian West : Yep. Operator : The next question is from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Doug Harned : Good morning. Thank you. You know, it sounds like you are in a very good position right now to get to the 38 a month level, given that you're already in the 20s on the max. But historically, upward rate breaks have been pretty challenging. And when you look beyond the 38 a month to 42 and subsequent rate breaks, how are you thinking about what you need to get done to make sure that you have the right team in place to make those rate breaks happen, given that a lot of people have left over the past five years or so? A - Kelly Ortberg : Yeah. You know, as I look at that, I'm less concerned about our \u2013 you know, the people resources to do that. I think we're in good shape. Once we get to these higher rate breaks, the most important thing is that we have the supply chain ready and mature. And one of the things we're doing right now, because we've forecasted rates that the supply chain has built to, and then we haven't met those rates. So I want to make sure that that supply chain isn't making independent decisions on readiness for these out year production rates and continuing to invest in the capacity that they need to supply us. So we've started that, as I said in the open remarks, you know open communication. And what that means is, at various levels, including CEO level, we're making sure that they are investing in their supply chain. And if they are not, they are talking to us about why, and we're working through what we do to make sure that we don't get to a point where we're ready to get to the next rate increase and the supply chain stability is not going to be there. Now remember, these KPIs that I talked about earlier, those are going to stay with us for each rate increase. So we won't make a rate increase if we \u2013 well, we won't be approved for it, but we won't request it, if our production system isn't showing that these metrics are indicating stability. So we've got to continue to work that. But I'm not too sure or too concerned about the overall staffing level of the production resources. It's probably more focusing on the supply chain for that growth. Brian West : And, Doug, the other good news is the facilitation. We're cycling at three lines in Renton as Kelly mentioned, and we've got that fourth line in Everett and that is going to create a lot of flexibility for us as we think about those rate breaks. So not only is it labor, parts, supply chain, etc., but the facilitation is there as well. So we feel pretty confident the tools are all there in place, and of course, the demand is there, which is beneficial. Doug Harned : And is there anything you would point to in the supply chain that you particularly want to focus on to make sure you don't run into an issue when you take your next break-up? Brian West : No, not in particular. I think there's multiple areas that we'll work with all of our Tier 1 OEMs probably have a commodity in their portfolio that we want to make sure. But it's generally more in the commodities where there's long lead components like forgings, castings, that kind of stuff. I'm less worried about electronics. That's a pretty easy area to scale. But it's where you have to invest in that second and third tier of supply chain, that we want to make sure that they are making those investments and they haven't hedged their bets and don't believe we're going to build the airplanes and then we find out that we don't have the capacity there. And you know, one of the things that we're working very closely with GE on is that the overall \u2013 making sure they understand our overall market demand, as well as the aftermarket demand for the engines as well, because they've got a big challenge with supporting our rate increases, our competitor rate increases, and managing the aftermarket. And I work very closely with Larry and his team to make sure we stay aligned. Doug Harned : Very good. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead. Jason Gursky : Hey, good morning. Brian, one for you and then just a quick one for Kelly as well. Brian, for you, BCA margins, you took some charges this quarter on the programs that were in forward loss positions. I suspect though, that we'll have some impacts on the margins for some of your more profitable programs as well, given all those costs. I'm just kind of curious, you know what does the margin cadence look like for BCA over the next six, eight quarters as you're ramping in production? When do we get the chance to flip to the positive range on margins? And then just kind of a long-term implications of these cost increases coming out of the labor strike, that kind of thing on the financial model and what BCA margins are going to skate to over time once you're up at those targeted production rates. And then, Kelly, just really quickly for you, I \u2013 you know I received the company's corporate calendar. It's got the X-66 on the cover. Just wondering if you could comment a little bit on that aircraft and kind of what it means to the company and kind of your general views on that development program for NASA. Thanks. Kelly Ortberg : Yeah, let me take the latter part of that first. So you know, it's an important technology development program. It's very challenging. It's taking some dedicated resources that I think, you know are learning new things and exploring new technologies for us. And then we'll look at what comes out of that and how that factors into our next airplane. So it's an important project that we're working on. You know, we've got some funding we're investing, but we've also got some funding there to support us. So you know, we'll continue to explore that exciting opportunity and see what that portends for the future for future airplane. I will tell you, I've sat through the through with the team and there's some exciting stuff that we're learning from that program and so I think we want to continue that. A - Brian West : And Jason, in terms of BCA margins. So as we think about 2025, your margins will be negative. They'll be less negative as we move through the next few quarters, as we exit the year. And then beyond that, we're going to expect them to get better in 2026. We're not going to try to characterize it quite yet. It's too early. But in terms of the longer term profile, you know, the IAM agreement did put pressure, but keep in mind, we're talking about a cost that's less than 5% of the airplane. Now, it's a little bit of pressure, but I characterize that versus the massive productivity benefit that we're going to enjoy by having two shadow factories behind us and a rate ramp that's going to accelerate productivity naturally. So it doesn't disrupt our margin expectations of the long-term. A lot of work in order to get this pressure behind us, but plenty of levers that we think work towards our favor. It doesn't necessarily disrupt the long-term. Jason Gursky : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Gavin Parsons from UBS. Please go ahead. Gavin Parsons : Thanks, guys. Good morning. Kelly Ortberg : Morning. Gavin Parsons : I just wanted to follow up on that BCA margin question a little bit with the price side of that, the price-cost mix. You know, how much of max 10 starting to contribute helps drive the margin up? How much of, you know kind of escalators or realized price increases over the coming years? And then a quick clarification on inventory. Just how much cash is tied up in both completed aircraft and WIP? Thank you. Kelly Ortberg : So in terms of the profile for BCA, of course, we've got a backlog that is in place, that has embedded escalation in it. That hasn't changed. That's good. And in terms of our supply contracts, you know they are vastly signed up until end of this decade. So that doesn't really disrupt the near term or even the medium term per se. I will tell you though, as we move forward, we will expect any kind of inflation pressure to be offset by an expectation that we continue to drive productivity. So we think we'll be able to manage that mix. More to come as we move out of this year and get into more of that normal stable position. But nothing right now would suggest it's going to disrupt that long-term margin outlook that BCA's enjoyed historically. And of course, some of the mixed benefits that you mentioned, both the 10 on the 37 and the 10 on the 87 are going to be natural tailwinds, including the consolidation at Charleston that we've always talked about and we still feel very good about as we move towards normal production rates. So more work to do, but no big disruptions that we see as we sit here today. In terms of the inventory, we've got $87.5 billion worth of inventory in the company right now. That is too much. Now, it's been an investment in stability and we are committed to make that investment so that we can get the factories in the right spot. But there will be a point when those inventories will begin to liquidate and not only see the productivity benefit, the word capital benefit will be something that we're very interested in seeing and we'll begin to lower buffer rates that we put in place deliberately as we get to more predictability. So that is the big cash flow benefit that we're going to see over the next couple of years-ish. And it's all because we've been sitting on this big investment that we look forward to having unwind with deliveries, and that's what we're focused with the team on, out in Seattle. Gavin Parsons : Thank you. Matt Welch : Well, thanks Gavin. And Lois, we have time for one final question. Operator : Thank you. And that question is coming from the line of Gowtham Khanna [ph]. Please go ahead. Unidentified Participant : Yeah, thanks for the detail on the call. I just wanted to put a finer point on when you expect to be at 38 a month in terms of deliveries on the 3-7, and when realistically you could get to 42. I know you mentioned this year, but if you could put a finer point within the year. Thank you. Kelly Ortberg : You know what? I'm not putting a finer point on it, both externally nor internally. We're going to go to that rate when the KPIs say that we're going to go to that rate and we'll just see how that plays out. I mean, like I said, things look encouraging so far. We got a lot of work yet to do and we'll make those rate increases, hopefully sometime, so that I do want to get through the rate 38 approval and move to that next rate of 42, get through the approval this year and get to that 42 sometime towards the end of the year. But we'll put exact dates on it once we know and feel better about our KPIs and how the trends are indicating. Unidentified Participant : Yes. Thank you. Kelly Ortberg : As part of why we're not providing guidance yet, I think we've got a little bit more work to do to see the system get stable, before I feel like we can provide guidance to you that we have a reasonable expectation that we'll be able to meet that guidance. So more to come as we mature. Things are off to a good start, but we got a lot of work yet to do. Operator : That completes the Boeing Company's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call.
