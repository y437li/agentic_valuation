Welcome to the WellPoint Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Please go ahead. Doug Simpson : Welcome to WellPoint's First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. This is Doug Simpson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Presenting today are Joe Swedish, Chief Executive Officer; Wayne DeVeydt, Executive Vice President and CFO. Joe will start this morning with an overview of our first quarter 2014 financial results and the broader backdrop, and then Wayne will review the quarterly financial highlights in detail and provide an update on the 2014 outlook. Q&A will follow Wayne's remarks. During the call this morning, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at wellpoint.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of WellPoint. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Joe. Joe Swedish : Thank you, Doug, and good morning. It was great to see many of you at our Investor Day last month and I look forward to building on the dialogue today and into the future. Let me begin by stating, we are pleased with our performance in the first quarter and continuing our focus on execution and fostering a culture of discipline, consistency and accountability to drive value for our customers and shareholders. Before I get into the review of the quarter, I want to frame the discussion this morning around our goals of driving affordability and better health outcomes for our members, which we laid out in detail last month and which are key to our capitalizing on our future opportunities. The overarching goal of our 48,000 associates is to provide the most attractive product in the market to serve the healthcare needs of our customers. Our view is that the complexity of the healthcare industry combined with growth in national health expenditures that consistently outpaces GDP creates a need to our health plan leadership with creative solutions to drive better cost and quality outcomes. We believe our broad-based engagement with providers, employers and policymakers will continue to benefit our members and their families. As we address the goal of achieving affordability and improving outcomes. This is a time for creativity not festivity. To that end, we continue to invest for success in the evolving marketplace, focusing on areas such as provider collaboration, information technology and process improvements to improve customer experience. Over the last two years we have invested approximately $550 million in our health insurance exchange build-out, improve analytics and predictive model. These investments are foundational to leveraging our assets against the growth opportunities across our segments. These investments are clearly creating better solutions that are valued by our 37 million members, representing roughly one in nine Americans. We're pleased to share that in the first quarter 2014 our products have been chosen by 1.3 million new consumers across both our Commercial and Government segments. Importantly, these new consumers represent a broad mix of customers, including individuals and their families, employers and government programs. We believe our enrollment success demonstrates the strength of our product design and our prudent pricing strategy. I would also note that we are a leader in the new markets being created under the Affordable Care Act. Newly created public exchanges in marketplace, which was specifically intended to enhance price transparency and drive affordability, we committed to participate by making the needed investments to be successful. Applications especially near the end of the quarter were robust. Our March 31 membership includes applications through February 15th and we have enrolled over 400,000 members. Through the entire open enrollment period which officially ended April 15th, we now expect to add more than 600,000 members from public exchanges. We are also serving approximately 100,000 members in private exchanges, which represent a new option for employers and their employees to obtain health coverage. Taken together, our overall enrollment growth and our positioning in the exchanges represent tangible examples of how our commitment to driving value for our customers is resonating with employers, individuals and their families on a daily basis. Now focusing on first quarter results, I'm happy to report a solid quarter during a very dynamic period for our industry. We believe this serves as an indicator about our continuing improvement in execution, as well as the benefits we are capturing from our investments across both Commercial and Government segments. Specifically in the first quarter, we reported earnings per share of $2.40 on the GAAP basis and $2.30 on an adjusted basis. Our GAAP EPS and adjusted EPS decreased from first quarter 2013, but the change in the mix of our product portfolio and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act has changed the quarterly earnings patterns of our core business results. Both of these results compare favorably to our initial expectations for the first quarter of 2014. We also generated higher than expected operating cash flow of approximately $1.4 billion, which has allowed us to continue executing on our share repurchase and dividend programs. We repurchased 14.3 million shares or nearly 5% of the shares outstanding at the start of the quarter for approximately $1.3 billion and paid $123 million of dividends. Turning to our business segment performance, our Commercial business had another strong quarter. Our product portfolio and leading cost structure drove Commercial membership growth of 1.2 million lives in the quarter and first quarter operating revenues of $9.7 billion. Investments made in recent years are translating into profitable market share capture, as evidenced by our 648,000 new lives national and our strong growth on the health insurance exchanges, which is expected to exceed 600,000 new lives by the end of the open enrollment. Commercial operating margins declined as expected from 12.8% a year ago to 9.1% in the first quarter of 2014, due to our SG&A investment spending and the changing quarterly earnings pattern of our business, which we discussed with you previously. The implementation of our public exchange strategy is progressing well, based on our read of available data and provides a foundation for future commercial risk growth opportunities over the coming years. To update you on the various metrics that support our position, let me say that our enrollment is tracking well, individual membership in total stood at roughly 1.85 million at the end of the first quarter 2014, consistent with our expectations and up 95,000 lives during the quarter. For exchanges, the general characteristics of applicants, including average age are tracking well versus our expectations. We anticipated that exchange enrollees would generally be older than our legacy individual customers and our pricing assumptions for both on and off exchange products reflected this view. We did notice the average age of applicants decreased and further we got into the open enrollment period, indicating that younger age applicants signed up later in the period. Product selection has also been consistent with expectations as silver and bronze have been the two most popular metal levels by a wide margin. The actuarial value of the products selected by new applicants is also in line with our projections to date and we will continue to monitor product mix on a state-by-state basis. We're continued to see signs at our brand name and network quality are carrying more of an advantage in the market than we had expected. For example, there are geographies where we believe we are gaining share despite lower priced competition, which points to the value of our local market depth, knowledge, brand, reputation and networks. Finally with respect to our small group business, we continue to be mindful of the potential for employer coverage changes in light of the exchanges and we did see Q1 small group member declines above our expectations. However, this was offset by stronger large group membership trends in the quarter. These dynamics are reflected in our outlook. Turning to the Government Business segment, our Government Business division added 75,000 lives in the quarter, driven by strong growth in Medicaid and generated revenues of $7.9 billion, up approximately 4.9% year-over-year. Government Business represented 45% of operating revenues in the quarter as our business continues to evolve and diversify. Medicaid enrollment is off to a strong start in 2014, growing by 121,000 lives in the quarter and it\u2019s expected to continue growing throughout the year, driven by our recent RFP wins in Florida, Kentucky, Georgia and California, as well as the ACA-driven expansion. Medicare enrollment declined by 62,000 in the quarter in line with our expectations, as we work to reposition our individual Medicare advantage portfolio of products to preserve affordability and benefits for our members and improve our performance. Government operating margins improved 160 basis points to 3%, reflecting continued medical cost management efforts and an improvement in expense efficiency, as well as receiving actuarial sound rates in certain states. We are updating our 2014 financial outlook this morning and now expect adjusted earnings per share of greater than $8.40 for full year 2014. This outlook reflects stronger than expected Q1 results while also incorporating an incremental $100 million in Hep C spending over the balance of the year to reflect the potential for higher than expected utilization of new drugs in that area. Wayne will discuss these elements in more detail. We believe this is a prudent outlook in light of the dynamic nature of our markets and the potential for future changes in the regulatory framework. As we articulated at our Investor Day last month, we believe we have a clear strategy to deliver more affordable products to more people across the commercial and government markets. This includes a differentiated approach provider collaboration. The site one specific relationship, our new partnership with Emory Healthcare System in Atlanta integrates the CareMore clinical model into their delivery system. The goal is migrating to full-risk contracts and leveraging CareMore capabilities to drive performance under those arrangements. More broadly, we note our momentum in the market with 87 ACOs currently in place and over 70 in the pipeline come online between now and the end of 2015. So wrapping up, we're very pleased with our Q1 performance. We believe that by focusing on improving health care cost and quality and leveraging our understanding of consumer trends and preferences, we have delivered on our commitment and will continue to demonstrate market leading solutions for our growing number of customers. With that, I will turn it over to Wayne. Wayne DeVeydt : Thank you Joe and good morning. My comments today will focus on the key financial highlights from the first quarter of 2014. I\u2019ll also provide an update on our 2014 outlook. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.40 for the first quarter of 2014. These results included net benefits of $0.10 per share, reflecting net investment gains of $0.07 per share and approximately $0.04 per share of income from 1-800 CONTACTS which we sold January 31, 2014, partially offset by $0.01 per share of debt extinguishment expense recorded in the quarter. Excluding these items, our adjusted EPS totaled $2.30 for the quarter. These results were favorable to our expectations. And as Joe noted we are pleased with how our 2014 has progressed so far. To anticipate the question, roughly one-third of the outperformance versus our previous expectations in the quarter from stronger operating gain and about two-thirds came from below-the-items and while positives, we\u2019ll not necessarily repeat. Operating outperformance in the quarter reflected high enrollment, modestly favorable medical cost experience and G&A expense control. March results supported some of the early positive trends we have seen in January and February. Below-the-line, our tax rate, while increasing from last year, was lower-than-expected due primarily to favorable state tax developments. Medical enrollment grew by 1.3 million or 3.6% sequentially to approximately 36.9 million medical members as of March 31. This reflected membership gains in our national and local group ASO, individual and Medicaid businesses. Operating revenue exceeded $17.6 billion in the quarter, an increase of approximately $210 million or 1.2% versus the first quarter of 2013, driven by higher overall enrollment and growth in the government business. These increases were partially offset by decline in commercial resulting from the previously discussed impact of transition of the State of New York account from fully insured to self funded on January 1st. The benefit expense ratio was 82.7% in the first quarter of 2014, a decrease of 100 basis points from the prior year quarter and favorable to our expectations. The decline reflected continued strong medical management and the impact of the premium revenue designed to help cover new healthcare reformed fees, partially offset by changes in our quarterly earnings pattern Joe discussed previously. For the full year 2014, we continue to expect underlying local group medical cost trend to be in the range of 6.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. Our SG&A expense ratio increased by 280 basis points from the first quarter of 2013. As expected, due to the inclusion of various healthcare reform fees in 2014, continued investment spending in preparation for ACA driven market changes and higher administrative cost as a result of strong commercial membership growth during the first quarter of 2014. Moving onto the balance sheet. Days and claims payable was 44.2 days as of March 31st, up 5.5 days from 38.7 days as of December 31st. We continue to maintain mid to upper single-digit margin for adverse deviation and believe our reserve balance remains strong and consistently conservative as of March 31, 2014. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 38.2% as of March 31, 2014, up from 36.9% from December 31st, down from 38.6% from year end 2012. We ended the first quarter with approximately $2 billion of cash and investments for the parent company and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of $995 million as of March 31st. We generated stronger than expected operating cash flow of $1.4 billion in the first quarter or two times net income. We continue to expect cash flow timing to remain volatile, partially reflecting the timing of exchange-based enrollment this year and the timing of payments related to health insurer fee and the 3Rs. That said cash flow trends in the first quarter been encouraging and we remain comfortable on outlook of greater than $2.4 billion for the full year. We repurchased nearly 14.3 million shares for nearly $1.3 billion during the quarter. This is a weighted average price at $88.14. As of March 31st, we had approximately $2.4 billion, a board approved repurchase authorization remaining which we intent to utilize over a multiyear period, subject to market conditions. We used $123 million during the quarter for our cash dividend and yesterday the audit committee declared our second quarter dividend to shareholders. Turning to our 2014 outlook. As Joe noted, we currently expect adjusted EPS to be greater than $8.40 for 2014. The increase in our full year outlook reflects a balanced contribution from higher operating income and below-the-line items. Above-the-line, improvement reflects stronger enrollment, strong medical management and expense controls and some recapture of the non-deductibility of the health insurer tax. Above-the-line, our outlook includes a slightly lower tax rate than we originally expected due to favorable state tax developments. These positives are partially offset by roughly $100 million in incremental Hep C cost we now factored into the remainder of 2014. So logical question is, could this prove to be conservative in light of the Q1 results. It is fair to say that at the level of our performance in Q1 were to persist, or if Hep C cost failed to increase as currently factored into our forecast then our current outlook could prove conservative. In addition, while our outlook factors in some recapture the non-deductibility of the health insurer tax in our Medicaid block of business based on signed contracts thus far. Incremental contributions from this block could add modestly to results all else being equal. That said it remains early in the year, in which the industry is undergoing substantial change and our biases to maintain a prudent stance in this dynamic environment. I would also note that our outlook continues to reflect approximately $210 million of intangible asset amortization expense in 2014 related to prior acquisitions including the Amerigroup. There are also investment in our business that we do not expect to repeat in 2015 including at least $30 million of cost associated with implementing the first year of public exchanges and nearly $20 million of the startup associated with two eligible programs. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Joe. Joe Swedish : Thanks, Wayne. Before we move to the Q&A section of the call, I do want to update you on our few senior leadership changes. Dick Zoretic who heads our government business division has recently informed us of his decision to retire for personal reasons at the end of May. I first want to express our sincere thanks to Dick for everything he has done to position our government business division with a continued growth opportunities we see in that area over the coming years. The success of the Amerigroup integration and our success in accelerating growth in our government business under his leadership are the result of the reinvigorated organization leveraging its key assets more fully. In addition to Dick\u2019s leadership, a key driver of this improvement has been the level and the depth of leadership and talent throughout division. As such, I'm very pleased to announce that Pete Haytaian, President of our Medicaid business will be taking over Dick\u2019s roll next month. Pete joined Amerigroup in 2005. Many of you have met Pete over the years. But for those that have not, Pete has been a key factor behind sustained growth and execution track record at Amerigroup and has been absolutely instrumental in the successful integration over the last year and the improved performance of legacy WellPoint Medicaid business. Pete bring substantial operating experience across both Medicaid and Medicare markets and a track record of operating execution and discipline to the role. I have every confidence that Pete will lead our government business to further success across our markets. I'm also pleased to announce that Tom Zielinski has agreed to join us as Executive Vice President and General Counsel. I've known Tom for many years. He is a fantastic addition to our team, bringing extensive legal and industry experience having previously served as General Counsel at Coventry. I believe both of these appointments strengthen our company and strengthen our prospects going forward. With that, operator, please open the queue for questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Justin Lake from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Justin Lake - JP Morgan : Thanks. Good morning. First, on the exchanges, can you tell us what margins or booking for these exchange revenues at this point. And then just a quick question on the 3Rs, the government is now looking for risk orders to be budget neutral. So I\u2019m curious if you are running a negative margin in a specific state for instance, would you comfortable, would your auditors be comfortable with booking a receivable in that risk order or given the budget neutrality? Joe Swedish : Hey, Justin. Good morning. Let me first start by saying that relative to margins, we are very pleased with the mix of business and probably more importantly the affirmation of the strategy we laid out around the design of our products and formulary. So our margins within our markets varied but they are still within our targeted range in total of 3% to 5% category. Relative to the 3Rs, it\u2019s a little bit of a hard question for us to answer because we do not believe we will be in receivable position on the corridors. From our perspective, we believe we are in situation where we are within the sweet spot of maintaining the appropriate margins. So, I couldn\u2019t respond to what the auditors may or may not say. If anything, we have evaluated a few markets where we may be booking payable, in fact in the quarter while deminimis, have booked a small payable towards the corridor. Justin Lake - JP Morgan : Okay. And just a quick follow-up on Hep C. You talked about a $100 million of costs, is that -- I just wanted to confirm that\u2019s incremental to what you already expected and then can you share with me, would you really expected for Hep C and what that implies for an overall kind of U.S. spend in your mind? Joe Swedish : So, Justin, for Hep C, we are actually pricing our book for Hep C cost to double over what those costs were for last year. In the first quarter, we were just shy of $50 million in costs. So we are still well within our pricing that we laid out for the year. But we thought it would be prudent to at least incrementally increase by additional $100 million in our outlook in the event that we would see a continued ramp up in utilizations. As I mentioned in my comments, if that proves to be conservative in our outlook and that would provide upsides to our guidance. Justin Lake - JP Morgan : Sorry, what was that number last year? Joe Swedish :  We doubled it from last year. So last year was at a level comparable to what you saw in the first quarter. So we had in excess of $100 plus million in pricing for this year. Justin Lake - JP Morgan : Great. Thank you. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll from Stifel. Please go ahead. Tom Carroll - Stifel: Hey, guys. Good morning. So with government accounting for like 45% of your operating revenue, I think is what you said, so basically half. How do you see this trending going forward and it\u2019s certainly should increase I would think a bit, given the dual programs coming on and the growth in Medicaid? But I guess, are you comfortable with the current level or do you see, do you have a particular target in mind in terms of how much explicit government business you are contributing to the total revenue number? Wayne DeVeydt :  Tom, let me start by first saying that I won\u2019t say that we have a targeted goal as a percentage of our book. What we have is a goal to really maintain and as Joe said at IR Day, a number one or number two market position in every segment, whether it would be government or not government. And then ultimately how that plays out will be very dependent on how the commercial book shifts over time. But that being said, we are bullish on our outlook for Medicaid and duals and longer-term for Medicare. We expected the government Medicaid to ramp up as the year goes on in terms of numbers shifts. So we are actually pleased with what we have in first quarter relative to expectations and expect that to continue to ramp up as the year progresses. And as you know, our dual revenue really doesn\u2019t start coming on until mid and late this year. So the full run rate impacts of that will really start to ramp up beginning next year. Tom Carroll - Stifel: And you see greater efforts on Medicare or Medicaid and maybe which one? Wayne DeVeydt : I\u2019d say from a Medicaid, we really like expanding our key pipeline, not just on the tenant population but as Dick highlighted a month ago, there was over 40 billion of our key pipeline in the next 18 to 24 months. So we plan to actually participate. But I will tell you that Joe has made it clear to his leadership team that on the Medicare front, we are going to get our shopping order and we are getting close to that and then we expect to start expanding in there much more aggressively beginning 2016. Tom Carroll - Stifel: Great. Thank you. Joe Swedish : This is Joe. Good morning. Tom Carroll - Stifel: Thanks, Joe. Joe Swedish : Just to add some color commentary, I think we are very solidly positioned for continued growth in the space. We believe and I just maybe affirm what Wayne just shared with you on that and we are actively pursuing duals. We are repositioning in Medicare, leaving that there will be an inflection point sometime in the not-too-distant future that would call us backend but we certainly want do that with a stable portfolio. And we have other government initiatives in terms of expectations with respect to Medicaid number growth. So all-in, we see the horizon. We believe that building a team as well as an infrastructure to support that growth is absolutely essential for success going forward. We are well on our way. And I think we're perfectly positioned for continued growth in the space. Tom Carroll - Stifel: Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice - UBS: Hello everybody. Thanks. Well, maybe first I will go back to the public exchanges. Can you expand in anyway? I know you said the demographics are consistent with your expectations. Do you have any data at this point about legacy WellPoint, previous, understand to whether they are previously uninsured, any commentary about the enrollees that sort of a big push at the end in February and March, with a materially different than what we were seeing earlier in the sign-up period, any color along those lines? Joe Swedish : Good morning, A.J. I will give you a little bit of background on what we saw. First of all, just as reminder, the membership you see in our current 1.3 member, a million number growth only reflects open enrollment due February 15th. So clearly applications received post that date, have a much more meaningful lift beginning in April and May. Relative to our expectations, the volume we saw is specifically in the last two weeks of March and that actually continued into the first two weeks of April for the extended enrollment period, not only was substantial versus our expectations. But I would tell you that we saw in each day\u2019s applications, the average age coming down in a meaningful fashion. And from our perspective, again, only time will tell but relative to the average age we've seen in that, we have hit the sweet spot. Relative to the claims activity, we have pushed over 90% of the claims we received in the first quarter through our predictive analytics and modeling we\u2019ve done. As we were building out whether we thought we hit the sweet spot or not and at least as of today, everything continues to be in the green status meaning positive status for now. We\u2019ve maintained a cautious outlook though until we can get through second quarter at this point because so much volume comes in, in April and May. A.J. Rice - UBS: Okay. And maybe just -- I'm sorry. Joe Swedish : One other wrinkle might be helpful because we are still tallying related to the post-February 15th and we are witnessing about a 90% premium pay relative to the enrollment capture, which I think is very strong and I think we've settled out on that number at the moment. So, I think that might help you in terms of envisioning where enrollment might land regarding April 15th. A.J. Rice - UBS: Yeah. That\u2019s great. And maybe just one follow-up, Joe, WellPoint is often in the press, you talked about various potential scenarios, acquisition wise and otherwise you guys seem to be doing well under the integration of the Amerigroup at this point, obviously you got a complex year. What's your view on looking at transactions to help build up some of the areas you\u2019ve identified that you want to build up? Joe Swedish : Yeah. Good question. At IR day, I emphasized that last year\u2019s effort certainly going into this is all about stabilization of the company. And I underscored the belief that going forward, we're really keening on transformation of the enterprise, reaching out to some initiatives and strengthening some long-standing commitments we\u2019ve made to the market. Our sense is that we've got a very strong base to work off of and obviously we're now going forward, observing about possibilities, no specifics obviously but we certainly are observant and we believe we can continue to grow our position with what we've got and we may look at further opportunities going into the future. A.J. Rice - UBS: All right. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold from Cowen. Please go ahead. Christine Arnold - Cowen: Good morning. In your assumptions now, you were assuming that the non-deductibility of the health insurance fee will be collected in Medicaid and how much did you collect in health insurance, C&A and revenue this quarter and how might that change going forward? Joe Swedish : So, Christine, first, in terms of the non-deductibility of the fee relative to Medicaid, the vast majority of the states have now, either in writing or verbally committed to covering that fee. However, as we've said previously, we believe that it is prudent to not recognize that fee and so you can see the all-in rates because we think ultimately rates are fungible and fees are fungible. So while we've included some of this in our first quarter, in our outlook, I will tell you it is less than a nickel at this point in time. So, I think we saw the reasonable amount of modest upside as we see the all-in rates that they imply that would point to trend and a true gross up. Christine Arnold - Cowen: And $0.25 to $0.35 would probably be the gross ups to less than a nickel of $0.25 to $0.35, is that what you think about it? Joe Swedish : It\u2019s a reasonable proxy. Christine Arnold - Cowen: And then in small group, you said that you have less than expected enrollment. You had more lapses but it was offset by some other factors. Could you just highlight that and I miss that? Thank you. Joe Swedish : Yeah, what was interesting is for all the areas that I performed on membership, the one that was a little surprising was the level of small group membership that actually no longer provided coverage post-January 1. So our early renewals were successful but for those, post that day, once the exchanges got up and running, we saw really -- we missed our expectations in some of the small group in the quarter. From our perspective, we expected that to occur at some point in time. In fact, it occurred sooner was a little surprising but nonetheless we like the fact that our positioning on the exchanges is what is. It was more than offset though by a large group in and of itself in the exchanges. Christine Arnold - Cowen: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America : Hey. Just -- maybe want to follow-up on the small group point there. One of your competitors talked a lot about how they were seeing disruptions in the city of New York and I guess, maybe it\u2019s where the pockets as well. Just wanted to hear your thoughts about your expectations for small group margins and I know you\u2019ve already talked about $200 million plus of margin compression this year. Wanted to understand whether that was focused in a couple of states specifically or whether that was a broad-based trend? Joe Swedish : Kevin, good morning. In terms of the small group margin compression either through moving to the exchanges or no longer purchasing with us, we have that pretty much of the broad-based trend across all of our states and in fact that\u2019s what we are seeing. Relative to the State of New York, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any secret that the past, several years prior to this year we\u2019ve indicated we felt that was a challenging market for anybody to get actuarial sound rates and make a profitable return. So the comments about an aggressive market there are nothing new to that particular market. We play very small in that market and we have only around 25,000 small group members in total there so. And that\u2019s about half of what we finish the year at. So clearly the membership there is moving, but we are okay with that because until it actually improves, we really don\u2019t want to be an active participant. Wayne DeVeydt :  Wayne, we exited in New York to a degree in 2012 and I guess we are holding firm where we are in a very deminimis position. Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America : Okay. And just one quick follow-up. I think you mentioned PBT was modest in the quarter, do you have an actual number there? Joe Swedish : Yes. I would tell you while modest I don\u2019t think it actually benefited the quarter at all. What I mean by that is, we exited our high-single-digit margin for adverse deviation that we typically record. It came in modestly better than that. But we believe we\u2019ve reestablished it all as of March 31, and so we can see further development on the underlying book. And I think that\u2019s evidenced in the DCP being up over 5.5 days. So we think the quarter did not benefit from any development. Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America : Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Barclays. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin - Barclays: Hi, thanks. Good morning. So I wanted to follow up on the individual bookings, just sort of help to understand the churn there. I know sort of a 95,000 lives sequentially increased, but I don\u2019t believe that tells much of a story. So I am just curious what new sales were versus what lapses were. It sounds like obviously 400,000 in the exchanges, but that seems like a relatively low number. I think you\u2019re saying 600 total. We have you guys at almost 400,000 California alone. So I just want to make I understand all the moving pieces in the individual book. Wayne DeVeydt : Hey, Josh, good morning. Let me first state that I think we\u2019ve taken a prudently cautious outlook on the exchange membership that hopefully will prove to be more of a low bar when we talk about the 600,000 members. Recognize that a lot of the volume that we got came in, in the last two weeks of March and a lot of it came in, in the first two weeks of April. Note that membership does not have an effective date till May 1 though. So from our standpoint until we can see that each of those members that we got an application on actually converts to a paying member. We are going to go ahead and maintain maybe a lower bar in their outlook. Now if it converts at the rate that Joe has said that we\u2019ve started to see which is closer to 90%, we will outperform that greater than 600,000 exchange base numbers. So I think all-in, when you look at the mix, we are off exchange, but metal products were quite strong as well in the roughly 400,000 plus range. So you are looking at almost 1 million what I call metal based members and then the delta represents that which was grandfathered in existing products. Unfortunately we cannot tell you if a member was previously uninsured or not. We just know that we are winning a lot of new members and whether they had coverage previously as this point we do not know. Josh Raskin - Barclays: You know how many were previously WellPoint members? Wayne DeVeydt : Well, we clearly know who was or wasn\u2019t a member, but until we see all these applications we recently received push back, it\u2019s hard for us to give you a definitive figure at this point. Josh Raskin - Barclays: Okay, got. And maybe a quick follow-up on the exchanges, have you guys thought about 2015 and what you are going to do from rate? It doesn\u2019t sound like you are going to have all your information before you have to get the rate. So I am curious if you think there will be significant rates increases or it really sounds like maybe pricing is where you thought it should be. Wayne DeVeydt : Again, we are really pleased with our strategy and the affirmation of our pricing strategy relative to what we built. We actually feel like we have more data to go into \u201915 pricing than we did going into \u201914 and we\u2019ve got validation. And we see the areas where we need to tweak on the fringes now based on getting into the market early and with the market share we have. So I think if you were to talk to our actuarial team Josh, they would tell you that we feel really good about moving into new market. What we can\u2019t control is what competitors do, but we really like our chances. And we think because we get the sweet spots, there will be less volatility in pricing for our members than there would be for others. Josh Raskin - Barclays: We should think about commercials at 6% cost trend you guys or 6.5% we should think about that as representative of exchange trend as well? Wayne DeVeydt : Yes, I mean, it\u2019s a reasonable proxy for medical trend in general. Josh Raskin - Barclays: Okay, perfect. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse : Thanks. Good morning. You talked about change to seasonal earnings pattern a few times in your prepared remarks. And I think when you updated guidance about a month ago, you said you expected fairly even distribution each quarter and that was sort of implied closer to 9.20 EPS number for the year just based on the 1Q results. So, is that fair, or is there some sort of pull forward in 1Q that\u2019s changed how you are thinking about the quarterly progression? Wayne DeVeydt : First of all, I think it\u2019s important to recognize that the reason for some of the smoothing now relates to ACA related products where you were forced to move up what the actuarial valuation would be for the products offer. So you have in some cases smaller deductible or smaller copay in the first quarter than you would have seen in historical products, which allowed you to earn more in the first quarter historically versus now you earn less but more straight line. Additionally, keep in mind the reinsurance does not kick in until 45,000, and so you are bearing most of the cost early in the quarter this year, but towards the end of the year you will bear less of those costs for those that exceed reinsurance thresholds. So that just a simple factor of why we think it\u2019s more smooth. That being said, that outlook hasn\u2019t changed for us. The one reason I wouldn\u2019t run rate first quarter though is keep in mind that we know that storms had to play some positive factor right and we can do a variety of model giving us a variety of outcomes, but we definitely don\u2019t believe that all of that would necessarily run rate, but we are encouraged with our underlying results. As we said at IR Day, if we can get through 2Q and this trend continues, then I think our guidance would prove to be conservative. Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse : Okay, fair enough. And then just the follow-up, are you seeing any acceleration in script trends. I guess just overall or within the exchange or Medicaid expansion population at this point, any specific categories worth highlighting? And again maybe how comfortable you are on the pricing side relative to your exchange premiums and/or the Medicaid expansion rates that you are seeing within your territories? Thanks. Wayne DeVeydt : We\u2019ve seen modest acceleration in script trends, but I think it\u2019s important to recognize too for example on exchanges we expected acceleration in script trends, and in some ways the exchanges are so early but coming in slightly better than the acceleration we expected. Really have to see you guys is the biggest issue right now, and I think it\u2019s the watch item for the industry. We think we\u2019ve provided adequate coverage by including an incremental $100 million in our outlook and it\u2019s the one area that we feel we have a responsibility as an industry to help control cost for the consumer and we plan to be very focused on that. And the other thing I would simply say is the unit price as a pass-through fee for us. So as other industries are getting their taxes and from the ACA those taxes relatively being passed on to us, which ultimately get passed on to the consumers. And so while we are seeing rising prices there, I do not think we expected much there to occur. Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs : Yes. If I could just circle back to the recovery of the tax impact of the insurer fee, am I correct going back to regional guidance that you had none of that impact baked in for the commercial side of the business, nor Medicaid? I know you discussed Medicaid, but on the commercial side that seemed to be worth something upwards of $0.65. Is that something that you don\u2019t expect to realize this year, or is that potential upside? Wayne DeVeydt : Hi, Matt. I think the best way to answer this on the commercial front was to the extent that our membership can exceed our expectations that additional member incrementally begins the recovery of that non deductibility of the tax. We\u2019re out of the gate strong. We are raising our membership outlook. We hope that proves to be conservative. And if it does, in theory, we will begin to cut into the nondeductible tax, which would also be upside. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs : And just a related question if I could. You touched on the attrition in small group and the growth in large group. On the large group side, is that primarily reflecting account wins, are you little bit question I am getting at, are you seeing increased uptake of coverage by employees that you might attribute to the ACA? Wayne DeVeydt : I think what I would highlight in that right now more in large group is retention solid, sales have been solid with expectations, probably the more beneficial items has been the inflection point we talked about in Investor Day about four or five weeks ago around the level of in group change has really moderated. And so while we had been assuming that we will continue to see negative netting group change, we didn\u2019t really see that in the first quarter. Now we are going to continue to maintain an outlook that\u2019s cautious for that to occur, but I think what we are finding is we got good retention, we got good sales and it appears that the layoffs have substantially declined a large group employers. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dave Windley - Jefferies: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on Josh\u2019s question around exchange and price for next year. I just wanted to make sure I understand that Wayne you are basically saying that you don\u2019t think that there will be an inflationary impact from things like uptake in insurer fee, lower support from 3Rs, broader network requirements, those types of things. I guess I was interested in what you think the impact of those things will be on top of what underlying trend might influence price increase? Wayne DeVeydt : Dave, yes, thanks for the question. Let me please clarify. There will clearly be an uptick for each of those items. The response to Josh simply to say that you\u2019re starting point is just what underlying trend will most likely in like and today we are at 6.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. There is no reason to believe that wouldn\u2019t continue. Items that I think would obviously impact pricing further are going to be the fact that the ACA fee increases next year for us and for other industries and those become ultimately pass-throughs. Clearly have seen if it continues based on our new outlook at the level that it is at that would be something that would have to be adding in as well. But we do think with the size of our book and the positive younger age as we\u2019ve seen coming in that that could be a muted utilization and folks are expecting going into next year, but there are many other factors beyond just trend that we think are going to meaningfully impact rate increases. Dave Windley - Jefferies: So as your expectations then likely to be into the double digits and what were your thoughts relative to rate review? And I guess President Obama is meaningless, insurance commissioners lately to encourage them to scrutinize the rates pretty aggressively. Wayne DeVeydt : Yes. I would say it\u2019s not an easy one to answer because it\u2019s going to vary by market, by product. I think that every commissioner has an obligation to ensure that the rates are reasonable and appropriate and we have an obligation to ensure we are driving the most affordable product for the member. So the pricing will ultimately be reflective of what require to cover and if we require to cover more and require to bear more cost, then the rates will reflect that. Dave Windley - Jefferies: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg from Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on hepatitis C again, can you give us a sense for how the expenses were allocated by business segment, commercial, Medicaid, Medicare in the quarter? And when you think about them going forward, is there one area where you are most concerned over the balance of the year? Thanks. Joe Swedish : Thank you. Good morning again. March pattern for fully insured claims was roughly 40% Commercial, 35% Medicaid and 25% Medicare and this does match our revenue mix. So on expense basis, the distribution is about, maybe a half commercial, half government and then when we adjusted from Medicare portion paid by CMS. So it\u2019s within government Medicaid having a largest share of that both. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna: Okay. And then just one quick follow-up here. On the Medicaid membership growth of about 121,000 in the quarter? Do you know how much of that was sort of ACA expansion-related growth versus just sort of what I would call core growth? Thanks. Joe Swedish : Yeah. Chris, the majority of that was some early expansion, obviously, there are some of the new markets such as Kentucky and that we expected to come a little slower. The item that we can\u2019t gauge right now, although we\u2019re getting very positive feedbacks is that the ACA expansion growth that is in the pipeline with the space right now is quite substantial. And so, we are going to see much more that coming through and then a lot of the other expansion growth that we did this year actually kind of phases and as the year go. So in Medicaid, we actually expect our membership to ramp up from the current level of 122,000 roughly sequential growth to get much closer to that 400,000 to 500,000 level we\u2019ve talked about previously. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna: Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank : Thanks. First question, just wondering if you had a breakdown just within your silver members, what percentage of those are eligible for cost sharing subsidies at less than 250% of FPL as compare to those that are above? And just whether you\u2019ve made some assumptions around whether you expect to see different utilization patterns amongst that cohort of members as compared to those that aren\u2019t eligible for our cost sharing subsidies? Joe Swedish : Yeah. So relative to that about 80% of the members were eligible to some degree of the subsidy, is what we\u2019ve saw. I would say Scott that our pricing was assumed not just by metal level but as you know in the metals we do have, we saw rating bands and age bands and so. It varies very much by segment. But, again, I would say, all in, as we try to carve the data down by market into the different segments that we looked at and we did evaluate whether subsidy eligibility would have different outcome. But I think probably the most optimistic thing I can say is the risk pool and the product selection seems to be coming in in the manner that we had hoped it would. And again, I really want to see second quarter because of the volume of applications that will affect 2Q and make sure that converts before we officially say that we've got it all right, but it's very encouraging right now. Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Then just I had a follow-up question, just interest in your thoughts on how the co-ops have been pricing in the market and just interested from your perspective, since you are expecting WellPoint could have the 3% to 5% positive margins and are actually booking payables in some of your markets, if the co-ops ended up taking a big [bath] (ph) in the exchanges in terms of their profitability? How would that affect their consumption of the 3R\u2019s and would that be an issue in terms of potentially increase in the payable that WellPoint after actually put in to the risk quarters? Joe Swedish : Scott, it\u2019s a good question. Unfortunately, has a lot of hypothetical. So, I\u2019ll talk about what I can say or know at this point. We\u2019re following the law and the way the calculation play out in the 3R\u2019s. I will tell you the amount we had to accrue the payable is so de minimis that will pay nobody out. We are within our 3% to 5% targeted range, slightly over the few markets which is why we put the very small payable. Relative to co-op pricing in the market, not, when we see one co-Operator, we only see once, so this is not meant to be broad speaking, but I think it's fair to say there are some co-ops that we do not understand the pricing and we don\u2019t know how economically it will work for them as time progresses. And so from our perspective, it's important to recognize that because of revenue neutrality and we think the market get smarter as each year passes by the data that the probability of money being paid in the pool actually gets less and non-enhance over the next several years. And so, I'm not sure there\u2019s going to be much in the kitty to begin with this year if anything when it said and done. And I would be -- I would personally be cautious against believing there will be anything in the kitty in the out years. Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte from Leerink. Please go ahead. Ana Gupte - Leerink: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to follow-up again on the membership that you\u2019ve offered for the quarter, if you could just elaborate on the $1.1 million loss since the fully insured? How much of that is coming from that New York State account that shifted to self insured and what does that mean for your small group membership at this point? I think you had $1.85 million and you\u2019d mentioned potentially booking or including $200 million of EBIT loss in your guidance for the year. I just want to understand how other pieces are fitting together? Joe Swedish : Yeah. Good morning Ana. The fully insured $1.1 million loss that I saw is all due to the conversion of New York ASO. So from out perspective, we have had very strong growth in maintaining our book and then growing. In terms of the small group margin loss or EBIT loss that we expected in the year, it is more than the $200 million that we talked about it at IR Day that we expected. It\u2019s actually going a little bit higher than that, but as I said early, we recapturing the vast majority of that back in exchanges and other area. I would say that, a big portion of the headwind we expect in that business. We anticipated they will incur this year and in fact is incurring this year and a more they continues to incur will actually create less of the headwind in future years for us . So we\u2019re actually not discouraged by it. Ana Gupte - Leerink: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. So would it means that you\u2019ve already booked it in the first quarter and it would minimize the headwind for \u201915. And just another follow-up is, if I\u2019m understanding this right, you have I think a pretty small increase in the individual book right now 100,000. Does that include your off-exchange and on-exchanges, and if so, even if you\u2019re only booking 600,000 in public exchanges, why is your net increase only about a 100k. The blues seem to be pretty positive about the off-exchange growth of that, if I look correctly? Joe Swedish : Thanks. A couple of things to keep in mind, while we\u2019ve grown by what is only a 100,000 net in individual, keep in mind that\u2019s essentially retaining the vast majority of our existing book, plus adding to that book. More importantly, it does not include membership enrollment post February 15. So you should see a 150,000 plus more members coming in, if not 200,000 plus more members in the next two months that would get added to that number. And then finally, the one thing it's very hard to model right now is what will happen with small group attrition throughout the year or even the broader economy and if layoff start to pick up again or small group of trips faster than we expected, those lives end up having what we call a life changing event, which allows them then to still go back and enroll in the exchanges. So the one piece I can\u2019t answer for you is how much more of a net additive will be in this year. We\u2019ve taken a cautious view of that for now, but if that actually picks up, I can still see the membership really start tracking well above the 2 million plus lives for the year on individual. Ana Gupte - Leerink: Okay. Got it. So basically what you\u2019re saying is the 1.3 million to 1.4 million membership increases contributor in your guidance. Joe Swedish : Yes. Ana Gupte - Leerink: Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : And your final question today comes from the line of Andrew Schenker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Claire Diesen - Morgan Stanley : Hi, this is Claire in for Andy. Thanks for the question. Just a quick one here on the commercial and specialty MLR commentary in the release. You mentioned it was stable year-to-year. I thought we would have seen some improvement given the inclusion of the industry fee and potentially some benefit from weather. Is there anything going on in that space that is worth highlighting and how do that ramp versus your expectations? Thanks. Joe Swedish : Thanks Claire. I appreciate the question. First thing, it was actually better than our expectations in the quarter. The biggest thing I can point to though to why you\u2019re not seeing as much improvement, as we thought it wasn\u2019t a prudent thing to maintain a stronger balance sheet in this quarter until we give the second quarter. As we said at IR Day, it\u2019s important to get to 2Q for you really start understanding the results. And we think we can show that to our investors as you can see the DCP is up 5.5 days and the underlying cash flow is quite strong related to that DCP. Okay. Well, thank you for your questions. In closing, let me reiterate a few key messages I like you to take away from this call. A better than expected first quarter results reflect our strong position in the managed care industry, benefits we are seeing from our strategic investments and our intense focus on execution. We made substantial investments to enhance the depth and breadth of our experience, as well as to improve our responsiveness to the needs of our customers. The addition of Marty Silverstein which was previously announced as Chief Strategy Officer and today's appointments of Pete Haytaian and Tom Zielinski continue that momentum. Recall the IR Day thing. You don't know what you don't know about us because we\u2019ve not told you. With that backdrop, let me summarize. We\u2019re off to a strong start in 2014, supporting an increase in our earnings guidance for the year. Perhaps most important though is that we have executed on our commitments. We told you we would make operational improvements and we have. We told you we would manage capital prudently and we have. We said we\u2019d be a winner on the exchanges and we are. I hope you see them when this management team tells you they will do something we follow through. I want to thank everybody for dissipating on our call this morning. Operator, please provide the call replay instructions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 11 AM Eastern Time today through May 14.

Please go ahead. Doug Simpson : Good morning and welcome to WellPoint\u2019s Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. This is Doug Simpson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Presenting this morning are Joe Swedish, President and CEO; Wayne DeVeydt, EVP and CFO. Joe will start with the discussion of our Q2 2014 financial results as well as the macro backdrop, and then Wayne will review the quarter\u2019s financial highlights in more detail and update you on our 2014 outlook. Q&A will follow Wayne\u2019s remarks. During the call this morning, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at wellpoint.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of WellPoint. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in today\u2019s press release and in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Joe. Joe Swedish : Thank you, Doug, and good morning. We\u2019re pleased to report strong second quarter results, which build upon the strength of our first quarters and positions us for an improved EPS outlook for the full year. We\u2019re making substantial progress toward our strategic goals and we are seeing the benefits of our diversified platform and leading cost structure manifest in our financial results. Our organic membership growth has improved meaningfully this year and we\u2019ve made further inroads with our provider collaboration strategy to drive an improved quality and cost of care for our customers. We grew by another 328,000 members in the second quarter driven by contributions from both the public exchanges and the Medicaid expansion. Demonstrating the reception of our value proposition in the marketplace, we\u2019ve now added 1.6 million new members served so far in 2014, representing growth of 4.5% versus year-end 2013. Our growth has been balanced in 2014 with contributions from national accounts and the public exchanges in our commercial segment as well as Medicaid expansion activity in our government segment. In Q2, our public exchange growth came in above earlier expectation reaching 769,000 members at the end of Q2. We\u2019ve also added 446,000 Medicaid members in 2014. Looking ahead, we continue to see meaningful, long-term opportunities to grow our customer base across our commercial and government segments. We expect 2014 will prove to be the first year of a multiyear opportunity to grow through continued growth of public exchanges as well as Medicaid expansion and new world [ph] opportunities. In addition, dual eligible pilots have started to roll out in Virginia and Los Angeles County and we expect further activity over the next 12 months in this area. We will remain disciplined with our product design and pricing strategy to drive affordability to the largest potential customer base. We must also continue to ensure that we appropriately cover our forward view of medical cost trend to enhance product stability for our customers. Now delving into second quarter results. We are very pleased with our Q2 results with solid contributions from both our commercial and government division. Specifically in the second quarter, we reported earnings per share of $2.56 on a GAAP basis and $2.44 on an adjusted basis. Our GAAP EPS and adjusted EPS decreased from the second quarter of 2013, reflecting a change in the mix of our product portfolio and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. However, our second quarter results do compare favorably to our initial expectations. We also generated higher than expected operating cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion brining our year-to-date cash flow to approximately $2.5 billion. We\u2019ve remained focused on our capital deployment strategies, repurchasing an additional 8.2 million shares during the quarter for approximately $814 million and paying $120.5 million dividends. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 22.6 million shares or 7.7% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the year for approximately $2.1 billion at a weighted average share price of $92.10. Turning to our business segment performance, our commercial business had a solid quarter as we executed our public exchange strategy. With contributions from continued growth and public exchanges, commercial was able to maintain membership levels after the robust growth seen in Q1. Commercial revenues grew 1.7% year-over-year to nearly $10 billion even with the previously announced funding conversion of the New York State account which impacts revenues by about $2 billion a year. Commercial operations declined as expected from 9.7% a year ago to 9.2% in the second quarter of 2014 due to our SG&A investment spending and the changing mix of business as we have discussed with you previously. Similar to Q1, in our commercial business, our large group and exchange base membership trends in the quarter remain favorable while a small group remain under enrolment pressure. Individual memberships stood at over 2 million members at the end of the second quarter 2014, up a net 172,000 members during the quarter from open enrolment. Year-to-date, our total individual enrolment is up 267,000 members. The implementation of our public exchange strategy is progressing well and provides a foundation for future commercial risk membership growth opportunities over the coming years. To update you on the various metrics, we added 769,000 individual members on the public exchanges through midyear, which was above our expectation of at least 600,000 we laid out on our first quarter conference call. The general characteristic of exchange applicants including average age, continue to track well versus our expectation. Product selection and benefit levels have also been consistent with expectation. We\u2019ve been executing on our exchange rollout and have managed our exchange inventories in the second quarter through our planned levels. The paid claims trends thus far are encouraging. But we recognize it remains early in the year as many of these new members only joined our enrolment rolls in May. Therefore, we continue to take a prudent view of our reserves in line of the potential uncertainties associated with this membership and expect to gain more information as this block contours in the Q3 and Q4. We continue to account for risk quarters and risk adjustments at being a net zero impact for us in 2014 as we have discussed before and as reflected in our outlook. As we discussed last quarter, with respect to our small group business, we continue to be mindful of the potential for employer coverage changes in light of the exchanges as we did see Q2 small group member decline above our expectations. Small group has now shed 218,000 members year-to-date and stands at 1.63 million members. These dynamics are reflected in our outlook. In our local group business, we were pleased to have recently been awarded the contract for the New York Hotel trade which added 74,000 members on 7-1-14. In the State of Kentucky employees which will add roughly 240,000 members effective 1-1-15. We do expect to lose some enrolment in the State of Georgia accounted 2015 due to carrier additions on that contract. But we believe our service levels and our cost of peer advantage leave us well-positioned for member retention and expect this will prove manageable in the broader context. Finally, we\u2019re roughly midway through the national account selling season and we feel good about our momentum in the market as our ability to improve healthcare affordability is resonating with customers. It\u2019s early to peg a specific enrolment expectation for 2015. But we do expect to be a modest net grower again in 2015. While the number of contracts after bid [ph] in 2015 is below that of the year ago, our competitive position remains strong. We believe we are well positioned for what we expect to be a ramp up in activity among national accounts as we look out to 2015. Now turning to the government business segment. Our government business division had 326,000 members in the quarter driven by strong growth in Medicaid and generated revenues of $8.3 billion, up approximately 7.4% quarter-over-quarter. The government business represented 45% of our consolidated operating revenues in the quarter as our business continues to evolve and diversify. Medicaid enrolment was up an additional 325,000 members in the second quarter, bringing year-to-date growth 446,000 members. We expect to continue growing Medicaid enrolment throughout the year driven by our recent RFP wins in Florida, Kentucky, Georgia and California as well as the ACA-driven expansion. We\u2019re raising our enrolment outlook for expansion members from 300,000 to 400,000 previously reported up to 400,000 to 500,000. As a result, we\u2019re raising our total Medicaid enrolment outlook from 400,000 to 500,000 previously up to 500,000 to 600,000. As expected, Medicare enrolment was relatively stable in Q2 with a gain of 3,000 members. Government operating margins improved 10 basis points year-over-year to 3.8% reflecting continued medical cost management efforts and an improvement in expense efficiency. Both Medicaid and Medicare margins track favorably relative to initial expectations. Our government business is growing along multiple fronts with the implementation of several recent go-live situations in New Jersey, Florida and Kentucky as well as dual-eligible pilots that will continue to grow in late 2014 and into 2015. Looking ahead, in addition to Medicaid expansion, we continue to see substantial RFP opportunity for new business over the next year. We currently see a universe of opportunity of nearly $40 billion in contracts to be awarded by yearend 2015. While we do not comment on individual markets, we remain optimistic in our ability to gain meaningful net new business from these opportunities. Dual-eligible programs have now started to launch with Virginia going live at the start of Q2 and we currently have roughly 5,000 members enrolled in that market. We also currently serve nearly 3,000 additional dual-eligible members in Los Angeles County which went live on July 1, 2014. We currently expect New York, Texas and the remaining counties in California to commence in early 2015. So on the back of a strong second quarter and a strong first half overall, we are updating our 2014 financial outlook this morning. We now expect adjusted earnings per share of greater than $8.60 for the full year 2014, reflecting stronger enrolment and margin trends. We\u2019re also raising our cash flow outlook which Wayne will discuss in more detail in a moment. We believe this is a prudent outlook in light of the dynamic nature of our markets and the potential for further changes in the regulatory framework. It is early to offer any specifics on our 2015 outlook other than to say our goal is certainly to grow earnings over our current 2014 outlook driven by incremental contributions from new membership in both our commercial and government segments. We will update you as the year progresses as we refine our views on enrolment and any timing issues and competitive landscape, rates and cost trend. To conclude, we are pleased with our Q2 performance and we remain optimistic about our future growth opportunities across both our commercial and government business provisions. We remain focus on executing against these opportunities while remaining disciplined stewards of shareholder capital. With that, I\u2019ll now turn it over to Wayne. Wayne DeVeydt : Thank you, Joe, and good morning. My comments today will focus on the key financial highlights from the second quarter of 2014. I\u2019ll also provide an update on the 2014 outlook. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.56 for the second quarter of 2014. These results included net benefits of $0.12 per share reflecting net investment gains of approximately $0.13 per share partially offset by $0.01 per share of debt extinguishment expense recorded in the quarter. Excluding these items, our adjusted EPS totaled $2.44 for the quarter. These results were favorable to our initial expectation and as Joe noted, we are pleased with how 2014 has progressed so far. Medical enrolment grew by 328,000, a 0.9% sequentially to approximately 37.3 million medical members as of June 30th. This reflected membership gains in our Medicaid and individual business partially offset by declines in small group and some modest [ph] in group change in national during the quarter. Operating revenue exceeded $18.2 billion in the quarter, an increase of approximately $738 million or 4.2% versus the second quarter of 2013 driven by enrolment growth in our commercial and government business. Revenue growth versus Q2 \u201813 was adversely impacted by the previously discussed impact of the transition of the State of New York account from fully insured to self-funded on January 1st. The benefit expense ratio was 82.7% in the second quarter of 2014, a decrease of 120 basis points from the prior year quarter and favorable to our initial expectations. The decline reflected continued strong medical management and the impact of the premium revenue designed to help cover new healthcare reformed fees, partially offset by changes in our earnings pattern we have discussed previously. We are pleased with gross margin performance in both of our businesses in the quarter and first half. And we are improving our MLR outlook for the year from 83.7% plus or minus 30 basis points to 83.5% plus or minus 30 basis points. For the full year 2014, we continue to expect underlying local group medical cost trend to be in the range of 6.5% plus or minus 50 basis points with a bias towards the lower half of that range. Our SG&A expense ratio increased by 190 basis points from 2Q of 2013 as expected due to the inclusion of various healthcare reform fees in 2014 and continued spending in preparation for ACA-driven market changes. Consistent with our best practice, we have included a roll forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning\u2019s press release. For the six months ended June 30, 2014, we experienced favorable prior year reserve development of $525 million which was modestly better than our expectation. Development was consistent with the prior year debate period. We continue to maintain our upper single-digit margin for adverse deviation and believe our reserve balance remains consistent and strong as of June 30, 2014. Days and claims payable was 44.8 days as of June 30th, up 0.6 days from 44.2 days as of March 31st and up 6.1 days compared from 38.7 days at the end of 2013. We expect DCP levels will come down over the next several quarters as our public exchange business further matures. Our debt to capital ratio is 37.8% at June 30, 2014 down from 38.2% at March 31st and up from 36.9% from yearend 2013. We ended the second quarter with approximately $2.1 billion of cash investments at the parent company. And our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of $1.2 billion as of June 30th. We generated stronger than expected operating cash flow of $1.1 billion in the second quarter or 1.5 times net income. On a year-to-date basis, we generated operating cash flow of approximately $2.5 billion, roughly 1.7 times net income. We continue to expect cash flow timing to remain volatile, partially reflecting the timing of the exchange base enrolment this year and the timing of payments related to health insurer fee and the 3Rs. That said, cash flow trends in the first half of 2014 have been encouraging. We repurchased more than 8.2 million shares for approximately $815 million during the quarter. This is on a weighted average price of $98.99. As of June 30th, we had approximately $1.6 billion of board approved repurchase authorization remaining which we intend to utilize over a multiyear period subject to market conditions. We used $120.5 million during the quarter for our cash dividend. And yesterday, the audit committee declared our third quarter dividend to shareholders. Turning to our 2014 outlook, as Joe noted, we currently expect adjusted EPS to be greater than $8.60 in 2014. The increase in our full year outlook reflects a stronger operating income outlook due to the stronger moment and continued medical management and expense controls. We are raising our enrollment outlook. And now expect enrollment in 2014 to grow by 1.4 million to 1.5 million members. The 37.05 million to 37.15 million by year end 2014. We\u2019re also raising our cash flow forecast to greater than $2.7 billion for the full year. Note, that we do expect cash flow for Q3 to be negative as a result to defining of [ph] payments related to the insurer fee and taxes which are due in September. We believe our updated outlook is reasonable as remains early in the year in which the industry is undergoing substantial change and our bias it to maintain a prudent stand in this dynamic environment. We may choose to opportunistically refinance certain debt if market conditions are favorable as the year progresses, such activity could result in onetime cost not included in our current guidance. Finally, we\u2019ve not yet made a decision on providing a cash EPS metric that some of our peers have. This is the metric we are considering adopting in 2015 to enhance comparability versus our peer group. In the mean time, we just remind you that our outlook reflects approximately $210 million of intangible asset, amortization expense in 2014 related to prior acquisitions including EMEA group [ph]. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Joe. Joe Swedish : Thanks Wayne. With that, operator, please open the queue for questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Justin Lake from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Justin Lake \u2013 JP Morgan : Thanks. Good morning. First question is on medical cost trend. I know you reaffirmed guidance here. But curious where you see yourself currently within that range and whether you\u2019re seeing any near-term data points indicating a pickup in trend given recent hospital reports? Joe Swedish : Hey, Justin, good morning. Relative to that range, our bias is to the lower half of that range. It\u2019s important to recognize that we obviously would be closer to the low-end of that range but it would not be [ph] for the incremental cost that we\u2019ve included for our outlook on hep C drugs for the year. So I would say, core trend is running well versus those expectations. And even inclusive of hep C cost, our bias is towards the lower half of that range. Justin Lake \u2013 JP Morgan : Any near-term data points on scripts prior authorizations, things like that that would indicate that maybe we\u2019re seeing a pickup here? Joe Swedish : Nothing of concern Justin. If you look at the drug script volume that I think many of you have seen, it really commence rates with the volume just coming in from the ACA, both the Medicaid expansion and the exchange live [ph] that are coming in. So nothing surprising there. When we look at our bed days per thousand [ph] as well as the length of stay per thousand by line of business, I would say in all areas, they\u2019re playing well versus expectation. Justin Lake \u2013 JP Morgan : Great. And then just thinking ahead, I know how \u201815 specifically, but usually around this time of year, you\u2019re able to help us out, just thinking about kind of headwinds, tailwinds for next year. So Wayne, can you \u2013 maybe you can lay some of those out for us? Wayne DeVeydt : I think from a tailwind perspective Justin, clearly as you said, it is too early, but we do expect to continue to have positive momentum on a membership front. We expect to continue to grow in our commercial book as well as our government segment. Additionally, I think a fair tailwind is that we begin to get full year run rate from some of the things that took place this year. As you know, the ACA membership came in at different points throughout the year, both the Medicaid expansion, the exchange and ultimately the duo opportunities [ph], as you know, just starts to ramp up this year. So I would say from a top line growth perspective we said many reasons to see tailwinds that are there. And clearly our capital deployment will continue to be a tailwind for our investors as well. From a headwind perspective, I would really frame it up as two things that we want to continue to keep an eye on. One is the industry tax increases by 40% next year. And that\u2019s not isolated to WellPoint, that applies to the entire industry. I think one thing that\u2019s isolated to us is that the small group attrition that we model for this year, more than half of that $250 million [ph] headwinds, we think we\u2019ll be in a more accelerated timeframe over a shorter window of time, meaning this year and next year in a very longer period of time. And then \u2013 Justin Lake \u2013 JP Morgan : Great. Thanks for all the color. Wayne DeVeydt : Yes. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice \u2013 UBS: Thanks. Hello everybody. Your days and claims payable now are up six days year-to-date. Obviously you\u2019ve said, you wanted to run with a little bit of caution reserves whatever [ph] until you get a full visibility on the exchange members. Can you give us given your book of business where you think over time that claims payable days might settle out? In other words, how much is sort of contingency now for the near-term? And what\u2019s the current run rate of that given the book of business you have today? Joe Swedish : Hey, A.J. good morning. First of all, I really appreciate the question. I think over time probably a more balanced DCP is going to be somewhere in the range of more of 39 to 42 range somewhere in there. The one thing that\u2019s a little bit challenging right now as you can imagine is that, it\u2019s difficult as an industry to really assess where risk adjustments will fall out, where risk orders will fall out. And so, the one thing I want to highlight is well, we think we have a inappropriate level of conservatism for all the unknowns in our DCP, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that if in fact, our reserves come in much better than we forecast at this point, then it would all translate to a bottom line drop. And some of that would then affect the risk corridor payment. And then some of that would have to go into our rebate [ph] calculation as well. But all things being said, we\u2019re pleased with the fact that we were able to main our strong DCP levels and actually grow them in 2Q. We think it gives us a lot more flexibility than in our outlook as we continue to evaluate how these things will settle out over the remainder of the year. A.J. Rice \u2013 UBS: Okay. And maybe one follow up would be that there\u2019s been a lot of discussion about on the exchange, just that we would see aggregate signups and then we have attrition over the course of the year. More recently, there\u2019s been some discussion about maybe more are signing up because of life change events that was originally expected. Do you have any visibility on sort of what\u2019s happening post the ending of open enrollment relative to month to month membership signups? Joe Swedish : Hey, A.J. this is Joe, good morning. I appreciate the question. To maybe calibrate, we\u2019re pleased within our exchange enrollment. Just to give you a sense again, as we stated earlier, we\u2019ve added 769,000 lives year to date. And that is net of all lapses as best we can tell at the moment. Clearly as the Europe progresses we\u2019ll be monitoring it very closely. But having said that, what we\u2019ve observed thus far and what we\u2019re expecting is well within our expectations going to year end. It\u2019s still little earlier in the year to figure out exactly we\u2019re going to land. But again, we\u2019re continuing to monitor the haps progression. So that net again, I think we\u2019ve accounted for it, and it\u2019s meeting expectations. A.J. Rice \u2013 UBS: Okay. All right, thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America : Great. Thanks. I just want to go back to your comments about the RFP pipeline of $40 billion through the end of 2014, just wanted to understand, does that all new things or does that include things like New York roll out and Texas roll out? And to the extent that is that all business in your existing markets or would you consider entering into new markets that are not blues markets for you? Joe Swedish : Hi, Kevin. First of all, let me clarify the $40 billion in RFP opportunity through the end of 2015. So it\u2019s both the remainder of this year and through the end of next year. Of the $40 billion, I\u2019d say about $9 billion represents existing opportunities through a combination of [indiscernible] re-procurement or potential expansion. With the other $31 billion truly representing new opportunities for our organization. So again, I think we feel very good about the value proposition we\u2019re bringing to states. We know they\u2019re seeing that value proposition. We think it\u2019s a big reason we continue to not only be invited in the [indiscernible] process but continue to be successful. As you know last year, we went eight for eight [ph], the team continues to win in new areas. And so, we like our chances. This is probably the best way to put it on the other $31 billion as well re-procuring some of the expansion on the $9 billion. And yes, maybe let me just underscore, I think we can target probably at least six areas of pursuit for us. Obviously many of you are well known to you like the dual demo [ph] pursuit, behavioral health pursuit and a variety of aspects of this line of business. So we\u2019re targeting, we\u2019re very focused I think as Wayne pointed out, our RFP process is very sound, very competitive and we feel very optimistic about the potential in all these areas. Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America : Okay, great. And then just a question on the small group margin compression that you\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times or profit compression, it sounds like from the counter from this [ph] other companies is that they\u2019re seeing maybe less dumping than they kind of expected before. Can you just give us a little more color exactly how you\u2019re seeing the pressure, because it sounds you are seeing membership losses? But how much of it is membership losses versus actual margin compression in that business? Wayne DeVeydt : Kevin, one thing to keep in mind with the small group is we fundamentally believe that over time that that business will migrate either to an exchange-like margin while remaining in small group or migrating to an exchange-like margin because it ultimately migrates to a public exchange. And so from our perspective, it\u2019s not so much what leaves that we pick back up. It\u2019s the combination of also what stays with us and where the margins for tractions occur. The one thing that we\u2019re not concerned with because we expected this to occur over a five-year period. But we just wanted to highlight, we think that trend is going to be faster and maybe what we thought about say 12 months ago at this point in time. And so we\u2019re seeing some margin compression occur as expected and as planned in the small group book which is seeing a few more leap sooner than we had expected. But as you can see for the exchange enrolment, we\u2019ve been quite successful in picking up many of them as they go to that transition. Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America : Okay, okay. So is it going to be when you think about that from the next step from here, is it more about margin compression on that existing book or is it about dumping and potentially picking them up on the exchange? Wayne DeVeydt : I think it\u2019s both. I think you\u2019re going to see continued margin compression in the existing book as they stay in and then I think you move over [ph]. The last thing I would say, though, is that if you look at the existing book, the active cancel loss ratio is positive for us. So for those that are leaving, they\u2019d appear to be moving to the exchanges in those individuals generally with a high MLR. And so by having them actually migrate over to the exchange, when you have 3R protections outlined, it\u2019s actually a positive too. So you lose out on the migration, but you at least move them on to protected environment on t he higher risk business. Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America : Interesting. All right, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Barclays. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin \u2013 Barclays: Hi, thanks, good morning. Just following up on the small group. Wayne, could you let us know \u2013 I think you said you had it 1.63 million live in the small group currently. So I\u2019m curious what the overall margin on that is and maybe even just relative to y our overall pre-taxes in the quarters. Wayne DeVeydt : Hey Josh, good morning. We do not provide margins by business segment. I will tell you that the margins are in the single-digit range, but none in the double-digit range. And to give you at least a gauge of where they\u2019re migrating to as we said, we anticipated that if margins were to be cut in half and move to more of a what I\u2019ll call more of a exchange-like margin in the 3% to 5% range. But that would translate to $400 million plus headwind. The fact that we\u2019re incurring more than half of that headwind this year at least gives you kind of a gauge of how it\u2019s migrating from say upper single-digit down to a more lower mid single-digit range. Josh Raskin \u2013 Barclays: Okay, perfect. That\u2019s helpful. And then to sum the exchanges, I just want to understand a little bit more. It sounded like you just mentioned the 3% to 5%. Are you guy still comfortable with \u2013 and I guess there\u2019s a couple of questions in here. Are you still comfortable with that 3% to 5% margin for the full year? Are you monitoring the others? It seems like everyone else is kind of suggesting that obviously their losses are coming in bigger than expected. So is it conceivable you might actually have a payable for the 3Rs as opposed to receivable. Are you guys looking at things like that? Wayne DeVeydt : Yes, Josh, very good questions. The short answer is yes. That\u2019s part of the reason that we\u2019re booking closer to the lower end to that margin range and then maintaining the high DCP levels that we have. As the year progresses, [indiscernible] that if those preserves prove to be conservative. And our run rate that we saw in the first half continues in the second half, we would then move from that lower range of 3%, start migrating closer to 5%, but we would be giving back 50% of every dollar above 3% back into the kitty if you will for the corridor. So we think our approach leaves us hopefully nothing but upside, though, as you migrate through those different corridors if you will. But that\u2019s part of the reason for our conservative posture as of June 30th. Josh Raskin \u2013 Barclays: Okay, that makes a ton of sense. And then what do you do about pricing for \u201815 then? If you\u2019re potentially in a payable situation, are there situations where you actually may be modestly reduced \u2013 your increases or at least increase your rate less than you would have in a separate \u2013 in a different scenario? Wayne DeVeydt : Yes, I think our goal is to be competitive in the market and if it results in the fact that our pricing has a rebate to the consumer or is spanning money to a corridor that we otherwise wouldn\u2019t have to do, we\u2019d rather let the consumer have that benefit. And so our goal is to provide that enterprising and then as I think you\u2019ll see in many of our public exchange market, I think the stability in the book that we created this year is why we have rate increases that are lower than the average increase you\u2019re seeing from many of our competitors. Josh Raskin \u2013 Barclays: Okay, perfect. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold from Cowen. Please go ahead. Christine Arnold \u2013 Cowen: Good morning. Thank you for the question. Two quick questions here. With respect to the public exchange membership, you had membership that came on in the first quarter, what do you know about that membership in terms of kind of profitability and lapses? And then also on small group, are you considering refilling your non-ACA products so that those that early renewed in the fourth quarter of \u201813 can renew again in the fourth quarter \u201814? Joe Swedish : Hey, Christine, good morning. In terms of profitability and lapses, I think we would say that the things are panning slightly better than our expectations would be. Again, we priced for degree of adverse selection in the first wave that we would have expected. We saw higher MLR on the book, but not as high as what we priced for it. And so we\u2019re encouraged by that data. And we now have six months of data on that group. So that continues to be encouraging. But I think it\u2019s important to recognize too that we think there\u2019s a delayed behavior that we know we had a lot of storms in the first quarter. We know a lot of people are still understanding how to use the system. And we think it\u2019s a reason to maintain the prudent reserve outlook that we have at this point in time. In terms of early renewals, I think our strategy is to just ensure that where the law allows us to do early renewals and where we can maintain an appropriate margin and retain the member. It is fully our intent to strive to keep that strategy. Christine Arnold \u2013 Cowen: So we\u2019ll be refilling those money for your products in the small group? Joe Swedish : Yes. Christine Arnold \u2013 Cowen: Right. Joe Swedish : Christine, it\u2019s Joe. I just want to focus on three elements that I think is really important to highlight regarding our experience thus far because we\u2019ve sighted this in the past. I think it\u2019s worth underscoring yet again that we\u2019ve attracted a balance risk pool of members. And that\u2019s critically important in terms of having met our expectations in that regard. Secondly, the average age of the enrollees is also attracting very close to our expectation which kind of gives us very strong comfort that we\u2019re in a good place relative to pricing to \u201814 as well as the experience that we expected. And finally, the product selection by the enrollees has played out as expected. So when we put all that together, I think we\u2019ve landed in a very good place year-to-date. We don\u2019t expect any material change relative to that going to the end of the year. And I might add also that the grandmother strategies that we\u2019ve employed are markets specific. I think we\u2019ve been very tailored in our approach. So again, underscore yet again. I think we\u2019ve modeled this very effectively, executed very effectively. And we\u2019re expecting a good path the year-end. Christine Arnold \u2013 Cowen: Okay, thank you Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg from Susquehanna. Please go head. Chris Rigg \u2013 Susquehanna: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess the first question is that at this point have any sense or what percentage of the public exchange and roll lease were previously ensured versus uninsured? Joe Swedish : So this is Joe again. That\u2019s a tough one because as you well know, there wasn\u2019t a specific question asked that enrollees, one of their running share ensured. I think we can go to some of the publicly disclosed information around studies of the form like by the Kaiser Foundation, I think in the main are referencing something in the order of 40%, 50%, take your pick. In our circumstance, I think we\u2019re kind of landing in about the same position. So I can\u2019t give you any specifics beyond that other than I think strong guesses or assumptions based on what we\u2019re seeing. Chris Rigg \u2013 Susquehanna: Okay. And then just to follow up on some of the risk or 3R questions from earlier. So I think in the prepared remarks you said that you\u2019re really assuming risk corridor, risk adjusted sort of doesn\u2019t contribute anything for this year, but then Wayne, I think you just said you\u2019re kind of going towards the low end of the 3% to 5% range in case you have a payable. I guess I\u2019m just trying to sort of mesh those two together. If you\u2019re kind of assuming zero, why it\u2019s also assuming a lower end of the market range. Thanks. Wayne DeVeydt : Hey Chris, I appreciate the question. And I understand the complexities of this accounting and trying to describe it. But think about it with a lens that if we\u2019ve maintained a strong reserve balance sheet which we believe we have and we believe the DCPs can support and you can see the underwriting run rate looks positive along with the cash flows, by taking a zero posture on both risk corridors and risk adjusters, what it does allow us to do then that if that run rate improves, for every dollar then that we put into the kitty, we will create a payable for $0.50 on the dollar, but $0.50 on that dollar will actually drop to the bottom line then. So from a conservative posture, it\u2019s not just about how do you account for risk adjuster versus the corridor, but it\u2019s also how does that then tie-in to your ultimate balance sheet conservatism or lack thereof.] So again with the posture, we\u2019ve taken if the run rate proves that we have a margin greater than three, you are correct, I will then be able to \u2013 I will have to book a payable which may not appear to be conservative, but on the contrary it\u2019s conservative because that means I have earnings better than what I\u2019ve actually recorded year-to-date. Chris Rigg \u2013 Susquehanna: Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll from Stifel. Please go ahead. Tom Carroll \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.: Hey, thank you. So, Wayne, I just want a quick follow-up on that on your last response just in terms of the accounting for the 3Rs. So it sounds like you are building a payable but not necessarily explicit to the 3Rs that you would end up just throwing back to the system if in fact you do end up in a payable situation. But it sounds like you\u2019re putting more than you need such that some of it drops back in the form of development into next year. Is that the way to think about it? Maybe go over that one more time if you don\u2019t mind. Wayne DeVeydt : Tom, I think the way you phrased it is actually a good way to look at it, right, that there\u2019s a multitude of blankets of payables you could put up. And I think for us, like taking the most conservative posture right on the balance sheet itself is it covers you for the multiple outcomes that could occur recognizing that if that balance sheet proves to be conservative, then you will not only have potentially some liabilities but you would only have a liability commensurate with whatever upside you would have and then some. So, yes, I mean if you were asking us today, we think the balance sheet is prudently conservative for all the unknown. I think I really want to emphasize that it\u2019s prudently conservative based on all the unknowns. The cash flow would seem to imply that it could be more conservative than needed. And we want to see some of that cash flow continue in the second half. But if it does, that would argue that there could be upside to our outlook. Tom Carroll \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.: And then do you have any additional visibility on the health profile of the exchange enrolment that came in with the April, May bolus? Wayne DeVeydt : It\u2019s still early on that group as well. I would say generally though, with the younger population and what we saw in the first quarter enrolments, the second quarter was clearly younger which generally translates to a slightly healthier population. But as Joe mentioned, the key to the strategy about how we priced our book was a balanced risk pool. So we aren\u2019t necessarily viewing one member any differently than another member as long as we get a balanced risk pool. And we think that\u2019s really what the goal of the ACA was to create a balanced risk pool and we think our strategy has done that. So in general, it\u2019s a little early though on that group to declare whether they\u2019re healthier than average yet because the actual claims volume\u2019s just starting to come in on them. Tom Carroll \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.: One more admin question. Wayne, I think you mentioned \u2013 you said you had claims development of what, $525 million favorable. How does that compare to the same period last year? Is it more or less? Wayne DeVeydt : That\u2019s a really good question. On an absolute dollar basis, it looks like it\u2019s just barely below last year. But when you consider that we had fewer members at the end of last year than we did the year before and then you reflected medical trend adjustment, it\u2019s actually slightly better than our expectations. But by having a higher DCP, we believe we\u2019ve reestablished it all. Tom Carroll \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.: What was the number for last year? Wayne DeVeydt : I don\u2019t have that in front of me, Tom, but if you go to the press release \u2013 Tom Carroll \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.: Yes, I can find it. It\u2019s not materially different though. Wayne DeVeydt : \u2013 you\u2019ll see it there. But it was within less than $10 million \u2013 in fact, if you could just give me a second, I can quote it to you. Last year was $532 million, Tom, this year is $524.7 million. So you\u2019re looking at roughly a $7 million delta [ph] year-over-year. Tom Carroll \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.: Yes. Okay, thanks so much. Wayne DeVeydt : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carl McDonald from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Carl McDonald \u2013 Citigroup: Thanks. First question was just the current assumption around payment of the Medicaid industry fee and whether that contributed to the increase in guidance. Wayne DeVeydt : Hi, Carl. Yes, good question. If you remember on our first quarter call, we had assumed about $0.05 in our outlook for the year based on the positive momentum we were having. The outlook has been improved by an additional $0.05 in terms of what we\u2019re expecting there. So we have about $0.10 reflected in both first half actual as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year in total. It\u2019s important to recognize too that we\u2019re still working through the hep C situation with our states and we\u2019re expecting hopefully some relief there. And then finally though, I would say the State of Texas is the one state that we\u2019ve not factored in some of the reimbursement levels around the non-deductibility component. We believe for a sustainable model that this is really an important factor that still needs to be addressed. But we have about $0.10 for full year earnings and outlook combined. Carl McDonald \u2013 Citigroup: Great. And then coming back to the discussion around the 3Rs, just wanted to try to make a distinction between risk adjustment and the risk carter [ph]. So is it right to think if it turns out you always pick a number, $250 million of risk adjustment, 100% of that goes away versus if it\u2019s a risk carter [ph] adjustment you get to keep 50%. Is that sort of the right way to think about it? Wayne DeVeydt : Carl, this is a real fair question. And the answer is yes, that\u2019s how you would think about it. Understand, though, there\u2019s a Wakely [ph] study going on right now as well. And while the data is still somewhat immature, we have a gauge of where we think we\u2019re going to land and whether we\u2019re going to be a net receiver or net payer at this point. And again, I would tell you even on that we\u2019ve taken a conservative posture. So while there is theoretically the possibility that the study could be completely wrong and that at the end of the year we could have something swing in the complete opposite direction, we would still look at it as our DCP, our reserve balance sheet has that covered. But again, I would tell you we actually have a third party data point to point to now that would tell us that we\u2019re probably being at least prudently conservative on the risk adjuster as well. Carl McDonald \u2013 Citigroup: Got it. All right, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Yes. Hi, good morning. Just a question on back to the 3Rs for a moment. Are you expecting some tailwind in the back half of the year from the reinsurance \u2013 another company talked about GAAP limiting their ability to accrue reinsurance according to what they would expect for the full year versus simply booking what they\u2019d actually seen, where are you on that? Wayne DeVeydt : So, Matt, I would say this response to that. I cannot speak to that competitor\u2019s actual accounting practices. I can tell you though the way the accounting rules work. You will have a higher MLR earlier in the year as a result of how the reinsurance component works than you would in the back half of the year. That is a factually true statement. And so best chain dynamic is in fact playing out in how we look at it as well. But again, I can\u2019t speak to the specifics of how it may have affected their MLR consolidated. Matthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs : What about yours though, I mean is that a material factor for you in the back half? Wayne DeVeydt : It\u2019s not a material factor. I mean I think when you have a balanced risk pool like we have for us, we feel that we\u2019re going to get a very similar flow of reinsurance kind of from quarter to quarter. But again, I will tell you that to the extent somebody burns through the first 45,000 in the first half of the year, you will have a higher MLR than you will on the back half when the next 200,000 is essentially covered by reinsurance and yet you\u2019re getting premium on it. So again, accounting wise, the math makes perfectly good sense. But from our perspective, our book is pretty balanced, so we don\u2019t necessarily get a big pickup in either direction. Matthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs : And shifting gears, on question for guidance off the top of my head where you guys are on participation in the new Florida Medicaid program but to the extent you do have some visibility on how that started, can you comment on utilization or anything else that you\u2019re seeing there? Wayne DeVeydt : Yes, Matt, I would say that from our standpoint in terms of the expansion in Florida, we haven\u2019t seen anything alarming at this point. We continue to monitor and stay focused on our medical cost management. It\u2019s really early there to be honest, though. I mean you\u2019re looking at less than 60 days of experience at this point in time. But based on what we\u2019ve seen, I mean we look at drug data and other data points, we\u2019re just not seeing anything alarming. Matthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs : All right, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Thanks. I just want to follow up on some of the discussion around small group and some of the attrition that you were seeing this year. And just interested, Wayne, just we can go on through the small group rate filings for 2015 in considerable detail and we\u2019ve been seeing some of the lowest proposed increases that we\u2019ve seen in frankly maybe ever. But certainly in a number of years, particularly amongst [indiscernible] non-profits and just interested in your view on how the initial rate filings are developing in small group for 2015 and if you think that maybe what we\u2019re seeing with some of these proposed rates is the response to the attrition that\u2019s going on in small group and a reaction to try to protect those books of businesses from outgoing [ph] into the exchanges. Wayne DeVeydt : Hi, Scoot, good morning. Our experience so far on our small grade filings has been encouraging. I think as we show our regulators the basis for how we\u2019re building those filings, we\u2019re trying to make sure they understand that the risk pool is changing though, that as people lead the current small group pool and migrate to exchanges that those created a different risk pool. But in general, we\u2019re seeing a pretty good profile there. Trend was lower in \u201813 though, so I think what you saw was not fully reflected in the 2014 rates when people first priced and now I think you\u2019re really starting to see the \u201813 and \u201814 trends get reflected in the \u201815 pricing. So I think it\u2019s \u2013 when you\u2019re doing an apples to apples, I think \u201813\u2019s trend coupled with \u201814\u2019s is kind of distorting some of the \u201815 pricing. But all that being said, it would only be prudent to hang on to those members at margins that are least commensurate to or slightly better than what you would see in an exchange. And I think that is a reasonable strategy that people will deploy. Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay. And then just I had a follow-up question. Just last quarter you guys gave us sort of a mix of the hep C spending by market segment, commercial versus Medicare versus Medicaid, just interested if there was any changes in that mix. And then just overall, how the hep C spending look for 2Q relative to 1Q. Joe Swedish : Yes, Scott. Just as a reminder, we had more than doubled our hep C cost in our pricing for the current year as compared to the prior year. And then in our outlook after Q1, we had in an incremental $100 million to that outlook. I would say that hep C has pretty much played with those expectations. We\u2019re not seeing upside versus that expectation at this point in time, but we\u2019re not seeing downside. The trend in the last say four weeks seems to be coming down a bit. But we believe you\u2019ll see a spike later in the year when the new hep C drugs come back out. So I think an early indicator meaning the last four weeks or so might imply that it\u2019s a little conservative. But we actually don\u2019t think it is because we really do think there will be a spike when the new drugs hit the market. So I think net-net for all of our segments, they\u2019re playing as expected that we reported last time. And I think what you\u2019ll find is that the additional $100 million is probably going to be necessary. Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay. And the mix just still look like 40% commercial, 30% Medicaid, 25% Medicare [ph]? Joe Swedish : Yes. It\u2019s very consistent with what we had in Q1. Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dave Windley \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Hi, thanks. So in the exchange market, I think we\u2019re seeing some new entrance in the pricing that we can see some new entrance coming in lower than some of the 2014 encumbrance in some cases. Are you seeing that and can you kind of rationalize that or do you think that is in fact irrational pricing? And just be curious your thoughts on some kind of low price new entrance. Joe Swedish : Yes. I think it\u2019s a good question. This is Joe. I think that we fully expect it that there would be new entrance in the market place. So it\u2019s certainly not a surprise. And we certainly underscored that our ability and desire to compete in markets like that. We have not seen what I call irrational pricing. Certainly, there would be flex happening in pricing market to market. But does far, we haven\u2019t seen anything that would give us great concern regarding irrational pricing. Dave Windley \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Okay. Wayne, I wanted to clarify, I think you talked to maybe Tom\u2019s earlier question about PPD, did I understand you to say that you feel like you\u2019ve basically put all of the favorable prior period development back up in reserve this year. So there\u2019s no benefit to 2014 earnings that would become a headwind this 2015 year-over-year? Wayne DeVeydt : As of June 30, we believe that is the case. Dave Windley \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : (Operator instructions) Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Peter Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo : Hi, just quickly, the claims paid this year has dropped in your reserve the whole forward table [ph] to 77% down from 79% last year, can you explain why that\u2019s happening? Is that related to your rise in DCP or is there anything else going on there? Wayne DeVeydt : Part of it is related to the rise in DCP and part of it really is just related to the mass of enrollment that we saw come in with the exchanges. The other thing I would tell you Pete is receipts are coming in slower than what we\u2019ve seen historically. So we don\u2019t just track \u2013 we track the time between when a claim is actually incurred versus the day we receive it from the providers through a payment cycle. So our payment cycles are just down slightly because of our DCP metric, coupled with the fact that with the volume that we saw coming in, we wanted to make sure resources were deployed to a lot of exchange membership to get them processed timely. But as of June 30, I would tell you that everything is stabilized, the inventories are stabilized, levels are consistent with past levels. Days worked on hand for the company as a whole is generally below five. So I\u2019d say, things look pretty steady at this point. But the biggest thing has been receipt times that have [ph] slowing down in terms of when we\u2019re receiving from the provider. Dave Windley \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Okay. And then any update on our PBM contract? Wayne DeVeydt : Nothing new at this point. They continue to be a good partner. And we\u2019re looking forward to build and maintain our relationship with them. Dave Windley \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Schenker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Andrew Schenker \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Thanks switching back to Medicaid here. I was wondering if you could tell us your experiences on the expansion life [ph]? It appears the new rates cells are more than accurate to cover the cost of these populations? You just tell us what you\u2019re seeing there? Thanks. Wayne DeVeydt : I\u2019m sorry, [indiscernible] very beginning of your questions what \u2013 Andrew Schenker \u2013 Morgan Stanley : I\u2019m talking about the Medicaid expansion population, just talking about your experiences with them? Joe Swedish : Yes. So one thing just to remind our listeners is that any time we enter a new market and even the market we existed in, but due to the new lives coming in through ACA expansion, we\u2019ve always assumed that we would have a much higher MOR in our run rate MOR. Just under the simple premise that we\u2019re talking completely unmanaged population and moving them into manage care. In general, I\u2019d say, things are playing well versus those expectations. But as I tried to remind folks that much of the expansion live [ph] as you can really have not started coming on until 2Q. And so, a lot of the data we have is still relatively immature. Cash flow would imply things look pretty good, but it\u2019s really early at this point to declare victory or any concerns in either direction. But all in, our outlook assumes a higher MOR on the book, they would have had [ph] on our run rate book. Andrew Schenker \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay. And maybe just talking about the run rate books here, how was the performance been in what we call the WellPoint legacy businesses versus AGP? Are you seeing a normalization there of margins? Thanks. Joe Swedish : I would say that, Pete and the team have done an exceptional job of improving that business even faster than we have been anticipated and we are starting. We\u2019re not at what I would call, Legacy Ameri-group margin Jet [ph] But we are closing the gap much quicker and those are much improved. Andrew Schenker \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte from Leerink, Swann & Company. Please go ahead. Ana Gupte \u2013 Leerink, Swann & Company: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. So I just wanted to follow up on the commercial medical cost trend. The first question if just looking at this whole notion of the Goldilocks scenario is dead if you will in hospital, some of them are have been seeing that does the [ph] cyclical rebound in \u2013 because of the economy, I would call Wayne used to talk about negative and group attrition. And I\u2019m just wondering if in large group and potentially in self-insured, are you seeing a reversal of that trend? So possibly what the hospitals are seeing is related to more people coming into the employment pool, but you\u2019re receiving premiums and not a per capita issue? Wayne DeVeydt : Hey, Ana, good morning. Yes, what\u2019s actually interesting is we have seen net negative in group change as far as you know the previous five years. In January and February where the first two months that we actually saw net positive in group change, but surprisingly, that trend is actually flipped in 2Q. And so, we\u2019re starting to see negative again. Now, it\u2019s modest. I mean, really, really minor. I don\u2019t want to \u2013 I don\u2019t want to create an alarm that that\u2019s going the wrong direction. But I don\u2019t necessarily know that that\u2019s the biggest driver. It may have been a driver for things that happened late in Q1 that got ultimately processed and built to us by Q2. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big driver for what you\u2019re seeing in Q2. I do think that you\u2019re adding a large uninsured population into the mix now. And you\u2019re adding a large group of new Medicaid members into the mix now. And I think it\u2019s why you can see a scenario where both the MCOs and the providers are both doing well, because you just \u2013 both parties have new volume coming into this the system that didn\u2019t exist before. Ana Gupte \u2013 Leerink, Swann & Company: Okay. So mostly Medicaid and exchanges, not really anything around cyclical? Just related to that then and back to the prior development question, I think you have \u2013 you\u2019ve gotten the only [ph] big MCOs that have reported decent commercial, lots of pressure result [ph]. And I know you all do, but slightly differently. Your PYD is pretty much in lined with last year. I\u2019m must wondering if that is because you were more conservative in estimating the second half particularly in the first quarter around grand fault where they see [ph] a disruption and so on as well as what you booked for the first quarter or is there actually no uptick at all, because there is a team emerging that a PYD is going down? Joe Swedish : And again, I can only speak to our book. But I think it\u2019s important to recognize when we price for this year, we did price for a rising trend. And I think we just had better data than others had in preparing for the exchange market. And I would argue, we had the best in class Medicaid management team in the country when the Ameri-group [ph] came in. And I think you just coupled those execution points together. And I think it\u2019s fair to say, we had a nice conservative balance sheet. So that differently helps but I don\u2019t want to take away anything from this management team\u2019s execution. This has because two solid years with this new team. And this thing is a very different company that what you saw in the previous five year. Ana Gupte \u2013 Leerink, Swann & Company: So just to wrap up on that, and fiduciary [ph], you\u2019re pretty comfortable that the second half your booking, your incurred estimated cost correctly. And then the pricing 2015, I\u2019m assuming you continue to expect an uptick for \u201815 or are you expecting a flat spend [ph] from where you are say? Wayne DeVeydt : We haven\u2019t given guidance yet for \u201815. But fairly I think there are reasons to believe medical trend will have a reflection point at some point. And we think it\u2019s prudent to take that view. Ana Gupte \u2013 Leerink, Swann & Company: Thanks, Wayne, for the color. Operator : Thank you. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference back to the company\u2019s management for closing remarks. Joe Swedish : Great. I\u2019d like to thank you all for joining us today and also for your questions. In closing, let me reiterate a few key messages I\u2019d like for you to take away from this call today. Our strong second quarter built upon the results of last year demonstrates the success we\u2019re having in attracting new customers across our commercial and government segment. I do want to underscore that our associates have had a lot to do with this and also have a lot to be proud of given their commitment to the execution that advances our strategic priorities and also it helps us capitalize on future opportunities. We recognize that our challenge going forward as an organization committed to serving our customers is to increasingly ground ourselves in our values especially being easy to do business with. Collectively and individually, we\u2019re focused on doing the right thing, offer simple solutions, striving for excellence and delivering results. Additionally, I want to reiterate a few points related to our call this morning. We\u2019re pleased with our performance in Q2 and the entire first half of 2014. In our exchange business, enrolment tracked well through midyear with 769,000 new members added. And we believe that we\u2019ve established prudent reserves for this business. Our government business is growing along multiple fronts with the implementation of several recent go-live situations in New Jersey, Florida and Kentucky as well as dual-eligible pilots that will contribute to growth in late 2014 and into 2015. And finally, we raised our 2014 adjusted EPS outlook from greater than $8.40 to greater than $8.60. And we also raised our membership growth and cash flow outlook for the year. So I want to thank everyone for participating today. So operator, please provide the call replay instruction. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 11 :00 AM Eastern Time today through August 13th.

And welcome to the WellPoint Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company\u2019s management. Doug Simpson : Good morning. And welcome to WellPoint\u2019s Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. This is Doug Simpson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Presenting today are Joe Swedish, President and CEO; and Wayne DeVeydt, Executive VP and CFO. Joe will start with the discussion of our Q3 2014 financial results and the macro backdrop, and then Wayne will review the quarter\u2019s financial highlights in more detail and update you on our 2014 outlook. Q&A will follow Wayne\u2019s remarks. During the call this morning, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at wellpoint.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of WellPoint. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in today\u2019s press release and in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Joe. Joe Swedish : Thank you, Doug, and good morning. I\u2019d like to begin reflecting on a solid third quarter, with membership and margins tracking well. We are pleased to report strong third quarter results of $2.36, which exceeded our initial expectations and builds upon the strength of our first six months and positions us for an improved EPS outlook for the full year. We grew by another 259,000 members in the third quarter, driven by contributions from the Medicaid, Local Group and National businesses. Through the third quarter, we have now added almost 1.9 million new members, served so far in 2014, representing a growth of 5.3% versus year end 2013. Our growth has been balanced in 2014, as we've added 699,000 Medicaid members through the third quarter, National has added 610,000 members and Local Group has added 438,000 members. With attrition in the third quarter as expected, our public exchange enrollment stands at 751,000 members at the end of the third quarter. What I\u2019d like to do now is discuss the specifics in and around the third quarter results. We are pleased with our third quarter results, with solid contributions from both Commercial and Government division. Specifically in the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $2.22 on a GAAP basis and $2.36 on an adjusted basis. Our GAAP EPS and adjusted EPS increase from the third quarter of 2013, driven by our growth in membership, improve medical loss ratio, administrative expense control and opportunistic capital deployment. Further supporting the quality of our earnings, we generated much stronger than expected operating cash flow of approximately $600 million in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date cash flow to approximately $3.1 billion. We have remained focused on our capital deployment strategies as well, repurchasing almost 5.1 million shares during the quarter for approximately $579 million and paying $119.2 million of dividends. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve repurchased 27.6 million shares or 9.4% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the year, for approximately $2.7 billion at a weighted average share price of $96.20. Let me turn to -- providing you an update on business development activity. As we have discussed previously, we believe affordability and access will be even more critical in the future, to enhancing the consumer experience with the healthcare delivery system. I want to take the opportunity to update you on a few selected items that show we are working to advance our goal of improving health care costs for our customers and their families. First, we're enhancing our medical cost management efforts to comprehensively review our medical cost profile and identify actionable opportunities to further improve medical cost management in both our Commercial and Government segments. Components of the strategy include, establishing line of sight, accountability and enhancing trend analytics and identification of actionable trend drivers. This will partially include some realignment of clinical support assets to the state plan presidents to improve their ability to react more quickly to their specific market dynamics. Finally, while each market has different opportunities, we will look to leverage best practices at the enterprise level. The structure of this effort has now been established and we have seen early stage savings and we expect contributions to increase in the coming years. At the same time, we continue to move ahead with our provider collaboration efforts, by partnering with leading providers and aligning incentives, we have the opportunity to drive better quality care at more affordable prices. We believe this directly impacts our ability to compete in the market as evidenced by our broad-based enrollment growth thus far this year. In September, we announced through Anthem Blue Cross of California formation of a joint venture named Vivity, the seven hospital groups in the Los Angeles market. Through Vivity, we will offer medical plans to the large group market in 2015 that provides a level of coordinated, high-quality and efficient care at a competitive price. This is a substantive example of how our local market experience and community presence uniquely positions us to help change the landscape of care coordination in the marketplace. I\u2019d like to now turn to Commercial and the execution of our strategies. Our Commercial business had a solid quarter, with membership largely steady on the back of the strong growth in the first half of the year. Commercial revenues declined in the third quarter by 0.2% year-over-year to $9.8 billion, with contributions from new membership growth in the business being offset, but the previously announced conversion the New York State account self-funded, which impacts revenues by about $2 billion a year. Commercial operating margins improved as expected from 7.2% a year ago to 9.3% in the third quarter of 2014, due to the changing mix of the product portfolio within the business, as we have discussed with you previously. While we do not breakout MLR by business segment, we can say that our third quarter Commercial MLR came in better than expected in the quarter. Echoing the membership trends seen in the first six months of the year in our Commercial business, our National and large group membership trends in the quarter remain favorable, while small group attrition continued even slightly faster than expected. With the open enrollment period ending in the April and normal seasonal attrition, our individual memberships stood at just over 1.9 million members at the end of the third quarter 2014, down a net 108,000 members during the quarter. Year-to-date, our total individual enrollment is up a net 159,000 members. To update you on the various metrics, we added 751,000 individual members on the public exchanges year-to-date through the third quarter. The general characteristics of exchange applicants including average age continue to track well versus our expectations. Product selection and benefit levels have also been consistent with expectations. We've been executing on our exchange rollout and the paid claims trends thus far are encouraging. But we recognize many of these new members only joined our enrolment rolls in May. Therefore we continue to take a prudent view of reserves in light of the potential uncertainties associated with this membership and expect to gain more information as this block matures in the fourth quarter. For the 3Rs, we continue to book reassurance as appropriate. We've also recorded a modest net payable risk quarters and while we believe we are a in modest net receivable position for risk adjusters, our outlook still does not include any such recovery. Open enrollment period for the exchanges is approaching and we are ramping up our activities accordingly. This year, we plan to again offer exchange products in all 14 of our Blue states and we're expanding our served geography within those markets. We plan to build upon the success we had in 2014 and leverage our experience with product design and customer preference in the exchange market. Our strategy for 2015 includes minor refinements based on our experience in 2014 and our overarching focus remains on driving product affordability for our members. During the third quarter, our large group business showed solid sequential membership growth of over 100,000 lives, including 74,000 lives from the contract for New York Hotel Trades. As we discussed last quarter, with respect to our small group business, we continue to be mindful of the potential for employer coverage changes in light of the exchanges. And we did see third quarter small group number of clients above our expectations. Small group has now declined almost 300,000 members year-to-date and stands at 1.56 million members. These dynamics are reflected in our outlook. Finally, we're coming to the tailwind of the National account selling season. We feel good about our momentum in the market. We believe our ability to improve healthcare affordability is resonating with customers. We now expect to add over 200,000 net new lives in 2015 and with very strong retention among our legacy customers. This is a solid result, reflecting a strong close ratio against the lower number of contracts out for bid in our markets for 2015 versus a year ago. Discussions are already taking place for the 2016 season and we continue to be optimistic that there will be a ramp up in activity among National accounts as we look out to 2016. I'd now like to turn to the government sector and speak to the solid third quarter growth coming online. Our government business division added 270,000 members in the quarter driven by strong growth in Medicaid and generated revenues of $8.6 billion, up approximately 10.1% quarter-over-quarter. The government business represented nearly 47% of our consolidated operating revenues in the quarter as our business continues to evolve and diversify. Medicaid enrollment was up an additional 253,000 members in the third quarter, bringing year-to-date growth 699,000 members. We expect to continue growing Medicaid enrollment in the fourth quarter. We're raising our total Medicaid enrollment outlook from 500,000, 600,000 previously up to 700,000, 750,000 driven by organic enrollment growth in ramping up of recent contract awards. We now expect to add 450,000 to 475,000 expansion members in 2014 versus 400,000 to 500,000 previously. Medicare enrollment was slightly positive in the third quarter with a gain of 20,000 members. Government operating margins declined 50 basis points year-over-year to 3.3%, partially reflecting lower Medicare margins and higher hepatitis C costs. Our third quarter membership growth reflected contributions from Medicaid expansion, several recent Medicaid go-live implementations in New Jersey, Florida and Kentucky and modest contributions from dual eligible demonstrations. We continue to see substantial RFP opportunities for new Medicaid business over the next year. And we remain optimistic in our ability to gain meaningful net new business from these opportunities. To update you on the dual eligible rollouts, programs started to launch in Q2 and Q3. And we currently have about 8,000 lives served in Virginia and over 3,000 dual eligible members in Los Angeles County which went live on July 1, 2014. We continue to expect New York, Texas and the remaining counties in California to commence in early 2015. I'd like to now turn to an update regarding the 2014 outlook which we believe is prudent. Given the strength of our results year-to-date and our outlook for the balance of this year, we are updating our 2014 financial outlook this morning. We now expect adjusted earnings per share to be within the range of $8.75 to $8.85 for the full year 2014, reflecting stronger enrollment and margin trends. We\u2019re also raising our cash flow outlook, which Wayne will discuss in more detail. We remain optimistic about our cash flow profile and outlook for the future. We do not want to get ahead of our board but we are considering moving to a higher dividend payout ratio in 2015, given the strength of our cash flow. We continue to maintain a prudent outlook in light of the dynamic nature of our markets and the potential for future changes in the regulatory framework. We're working to our 2015 budget process and we\u2019ll offer our more detailed outlook in early 2015. Our goal remains EPS growth over our updated 2014 outlook, driven by incremental contributions from new membership in both our government and commercial segments. But we are not yet ready to offer specific EPS guidance, the current estimates for adjusted EPS of most analysts in the $9.15 to $9.30 range for 2015 are reasonable placeholders with a 7% to 8% topline growth. We expect to maintain a prudent posture with our 2015 outlook, given the evolution of our business across our served markets. To conclude, we\u2019re very pleased with our third quarter performance. Over the next several years, we will look forward to serving a growing membership base across both our commercial and government business divisions. Our efforts on provider engagement and cost management should further our position in the market while improving the cost and quality of care for our members. Our team remains focused on execution and we will also remain disciplined stewards of shareholder capital. With that, I will now turn it over to Wayne. Wayne DeVeydt : Thank you, Joe and good morning. My comments today will focus on the key financial highlights from the third quarter of 2014. I\u2019ll also provide an update on the 2014 outlook. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.22 for the third quarter of 2014. These results included net costs of $0.14 per share, reflecting $0.17 per share of debt-extinguishment expense, partially offset by net investment gains of $0.03 per share. Excluding these items, our adjusted EPS totaled $2.36 for the quarter. These results were favorable to our initial expectation and as Joe noted, we are pleased with how 2014 has progressed so far. Medical enrollment grew by 259,000, or 0.7%, sequentially to approximately 37.5 million medical members as of September 30th. This reflected membership gains in our Medicaid large group and National businesses, partially offset by declines in our individual and small group businesses. Operating revenue was nearly $18.4 billion in the quarter, an increase of approximately $752 million or 4.3% versus the third quarter 2013. Reflecting enrollment growth in our commercial and government businesses, revenue growth versus Q3 2013 was adversely impacted by the previously discussed transition of the State of New York account from fully insured to self-funded on January 1st. The benefit expense ratio was 82.5% in the third quarter of 2014, a decrease of 240 basis points from the prior year quarter and favorable to our initial expectations. The decline reflected continued strong medical management and the impact of the premium revenue designed to help cover new healthcare reform fees, as well as changes in our earnings pattern we have discussed previously. We are pleased with gross margin performance on both of our businesses in the quarter and first nine months and we are improving our MLR outlook for the year, from 83.5%, plus or minus 30 basis points to 83.3%, plus or minus 20 basis points. For the full year 2014, we continue to expect underlying Local Group medical cost trend to be in the range of 6.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points, with a bias towards the lower half of the range. Our SG&A expense ratio increased by 180 basis points from the 3Q of 2013 as expected, largely due to the inclusion of various healthcare reform fees in 2014. Consistent with our past practice, we have included a roll-forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning\u2019s press release. For the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we experienced favorable prior year reserve development of $535 million, which was modestly better than our expectations. Development was consistent with the prior year-to-date period. We continue to maintain our upper single-digit margin for adverse deviation and believe our reserve balance remains consistent and strong as of September 30, 2014. Days in claims payable was 44 days as of September 30th, down 0.8 days from 44.8 days as of June 30th, and up 5.3 days from 38.7 days at the end of 2013. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 38.6% at September 30, 2014, up from 37.8% at June 30th, reflecting our August financing activities. We ended the third quarter with approximately $2.1 billion of cash and investments at the parent company, and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of $1 billion as of September 30th. Moving to cash flow, we generated stronger-than-expected operating cash flow of $606 million in the third quarter, or one times net income on the back of strong underlying fundamental performance and about $200 million of favorable timing of Medicaid payments in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we generated operating cash flow of approximately $3.1 billion, roughly 1.5 times net income. We repurchased almost 5.1 million shares during the quarter for approximately $579 million, representing a weighted average price of $114.50. Earlier in October, the Board of Directors approved a $5 billion increase in share repurchase authorization to the $1 billion that was remaining at the time. As a result, we had approximately 6 billion of shares repurchase authorization remaining, which we intend to utilize over a multi-year period subject to market conditions. We used $119.2 million during the quarter for our cash dividend and yesterday the audit committee declared our fourth quarter dividend of $0.4375 to shareholders. Turning to our 2014 outlook. As Joe noted, we currently expect adjusted EPS to be within the range of $8.75 and $8.85 for 2014. The increase in our full year outlook reflects a stronger operating income outlook due to a stronger enrollment and continued medical management and expense controls. There is a timing issue we want to highlight for you related to the revenue recognition for Medicaid contract rate changes in certain market, which totaled north of $100 million. Our 2014 adjusted EPS outlook has previously and continues to include these amounts revenue in two of our states. And there's no change in our forecast for these amounts. We believe this is simply a potential timing issue related to the administration of these contracts as we approach year end. Simply put, we expect to report these amounts in the coming months. But there is a chance a portion could slip into 2015 because of administrative timing. We will be very transparent with you, if there is ultimately a delay in recognizing any of these premiums from late 2014 to early 2013. We are raising our enrollment outlook and now expect enrollment in 2014 to grow by 1.55 to 1.65 million members to 37.2 to 37.3 million by year-end 2014. We are also raising our cash flow forecast from greater than $2.7 billion previously to greater than $3.3 billion for the full year. We believe our updated outlook is reasonable in a year in which the industry is undergoing substantial change and our bias is to maintain a prudent stance in this dynamic environment. As Joe said earlier, we are continuing to work through our 2015 budget process and we\u2019ll offer a more detailed outlook in early 2015. While we are not yet ready to offer specific EPS objective, the current estimates for adjusted EPS to most analysts in the $9.15 to $9.30 range for 2015, seem to be a reasonable placeholder at this point based on our current definition of adjusted EPS. However, we will move to a cash EPS metric in 2015, which would raise EPS all else being equal. Specifically, starting in 2015, we planned to also exclude the amortization of intangibles from our adjusted EPS calculation. For 2014, our adjusted EPS includes the impact of $220 million of intangible asset amortization expense related to prior acquisitions including Amerigroup. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Joe. Joe Swedish : Thanks, Wayne. With that, operator, please open the queue for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Tom Carroll from Stifel. Please go ahead. Tom Carroll - Stifel: Hey. Good morning. I wonder if you could just circle back quickly on the point on, Texas and maybe give us a bit more color on what may or may not be happening down there and if you have signed agreements and maybe when you expect to get them? And then just staying on the Medicaid topic, maybe touch on, do any markets stand out as being either more profitable or more costly than expected? And I guess, I'm thinking specifically Florida here in this instance. Thanks. Wayne DeVeydt : Good morning, Tom. This is Wayne. Appreciate the questions this morning. Let me first address Texas and then, I\u2019ll address the more broader question on Medicaid. Starting with Texas, our previous outlook actually assumed that we would not collect the non-deductibility but did assume we would actually collect the tax. We still believe the tax will be collected and we believe it's a prudent part of sustainable model, just as we assume the non-deductibility should be collected. However, we do not believe we would've a contract signed by the end of this year and accordingly we\u2019ve excluded that from our guidance now for the full year outlook. In addition to that, to your second question on Medicaid, we continue to see no issues in the Florida market versus our expectations. I call that market out specifically as I know there has been lot of questions there. I think our counties are uniquely different in position and we performed relative to our expectations, pretty much aligned with them. I will say though that many expansion states and the new lives coming through expansion are coming in generally with an overall cost structure better than we would have anticipated. And as a result, we are booking callers at this point back to ministates regarding those expectations. Tom Carroll - Stifel: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Justin Lake - JPMorgan: Thanks. Good morning. First question in terms of 2015, you blessed this range of $9.15 to $9.30, which is 4% to 6% EPS growth. Just hoping you can walk us through the headwinds and tailwind that we should keep in mind here to get this estimate given the solid topline growth you talk to and the typical share repurchase? Joe Swedish : Good morning. This is Joe. Thanks for the question. Headwinds, tailwinds; on the headwinds perspective, maybe about four, five items that I can lay out for you include the industry fee going to definitely be up 40% and we clearly believe we will account for that accordingly. Second, as we\u2019ve repeatedly said that we have seen and continue to see small group margin and membership compression. So we\u2019re expecting certainly '15 to continue that path for the compression. The Medicare stars bonus cuts certainly impact us. Dual eligible population startups in year one of our engagement and the duals arena certainly provides for some agreement. We believe we will manage our way through effectively. And finally increasing hep C spend from new drugs that are coming online, we mapped out very clearly our hep C exposure. We believe that we\u2019ve got a line of sight both on the cost impact, the volume impact estimates, as well as the clinical protocols that are necessary to effectively manage that. With respect to tailwinds, we believe that the enrollment growth in Medicaid certainly will continue strong, specifically related to the expansion states that we envisioned coming online. The one specific state that I can call out that definitely headwind for us -- excuse me -- tailwind for us is Tennessee because that contract is coming online shortly. Enrollment growth in the ACA engagement as well as our National business was quoted to you in our materials we just presented to you. The waterfall effect of lives added over the course of 2014 and finally the impact of our 2014 capital deployment strategies that I think have been very effectively executed and look forward to the impact that that will provide for us in '15. Justin Lake - JPMorgan: Great. And then Wayne, you\u2019ve talked to the company\u2019s conservatism on reserves this year due to all the reform changes. Can you give us an update here and maybe talk to the drivers of the decline in claims payable from 2Q to 3Q? Thanks. Wayne DeVeydt : Sure, Justin. As you saw, our DCP went down about 0.8 days versus where we\u2019re at previously in 2Q. One thing I think will be important for our investors to understand is why do we think maybe a more normalized DCP might look like? Our mix of business has changed quite a bit. And as we continue to ramp up and grow like we expect to do between now and 2018, you\u2019re going to see a rising reserve balancing. And in theory, it will rise at a faster pace than paid, because those members are coming on sooner and then of course you pay claims in arrears. So we think of more normalized DCP for our business model is probably closer to 40 days and that would assume our high-single-digit margin for adverse deviation. Obviously, we\u2019re currently posting a 44 days at this point. So I think you can get a feel for at least a level of conservatism that we think we're maintaining. We think that's prudent though. There are still a lot of moving parts around risk adjusters, around corridors, around MLR rebates once those settle up, and even risk callers in our Medicaid expansion states. And so the way I would look at that extra four days is not necessarily all conservatism that could potentially drop to the bottomline, but rather view it as conservatism against many risks that could go the wrong direction. And if they were to all move positive or some move positive, not all of that would drop to the bottomline, as some of that than would result in a payable back either through a caller, a corridor or an MLR rebate, but it would be upside to our current expectations. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice - UBS: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe just ask you about the positioning for exchanges for next year, your thoughts on that. Obviously there's a projected growth in the underlying overall industry. You guys are expanding your geography and you\u2019ve done pretty well this year. So in terms of expectations for membership growth, expectations for margin trend, can you give us at least some directional comment on that? Joe Swedish : Yeah, A.J., good morning. First of all, just to underscore, we are going to continue to participate in each of our 14 markets in the public exchange arena. So virtually nothing is changing year-over-year in that regard. We certainly are going to build on what I would categorize is tremendous successes this past year relative to the analytics pricing and our marketing efforts that allowed us to accumulate the enrollment that we achieved. So going into the '15 timeframe with enrollments cracking up very, very soon, we are going to participate in 139 rating regions this year. And we believe that certainly there will be some adjustments with respect to how we approach the market, but generally speaking in terms of our pricing, our marketing efforts, et cetera I think it will look remarkably similar to the efforts that we employed in '14. Long story short, we really continue to feel strongly about the value proposition we are bringing to the market. And as you may know, CBO estimates indicate something like 5 million lives may come into the exchange environment. We believe given our share of the market this time around, we believe maybe we will capture like share in the new round. So again, I think we're well positioned and aggressively pursuing the markets we have already established ourselves in during the '14 selling season. A.J. Rice - UBS: Okay, great. Maybe just a quick follow-up. Obviously in the last couple days, it\u2019s been renewed discussion around the part of the middle market -- the lower end of the middle market 50 to 300 employee groups and that there is maybe some increased volatility both the utilization and churn there. Can you just comment a little bit, how big that is for you and if you're seeing anything that surprises you going on in that market? Joe Swedish : Thanks, A.J. We\u2019re not seeing anything that surprises us in that market. We\u2019ve always held the very strong market share in that space. If you look at our growth in the Q3 timeframe, it's been a lot of ASO growth in our large National business and the Local Group business was a sizable win of one account. But when you get to that 50 to 300 range, I mean this is a space that we\u2019re very familiar with. We view it as average margins and we feel like the competitive environment continues to be rational in general in that space. So no real surprises for us in that market at all. So I can\u2019t really comment on any other questions that have come up other than that regarding us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold from Cowen. Please go ahead. Christine Arnold - Cowen: Hi, there. Could you update us on your small group expectations? It looks like you're losing many more membership than you expected. Have you re-launched those small group non-ACA products or you are going to be losing those early renewed a year ago and do you still think you lose about $300 million of the $400 million in profitability and is that $400 million still a good number ultimately? Wayne DeVeydt :  Thanks, Christine. Small group definitely continues to achieve the level faster than we have updated. Even when we did our second quarter outlook, we assumed a much faster pace and it was slightly worst than that. It wasn\u2019t too far of our expectations. But I think now that you\u2019ve got exchanges up and running and functioning well, and that small group, of course, we have an opportunity to revaluate whether they choose to go to exchange for their employees. We think will become even probably a more prominent decision that they\u2019ll make this quarter as the exchanges start to -- start the enrollment process. We have many products we\u2019ve rolled out to try to retain a small group for a period of time. But as we always said as part of our five year strategy, we clearly believe that the important part was having a net or catchers made if you will to become in different on where that customer wanted to buy their product and whether that would be through small group or through the public exchange. So, I think, our goal is just to offer the most affordable product we can give to them. We do think that the majority of the $400 million headwind will still occur this year. It will between the $200 million and $300 million range and it will be closer to the $300 range in terms of op earnings impact and it will be $200 million range and we still anticipate over $100 million headwind for next year. Relative to the $400 million, is that still a good estimate or not. Based on everything we know today, it seems like a reasonable proxy still at this point. Margins are starting to become fungible between exchanges and small group as they start migrating off and our membership as you know is down a pretty meaningfully there. So, I think, we still feel the $400 million is a good number. Could it be a little bit north of that, possibly, but we also think that the enrollment pickup on the exchanges and the improvement that will happen there should offset that as margin start to expand. Christine Arnold - Cowen: Great. Thank you. Joe Swedish : Yeah. This is Joe. Wayne, I believe, originally we are estimating something like a five-year migration to significantly reduced membership in small group and long story short, we\u2019re not believing this is a two-year migration path and obviously, we\u2019re managing to that reality as Wayne pointed out, hopefully, we\u2019ll be shifting members from one of our books to another book and we\u2019d be in different way they\u2019d end up, albeit margin situation maybe different, but we believe, we can account for them effectively. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse : Thanks. Good morning. Could you update us on where you stand at sort of the margin level that you\u2019re booking on the exchange business at this point? And is there any difference around that cost trend and/or margin level, whether you're thinking about sort of on versus off exchange? Wayne DeVeydt : Hey, Ralph. Let me address first the cost trend in general margin levels and then come into on versus off. First, I would say, we still think we\u2019re running margins in the 3% plus range at this point. I\u2019d say the plus point now, because I think as we\u2019re starting to get more data on risk adjusters and other items, those would imply that we\u2019re in a net receivable position. That being said, I want to make sure that our investors understand that even though they would imply a net receivable position, we have recorded those balances both payables and receivables, but have booked 100% valuation against the net receivable position. Again, until we get more clarity, we\u2019re not going to assume that. But to the extent that those data points do prove out between now and end of the year, going in early next year, we would be running 3% plus margins at that point. Again, very comfortable with our original goal that we\u2019ve laid out of targeting 3% to 5% margins. It varies by market. No one market is the same. We have opportunities to improve margins in certain markets and in fact, I would argue we have opportunities in all markets to improve margins. But I think right now it\u2019s important to recognize that the membership is very critical as we continue to absorb the tax and we will continue to try to balance those margins with the membership goals that we have in our five-year outlook. Relative to cost trend, probably the best way to look at it, Ralph, is versus our expectations. And so, clearly, we expected the cost trends on exchange business to be much higher than the cost trends that we would have on our non-exchange business and that is prove to be true. But relative to our expectations, it is prove to be less than we had expected though. So, again, and I would say, on both books of business trend in general is playing well. But probably the bigger item is just the SG&A continues to rise on those books, as we think investing in medical management, investing in marketing, as we go to market this fourth quarter, a really the critical initiatives. So we like our position too, because we\u2019re able to grow while investing in the business and than we think overtime as we capture this membership, you will start to see the SG&A ramped down in the later years of our five-year strategy. Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse : Okay. And then just on the, I guess, on the 3Rs, just to be clear, one clarification. Last quarter I thought, you had been booking or thinking you\u2019re going to be in a payable position on the risk adjustment, so is that changed or am I sort of misremembering one? And then two, just on reinsurance piece, I guess, where do you expect to end the year and then what kind of benefit essentially would that have to MLR in 4Q, just based on that 1R? Wayne DeVeydt :  Yeah. Ralph, first of all, yeah, in the second quarter we assumed we would be in a payable position for risk corridors not risk adjusters. However, that being said, we had a payable in 2Q and we continue to record a payable in Q3 for risk corridors. We had indicated in 2Q that for risk adjusters, we had data that imply to receivable. We chose not to book that receivable as we thought the data was immature. We\u2019ve gotten better data now in Q3 that would still imply a receivable. We have booked that receivable along with the payables based on the data but then booked a 100% valuation allowance. Our outlook still does not assume upside, which at least the data to date would imply from the weekly study that we would be entitled to a net receivable but we\u2019re still not booking one at this point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Peter Costa - Wells Fargo : Just as a follow-up to that last question. Can you talk about what the timing will be in the fourth quarter and then into next year of finalizing, whether you should be in the receivable or payable situation, relative to the risk adjuster? Wayne DeVeydt :  Hey Pete, how are you? Honestly, I really think its going to be challenging for anybody to know what the final settlements going to look like on the risk adjuster. Everybody is submitting their data today. You still have opportunities to code your data if it wasn't coded properly between now. And you -- in fact you have that other opportunity into early next year as well. So realistically, we think we really not going to know an answer, until closer to end of Q1, early Q2 of 2015 on where things really shakeout. Our intention though from this point is because we do have better data now and there is at least a point of view that the industry can begin to take as to book to what we\u2019re getting not only on the receivable side but on the payable side. And then if we\u2019re in net receivable position, which we continue to be after two quarters, this book of valuation allowance until we see ultimate settlements shakeout. We\u2019ve seen the number of moving up between 2Q and Q3 in a variety of directions that we think booking an allowance is a very prudent thing to do until we see ultimate settlement. But I think ultimate settlement does not happen until 2Q of next year. Peter Costa - Wells Fargo : And so the follow-up staying on the exchange business, your price increases on the exchanges for 2015 were relatively modest yet, some of the second lowest cost silver plan price increases were lower than yours and that results in higher premiums, fairly, substantially for some of the lowest income people, in terms of the percentage increase for them for your plans. Do you expect some churn of your existing business? And if you do, how much or can you give us an idea of sort of what the relative rate increase is for some of the people on the lower end of the spectrum? Joe Swedish : Pete, I think it's fair to say, we expect some degree of churn as we do with any book, especially, in the individual book where I\u2019d say, highly competitive consumer-based shopping experience. That being said, we expect to be a net grower next year on our exchange book. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll maintain exactly the same market share because it is very much dependent upon the competitive environment. But we think what\u2019s probably most important for the consumer is predictability and affordability. And so the volatility in our pricing we think is very limited versus maybe what we\u2019ve seen in other fillings throughout this most recent period. One thing to keep in mind though is that our goal is to maintain affordability but price for a fair return for the value we bring to not only our member but to State and Federal Government. And when you look at with that lens, it\u2019s important to recognize too that the data which support these rate increases and probably more importantly the ultimate impact to consumer is very dependent upon the product selection they\u2019ve and the substitutes they have. And so I think as we continue to bring healthier lives into the book over time and as the book gets more medically managed over time, I think you\u2019ll see price points begin to tighten even further and you are starting to see that in markets. And I think as the 3Rs start to where their course and for lack of better word, the training wheels come off, I think you\u2019ll start to see pricing get even more rationale and markets where we don\u2019t think it\u2019s completely rationale yet. Peter Costa - Wells Fargo :  Thank you. Operator :  Your next question is come from the line of Josh Raskin from Barclays. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin - Barclays: Hi thanks. Thanks. Wayne, I just want to clarify on the cash earnings. I think you said $222 million of amortization. I don't know if there is a tax impact, but is that something in the ballpark of $0.80? Wayne DeVeydt : Hey Josh. Yeah, that\u2019s a pretax numbers, so you\u2019ll need to tax adjusted, so you will be south of the $0.80. Josh Raskin - Barclays: Okay. So $0.50 or something like that. Wayne DeVeydt : Yes. Josh Raskin - Barclays: Okay. And then is there -- is amortization, is that trailing down in \u201815 as you get past Amerigroup? I don't know how many short-tail amortization buckets there were? Wayne DeVeydt : It is, Josh. We use an accelerated the amortization method. So it is trailing down. And if you go to our 10-K and our 10-Q which will be filled later this afternoon, you will have an opportunity to see the five-year average of what our amortization expense is and you\u2019ll be able to see how it trails down. Josh Raskin - Barclays: Okay. Perfect. And then just moving to the individual book, the decline in the third quarter, I just want to make sure I got the moving pieces on that. Was that mostly declines as some of the individuals on exchanges were lapsing or was there more going on there and is that what's driving -- you guys had a pretty big drop in the fourth quarter membership expectation. Is that mostly individual as well? Joe Swedish : Yeah. Thanks, Josh. Yeah, it\u2019s basically what I\u2019ll call historical normal lapses that we see during the third and fourth quarter. And that\u2019s pretty much what we saw on the exchanges. Our sales assumptions are lining with what we expected which was not that many individuals that would have life event changes, many individuals are getting job, in some cases, moving from exchange into an employer-based coverage. But nothing unusual or unexpected and we expect that trend to continue going into Q4 within a ramp-up back in growth again starting January 1. We\u2019ve also made an assumption in our ASO business, that we may see some in-group change, negative in-group change in Q4. I hope that proves to be conservative, but there has jut been a lot of volatility in employment levels and as we get into Q4, we\u2019re not quite sure how that might shake out with the fourth quarter. So we chose to take a more conservative view at this point until we see more. But those are the two primary drivers of the reduction in membership that we\u2019re assuming in Q4. Operator : Your next question is comes from the line of Chris Rigg form Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could give us your latest thoughts on Medicare Advantage for 2015 and how you think enrollment will trend in that book next year? Joe Swedish : Hi Chris. Good morning. I think at least our view at this point, we clearly have a headwind in 2015 due to the star ratings that were out there. And as Joe has indicated many times, our path to this turnaround is a multi-year path. And I will tell you basically we\u2019ve seen for progress this year relative to future ratings, we are very encouraged with the strides we've made as a company. That being said, we would expect membership to be down slightly next year as we continue to refine our business, maintain zero dollar HMO plans in key markets where we want to get scale and leverage. But I do believe we can have optimum growth next year, because a lot of our strategies are started to play out and a lot of the investments we\u2019re making this year which are impacting our Medicare margins, including SG&A investments and risk score adjustments that we are doing will then start to flip next year. So, I think you will see membership down next year. But you'll start to see operating earnings improvement really starting to occur next year and then start to ramp up in \u201816 and then really ramp up in \u201817 with the star improvements. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna: Great. Joe Swedish : Chris, this is Joe. I just -- so I can maybe add a little bit more meat to it. I think quarter-over-quarter, we keep talking about our M&A focus and how we are trying to realign restructure, renew our M&A market presence. And I think that we\u2019ve got some very key strategies that will be exercised in \u201915, going into the subsequent years. We do want to underscore that we are going to achieve a lot of that through incremental investments. It's really important to note because as I\u2019ve always said that we believe M&A is an important part of our portfolio going forward. We don't tend to back off of that. We are investing heavily in medical management, on medical cost management and I think that\u2019s going to be a very robust contributor for us going forward. Managing the business locally, it\u2019s really important to underscore and probably most critical is that we\u2019ve created a more effective operating team. And we\u2019ve got an entirely new executive infrastructure that is administering the growth dynamics in and around M&A. So we have big strategies. We've got kind of a focus of not, overreacting or reacting rationally in the market. And I think in the long view, we are certainly going to focus on performing in a more stable construct. And I think history would suggest and again, we\u2019ve got specific strategies related to everyone of those points that I made. I\u2019m pretty optimistic about our efforts going forward. I guess one key driver is stars ratings. And I think we\u2019ve got a very significant plan of action there and we\u2019re hopeful that, as we did experienced an uptick in our stars rating this year, most recently announced which we believe was materially in the right direction. We do believe that over time that we will achieve our goal to attain 51% of our members in four star plans. So put all that together, I think we've got a very, very significant opportunity ahead of us. And of course, a lot of that is being driven by our provider collaboration activities, which I think kind of undergird a lot of what we're doing, not just in M&A but in a variety of other domains in the company as well. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna: Got it. Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dave Windley - Jefferies: Hi. Wanted to follow-up on some of your spending initiatives that you've mentioned and focusing, I guess on SG&A. SG&A was a little higher I think than the street and we were looking for this quarter and then it looks like, for your guidance, it actually drops down a little bit in the fourth quarter and that's I think countered to normal seasonality. So, I wondered if some of that spending was going into these investments in programs that you're talking about or was it related to something else? Joe Swedish : Good morning, Dave. No, lot of the spending that you saw in 3Q really wasn\u2019t to these initiatives. I would say that keep in mind, the duals really started rolling out and ramping up and so you're starting to get real run rate value there. But as we continue to have new RFP wins in Medicaid, as we continue to see lives expand. A lot of our initiatives around our exchanges beyond the marketing, there's a lot of other initiatives we are doing to build products, redefine how we go to market. And we are doing a lot of those sooner versus waiting right before open enrollment. So you are seeing a lot of that come through in Q3 and it\u2019s important to recognize and on a year-over-year basis. Last year, you had three months of open enrolment. This year, you are only getting two months of open enrolment and so you don\u2019t have quite the same marketing level of spend as you saw last year for the last three months as you only have two months. So there is a few things that influenced Q4. The important point, I think we want our investors to understand though is we are investing for growth. We are not cutting the growth. And I think that\u2019s probably the most important point we want to make is that the SG&A is really a variable cost to us now. We\u2019re using some of the fixed cost leverage though to shutdown systems and platforms. Joe has put forward a very clear initiative for IT and we will get to a unified enterprise and unified IT platform. And I think the real values of these investments, when you see G&A coming down, really is not until you start getting out to the \u201816, \u201817, \u201818 timeframe. So view us investing through \u201914, view us investing through \u201815 and then begin to see how the leverage of that topline growth really comes to play in \u201816 and beyond. Dave Windley - Jefferies: Great. Thanks. And then my follow-up question is coming back to your broad bookings on 2015 and the headwinds and tailwinds that you gave Justin earlier. I guess the essence of the question, the simple question would be do you expect that you can grow op gain or operating earnings in 2015? In particular, like I'm thinking you gave Medicare STARS as a headwind, but you also talked about op gain growth for Medicare in 2015. So again, bottom line, do you think you grow operating earnings in 2015? Joe Swedish : We do, Dave. And if you look at our five-year model we laid out in early March, we indicated an operating earnings growth of between $1.4 billion and $2.1 billion. If you look at where we started this year at being greater than $200 million, I think you can see through three quarters of results and now backing into the fourth quarter EPS number that we will be north of 10% of operating earnings growth. This year, we are $400 million of op gain growth. We would fully expect that trend would continue and in the later years as I said, we will begin to get some standard G&A leverage with that topline growth. So, yes, op gain, we expect to grow next year. Wayne DeVeydt :  Again, I think reflecting back to our Investor Relations day and the outlook we provided you there, we\u2019re still very committed to our outlook in terms of where we are going to land in \u201918, strongly committed to that. At the moment, we don\u2019t see anything that would kind of distract us from achieving the goals that we established at that time. Notwithstanding, there maybe some bumps along the way but in the main what we are seeing right now, we believe we still have clear line of sight to \u201818 outlook. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Ana Gupte - Leerink partners : Yes. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the individual off and on exchange question but the slightly different aspect of it. I think a couple of your competitors are now beginning to acknowledge that the public exchange is actually profitable, but their bearish outlook is largely because net across on and off exchange, they are seeing margin compression and even losses. So just wanted to understand relative to last year in 2013 what type of margin performance did you see into '14 and was that a tailwind or a headwind that differ geographically and then what is the expectation into '15? Joe Swedish : Hi. Good morning, Ana. This is a good question. If you were to look at run rate margins last year versus expected run rate margins for this year, I would say year-over-year margins are very comparable on a run rate basis. However, what\u2019s the primary difference, well, one is, this year you have a lot more members that are starting to migrate into the book and those are coming over. But probably more importantly was last year, we had all the build out activities though of exchanges which really did tap down margins for last year as we built out our strategies, put forward our marketing but had no revenue coming through. So on a year-over-year, margins have improved this year versus last year, but that's because of last year's investments not of because necessarily the underlying run rate. We clearly believe though and have expected in our pricing, there would be a volatility in the book and a lot of unknowns. And so, we don't believe margins are optimal at this point though and we think it is very similar to what you see in a Medicaid program. We think as we begin to the manage these lives and begin to put them through more managed care programs that over time we will actually see the underlying trends with the exchange business start to migrate more to a non-exchange individual business that we've seen historically, which did ultimately would reside in even higher margins over time. So we still think 3 to 5 is reasonable and our goal would be to eventually target closer to the five and the three. Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners : On a follow-up basis then your competitors have even talked about forced attrition from off exchange to on exchange, will you do any of that, do you need to do that into '15? Joe Swedish : Unfortunately I can't speak to what our competitors are actually talking about. I mean from our perspective, there isn\u2019t a need of forced attrition and again I would simply say that the catcher\u2019s mitt we built starting over two years ago was exactly to get to the point where we were indifferent to where the customer decided to buy and what mechanism and whether that was the buy through a public exchange, a private exchange, a broker or just online. Our goal was to build a mechanism. That said, we\u2019d would like to catch them regardless of where they are at. A real issue for us is offering them that choice and then giving them the most affordable product. And so I will tell you that Joe's focus for this leadership team is to make sure that the choice and affordability stay paramount in that and that\u2019s why the provider collaboration efforts that we\u2019re driving because that influences the affordability more than anything. Operator : And your final question today comes from the line of Matthew Borsch from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs :  Yes. Hi, good morning. Maybe just give us an idea what you're putting through is the rate increase for 2015. I guess I'm really talking about off exchange in your commercial insured business. If you don't have a point estimate you can share it, are the rate increases that you\u2019re putting through for 2015 generally higher than what you put in for 2014? Can you characterize that? Wayne DeVeydt : Matt, while we don\u2019t give specific rate increases by market or product for competitive reasons, I can't tell you that we are assuming across the book that we will have a rising medical trend over the levels that we have today. There are many reasons to assume that. There is also arguments why others may say you shouldn't assume that, including an improving book over time. But the reality is we think hep c cost will continue to rise. And even if we were to exclude hep c cost, we still think the underlying core book is poised at some point to have trend and utilization move back to a more level place. So we\u2019re comfortable with our 6.5% for this year, plus or minus 50 basis points in the bias to the low end, but we are pricing for a level higher than that as we go into next year for core medical trend. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs : Great. And Joe, if I could just -- one more, if you can just remind us on the Medicaid business where you stand with most of the states? I know Texas is a special situation, but are you now getting both in most cases the fee and the gross up or is it mostly just the fee? Wayne DeVeydt :  Hi, Matt. Yeah, on that question, the answer is both, which is what\u2019s very encouraging for us. We still believe we will get that in Texas. We believe it's part of a sustainable business model. We just have not included that in our outlook. The one thing I want to highlight though as we said in the prepared remarks is, we\u2019ve got a $100 million -- just north of a $100million of items that we have arrangements with a couple states. They've been signed off with them in writing. Those arrangements now are with CMS and we are just waiting for a final signed contract. And they go retroactive to within the year. So we continue to include that in our outlook for the year. But I would tell you, we don't see a reason why we won't get there with all the states. We just think there maybe timing on those and we\u2019ll call that out if that happens. But Texas, we feel like that\u2019s going to be more next year now than it will be this year in terms of a signed contract. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re referring to when we talked about administrative items. It\u2019s the timing of getting the final signed contract is when we record the revenue. Joe Swedish : All right. Thank you, Wayne. Thanks for the questions, really robust discussion today. I know there are still folks in the queue and I\u2019d like to suggest that if there are kind of lingering questions, both Doug and Wayne are available to take your calls later today and fill in some of the gaps that might have been created. But let me just underscore couple of closing points. First of all, we're very pleased with the substantial progress our company has made, not just in this quarter, but over the course of the entire year and I think, it's really important for me to underscore that perspective. This occurred in the year of remarkable change. Our game plan for 2014 is played out better than expected. I think we are very proud of that and in addition to the financial success we've enjoyed this year. I'm really pleased with our progress in driving toward performance-based culture within the company. The financial results for \u201813 and \u201914, the foundation for growth that we've established, support our confidence that I hope you detect, that our structure, our leadership and our strategies are all pointed in the right direction. We do remained focus on execution, as well as the need to continue to invest in our future to drive greater healthcare quality and affordability, which I believe is a hallmark of our focus going forward. To recap, on the back of the strong third quarter today, we raised our enrollment, cash flow and EPS outlooks for 2014. We are targeting growth in 2015 and remain optimistic about our longer term opportunities across both our business segments. I want to thank all of our associates, who really performed remarkably well for their and given all their hard work that underpins our success as a company and our transformation into this performance-based culture that we now have embedded throughout the company. Thank you for joining us this morning and for your interest in the company. We look forward to speaking to you next quarter.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to the Company\u2019s management. Doug Simpson : Good morning and welcome to Anthem\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. This is Doug Simpson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Presenting today are Joe Swedish, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayne DeVeydt, Executive Vice President and CFO. Joe will start with the discussion of our fourth quarter 2014 financial results and the macro backdrop, and then Wayne will review the quarter\u2019s financial highlights in more detail and provide additional commentary on our 2015 outlook. Q&A will follow Wayne\u2019s remarks. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our Web site at antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in today\u2019s press release and in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Joe. Joe Swedish : Thank you, Doug, and good morning. Our first quarterly discussion since our corporate name change from WellPoint to Anthem. We are pleased to announce strong 2014 adjusted earnings per share of $8.85, as we previewed two weeks ago with membership and margins tracking well in the fourth quarter. We ended 2014 with 37.5 million members, which was about 250,000 higher than the mid point of our previously guided range. For the full-year 2014, we added over 1.8 million members, representing growth of 5.2% versus year-end of 2013. Our growth was balanced in 2014 as we added 815,000 Medicaid members, 607,000 National members and 412,000 Local Group members. With attrition in the fourth quarter, as expected, our public exchange enrollment stands at 707,000 members at the end of the year. Driving our strong fourth quarter results were solid contributions from both our government and commercial divisions. Specifically in the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.80 on a GAAP basis and $1.73 on an adjusted basis. Our GAAP earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share increased from the fourth quarter of 2013, driven by an improved medical loss ratio, administrative expense control, and opportunistic capital deployment. As we discussed in our preview two weeks ago, we did see an adverse impact in the quarter in the delay of certain Medicaid revenues into 2015, a possibility we discussed on the third quarter call. Additionally, the flu season started earlier than expected. However, these issues were largely offset by the positive underlying financial performance of the business and the recognition of reimbursement of 2014 health insurer fee in Texas. Further supporting the quality of our earnings, we generated strong operating cash flow of approximately $305 million in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date cash flow to approximately $3.4 billion. We\u2019ve remained focused on our capital deployment strategies as well, repurchasing over 2.8 million shares during the quarter for approximately $343 million and paying $117.6 million of dividends. For the full-year, we repurchased 30.4 million shares or 10.4% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the year for approximately $3 billion at a weighted average share price of $98.52. Let me turn to providing you an update on business development activity. During the fourth quarter, we advanced our strategic goals with our announcement in December of the acquisition of Simply Healthcare, a Medicare and Medicaid company with a strong presence in the state of Florida. We have received antitrust clearance from the Department of Justice for the transaction to proceed and we expect to close during the first half of the year. Similar to how we integrated the acquisition of Amerigroup, we expect to maintain leadership to continue growing the business profitably. This is a well-run plan with deep expertise and a local market understanding we expect to leverage for growth. We expect the transaction to be EPS neutral in 2015, though its financials were not yet included in our forecast. We do expect to grow the business profitably in 2016 and beyond. At the time of announcement, Simply Healthcare had approximately 166,000 Medicaid members and attractive market share in the southern part of the state, which complements our presence in the middle part of the state very well. Once the deal is completed, we will be the second largest Medicaid plan in the state of Florida. Simply also serves 22,000 Medicaid members through a four-star plan and is positioned to grow. The company has strong provider collaboration agreements in place and a large percentage of their membership is in shared risk arrangements, which help improved care coordination and better managed costs. Simply also owns and operates a statewide specialty HIV AIDS plan with 9,000 members. This brings us incremental talent and local market knowledge and is indicative of the types of M&A opportunities in which we are interested. In addition to a strong Medicaid business, Simply provides us with a strategic footprint in an important state with a growing Medicare Advantage population. While we continued to capitalize on organic growth opportunities within our businesses, we remain focused on attractive M&A that augments those opportunities as Simply does for us in Florida. We are also making progress transforming our Company to succeed with new market structures and expanding upon our competitive advantages in our markets. The health insurance industry has started to shift from a historical business-to-business model towards a business-to-consumer model and that shift will continue going forward. On top of that, new rules in the market have changed the dynamics of how we position our products and put focus on increasing enrollment. As a result, we are intently focused on serving as a protagonist to advance affordability and access for our growing membership. First, we\u2019re changing the way providers and insurers interact with one another to lower medical costs and include quality for healthcare for Americans, such as our recent agreement with Aurora Health Care, in Wisconsin. We are leading the way in structuring innovative, groundbreaking agreements with our providers including a focus on value-based payments. Currently we\u2019ve more than $38 billion in spend tied value-based contracts, representing 30% of our commercial claims and approximately 40,000 providers. This includes enhanced payments for performance and shared risk with bundled payment arrangements. We have 118 ACO arrangements as well as other collaborative efforts such as patient centered medical homes, hospital quality and safety programs, and other partnerships that share financial risk and gain. We are proud to have taken the lead in working together with our provider partners to move toward a structure that financially rewards activities to improve health, healthcare and affordability. Second, we\u2019re ramping up our efforts around cost of care management including enhanced efforts to comprehensively review our medical cost profile and identify actionable opportunities. This includes establishing line of sight accountability and enhancing trend analytics. Third, we are striving to meaningfully improve the consumer experience by leveraging technology to deliver simple, convenient, and productive experiences to our members. A recent industry survey by Foresters found that health insurance plan score at the bottom of 13 different industries in terms of consumer experience. The industry has unfortunately held this spot every year since the survey started in 2007. Our goal is to change this dynamic and our strategy is to create and improve customer experience as a distinguishing characteristic of Anthem. Consumers are assuming a higher cost burden with increased decision-making responsibility and they\u2019ve very specific expectations about how their health plan should serve them. For Anthem, 70% of our plan growth over the next five years is in consumer choice markets. As part of our focus on the consumer experience, we continue to upgrade our IT capability to drive greater agility and cost efficiency for our Company. This is a multi-year effort to bring our business into line with the needs of our customers. To support that initiative, we recently announced a $500 million deal with IBM for operational services to improve the flexibility and responsiveness of our IT infrastructure. Specifically, IBM will provide operational services for both our mainframe and data servers. Once implemented, we will use both our traditional in-house IT infrastructure as well as IBM's cloud capability to serve our members. This agreement is part of our five-year plan to enhance our ability to respond rapidly to evolving market demands and deliver on our commitment to drive greater affordability for our members. Additionally, we recently launched an innovation studio center in partnership with Deloitte, which will enable us to rapidly develop new capabilities that are relevant to technology savvy consumers. We need to lead in creating a better relationship with consumers and ensure that we\u2019re improving our ability to serve them in a positive way. We believe an improved customer experience can be a critical point of differentiation to improve retention and customer loyalty, and will support members\u2019 efforts to manage their own health and make informed choices. I\u2019d like now to turn to discuss our commercial business and the execution of our strategies. Commercial revenues declined in the fourth quarter by 1.9% year-over-year to $9.7 billion, primarily due to the previously announced conversion of the New York State account to self-funded status, which impacted revenues by about $2 billion a year. Additionally, revenue was pressured by membership declines in small group. These were partially offset by additional premium revenue to help cover new healthcare reform fees as well as self-funded membership growth. Commercial operating margins improved as expected from 2.6% a year-ago to 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014, due to the changing mix of the product portfolio as we\u2019ve discussed with you previously. Membership trends in the commercial business during the quarter were encouraging as our Local Group membership came in above expectations. This was primarily driven by better than expected growth in our large group business and higher-than-expected retention rates in our small group business. Our total individual membership declined by 121,000 members during the quarter, primarily driven by an expected membership attrition toward year-end and we ended 2014 with approximately 1.8 million lives. The 3Rs we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate. We\u2019ve also recorded a net payable for risk adjusters and are in a net neutral position on risk quarters. We believe our estimates are prudent given the dynamic nature of available information. We expect to continue to refine our estimates in these areas as our 2014 claims data develops over the next few months and the relative risk profile for our various competitors become clear within our markets. As we discussed last quarter, with respect to our Small Group business, we continue to be mindful of the potential for employer coverage changes in light of the exchanges. In the fourth quarter, we had a meaningful number of small group members up for renewal and we did see small group member decline. However, the declines were less than expected due to the success of our retention strategies including grandmothering and an improved and competitive position across our markets. Small Group has now declined almost 400,000 members year-to-date and stands at 1.46 million members. I would now like to turn to the Government segment and speak to the solid fourth quarter results. Our Government business segment added an additional 118,000 members in the quarter, driven by a strong growth in Medicaid and generated revenues of $9 billion, up approximately 17% quarter-over-quarter. The Government business represented over 48% of our consolidated operating revenues in the quarter, as our business continues to evolve and diversify. Medicaid enrollment was up an additional 116,000 members in the fourth quarter, bringing year-to-date growth to 815,000 members. We\u2019re very pleased as both organic membership growth and enrollment coming online from recent contract awards exceeded our expectations. Medicare enrollment was relatively flat in the fourth quarter as expected. We are feeling better about our Medicare Advantage membership outlook, but still expect a modest decline in 2015 as we continue to reposition that book of business. Government operating margins improved 180 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 3.9%. This primarily reflected the impact of various retro rate adjustments as expected during the quarter, as well as the timing issues previously discussed related to the delay in recognition of certain Medicaid revenues into 2015 and the recognition of reimbursement of the 2014 health insurer fee, in Texas. I\u2019d like to now turn to an update regarding 2015 outlook. We currently expect GAAP earnings per share of greater than $9.30. As we discussed in our third quarter conference call, we\u2019re also going to update how we report adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted earnings per share will now exclude deal related amortization expense as well as realized gain losses. On this basis, we project 2015 adjusted earnings per share of greater than $9.70. We started 2015 with 37.5 million members, which was better than expected and creates a favorable starting point for 2015 enrollment. For 2015, we expect a continuation of the trends and performance we saw in 2014. In our Commercial business, we expect modest growth in individual with continued pressure in the small group business, albeit less so than in 2014. We also see strong self-funded growth in 2015 and we\u2019re pleased with our initial trends toward 2016 national account selling season. In the Government business, Medicaid should again be a strong growth driver for us as we will recognize the full-year financial impact of growth that came on line throughout 2014 and the additional membership growth we expect in 2015 from new contract awards. We also expect the progress we\u2019ve made recently in restructuring the Medicare business to positively impact earnings. We currently expect operating cash flow in 2015 to be greater than $3.5 billion and we expect this to be another active year of capital deployment. As we discussed last quarter, we\u2019ve been evaluating an increase in our dividend payout ratio as a result of our confidence in the cash flow profile of the Company related to the growing diversity of our business. As a result, yesterday our Board approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.625 per share from $0.4375 per share in 2014. Our dividend has now increased every year since 2011. And subject to market conditions, we\u2019d expect our dividend to continue increasing over time. We will remain disciplined steward of shareholder capital. In the last two years alone we\u2019ve returned $4.6 billion through share buybacks and approximately $930 million through dividends to shareholders. This year we expect to return $2 billion to $2.5 billion through share repurchases and approximately $700 million in dividends to shareholders. We remain focused on appropriately returning capital to our shareholders while ensuring financial flexibility for investment in future growth opportunities and potential M&A. In summary, we\u2019re proud of our performance in 2014 and believe we\u2019re well positioned for growth in 2015. And Wayne is going to walk you through the details. Wayne? Wayne DeVeydt : Thank you, Joe and good morning. My comments today will focus on the key financial highlights from the fourth quarter of 2014. I\u2019ll also provide commentary on our 2015 outlook. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $1.80 for the fourth quarter of 2014. These results included net investment gains of $0.07 per share. Excluding these items, our adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.73 for the quarter. For the full-year 2014, we reported earnings per share of $8.99 on a GAAP basis, $8.85 on an adjusted basis with the high-end of our previously guided range. As Joe noted, we\u2019re pleased with our 2014 results and feel well positioned to grow earnings per share in 2015. Medical enrollment declined by 32,000 members, a 0.1% sequentially to approximately 37.5 million Medical members as of December 31st. This reflected membership declines in our Individual and Small Group businesses, partially offset by gains in our Medicaid and Large Group businesses. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with our membership result which were approximately 250,000 higher in the mid point of our previously guided range. Operating revenue was nearly $18.8 billion in the quarter, an increase of approximately $1.1 billion or 6.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2013, reflecting enrollment growth in the Government business and additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends and new fees associated with healthcare reform. For full-year 2014, we reported operating revenues of $73 billion, an increase of $2.8 billion or 4% from 2013, including the adverse impact of the previously discussed transition by the State of New York account and fully insured to self-funded status on January 1st. Our 2014 revenues were slightly below our previously guided expectations as we were adversely impacted by higher than expected experience rebate accruals in the Medicaid business, as performance was better than expected and higher than expected risk adjusted accruals in the individual business. The benefit expense ratio was 84.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of 330 basis points from the prior year quarter. The decline reflected continued strong medical management and the impact of the premium revenue designed to help cover new healthcare reform fees. We are pleased with gross margin performance on both of our business segments in the quarter and year as we reported full-year 2014 benefit expense ratio of 83.1% at the low-end of our previously guided range. Our SG&A expense ratio increased by 120 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2013, to 16.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014 as expected largely due to the inclusion of various healthcare reform fees in 2014. For the full-year 2014, our SG&A expense ratio was 15.1% with the high-end of our previously guided range as the Company made investments in areas directly supporting our expected growth into 2015 and beyond including provider collaboration, consumer centricity and medical cost management. Consistent with our past practice, we\u2019ve included a roll-forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning\u2019s press release. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2014, we experienced favorable prior year reserve development of $542 million, which was modestly better than our expectations. Development was consistent with the prior year-to-date period. We continue to maintain our upper single-digit margin for adverse deviation and believe our reserve balance remains consistent and strong as of December 31, 2014. Days in claims payable was 42.5 days as of December 31st, down 1.5 days from 44 days as of September 30th and up 3.8 days from 38.7 days at the end of 2013. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 38.5% at December 31, 2014, down 10 basis points from 38.6% at September 30th. And we ended the fourth quarter with approximately $2.7 billion of cash and investments at the parent company, and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of $958 million as of December 31st. Moving to cash flow, we generated stronger-than-expected operating cash flow of $305 million in the fourth quarter, or 0.6 times net income. For the full-year 2014, we generated operating cash flow of approximately $3.4 billion or 1.3 times net income. We repurchased more than 2.8 million shares during the quarter for approximately $343 million, representing a weighted average price of $121.17. As of December 31st, we had approximately 5.7 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining, which we intend to utilize over a multiyear period subject to market conditions. We used $117.6 million during the quarter for our cash dividend and yesterday the Board declared our first quarter 2015 dividend of $0.625 per share to shareholders. Turning to our 2015 outlook. We see 2015 as a year of continued growth across our business. We currently expect operating revenues to grow approximately 7% to 8% in 2015 with roughly 2% membership growth across our business. In Commercial, we expect meaningful enrollment growth during the year. We expect growth of over 200,000 lives for national accounts in 2015 with strong momentum during a quieter year for RFP activity. We also expect growth in Large Group enrollment driven by self-funded contract wins. We expect modest growth in the Individual business next year. So we expect to maintain our leading market share in our collective 14 states. Our assumptions prove to be conservative, that changes are made to the duration of the short and open enrollment period or for retention metrics developed above our current expectations. On the negative side, we do expect further Small Group attrition. Though fourth quarter retention rates were better than expected, we\u2019re still forecasting membership decline in 2015 North of 100,000 lives. For Government, we\u2019re also expecting another strong enrollment growth year. We expect Medicaid to add approximately 300,000 lives, reflecting the addition of new business in the state of Tennessee, as well as continued organic growth in core and expansion products. Within our Medicare business, we continue to expect MA enrollment to decline modestly in 2015 with some offsetting growth in Medicare supplement and dual eligible populations as new state programs go live. We also expect stable margins in 2015. We currently expect an MLR of 83% plus or minus 30 basis points in 2015 consistent with our 2014 levels. Our forecast does incorporate an expectation for lower Medicaid gross margin after the very strong performance in 2014. However, 2015 MLRs will be favorably impacted by the increase in health insurer fee, which impacts operating revenue and G&A expense. Related to cost trend expectations, we expect 2015 Local Group medical costs trends to be approximately 7% plus or minus 50 basis points with a return to a more normal utilization trend and higher hepatitis C drug cost. We currently expect our SG&A ratio in 2015 to be 15.1%, plus or minus 30 basis points. This reflects the impact of the rising health insurer fee in 2015 and investments we\u2019re making to support our strategic initiatives offset by leverage across our business. Below the line, we expect investment income of approximately $660 million and interest expense of approximately $635 million. We also currently expect our tax rates to be in the range of 43.5% to 45.5% for the year, reflecting a significantly higher health insurer fee in 2015 which is non-deductible for tax purposes. We expect to invest $2 billion to $2.5 billion in share buybacks this year and currently forecast a share count for the year at 270 million to 274 million shares. This is in addition to the $700 million we expect to pay in dividends to shareholders. To conclude, our 2015 GAAP earnings per share estimate is greater than $9.30. Our adjusted earnings per share outlook is greater than $9.70. The difference between these two forecasts is the exclusion of the amortization of deal related intangibles as we discussed in our third quarter call. While we do not offer quarterly EPS guidance, we do expect more than half of our 2015 earnings per share to come in the first half of the year, with the first quarter representing the highest quarterly earnings and the fourth quarter representing the lowest. This reflects both the timing and impact of our membership gain and the accounting related to the exchanges. Looking out longer term, we believe that 2018 targets remain appropriate and achievable. Our 2014 performance was better than expected and we currently expect 2015 revenue growth with 7% to 8% and operating income growth in the mid single-digit, prior to any health industry fee impact. I\u2019d also note that our current outlook does not yet include Simply Healthcare which is expected to close during the first half of the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Joe. Joe Swedish : Thanks, Wayne. And with that, operator, please open the queue for questions. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. I might just ask you to expand a little bit on some of the medical cost trend commentary. I know in the fourth quarter we\u2019re seeing -- with the fourth quarter release you\u2019re saying the 2014 medical cost trend ended up being about 6.5%. I think in the third quarter commentary, you said it was trending towards the lower end of the 6% to 7%. Is that -- is there a slight variation there or is that just the way the variances in commentary? And then, for the \u201915 commentary, can you flush out the 50 basis point step up? It sounds like it\u2019s mostly hepatitis C, but I just want to confirm that versus other puts and takes and your sense on where the medical cost trend is going? Wayne DeVeydt : Thanks, A.J. Good morning. Let me first address your first question. As we had said in the third quarter, we did expect trend to be in the lower half of that 6.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. Not necessarily the low end, we had -- we were intension [ph] about the lower half. Probably the one item that surprises a bit in the quarter was nothing to do with core run rate or core medical trend, but really was just the flu season starting earlier than expected in the level of flu that we saw in our markets. But outside of that, really no surprises and had that not occur, we still would have been squarely in the lower half of expectations. Relative to the future medical trend of 7% plus or minus 50 basis points, we do have increased hep C costs in there, but recognize while we got a bit surprised in \u201914 on the level of hep C costs, the actual cost per drug that is included in our medical trend though that you see in the 6.5%. So you already have some of that baked in when we start going into \u201915 and then we\u2019ve added increased hep C cost as well as some underlying utilization that we expect to start returning to a more normal level. So I think all-in, we think we\u2019re finishing \u201914 though in a good spot relative to our pricing going into \u201915. So cautiously optimistic at this point on the pricing that we see into the New Year. A.J. Rice: Okay, great. Just on that fourth quarter flu commentary, would you say that the flu had a bottom line impact or was there sort of a marginal -- was there pennies involved in impact? Wayne DeVeydt : I mean it was over a nickel impact versus our expectation. So it gives you a little bit of flavor that, the best being at the high-end of our guided range we actually outperformed it, but it was north of a nickel impact. A.J. Rice: Okay, all right. Thanks a lot. Joe Swedish : A.J it\u2019s Joe. Just to let you know data we\u2019re tracking suggests that the flu exposure is plateauing if not declining slightly which is sort of given what we see in prior somewhat of a normal trend. A.J. Rice: Right. Joe Swedish : So, again we\u2019re optimistic that the plateauing is sustainable. A.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Christine Arnold from Cowen. Please go ahead. Christine Arnold : Hi, there. Could you help me quantify some of the Medicaid impacts? I think you had a delay of some of the $100 million that you expected, but then you did get Texas retroactive. How much of what you expect it to get this year is moving into next year versus being realized in the quarter? How do I think about a run rate there? Wayne DeVeydt : Hi, Christine. Good morning. They\u2019re almost, I mean, within a $1 million an exact offset of each other. So essentially what we pushed into next year the Texas essentially offset it almost dollar to dollar like we said within a few million dollars. But keep in mind; we fully expected to collect Texas. We just weren\u2019t expecting to get the letter on December 31st allowing the reimbursement, so we had assumed that we would get that in January. So in some way to somewhat of a flush it doesn\u2019t affect run rate in the next year because while we did take some of the earnings out of this year and push to next year, we did accelerate the Texas earnings though out of next year into \u201914. Christine Arnold : And if I understand correctly, you\u2019re looking for the loss ratio to rise in Medicaid. Is that because you\u2019ve kind of maxed out profitability relative to the quarters or is it because you\u2019re seeing some rate reductions or is it the duals? What\u2019s behind your expectation on the MLR for Medicaid next year? Wayne DeVeydt : I\u2019d put it into three different buckets. The first bucket is we had exceptional performance in our Medicaid to the point that we recorded very sizable risk collars back to many states this year. And so, we are at what I will call optimal margins in certain programs. And we\u2019ve assumed a more conservative outlook on that, although I would again indicate that underlying trend seems to be playing well. So hopefully that will prove to be at least a prudent may be a conservative outlook. The second thing I\u2019d say is we\u2019ve new states we\u2019re expanding into. So in the case of Tennessee, we\u2019re expanding into new markets and we\u2019ve many expansion lives coming on. And so as we typically deal with new membership coming in, we automatically assume a higher MLR and a lower margin. And so that\u2019s putting a little bit of pressure on the overall margins. And then the last thing is just that as we continue to build out capabilities for the new growth pipeline we see out there, we\u2019re putting some more G&A investments into new states that we expand -- or planning to expand in and hope to win. And that puts a little bit of short-term margin pressure on it, but it\u2019s for a longer term revenue and operating gain. But all-in Christine, I mean, we -- I\u2019d say if there is a reason for margins to go down, this could be the -- this is the right side of the track to be on. Christine Arnold : Right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Justin Lake from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks, good morning. First, on the individual book specifically the exchanges, it sounds like your corridor accrual if I\u2019m -- I was hearing correctly went from positive in the third quarter to flat in the fourth quarter. And then, I think you actually -- you might have said risk adjustment also may have moved negative in the quarter. So I just wanted to get some update on the individual book margins and those puts and takes? Wayne DeVeydt : Hi, Justin. Yes, really good question. A lot of moving parts here, more complicated than it should be, but let me try to make it a little more simple. On the risk corridor, yes we had a very slight receivable. We chose to book 100% valuation allowance against that slight receivable, so obviously our concern is whether collectability will ultimately be there. So we are more at neutral, but it's not moving the needle for us. We didn't have a receivable as you know our profitability in the books have been quite good so, and it's based on a market by market. So it was more conservative posture to put a valuation allowance against the collectability of that receivable. Obviously, that proves to be collectible then it\u2019s very modest outside though. Relative to the risk adjustors, I think we\u2019ve decided as a Company that we had a lot of new data points that would imply that we could have a more sizable payable. The [indiscernible] data at 9.30 would have implied that we had a net receivable. As you know we booked a 100% valuation allowance against that as well under the premise that that could switch and change. And so, we hope that will prove to be conservative that we chosen a book of payable at 12.31 and if it does prove to be a conservative that will be upside to 2015. Justin Lake : And so where are the margins, are they still shaking out around that 3% range? Wayne DeVeydt : We are north of 3%. Justin Lake : Okay. Is it closer to 4% to 5%? Wayne DeVeydt : Yes, I would say our targeted margins of 3% to 5%, we\u2019re well within the higher end of our targeted margins. Justin Lake : Okay. And then, just a follow-up on the Government business, specifically, how do we think about that $100 million give or take that\u2019s going to be received in 2015? Would we think about that as kind of a one-time benefit so as we think about the growth rate off 2015, would that be a headwind, Wayne, given that it's attributable to \u201914? Wayne DeVeydt : No, I think the one thing, Justin, the reason we don\u2019t view it as a headwind is while its attributable to \u201914, we really have these type of items happen to us just about every single year. What was a little bit unusual was to have north of $100 million in timing occur, so the good news was with us collecting a little bit more than half of that, you really got back to a point where it was back to what I\u2019d call more of a typical run rate of what kind of flows from year-to-year. So I\u2019d say from our perspective we\u2019re not really concerned about it and unfortunately, I guess, that we will probably have another $50 million in \u201915 that probably will ends up in \u201916 so -- and we\u2019ve assumed that in our outlook, in our plans. So I think we\u2019re more in a run rate now. Justin Lake : Got it. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Matthew Borsch from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matthew Borsch : Yes, good morning. Can you tell us what your outlook is on the Medicaid rate updates and the rate resets, and maybe if you can breakout where you expect development on rates that are specific to the Medicaid expansion populations versus the existing pre-expansion business? Wayne DeVeydt : Good morning. I would say the Medicaid rate environment, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic. Still lot of moving parts there, but we\u2019ve been successful in our rate negotiations. As you know many of the rates at least going into \u201915 were finalized in \u201914. Now obviously we\u2019ll go through a new rate cycle beginning second half of \u201915. In general I think we\u2019re optimistic about the rates that we were able to achieve. We think we\u2019ll continue to have industry leading margins, but we think that\u2019s because we provide an industry leading value in terms of the overall cost we provide to the state, and I think that\u2019s the important part to keep in mind. The other thing to keep in mind Matt is that we had sizable callers in the hundreds of millions of dollars in terms of better than expected performance. So those callers serve as a reasonable buffer to future trend if it was to occur relative to the rates as well. So, all in, I would say we really like our chances on the Medicaid front and how we\u2019re addressing new populations and I think the Medicaid team has really done an exceptional job managing this very unknown environment in about an optimal ways you could possible be. Matthew Borsch : Sorry. Can you just remind us how the callers worked, does that mean that you\u2019re paying money back to the states when you\u2019re outperforming? Wayne DeVeydt : That\u2019s correct, Matt. So to the extent that we achieved MLRs below a certain threshold, we\u2019re writing a check dollar for dollar back to the state. And so I think again the point we wanted to make was, we finalized our rates but even in finalizing those rates has also seen sizable callers that were going back from this year. So, there\u2019s a bit of a buffer there that if for some reason the rate would be deemed inadequate, keep in mind you would have to burn through a lot of caller activity that we\u2019ve had this year as well before you ultimately get to a point of being short on rates. So -- but yeah, our MLRs and many of our expansion markets came in south of what those minimum floors were. Joe Swedish : This is Joe, again. I also want to underscore another part of the equation, because there is the rate situation or negotiations that goes on, but also I think its fair to underscore aggressively we\u2019re pursuing medical cost management as a contributor to how we better manage that book as well as others. Specifically building out data analytic capabilities, really a passionate commitment to effectively managing the medical cost trends I think really benefits us over the long-term. So, it\u2019s really sort of a two sided coin here in terms of rate negotiations as well as medical management both cost focused. Matthew Borsch : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Rigg from Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead. Chris Rigg : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on the individual comments with you\u2019re seeing modest growth for 2015. Can you give us a sense for sort of the churn or retention rates in that business versus new member adds? Thanks. Wayne DeVeydt : Hi, Chris. So, first let me comment on the modest growth. We are still seeing relative to the new lives coming into the system, us getting our mid 20% range market share. So, I do want to first start with, this is not a growth store issue around new lives coming in. And I would say retention has been decent, I mean, kind of what you would expect with an individual book. What we are seeing now, and part of the reason for the more modest view is, overall employment in the economy is starting to improve. And as that starts to improve, individuals start getting jobs, and as a result they drop their individual healthcare coverage. And so, the one thing that we feel good about though is that, we still think we\u2019ll have modest growth. If the economy really does take off though and we saw that gets more flattish or even slightly down, we have got a pretty big catchers net with the way our book is build. And so, ultimately we will most likely pick up much of that membership in either a large local group business or a national account business. So, I view it a little fungible regarding the growth, but I think we still expect modest growth. But if the economy really takes off, that could decline. But again we would expect to have offsetting beats in other lines of business. Chris Rigg : Okay. And then, the follow-up is just on Medicare Advantage. Understand the comments on 2015, but assuming the rate environment for \u201916 remains reasonable. Do you think you can grow that business next year? Is the repositioning essentially down at this point? Thanks. Joe Swedish : Yes, this is Joe again. We have stated that we do expect a slight decline in membership for MA for \u201915 and again that\u2019s a continuation of the repositioning of that portfolio, so that it -- it does become a solid performer for us going forward. It builds a great foundation in terms of adding membership in key markets in an effective way given the business model we build out. Our sense is that, going into \u201916 obviously we\u2019re looking forward to a combination of organic growth and the potential of M&A activity similar to what we just announced regarding Simply Healthcare in Florida. So, we\u2019re very mindful of M&A opportunity, and also just basically organic growth I think will continue to be a great benefit to us. So, I think net-net we\u2019re going to be well positioned for what comes our way and we\u2019re very optimistic about our potential going forward in MA. Chris Rigg : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Sarah James from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Joe Swedish : Sarah, are you there? Operator : It looks like we lost her line. So, we\u2019ll go to Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Ana Gupte : Yes, thanks. Good morning. I was just trying to see what other puts and takes in your 83% consolidated loss ratio guidance for 2015 across commercial and if any color on small and large group like changes in Medicare and Medicaid? Wayne DeVeydt : Well, I think relative to the overall guidance in the MLR, generally pretty stable for the year across all of our lines of business, no real outliers. We\u2019re expecting to maintain our margins in general across various books, but we see margin declamation. Again it more like what we talked about on the Medicaid in terms of some new markets and some new investments versus what I would call real pressures. Again we think we priced right, that\u2019s the key, and we priced for a rising trend. And we -- again our starting point is good at this point, and its really in the year, but January cash flow seems to be at least supporting our assumptions at this point, so, more to come. But I would simply say that, as you look to the various businesses in 2014 it will be a very comparable MLR for each of the lines of business in 2015. Ana Gupte : So, just to follow up then, Wayne does small group, is the margin compression done at this point and secondly on your reserve expectation you\u2019ve been remarkably stable for three years on the 500 plus that was assumed into guidance? Wayne DeVeydt : Yes. So, two things; one is on the small group. We really expect this to be the last what I would call more meaningful wave of attrition and margin compression that would occur. So, from a membership perspective we are assuming we\u2019ll loose north of a 100,000 lives in \u201915, and we have about $100 million of EBIT headwind this year as a result of that margin compression. But in essence after this year we\u2019re kind of on a very flat to growth trajectory again. So, that is included in our outlook and our guidance. The second part of your question, on the blank what it was. Ana Gupte : The reserves, it was like 540 I think you said that in your prepared remarks. Wayne DeVeydt : Yes. Thank you, Ana. And we have assumed no reserve releases in our outlook or anything of that sort. We would expect reserves to develop very similar in \u201915, now what you have seen in \u201914 and \u201913 et cetera. So at this point, if that proves to be conservative then that would be an upside to our earnings outlook as well. Ana Gupte : Thanks, Wayne. Very helpful. Wayne DeVeydt : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Scott Fidel from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Thanks. First I just had a question just following up on individual and the modest growth that you\u2019re expecting. How would you expect that, that\u2019s going to break out between on-exchange growth as compared to off-exchange attrition? Then just interested in terms of what you\u2019ve seen so far in terms of how the rest of the mix is developing for year two, and how those new joiners that are coming into the exchanges this year appear to be looking from a risk profile perspective? Wayne DeVeydt : Thanks, Scott. So, let me start with the individual market on the modest growth. I would say really it\u2019s somewhat fungible between our on and off exchanges at this point. Everything seems to be kind of holding the line as the year develop, so nothing really crazy. I mean, I would say on-exchange is going to grow and we\u2019re getting new market share and off-exchange will have some attrition, but similar to what we saw in \u201914. Relative to new entrance and new markets, I guess what I would say is, in general pricing seems to have stabilized more. We\u2019re not seeing as wide of the variability or variation in pricing as we saw in \u201914 and it seems that there has been a bit of a regression to the mean in terms of pricing which is a positive. We continue to see some outliers, generally new interest that we scratch our heads on in terms of the pricing and, so that may slow some of our growth in certain markets for a short period of time But we think over time that similar pricing has to prevail, because if it doesn\u2019t, financial solvency becomes an issue, and so, we for those other entities. So, I think in general we think industry is handling a very unique and unknown environment in the right way with pricing. We\u2019d like to see the regression in the mean and I think as the Three R start to dissipate over the next couple of years, I think you\u2019re really going to see rational pricing come even into play. Scott Fidel : Okay. And then just, I had one follow up, and just with Simply now coming online in Florida and then you have obviously the Amerigroup platform already there in Florida. How do you view the positioning of the government platform for Anthem now in Florida after the Simply acquisition? Do you feel like, you\u2019ve now got the pieces in place for Florida or do you feel like you\u2019d need to do sort of further actions in order to get it to where you would want to be long-term? Joe Swedish : Yes, it\u2019s a great question. Thank you. Simply, I assume you\u2019re aware of the -- of this growth dynamic we created for ourselves by now becoming the second largest player in the state of Florida which is a very solid position especially South Florida combined with the regions we\u2019re already performing in. So, our sense is that we\u2019re extremely well positioned in Medicaid going forward especially if there is the prospect for expansion in that state becomes a reality which obviously is still somewhat speculative. So, again I think we\u2019re very well positioned in that regard. I hope that answers your question. Scott Fidel : I\u2019m sorry, Joe. I was sort of meaning the combination of Medicaid and Medicare just in terms of Simply\u2019s Medicare capabilities ...? Joe Swedish : Yes, and excuse me I should have kind of weighed in on Medicare as well, because that really gives us a good foot hold in a very dynamic state regarding Medicare or MA membership and it\u2019s potential. So obviously we certainly intent to leverage our new found position in the state, especially given the fact that we\u2019ve got some very expert management associated with Simply that will be coming into the company. We fully intent for that leadership team to continue to support Simply and the overall footprint that we have in the state. So, I think we\u2019re very well positioned for growth going forward in both MA and Medicaid. Scott Fidel : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we\u2019ll go to the line of Sarah James from Wedbush. Please go ahead. Sarah James : Thank you and I apologize about the technical difficulties earlier. There has been a lot of talk about the price ticking behavior of exchange members. And now that we are in year two, can you talk about, how you\u2019re seeing that balance against brand loyalty or consumers just not wanting to re-bid every year, so giving us a sense of the overall stickiness of the book. Joe Swedish : I\u2019ll take a shot at it first by simply saying that I think stickiness is real. It certainly has played out as we expected. Given our entry last year migrating into the second year, I think stickiness has played out particularly related to our Blue Cross Blue Shield brand identity in our 14 states where we have played. So, our sense is that, that certainly has been a so called asset for us. So our strategy is playing very well with respect to our pricing model and especially leveraging our brand identity in all the markets that we serve. We really like our position going forward in the market regarding how we priced and obviously continuing to leverage our brand identity. So, long story short, stickiness is real. We believe its sustainable and, but I do want to underscore that, certainly is the determinant as well and we\u2019re very mindful of the combination of pricing, brand and network configuration being three core ingredients regarding how people will make their decisions going forward. But again I think brand stickiness is a significant driver and will remain so for the foreseeable future. Wayne DeVeydt : Sarah, one thing we want to add to Joe\u2019s comments is that, our strategy was not a \u201914 strategy. It really was a post Three R strategy and where we wanted to take our organization. And so, I think one of things too to keep in mind is, having a first year mover and a first mover advantage, we think is meaningful. But we think the ultimate value, that value proposition and how that affects pricing over time and how that a price affects market share, really it can't be measured until you get closer to \u201917 and \u201918, because when you think about the unknown to Three R\u2019s, if those still haven\u2019t been settled and they\u2019re not getting settled until probably second quarter of \u201915. So, I still don\u2019t think people can say that they had complete visibility on all of the factors that affect pricing. And so, I think from our perspective though, we have taken a conservative posture on all those factors. We\u2019ve priced well in the first year, we have achieved all of our margin goals that we set for ourselves as a company, and we know what the consumer makes decisions on beyond just price, including brand and product design, and we have really learned a lot in this first year. But keep in mind, this is a multi-year strategy and we\u2019re going to have to trudge through a few years, but we still think of some irrational behaviors. But once those pass, we really think the value of this strategy is really going to shine when you get out to the \u201916, \u201917, \u201918 time periods. Sarah James : I appreciate all the color. And if I could just clarify one comment from earlier. The $0.05 of flu, how did that fall between Medicaid and Commercial? Wayne DeVeydt : So, it was north of $0.05 and it\u2019s roughly split, fairly evenly between the two. Sarah James : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Tom Carroll with Stifel. Please go ahead. Thomas Carroll : Hi, guys, good morning. Also just a clarification on some prior discussion. The Medicaid rate retro payment in Texas, I think you guys were expecting to get paid for the tax. But you hadn\u2019t explicitly assumed the gross up. So, is that something that we should consider here in terms of kind of a run rate discussion kind of what Christine was getting at? Maybe that\u2019s a nitpick, so I apologize for that. And then secondly, kind of a high level question on your outlook. The press release and this call seem to be very favorable and the outlook seems to suggest if you look on a, your old methodology basis, kind of a 5% EPS growth over 2014 level. So if I\u2019m doing the math correctly, it seems like you could double that on repurchase and capital deployment alone. So, I guess the heart of my question really is, where do you feel like you could see points of concern in 2015 that may hold things back more or is there just a good bit of flexibility in your outlook? Wayne DeVeydt : Good morning. Let me start with your gross up of Texas, I mean that\u2019s a good point. So, we did not assume that we would get the non-deductibility to tax initially in our outlook, so that was upside to us relative to Texas. But again if you were to take the actual model received plus the gross up, it literally is within a few million dollars of that amount that got differed to next year on some of the retro rate stuff. So again still on that flush from that perspective. Thomas Carroll : Okay. Good. Wayne DeVeydt : Relative to outlook, it\u2019s a very fair question, is what I\u2019ll start it with. I want to highlight that as you know, we do have a 40% increase in the industry tax this year which we want to manage through. We have many investments that we are making for the long-term all around growth, both in our commercial and our government businesses. And those are reflected in here as well as many investments that Joe has really pushed the pedal to the floor on around shutting down the system platforms and other items, things that will really drive value into \u201916 and beyond that you cannot see in the \u201915 outlook. And then lastly I would simply say, we have the small group headwind of north of $100 million of EBIT. But all that being said, core operating gain is still growing very meaningfully with that. And I would say that, we feel that we\u2019ve given the least prudent guidance of a greater than number and if, we don\u2019t need a lot of things to fall our way. We just need to make sure that we maintain our conservative posture and we could have opportunity for our performance. But three weeks into the year, so lots still due and our job is to execute with the agility as a lot of these unkowns become known. Thomas Carroll : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. I just wanted to go back to the small group commentary, it sounds like you guys feel like it will be through the margin compression in 2015. But just trying to understand I guess two things, one is whether if you had any conversations with those customers, those who have not yet dumped, whether there is any view that the risk that they will dump increasingly in the future, is there -- or whether this is something that really isn\u2019t heard, haven\u2019t turned out to be the issue that people thought that might be just trying to understand. I know you have re-priced the margin between the two, but clearly there is a risk about re-capturing those members on the exchange if they do in fact dump. And then second, any issues at all in the kind of the 50 to 300 range. It wasn\u2019t, its never been 100% clear to me why you guys felt like there wouldn\u2019t be at least some pressure in the 50 to a 100 range, and why kind of the $400 million was only related to that, to the small group? Wayne DeVeydt : Kevin, let me start with the first part of your question which was, we\u2019re having discussions with our customer\u2019s conversations around this, I mean, and the answer is absolutely. I think its -- and these questions kind of go hand in hand, the two comments you raised. I mean it\u2019s important to recognize though that, that generally speaking for a company that has fewer than 50 employees just the economics, the math of their business models would generally imply there is a value benefit to them moving to a public exchange versus not. And as you get to a larger size employer, that value benefit diminishes. And so, one is, there\u2019s just an economic play that we think an employer can look at. Two is, because there is no penalty for dropping coverage below 50 lives is also a natural incentive then for employers to not only evaluate the economics but recognize there is not a penalty for not providing coverage\u2019s of some sort. So, we have regular discussions with our customers. We were very pleased with our retention of small group renewals in December, and we hope that gives us a little bit of a positive starting point going into \u201915. But I would say though that, its not just about small group retention, because again we set up a lot of customers in small group, it\u2019s about margin compression. And I think that\u2019s the other part people have to remember though is that, there is an alternative available now and that alternative has lower margins than what we have in small group and our goal is to make that alternative fungible between the two. And then, in the 50 to 100 segment, in general our market share has been relatively stable. In some spots we have lot a little bit of market share but nothing that\u2019s really concerning and I think -- we actually think we\u2019re going to start growing in that area now that we\u2019ve seen some of the shakeout of exchanges. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. Then maybe just to clarify, because again to the extent that we do see again you could be agnostic margin wise between the two products, but any color you have on how you think about your local market share in the small group or even up to a 100 versus the exchange market share? Is it reasonable to assume that you would capture your fair share of that membership that moves in or is there potentially a risk from a membership perspective if there was somehow a wholesale dumping or a larger scale dumping than we\u2019re seeing now? Joe Swedish : We really like our chances on maintaining even the market share that we have between the two and that our catchers they kind of pick some up wherever they fall. But I want to clarify; I\u2019ll caveat my comment with one thing. Not necessarily all in one year though. And the reason I said that is again, we still see some players in certain markets that we think have to get right sized on pricing, and so as we\u2019ve seen Kentucky and a few other markets, we understand that we may not have the market share we had and then as people move from one bucket to another we may not maintain that market share. But we think overtime that sustainability to the market comes and as the Three R start to dissipate, and we\u2019ll see that market share come back in. So, obviously for \u201914 we think we\u2019ve accomplished that goal quite well. We\u2019re assuming we\u2019ll do something similar in \u201915, and -- but we really think you\u2019ll see potential growth in beyond our market share as we get to a more stable environment through the end of \u201916. Kevin Fischbeck : That makes sense. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our final question this morning will come from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Peter Costa : Thanks for squeezing me in at the end here. Can you guys talk a little bit more about private exchanges and what you\u2019ve seen happening there between 2015 and 2016 selling season? Where do you think that\u2019s going at this point and then also, the second question around your PBM structure? Do you see that evolving this year in any way shape or form from what you have used in the past? Joe Swedish : This is Joe, I\u2019ll take on private exchange and then Wayne you can pick up on PBM. We have been, I think well positioned regarding private exchange formation for go-to-market effort. We have been believer now for quite some time that there is going to be a relatively slow uptake on private exchanges, and I think in fact that has come to pass. We have had about 100,000 members in the private exchange space for quite some time. Having said that though, I think we\u2019re extremely well positioned because we do believe that there will be an inflection point in the not too distant future where there probably well be an increasing interest in private exchanges, so I think this moment in time has given us tremendous opportunity to prepare. Get aligned with a variety of interest in the market that are advancing various models. So long story short, I like our chances when that moment comes and I think that, the private exchange market place has potential albeit it\u2019s been a slow uptake. So, it\u2019s out there, we\u2019re ready and I think we\u2019ve got the experience that\u2019s necessary to actively engage when that moment comes. Wayne DeVeydt : Pete, relative to the PBM, let me first start by saying that similar to what we said in our Investor Day last year, we continue to expect significant value for our members and our shareholders regarding our PBM and its value that, that the question really becomes a matter of win not if we\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019ll begin to hopefully garner some of this value for our shareholders and members sooner than later. But we obviously don\u2019t discuss our relationships or any negotiations regarding those relationships in a public environment for competitive reasons. But in general, our goal is to ensure that we get all the rights that were allowed into our contract and to also ensure that those values go to not only our members but our shareholders. Peter Costa : Is there market check explicitly in your contract? Wayne DeVeydt : Yes. Peter Costa : Thank you. End of Q& A Operator : Thank you. And I would now like to turn the conference back to company\u2019s management for any closing remarks. Joe Swedish : Thank you for your questions everyone. We\u2019re pleased with the operational performance last year. It clearly was a year of substantial change to our markets and our associates I believe have done an impressive job of navigating the market rules and executing on our strategies. I also believe we\u2019re making progress in advancing our positions in the market with respect to core elements, such as provider collaboration, cost of care management and our ever increasing focus on the consumer experience. While we made progress in these areas, there is substantial room for further gains. I\u2019m really confident that we are appropriately focused on our long-term market position. Our structure, leadership and strategy are all pointed in the right direction. We are targeting further growth in 2015 and beyond and really remain optimistic about the meaningful opportunities across both of our business segments. I\u2019d like to thank all of our associates for their efforts that drive our company success and importantly our transformation into a performance-based culture. Thank you all for joining us this morning and for your interest in Anthem. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. All the best. Operator : Thank you.

I would now like to turn the conference over to company's management. Doug R. Simpson - Vice President- Investor Relations : Welcome to Anthem's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. This is Doug Simpson, Vice President of Investor Relations. With us this morning are Joe Swedish, President and CEO; and Wayne DeVeydt, our CFO. Joe will discuss our first quarter 2015 financial results and the macro backdrop and also provide additional commentary on our 2015 outlook. Joe and Wayne are then both available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Joe. Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Doug, and good morning. We're pleased to announce a strong first quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $3.14, with membership and margins tracking well thus far. We ended the first quarter of 2015 with over 38.5 million members, in excess of 1 million members more than the 37.5 million members we reported on our fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. Our growth continues to be balanced so far in 2015 as we added 429,000 Medicaid members, 371,000 National members, 102,000 Individual members and 82,000 Local Group members. Notice that this is the first quarter where our results include the impact of Simply Healthcare, which we closed in February and which contributed 205,000 members as of March 31. Driving our strong first quarter results were solid contributions from both our Commercial and Government segments. Specifically in the first quarter, we reported earnings per share of $3.09 on a GAAP basis and $3.14 per share on an adjusted basis. Our GAAP earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share increased from the first quarter 2014, driven by revenue growth, an improved medical loss ratio and opportunistic capital deployment. We're pleased with the evolution of our diversified business model and believe it bodes well for future growth opportunities. In the first quarter, our membership grew to over 38.5 million lives and our quarterly revenue approached $19 billion. This quarter also marked the first time that Government business represented slightly more than half of our consolidated operating revenues. The diversity of our business model is serving our members and our shareholders well as we leverage capabilities and investments to drive improvements in cost and quality. During the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of Simply Healthcare, a Medicaid, Medicare company in the State of Florida. The deal is expected to be earnings neutral on a GAAP basis and to be slightly accretive on an adjusted basis in 2015. Simply's local market experience and strong provider relationships augment our position in the important Florida market and improves our ability to serve local communities with Medicare and Medicaid offerings. Our provider collaboration efforts continue to grow and we now have roughly $50 billion of our aggregate healthcare spending in value-based contract, of which over half flows from shared saving, shared risk or population-based payments with the balance in pay-for-performance arrangements. Details vary by contract and market, but they're generally characterized by upfront payments for care coordination and an opportunity for shared savings with our Enhanced Personal Health Care program as a good example. It's about aligning incentives to encourage smarter, collaborative decision-making that fosters healthier outcomes and a better patient experience. Our position aligns with the goals laid out by HHS earlier this year, calling for 30% of all Medicare fee-for-service provider payments to be in alternative payment models that are tied to how well providers care for their patients by 2016 and increases the goal to 50% by 2018. In the first quarter of 2015, we have added 18 accountable care organizations, bringing our total number of ACO contracts to 139. To-date, the program includes contracts with over 37,000 primary care physicians through ACOs and patient-centered medical homes who are accountable for the cost and quality of care of 3.8 million Commercial members. Notable among our new ACOs is an expanded partnership with UC Health, which is Greater Cincinnati's academic medical system covering both our Commercial and Medicare Advantage plans. Under this new arrangement, UC Health's providers will accept value-based reimbursement tied to the total cost of care for their panel of attributed members and gain the opportunity for shared savings payments for meeting specified quality and cost efficiency targets. We've finalized a study of the results of the first year of Enhanced Personal Health Care and are encouraged by what we have found. We conducted a rigorous analysis of the results comparing members in our Enhanced Personal Health Care program versus those who are not to determine the program's effect. Earlier results show improved acute care admissions, inpatient days and lower ER utilization, and these improvements led to gross savings per attributed member per month of $9.51. Additionally, our focus on cost of care management is advancing, generating incremental improvements of over $150 million for 2014 and 2015. We have improved analytics to identify actionable trend drivers and we have increased the sharing of best practices across our Commercial and Government segments. We're conducting deep dives on cost of care across our markets and identifying local leadership to drive further improvements in cost outcomes. Finally, our focus on an improved customer experience is aimed at delivering intuitive and easy experiences to our customers through the channel of their choice. Our consumer culture team is dedicated to systematically modifying the mindsets and behaviors of our associates. Our consumer work is concentrated on improving the experience associated with key areas such as shopping, post enrollment, and transparency and payment. Our research confirms that customers don't want to exert too much time or effort on their health insurance. Consequently, we are focused on optimizing our capabilities to deliver exceptional services that more closely mirror those experiences that consumers enjoy in the other aspects of their lives. We have a partnership with American Well whereby our consumers can have a virtual physician visit 24/7, 365 days per year in 44 states. We also offer convenient care options through LiveHealth Online, which lowers costs and reduces unnecessary ER and urgent care visits. Tools such as Anthem Health Guides help navigate the healthcare system, and our relationship with (9:02) helps our members better understand their healthcare options and choices. We believe the ability to reduce complexity and frustration will be differentiating factors for us. I'd like to now turn to discuss our Commercial business and execution of our strategies. Commercial membership rose 555,000 in the first quarter, to 29.9 million members. However, revenues declined in the first quarter by 3.4% to $9.4 billion, primarily due to the previously announced decision to discontinue our Employer Group Medicare offering in the state of Georgia account. Self-funded membership trends in the Commercial business during the quarter were encouraging, increasing by nearly 800,000 versus year-end 2014. This was primarily driven by better-than-expected growth in our large group business. Private exchange has remained a smaller part of the story, but they're growing off that smaller base. We currently serve 280,000 Commercial members through active group private exchanges, up from approximately 127,000 at year-end 2014. Roughly two-thirds of these lives are on a self-funded basis, and most of this growth is flowing from our National Accounts segment, with membership coming through exchanges operated by major consulting firms, with the balance generated either through Anthem Health marketplace or broker-led exchanges. The majority of this volume is from existing business, but approximately 35% represent new members to Anthem. While still a small piece of the overall book, we expect private exchange enrollment will continue to grow within our mix over time. We're optimistic about the outlook for the 2016 National Accounts selling season, having already closed on two large new accounts with a combined membership opportunity of several hundred thousand lives. We have a solid pipeline for National Accounts, and expect solid growth in this area in 2016. Insured membership in the Commercial business declined, as expected, in our large group and small group businesses. The large group business decline reflected the decision to exit the Employer Group Medicare Advantage market in the State of Georgia account, which was reflected in our Local Group membership, as it was with the Commercial customer. Small group membership declined by 96,000 in the quarter, with total membership ending at 1.36 million. Individual membership grew by 102,000 during the quarter, due to growth in public exchange lives, partially offset by expected contraction in non-metal products. The amount of contraction was less than anticipated, as retention rates in these non-metal products were better than expected. We believe our exchange strategy is playing out well overall, and our early read is that the demographics of exchange lives appear slightly younger than last year's population. In the first quarter, we grew exchange membership by 191,000 lives, to 898,000. Overall in the first quarter, Individual exchange enrollment growth was light of our expectations due to lower aggregate growth in exchange lives in our served market and continued pricing pressure in certain markets, including New York, Kentucky and Colorado. We believe that we will continue to grow share as the market pricing backdrop stabilizes toward a more sustainable level, and co-ops and other new entrants gain more experience. For Three Rs, we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate. For risk adjusters, we have slightly increased the net payable position for the 2014 benefit year and have established a net payable position in the 2015 benefit year as well. For risk quarters, we are now in a slight net payable position for the 2014 benefit year, and are in a net neutral position for the 2015 benefit year. We believe our estimates are prudent given the dynamic nature of available information, and we expect to continue to refine our estimates in these areas, as the relative risk profile of our various competitors become clearer within our markets. I'd now like to turn to the Government segment and to speak to the solid first quarter results. Our Government business segment is having another strong growth year, adding 483,000 members in the first quarter, driven by strong organic growth in Medicaid and the addition of Simply Healthcare, while generating revenues of $9.5 billion, up approximately 19.4% quarter-over-quarter. Medicaid enrollment was up an additional 429,000 members in the first quarter. We are very pleased, as both organic membership growth and enrollment coming online from recent contract awards exceeded our expectations. The pipeline of opportunity for our Government business remains substantial. We currently estimate $65 billion of new business could be awarded by the end of 2018, split about evenly between traditional Medicaid, and new populations and specialized services. We believe our experience and footprint positions us very well to continue our growth as we help states address the challenges of lowering healthcare cost and improving quality for their residents. Our Medicare enrollment grew slightly in the first quarter, largely due to the acquisition of Simply Healthcare. Excluding Simply, membership remained stable, as our retention was slightly better than expected. Government operating margins improved 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 3.4%. This primarily reflected improved medical cost performance in certain markets in our Medicaid business. I now want to turn to discuss the key consolidated financial highlights from the first quarter of 2015. I'll also provide updated commentary on our 2015 outlook. As I stated previously, on a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $3.09 for the first quarter of 2015. These results included net investment gains of $0.08 per share, $0.01 per share of expenses for the early retirement of debt, and $0.12 per share of expenses for deal-related amortization. Excluding these items, our adjusted earnings per share totaled $3.14 for the quarter. Medical enrollment increased by over 1 million members, or 2.8%, during the quarter to approximately 38.5 million medical members as of March 31. This reflected membership increases in virtually all lines of business. Operating revenue was nearly $18.9 billion in the quarter, an increase of approximately $1.2 billion or 6.8% versus the first quarter of 2014, reflecting robust enrollment in the Government business and additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends and new fees associated with healthcare reform. For the first time in our company's history, the Government business accounted for more than 50% of our quarterly revenue. The growing diversity of our business aligns with our long-term strategy as we believe we are well-positioned to continue capitalizing on future growth opportunities. The benefit expense ratio was 80.2% in the first quarter of 2015, a decrease of 250 basis points from the prior-year quarter. The decline reflected a lower medical cost ratio in the Local Group and Individual businesses due to the timing of medical cost experience, improved medical cost performance in the Medicaid business, and the impact of an increase in the health insurer fee for 2015. For the full year 2015, we continue to expect underlying Local Group medical cost trends to be in the range of 7% plus or minus 50 basis points. Our SG&A expense ratio increased by 50 basis points from the first quarter of 2014, 16.7% in the first quarter of 2015, as expected, largely due to higher healthcare reform fees in 2015 and higher administrative costs as a result of the strong membership growth during the first quarter. Moving to the balance sheet, days in claims payable was 45.7 days as of March 31, up 3.2 days from the 42.5 days as of December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher reserves associated with new membership coming online throughout the quarter. As previously discussed, we expect delays (18:48) in claims payable to come back down to closer to 40 days over time. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 39.4% as of March 31, 2015, up 90 basis points from 38.5% as of December 31. We ended the first quarter with approximately $2.8 billion of cash and investments at the parent company and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $1.1 billion as of March 31. Moving to cash flow, we generated strong operating cash flow of nearly $1.7 billion in the first quarter or 1.9 times net income. As a reminder, our first quarter cash flows are historically higher than the average quarter as we pay our first and second estimated federal income tax payment in the second quarter. That said, cash flow trends in the first quarter are encouraging and we remain comfortable in our outlook of greater than $3.5 billion for the full year. In addition to closing the Simply acquisition during the quarter, we repurchased nearly 5.7 million shares during the quarter for approximately $774 million, representing a weighted average price of $136.88. As of March 31, we had approximately $4.9 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining, which we intend to utilize over a multi-year period, subject to market conditions. We used $167 million during the quarter for our cash dividend, and yesterday the Audit Committee cleared our second quarter 2015 dividend of $0.625 per share to shareholders. Turning to our full 2015 outlook, we continue to see 2015 as a year of continued growth across our business. We're updating our outlook for full year 2015 adjusted EPS from greater than $9.70 to greater than $9.90, which reflects the solid core trends and run rates seen in the first quarter. First quarter results and underlying medical cost performance tracked well versus our expectation and bode well for the remainder of 2015. As we said last quarter, the first quarter was expected to represent our highest quarterly earnings level this year. While we do not offer quarterly EPS guidance, we expect the second quarter to be the strongest of the remaining three quarters, with the first half of the year approaching 60% of our full year EPS. We expect the fourth quarter to be the lowest quarterly EPS figure for the year as a result of the diminishing impact of the Three Rs, the timing of member months, and our overall business mix. We continue to expect operating cash flow in 2015 to be greater than $3.5 billion and this will be another active year of capital deployment. In that regard, we remain focused on maintaining an appropriate balance between returning capital to our shareholders and ensuring financial flexibility for investments in the future growth opportunities and potential M&A. While we are encouraged by the underlying trends in the first quarter, it remains early in the year, and we believe our full year outlook is reasonable and prudent. Wayne and I will now be available for questions. Operator, can you open the queue? Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question is from A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe just asking on the cost trend. I know you highlighted the experience with the new members being part of the dynamic, but you did outperform us by quite a wide margin, I think, consensus on the MLR trend. Can you drill down a little bit more what you're seeing? I know some of the others have talked about the updated hep C contracting being a factor. And are you just being conservative at this point and not signaling maybe that you're toward the low end of your medical cost trend outlook for the rest of the year, or is there something that we should keep in mind on that? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi, A.J. Good morning. Appreciate the question. Let me start by saying that we're only 90 days, really one quarter into the year, and I think from our perspective it was just prudent to wait till we saw the second quarter settle itself out. That being said, if the trends we had seen in the first quarter were to continue, we clearly would have a bias towards the lower end of our current guidance range at this point in time and really around the things you've highlighted. We are expecting a lower hep C cost for the year and a lower utilization than we had anticipated at this point in time. And overall, we think trend is playing well in all lines of business and in all segments. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then just maybe quickly on my follow-up, I think there was an expectation that there might be some Three R data available from CMS in the spring. That seems to have gotten pushed back. I know there's a hope that we get some final data out in the fall. Can you just maybe walk us through what you're expecting, if you've gotten any preliminary information from them, and how that might affect the back half or rest of the year cash flows and your thinking about these days claims payable you're running? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so relative to the Three Rs, we really don't think that we'll get, as an industry, real quality data till early third quarter, most likely in the July timeframe. The question will be, will we get it prior to 2Q earnings, where we'll have an opportunity to reflect that. That being said, we are using the Wakely data and other information that we can find available and we continue, we believe, to reserve towards the more conservative end of a range of outcomes. We hope that that proves to be the case, which is a reflection of why our DCP has also continued to be an elevated level and the impact of those. It's important to recognize, though, that there's a combination of DCP being impacted by just strong reserves. The Three Rs in and of themselves do not necessarily reflect in DCP. So, we think we have conservatism beyond what's in the DCP at this point in time. Relative to cash flow, our outlook does assume a payout relative to the expectations we've booked at so far. So again, to the extent that that proves to be conservative, we would have upside both in our outlook and our cash flow. But I do want to reiterate, there are a lot of moving parts on the Three Rs and a lot of data that is not in our current custody (26:04), and we're going to need to get the actual data from CMS to be able to finalize any estimates. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Josh Raskin from Barclays. Please go ahead. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Just want to talk a little bit about the membership trends. I'm curious, the additional 200,000 lives on the ASO front, maybe just some color as to where that's coming from; is that in-group growth or is that better sales? And then, it looks like you're expecting membership to actually trend down the rest of the year, and I don't know if that's exchanges or if there's something there. And then I guess part C of my one question is just any expected impact from the Assurant sale and what you see in the market from those guys? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Josh. Relative to the ASO, it's a combination of mostly in Local Group. So, we are winning new accounts in Local Group. We obviously had already assumed the significant membership growth in our guidance regarding National Accounts, but we're being successful in the markets. There is some in-group change, but I would say it's a much smaller impact of the membership beat than it is actual new membership wins. So, we're definitely encouraged by that. We have the membership trailing down though in the back half of the year primarily due to the exchanges. We saw last year that a lot of the enrollees after Q1 actually migrated down throughout the year. We took a conservative posture in our guidance last year, assuming that would be the case, and that in fact played out to be the case. So we're going to assume a similar trend this year, which is a lot of the membership comes in heavy in Q1 and then as the year progresses it slowly ratchets down. Relative to the Assurant, which I know many of you probably saw last night, I would just say this, Josh, that this is the trend that we thought would be occurring regarding public exchanges. And I think we've been fairly vocal that we think that companies have to not only be local to get the cost of goods sold advantages they need, but they have to have significant depth, and you need to have national G&A leverage to be able to comply with the MLR rules. So, I think these opportunities are going to become more and more as this environment has the Three Rs go away. And from our perspective, we plan to be a participant in that membership as it becomes available. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And then, just a quick one, Wayne... Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Josh... Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: ...Josh, this is Joe. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi 28 :21). Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Good morning. I just want to add on to the nice commentary Wayne provided. A very small wrinkle is the small group, which we're going to continue to see declines in membership, as we expected, something north of 100,000 lives. So I just wanted to bring that in, because last year, we had a decline that escalated a little bit more than we had originally forecast, and I think this year, we're expecting continued decline, albeit maybe not as aggressive. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then Wayne, I think you said in the release that PPRD was a little bit higher than expected. Was there a P&L impact that didn't get replenished? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. Regarding prior period, while it was slightly better than we expected, we believe we've re-established all of it within the balance sheet as of March 31 and we think the DCP would be a good idea to point to, in terms of that strength. So, it did come in better. That generally bodes well then as well, Josh, as you know for underlying trend then, because our pricing is assuming a higher level than what we actually saw come through, but we do believe we've re-established it at March 31. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Fidel from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Just questions on the Medicaid side. First, maybe if you can just flag some of the markets that you referenced where you're seeing the particularly favorable medical cost trends, and how that's playing out maybe with some of the floor requirements in those markets? Then just unrelated follow-up, would just be interested in, I know it's a small market for Anthem overall, but your thoughts on the Kentucky Medicaid reprocurement and how much rebasement in the rates you think could occur as a result of that? Thanks. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Scott. Let me first talk about the Medicaid and where we're seeing the positive trends. To be candid, I would say that we're generally seeing it across the board. This appears to be a muted (30:18) trend versus expectations. All markets are performing well relative to our expectations. We continue to have states, such as the State of Florida, where we assume, with the expansion, that we would have a much higher MLR. That proved to be the case. We are looking for continued improvement in that market versus the pricing environment, but we are expecting rates that will be much more commensurate with what we're seeing in the actual underlying trends in the State of Florida. And the last thing I would just say is, regarding Kentucky Medicaid, at this point, we're happy with the reprocurement. We think it will give us an opportunity for a bigger piece of the pie than what we initially got with our entry into the market last year. As you know, the rates are an evolving process, so more to come on that, is what I would say. But generally speaking, we're very encouraged, not only at the reprocurements that are out there, because we think we have a chance, not only of retaining but growing, but the significant pipeline that Joe highlighted earlier on in the dialogue today. Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Chris Rigg from Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead. Chris D. Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to see if you guys could provide any color with regard to public exchange enrollment and how, or if, utilization has changed amongst those members sort of year-to-year, people that you've had enrolled for 15 months or so, whether there's been any material difference between how they've used the system, versus people that are more traditional to the healthcare system. Thanks. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Chris, let me first start by saying that generally speaking, the demographics this year on employment base (32:02) versus a year ago are just slightly younger. So I would say, all things being equal, things are playing out relatively similar to what we had expected in the prior year. I would say the volume, though, is not what we had expected. So if we were to point to one area where we were anticipating more volume than we actually got, it was in the public exchange arena. And we think that's going to result in an interesting dynamic, as the year progresses, on what lives shifted to where, in terms of the new lives that came in, and what implications that may have on the Three Rs. That being said, I would say that it's still early, 90 days in. Remember, a lot of these members last year, because of the exchanges not operating effectively in Q4, really didn't come on until late Q1, early Q2. And so, they started to burn through their deductibles early on in that period, more in the Q2 timeframe versus this year, it's in the Q1. So it's too early to really make a declaration if the trends on that previous membership are improving this year, and it's part of the reason for us maintaining our current trend outlook. Chris D. Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Christine Arnold from Cowen. Please go ahead. Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, there. I know you're not giving guidance for 2016, but could you give us, broad strokes, how you see things playing out? Is there still opportunity to improve the public exchange margin from here? Is Medicare Advantage going to improve? How do we think about the duals versus Medicaid and small group? How do we think about kind of pluses and minuses for next year? Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Maybe I'll take a run briefly, and then let Wayne jump in. But just to underscore what we said last year, we're continuing into this year, our margin expectation in that space is about 3% to 5%. We see no reason that that would change through the balance of the year, even going into next year. I think the driver going into next year is the fact that we're going to see this marketplace stabilize, in the sense that other players are going to gain more experience. We have said repeatedly that we believe that pricing will probably gravitate toward a tighter band as more plans become \u2013 getting better experience at the membership they're pricing. So our sense is that this market will evolve by way of maturity, and we think stabilization will certainly play to our benefit in terms of membership capture going into 2016. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And to add to Joe's, Christine, I agree with everything Joe highlighted. I think it's just important to recognize what makes 2016 so unique is that it's the first year with no meaningful headwind. We don't have an increase in the health insurer fee in 2016. Our small group attrition will have meaningfully run its course by the end of this year in terms of the op gain impact. So as we move into next year, we don't have a meaningful headwind to point to but we do expect a tailwind from public exchange growth with stability in margins. We do expect growth in National Accounts. In fact, we've already logged and locked into significant accounts that will be north of $100,000 in growth already, and we're still in the midst early in the selling season for National for next year. We expect large Local Group growth as well. Medicaid, not only the expansion of margins in those states that are not at our targeted margin levels, but at the same time we expect more membership to continue to come in with all the RFP procurement. We do expect meaningful EBITDA improvement in Medicare starting in 2016 as the first year of the meaningful improvement in a multi-year. And then finally, we expect capital deployment to still play a factor in our EPS growth, not as meaningful maybe as it has in the past but to really start seeing our investments paying off on the top line and the operating earnings growth. Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC : Hi, good morning. It's Dave Styblo in for Windley. Thanks for the questions. Want to come back to A.J.'s original question about the cost trend and actually take it a step further and translate that to EPS. With you guys beating (36:03) by $0.45, $0.50 at least relative to the Street, how did that compare to what you were expecting? And then, I also know you mentioned there was some benefit of timing related to the Local and Individual medical cost experience. Can you quantify how much that was? And at the end of the day, I'm just trying to get a better sense of why the guidance increase was only $0.20 versus something that perhaps might have been better than the 1Q outperformance? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, let me first point to a few things. We had previously highlighted that we expected first quarter to be the highest quarterly earnings level for us. That being said, we did obviously outperform on a run rate basis our own expectations. So at the same time, as we saw last year, there was a significant amount of uncertainty around the Three Rs and how the membership mix would come into play. We believe that uncertainty is real and will continue through 2Q. If that plays out to be better than expected, we would consider raising more. But at this point in time, we felt comfortable and confident in the $0.20 raise with good line of sight. And again, as more time pans out, we'll see where that goes. But as I said early on in the call, if cost trend stays where it was at in Q1, we could have a much more outperformance than we've guided to at this point. But again, it's 90 days into the year, it's a little early to declare this. David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC : Sure, that's fair. And then just a follow-up on the Medicare margins, you talked about that in 2016 as an opportunity to expand. What's your overall book of margins and how much or at least how much further margin expansion potential is there to get to your targeted range, call it, over the next two or three years, whatever that might be? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We believe a more sustainable margin in Medicare is around the 5% range, and we're several points below that on a sustainable basis. So, I would view it as several points to go on a book that's also going to be growing over time. But I would remind everyone that that's over a multi-year period as we get more of our membership into the four-star rated programs. David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC : I apologize if I misspoke, I was actually referring to Medicaid. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'm sorry, in the Medicaid. On the Medicaid front, we generally think still 3% is the targeted margin that you would want to be participating in over time. We continue to perform well in many of our markets at our targeted margin levels, but I would tell you we have new entry markets that are performing below that level. So we have opportunities not only to improve those markets, Florida being one of those, but in addition to that \u2013 and Kansas being another one \u2013 but I would say in addition to that, the RFP pipeline is meaningful. And just keep in mind that with the RFPs, Individuals generally bid closer to a break even in year one and then you ratchet up over a multi-year period to your target margin. David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes, hi. Good morning. I thought maybe we could just go back to the enrollment trends for a minute and maybe talk about what you saw. I think you said 96,000 down in small group. And given your knowledge of the customer base, what's giving you confidence that we're reaching the point where that's going to stabilize and you won't see more attrition? And to the extent you've had some perspective of time now, where do you see that enrollment going? Is it then covers drops (39:34) to the ACA exchanges, Medicaid or other places? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Matt, a real good question. And I want to clarify a point here that the stabilization isn't so much in the membership of small group; we may see attrite much more. The stabilization is in that margin fundability between small group and public exchanges. As you know, our goal was to build the biggest catcher's mitt we can build so that whether a member was in Medicaid, a public exchange, small group, that we would have the ability to pick them up in whatever market. And so, we are seeing, what I would say, a much bigger headwind in EBIT that's been coming down between last year and this year versus the actual membership. So you may continue to see membership in small group attrite, but just recognize that we are now getting closer to targeted margins whether they're in the exchange or small group or Medicaid that we would be comfortable with it. Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And, sorry, just to follow up on the larger group side, what are you seeing there in terms of is it continued preference particularly in the middle market at least at the margin for self-funding given that the added burden of the ACA fee that's now increased for this year? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We're still seeing the self-funded be the preference on the larger group side. But I will tell you, as the private exchanges are growing, and still small but more than doubled in the last year, we are starting to see some accounts move from self-funded to fully-insured. Again, not many yet, but the early trend is starting to occur. So again, I think as we get closer to 2017 and the Cadillac tax, that may potentially be an accelerator. Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: This is Joe. Just to underscore, you recall last year we're talking about a private exchange membership enrollment of about 100,000 lives. And we've certainly seen that grow this year, not substantially but certainly the pace has picked up. That gives us some line of sight, to Wayne's point, that we believe that there's probably an escalating interest in private exchanges. So, we're very mindful of that. I mean we're building our platform to adapt to that shift. And as we've consistently stated, we will be ready when that inflection point occurs. And there's, quite frankly, a very quickened pace toward private exchanges, which we believe will occur in the coming year or two. Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. A question on the public exchanges. So, I guess you're booking a risk corridor for 2014 but not for 2015. Does that imply that maybe you outperformed your margin target there in 2014 and expect a little bit of pressure in 2015? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, I wouldn't necessarily view it as that. We had a very de minimis risk corridor in 2014. We achieved our targeted margins. We had a little bit of a receivable but we booked a valuation allowance on it. We had, obviously, a payable as well. The net of the two is a net payable, but not meaningful. And I would just say that as we priced for this year, we were trying to price at a level that would be commensurate. We didn't see much value in contributing money into a kitty at the expense of consumers not getting the best price available in the market. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. But it sounds like you may have been at the high end of the range and now you're pricing to normal margin. Is that the way to think about it? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Again, I would say the corridor last year was so de minimis that we're still at the high end of the range. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then just to clarify a comment you made on the private exchanges, you said, I guess, 35% of the membership that you got was new to you. But did you see net enrollment growth there, because I guess your customers would have contributed some membership into the exchanges as well? So just trying to figure out whether there was a net addition. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : On the private exchanges, yes, yes. We saw enrollment move from around just north of 100,000 at the end of 2014 to over 280,000 at the end of the first quarter this year. So about 180,000 member growth almost, both a combination of new membership as well as conversions. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : But I guess I'm just wondering if you had customers representing 300,000 members that moved into the exchange, getting 200,000-plus is actually a net loss. So I'm just trying to understand if you have that number, whether overall it was a net win for you. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That was a net win. About 35% represent new members to us in the exchanges. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. All right, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Andy Schenker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Sort of, just first, a housekeeping question following up on the last one there. So the true-ups on the Three Rs related to 2014, did they actually have an impact in the first quarter here? Was there actually some slight negative impact on the MLRs related to that? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Very de minimis, very de minimis. We took advantage of some new data and did a slight strengthening on the risk adjusters. But again, very de minimis to us. Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, so nothing meaningful going on. And then, sort of no one has asked yet, I guess I will. Given the close of Simply Health in the quarter, if you could just kind of remind us on your outlook here for capital deployment and your thoughts on M&A. Thanks. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, as you know, we funded Simply Health with cash on hand, which we were pleased with, and bought back more than 2% of our stock in the quarter. We still expect for the full year to deploy between $2 billion and $2.5 billion in the form of buybacks as well as continue to pay our annualized dividend of $2.50. And we still believe that will leave us with some flexibility at the parent north of $750 million of excess cash, which we like to maintain to have flexibility for tuck-in M&A along the way. Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : You mentioned you expected a strong selling season for 2016. I think that was in relation to the Commercial business. Can you put a little bit more clarity on why you believe that this early in the season, and also how you contrast that with your view of the expanded use of private exchanges by large employers? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Pete, one of the things is we obviously, at this point in time, have line of sight on those large National Accounts that are choosing to take their business out for either renewal or for new opportunities for us. The reasons for that is at this point in time, if the RFPs have come out, is that they have to make decisions generally by mid-year so that they can implement the new accounts by the end of this year so they have a January 1 effective date. So at this point, we've been very pleased with what we're seeing in the early selling season. We have already locked in two meaningful accounts that are new to us \u2013 net new accounts to us. And again, we'd like to think that we could have a similar close rate as we did last year, which was almost 50% success rate on new business. So again, early but feeling optimistic. One of the things I would highlight though that we think has lend itself to our success is that over the last several years, for year one, we've had the ability of offering a zero trend guarantee. And simply put, what we're finding is our customers in year one are actually getting negative trend and continued to get negative trend; that our cost of goods sold advantage on a national basis is so meaningful that anybody that switches to us, that we can generally show them in year one that they will actually have their costs go backwards. And that continues to be the case. And we have not paid any performance guarantees in three years around that zero cost trend guarantee, and it gives us a real unique advantage as we go after National Accounts. Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, and I think you asked a tag-along question about the exchanges, private exchanges... Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yes. Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And we don't really see that having any kind of material impact on shifting, let's say, membership capture like National Accounts, et cetera. As Wayne said earlier, we've seen a net add related to the private exchange uptake, and it's still modest. Let me just underscore, it is modest, but we're going to be very vigilant going into the year to determine how much more positioning we ought to establish relative to the growth of private exchanges, because we do believe it's coming. But again, it's not having any material impact on our membership capture going into 2016. Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : This is a tag-along to that. One of the weak points this quarter was the group Medicare Advantage business, which shows up as Commercial business for you guys. Can you talk about what you're doing to shore up the group Medicare Advantage business, or do you think that's just going to migrate to Individual business going forward? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, keep in mind that, with the State of Georgia procurement that we won last year, as you know, the state was required to make a decision to bring in more competitors. And so, we made a decision to actually leave the group MA business in the State of Georgia. So I think that is distorting the actual results of our performance, was the exit from the State of Georgia account for the purposes of group MA, but we plan to be a participant in the group business going forward. Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Do you view that as still an ongoing strong product for yourselves, going forward and for everybody? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We do, we do. Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, thank you. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : To make it clear, I guess we can say that Georgia was an N of one (48:56), we believe. Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Please go head. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the Commercial question. Your operating margin expanded by 440 bps to quite a remarkable 13.5%. What I'm hearing you say is, you're still seeing continued margin compression in small group. As I had understood last year, your Individual margins on the op exchange had expanded. You did not allude to much pressure on the public exchange side. In fact, it seemed like it was generally profitable from the get-go. So, it sounds like comps would've been tougher there. So, what is exactly driving so much margin expansion? Is it hep C or weather? It doesn't sound like it's PYD. So, is that sustainable? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, thank you, Ana. The one thing I would remind everyone though is, last year in Q1, we had very little visibility on any public exchange membership. As you know, that membership came in in late February, March timeframe. A lot of it came on in April, because they extended the open enrollment period. And we maintained very conservative reserves a year ago in Q1 for the unknown. So if you looked at our DCP a year ago, you'll see that it actually ratcheted down as the year went down and we got better visibility. So some of the profitability that we saw last year in Q3 and Q4, with hindsight, really belonged in Q1. And it's also important to recognize that deductibles are being met in Q1 of this year versus last year, they were being addressed in Q2. So I think you'll see those margins come down as the year progresses. We clearly will not maintain that level of margin. But when the year is done, I think we'll still have a very strong year-over-year margin of high-single digit to low double-digit range. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : It sounds like public exchanges. So, okay, follow up on that then, on the public exchange membership growth, where did you see the most competition, if you will? Was it more from new membership on uninsured, or was it retention of your existing small group or existing 2014 exchange membership? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : What's interesting is, we found the business to be fairly sticky. So we think the year one strategy was the right strategy, and the existing business remained fairly sticky. We did not garner as much business as we had expected on the new lives coming in. Again, we grew, but not nearly at the level we had anticipated, for a couple reasons. One is, we still have not seen the co-ops necessarily shore up their pricing at the levels we believe are going to be necessary. And we had anticipated they would shore up a bit more going into this year, but that in fact did not occur. So there are markets, and I think you can view those markets, like a Kentucky and a Colorado and other areas, where we're impacted by the co-ops. But generally speaking, we'd say the large national players, publicly traded companies, seem to be pricing fairly rationally. And so, it's more on the co-op side that we saw the pricing that we're willing to wait it out on. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Very helpful color. Thanks, Wayne. Operator : And our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. Good morning. I may have missed this; did you talk about the ASO book and what drove the higher enrollment guidance, and how much is being driven by new wins versus conversion of risk? And I guess, is it your sense that more mid and smaller employers are contemplating sort of shifting to self-funding, in part to avoid the industry fee, or do you think we're past that point? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Ralph. Yeah, we highlighted briefly at the beginning just the idea that the stronger enrollment was really around new Local Group membership wins. Very little was due to in-group change. So, just new wins in the market, continue to be successful across our many segments. I'd say the ASO trends have stabilized. As we said earlier, we're starting to see, even in the private exchanges, that people are starting to migrate to fully-insured. Again, it's small, but in general, it seems that the ASO trends have stabilized. And I think the next couple years, with the Cadillac tax, will be an important inflection point, to see how the markets respond. Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, that's helpful. And then, just on that private exchange and the shift, in your opinion I guess going forward, do you see sort of that migration to private ASO exchange or private risk exchange? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think it will be a little bit of both. Right now, it's about two-thirds is on a ASO basis and about a third is on a fully insured. The thing I would say is any member that moves from ASO to fully-insured, though while lower margin, is better cash flow. So it's all what you believe is the most valuable input. But from our perspective, we prefer the cash flow. Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And I guess just on that point, if it's sort of ASO to ASO, can you talk about the dynamics of the economics or the profitability of that? Is it fair to assume that given the greater competition, that that would be somewhat lower in terms of shifting to a private exchange? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, moving from a ASO to ASO does not necessarily change the economics. So moving from ASO to fully-insured does create a cap for the employer, a more meaningful cap that they can manage over time. At the same time, it does move to a lower margin business which requires risk-based capital associated with it. But that lower margin generally still generates two to three times more cash flow on a per member per month basis than you would have otherwise generated in ASO. So it's a little more capital intensive as they switch over, but in the long-term it generates a lot of cash flow, which gives us more flexibility in terms of investing in our business and in M&A. Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): That's helpful. I guess I was just talking more about ASO to ASO. So, you're saying the profitability on that would be similar. I would have just assumed when you move into private ASO, there could have been more competition in there that maybe would drive the economics of that business lower. Is that not the right way to think about it? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think it's fair to assume that that would be the case. But I would say because of our COGS advantage, we think we can show a value profit that allows us to maintain comparable membership and margins. Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we have no further questions in queue. Please continue with your closing remarks. Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you for your questions. Great having you on the call today.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later there will be a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Douglas R. Simpson - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning and welcome to Anthem's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. This is Doug Simpson, Vice President of Investor Relations. With us this morning are Joe Swedish, President and CEO; and Wayne DeVeydt, our CFO. Joe will offer an overview of our second quarter 2015 financial results and Wayne will walk through the financial details and our updated 2015 outlook. Joe and Wayne are then both available for Q&A. During the call we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Joe. Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Doug, and good morning. As this marks our third conference call in roughly a month, we're going to keep it as succinct as possible and then move right into Q&A. We're pleased to announce strong second quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $3.10 with solid membership and margin trends. On a GAAP basis earnings per share was $3.13. Our adjusted earnings per share increased from the second quarter of 2014 driven by revenue growth and improved medical loss ratio and opportunistic capital deployment. We ended the second quarter of 2015 with over 38.5 million members, over 1 million members more than the 37.5 million members we reported at the end of 2014. Our growth continues to be balanced so far in 2015 as we added 571,000 Medicaid members, 331,000 national members, 51,000 individual members and 16,000 local group members. As a reminder, we closed on the Simply Healthcare acquisition in February of this year, which contributed 209,000 members. These results have been supported by strong operating cash flow of $2.8 billion year-to-date, which represents 1.6 times net income. I'd like to start by discussing our Commercial business. Commercial membership has increased by 398,000 since year-end 2014. Revenues remain relatively flat in the second quarter, but have declined by roughly 6% since the prior-year quarter to $9.4 billion, primarily due to fully insured member declines, including the previously announced decision to discontinue our employer group Medicare offering in the state of Georgia account. Self-funded membership trends have been encouraging, increasing by 710,000 versus year-end 2014. This was primarily driven by better than expected growth in our large group business. Large group and small group insured membership in the Commercial business remained relatively flat in the quarter as expected. Small group ended the quarter with a total membership of 1.35 million. Individual membership declined by 51,000 during the quarter as we continue to see contraction in our legacy non-metal products and metal products off of the public exchanges. Our exchange membership declined by 5,000 lives to 893,000 members, which was due to normal attrition outside of open enrollment and was slightly better than expectations. We have a solid pipeline for national accounts and expect solid growth in this area in 2016, with several large new accounts already closed representing several hundred thousand lives. For the 3Rs we were able to incorporate the data received by CMS in late June in our second quarter financials. All in, our current read is that the data received was relatively in line with our expectations. We did see some benefit from a higher than accrued reinsurance receivable, but that was offset by higher than expected risk adjuster payable. Risk corridor and MLR rebate estimates were then refined. It is important to note that we may need to adjust our estimates for both the 2014 and 2015 benefit years as the data we have received is subject to appeal. So to summarize our current position, we've updated our reinsurance accrual as appropriate. We increased the net payable position for risk adjusters for both the 2014 and 2015 benefit years during the quarter. As a result of the increase, we reduced our risk quarter expectation from 2014 and are now in a net neutral position for the 2014 and 2015 benefit years. We believe our estimates are prudent given the dynamic nature of available information. I'd like to now turn to the Government segment and speak to the solid second quarter results. Our Government business segment had another strong quarter, adding 147,000 members driven by strong organic growth in Medicaid. Revenues in the quarter were $10.4 billion, up approximately 25.7% versus the prior-year quarter. Government business year-to-date membership growth has exceeded our expectation. We've grown by approximately 630,000 members, including 571,000 in Medicaid, 31,000 in our federal employee program, and 28,000 in Medicare. Please note that these results include membership associated with Simply Healthcare. The pipeline of opportunity for our Government business remains substantial. We continue to expect $65 billion of new business to be awarded by the end of 2018, split about evenly between traditional Medicaid and new populations in specialized services. We believe our experience and footprint positions us very well to continue our growth as we help states address the challenges of rising healthcare costs and improving quality for their residents. We are pleased to have announced during the quarter that we were awarded the opportunity to geographically expand our offering of Medicaid services for the state of Kentucky. Government operating margins improved 210 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 5.9%. This primarily reflected improved medical cost performance in certain markets in the Medicaid and Medicare business and expected retro rate adjustments recorded during the quarter for certain Medicaid contracts. I now want to turn the call over to Wayne to discuss the key consolidated financial highlights for the second quarter of 2015. He will also provide updated commentary on our 2015 outlook. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Joe, and good morning. As Joe stated, in the second quarter we reported earnings per share of $3.13 on a GAAP basis and $3.10 per share on an adjusted basis. Medical enrollment has increased by over one million members or 2.7% during the year to approximately 38.5 million medical members as of June 30. This reflected membership increases in virtually all lines of business. Operating revenue was nearly $19.8 billion in the quarter, an increase of approximately $1.5 billion or 8.4% versus the second quarter of 2014, reflecting robust enrollment in the Government business, additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends, and new fees associated with healthcare reform as well as growth in administrative fees as a result of our strong self-funded membership trends. This was partially offset by fully insured membership losses, including the previously announced decision to discontinue our employer group Medicare offering in the state of Georgia account. The growing diversity of our business aligns with our long-term strategy, as we believe we are well positioned to continue capitalizing on future growth opportunities. The benefit expense ratio was 82.1% in the second quarter of 2015, a decrease of 60 basis points from the prior-year quarter. The decline reflected a lower medical cost ratio in the Local Group business due to the timing of medical costs experience, improved medical cost performance in the Medicaid and Medicare businesses, and the impact of retro rate adjustments reported during the quarter in the Medicaid business. Our MLRs improved by 150 basis points year-to-date in 2015 versus year-to-date 2014 on a consolidated basis to 81.2%, with improvements in both business segments contributing to the change. For the full year 2015, we continue to expect underlying local group medical cost trends to be in the range of 7% plus or minus 50 basis points. Our SG&A expense ratio decreased by 40 basis points from the second quarter of 2014 to 15.4% in the second quarter of 2015. The improvement largely reflected our ongoing cost improvement initiatives, the changing mix of our membership toward government business, and lower spending related to the public exchange's open enrollment season. Partially offsetting the decline was higher administrative costs as a result of the strong membership growth in the first six months of 2015. Our Specialty business has shown strong growth this year as we've added 542,000 total dental members and 398,000 vision members. We are pleased with the improvement in Specialty's performance, which shows that our recent efforts toward driving an increased penetration in our medical book are bearing fruit. Moving to the balance sheet, days in claims payable was 43 days as of June 30, down 2.7 days from 45.7 days as of March 31, 2015. The expected decrease was primarily due to an acceleration of payments fee during the quarter as the company worked through the normal first quarter peak season of new and renewal memberships. As previously discussed, we expect days in claims payable to come back down closer to 40 over time. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 41.9% at June 30, 2015, up 260 basis points from 39.3% as to March 31, which includes the impact of our recent equity issue offering and partial 2.75% convertible security repayment in early May. We ended the second quarter with approximately $2.2 billion of cash and investments at the parent company. And our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $688 million as of June 30. Moving to cash flow, we generated strong operating cash flow of more than $2.8 billion during the first six months of 2015 or 1.6 times net income. During the quarter, operating cash flow was $1.2 billion or 1.4 times net income. Cash flow trends thus far in 2015 have been encouraging and we remain comfortable in our outlook of greater than $3.5 billion for the full year. As a reminder, cash flow in the third quarter is impacted by the payment of the 2015 health and surety and the receipt of the 2014 reinsurance reimbursement from the federal government. We repurchased 4 million shares during the quarter for approximately $637 million, representing a weighted average price of $157.89. As of June 30, we had approximately 4.3 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining, which is intended to be utilized over a multiyear period subject to market conditions. As a result of the recent agreement to acquire Cigna, we have halted share buybacks for the remainder of 2015. We used $164 million during the quarter for our cash dividend. And yesterday, the audit committee declared our third quarter 2015 dividend of $0.625 per share to shareholders. Turning to our full year 2015 outlook, we continue to see 2015 as the year of continued growth across our business. We are updating our full year 2015 adjusted earnings per share outlook from greater than $9.90 to greater than $10. Our revised outlook is consistent with current analysts' estimates and reflects the strong first half trends. Our outlook includes the impact of halting our share buyback program for the remainder of 2015. Additionally, our updated revenue outlook now includes the impact of slower than expected growth in the Dual Eligible program. We are pleased with overall results in the first half, which bodes well for the full year 2015. While we do not offer quarterly EPS guidance, as we said last quarter, we expect the fourth quarter to be the lowest quarterly EPS figure for the year as a result of the diminishing impacts of the 3Rs, time to get medical cost experience for our members and changes to our overall business mix. While we are encouraged by the underlying trends in the first half of 2015, our outlook continues to expect commercial business margin to be lower in the second half of the year versus the 11.6% reported year-to-date which is reflected in our outlook. We continue to expect operating cash flow in 2015 to be greater than $3.5 billion. With that, operator, please open the queue for questions. Operator : And our first question is from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thanks. I just wanted to go into the items that you had spiked out as helping the MLR in the quarter. I was wondering if you could try and quantify a little bit more exactly how much of the benefit was from the expense timing, how much of the benefit was from the retro Medicaid, and some of the things that you highlighted. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi, Kevin, good morning. First, let me start with a number of the items that actually occurred including the retro were anticipated in the second quarter, so while we did benefit from it in and of itself, it was not necessarily something that was not expected. And probably more importantly, I would say the MLR in total still came in better than our expectations. So first of all, underlying run rate appears to be strong across the businesses and we continue to be encouraged by it. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, well, you're not prepared to break out just how much they were in the quarter? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, no. These are \u2013 again, I view these as normal run rate expectations with puts and takes that occur every quarter. So no, we wouldn't break those out separately. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, then you mentioned the trend is \u2013 underlying trend is solid. Any additional color you can give there about components of trend or is it the midpoint of the range that you guys are reaffirming or does it only count for the one and/or the other? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, we continue to reaffirm our trend guidance at 7% plus or minus 50 basis points but I would say at this point, Kevin, if the first half were to continue through the second half of the year, we would be in the lower half of that range, this 6.5% to 7% range. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Ah, yes. Good morning. Thank you. If maybe I could ask about the reserve development in the quarter. So the days claims payable came down just shy of three days. And looks like the reserve development for the first half was considerably larger than the rate of reserve to development in the last year. I guess the question here is, it clearly shows conservative reserving and strength in 2014, but at first glance, that looks like your reserve reduction to medical claims liability benefited your earnings in the first half, maybe by significant magnitude. Can you talk to that? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Matt. Thank you so much for the question as well. Let me first state that we do not believe our first half benefited from the additional reserves that came through in the reserve roll-forwards. Specifically as those reserves related to the prior year, the majority of that release actually ended up being re-established as additional liabilities for the risk collars we had in Medicaid, for the MLR rebates in our individual business, and for risk adjusters on our individual business. So it simply shifted from one bucket of the reserve balance sheet to another bucket of the reserve balance sheet. As those got released there, additional reserves were then established. That was part of our conservative posturing we tried to take at year-end so that as things would develop, we knew there wouldn't be much upside, but we also knew we were protected against the downside. Probably the best quality metric I can point you to, Matt, to then validate that we did not benefit in the quarter is the cash flow to net income, which will show how strong cash flow is relative to our net income earnings. But we did not benefit in the quarter, and believe we continue to have high-single digit margin for adverse deviation in our reserves. Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you for addressing that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Christine Arnold from Cowen. Please go ahead. Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey there. I'm getting a huge increase in the government premiums. Is that exclusively the Medicaid true-up or were there any outside or out-of-period revenue adjustments we should think about within Medicare Advantage? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi, Christine. A little bit was the true-up, but the true-up in and of itself was not that meaningful and so it wasn't the largest driver. I will tell you that our Medicare is performing quite well, and a number of the items that we were fixing in previous years including risk adjusters and other items are no longer impacting our Medicare book of business. So as we said as part of our turnaround strategy that this should be the first year that we thought investors would begin to see stability, in fact increases in its earnings. And we think that run rate will continue. But I will tell you Medicare was as much a contributor as Medicaid was within the quarter. Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: So last year, you had prior-period negative adjustment to the risk adjuster. Can I assume that this quarter there might have been some positive true-ups to risk adjuster past accruals because you had increased your conservatism or how do I think about that? Because that Medicare PMPM has got to be up pretty big too. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, actually, we did not \u2013 I would say we have a conservative balance sheet though regarding the risk adjusters at this point. But I would say that we did get our recent mid-year statement on Medicare Advantage and it's in line with our expectations. I would say relative to risk adjusters for the broader exchange book, we actually had a true-up for the prior year which again, was offset by the excess conservatism on the balance sheet because that's why we had it established. And then we applied a run rate factor for the first half of the year to that as well. So again, we believe our balance sheet continues to maintain a decent amount of conservatism for the unknown. Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: I'm sorry. I just need a \u2013 I'm not clear. Was there a positive true-up to the risk adjuster for Medicare Advantage in the quarter? Because then MA, Medicare Advantage premium yield looked like it was up pretty significantly. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, not a meaningful adjustment versus our expectations, I should say, Christine. But clearly we were expecting a much better and positive return from our investments we made in the previous years. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tom Carroll from Stifel. Please go ahead. Tom A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Maybe you could spike out for us a bit more or give some more clarity on the increase in the operating gains seen in the Government business. I mean you're going from $313 million to almost $610 million. How much of that was improved operations, Wayne, as you mentioned versus perhaps retro adjustments in the businesses? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi, Tom. Good morning. The vast majority of it is improved operations in the Medicare book plus you're getting full run rate benefits from the Medicaid expansion that occurred last year plus our new wins. Remember, a lot of the Medicaid expansion in and of itself did not really get on the books until around June of last year. And so last year's 2Q is really not reflective of not only the full quarter growth but, as you know, that ramped up then through the end of last year plus new wins we had into this year. So what you really are seeing there is core organic growth in our Medicaid book as well as unique improvement in our Medicare book. And I do want to reiterate the retro adjustment is quite de minimis relative to the quarter but just one of many things that we have happening every quarter. Tom A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, Wayne. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Just a quick clarification on the guidance. Stopping the buybacks, Wayne, what was the impact on adjusted EPS in terms of the guidance? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Matt. It was not overly significant. You're looking at around $0.04 to $0.05 total is what the impact is based on the timing that we had assumed we would have. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then next question just sticking with that Government segment margin, you guys put up a 5.9% margin this quarter. I know it's just under 5% for the full year, or year-to-date I should say. So what's running \u2013 I mean I just, I think about the Medicaid businesses on a pre-tax basis and none of the competitors are anywhere close to that 6%. Medicare historically, at least Medicare Advantage has not been that high and I know your business has not performed to that level in the past. So what's causing that margin, that sort of 6%? And how do we think about, you've talked about this turnaround from 2014, are we fully there or is there actually an opportunity for even higher margin? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi, Josh. Good question. So a couple of things to keep in mind regarding how the margins look in the quarter and then where we think they'll pan out. And I think it's fair to say that on the Medicaid front, the margins are quite strong in the quarter, but when you're comparing it to the previous-year quarter but recognize again, with the ramp up that occurred last year there was heavy G&A for that initial ramp up, so as we're staffing and resourcing in the quarter a year-ago for all that ramp up coming in, you're getting a fairly sizable G&A hit to the margins but you're not necessarily getting the revenue bump that comes with it or the earnings that are associated with it. So as you compare to this year you're getting what I'll call much more normalized view of what margins could look like. The second thing I would highlight is our Medicare book has improved meaningfully. This was one of our strategies. We've done the things we've wanted to do around pairing the business back, refocusing on HMO products and slowly starting to improve our risk adjusters, and so I would tell you on a year-over-year basis the margins in Medicare specifically are quite strong. And then finally I would say that we had assumed some duals though still to continue to grow through the back half of the year, and as you know the duals will have a very muted effect, somewhat a negative margin in the early rollout. So that's another reason why I think you'll see the margin start to come down through the back half of the year but in general, Matt, we're very encouraged by how the whole book is running. I would also highlight that we still see margin opportunity for improvements, Josh, in a number of our areas that we have right now around certain states including Florida, Kansas and others where we continue to believe that they're large states that have upside still. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I guess, Wayne, my question was more around that 6% margin or even 5% on a year-to-date basis, just kind of absolute, not \u2013 forget about relative to where you've been but just on an absolute level do you think 5% margins in your Government segment can get better, right? And so is Medicaid actually running at 5% pre-tax margins? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think that is probably more the high end of the range of where we're going to be on a sustainable basis. I wouldn't necessarily look at that to be higher than that level. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : A.J., are you there? A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. Hello, everybody. Sorry about that. Can you hear me? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, A.J. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : First off, on the medical loss ratio, if I look at where you're at year-to-date across the board and then look at where you've maintained guidance so what that would imply about the back half of the year, a significant step up overall. Can you just give us a little flavor on what some of the drivers of that would be? Obviously seasonality to some degree, maybe mix shift back half versus first half, just general conservatism as you look in the back half of the year, maybe some color on that. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, A.J. Good morning. Let me start with one of the things that I would point each of you too is to actually look at the margin that the Commercial segment has reported through the first half of this year being around 11.6%. We believe that the seasonality patterns are very different that what we've seen historically and part of this is due to the ACA and how it's rolling out. We believe we'll get to what I'll call our typical sustainable high single digit margin, but if you take that 11.6% for the first half and then consider what it would take to bring that down the high single digit margin, to give you a little bit of a flavor in the Commercial book of the seasonality that we believe we're seeing along with the mix. I would also highlight that you start getting diminishing returns on margins in the back half of the year now because of the way the 3Rs have been established and the way the MLR rebates work. So as you have outperformance profitability early on, as that continues, you end up essentially recording collars under the Medicaid and then, of course, MLR rebates and risk adjusters and corridors under the exchange-related business. So it's not that the business will be performing worse in the second half. We actually think the business is doing quite well, but we think the seasonality and mix patterns have changed meaningfully from what we've seen historically. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, that's helpful. And then just as my follow-up, I was going to ask about your updated thoughts on the 3Rs. Obviously, we've gotten two of the 3Rs data actually in hand on that. Can you comment on whether you learned anything from that that's impacting the way you're thinking about them for this year, and then second, have you got any early information on the risk corridors and where they're coming out or any thoughts on that? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So let me start, A.J., on the reinsurance corridor. No big surprises there from our perspective. A little bit of upside to it because we had put some reserves up against some of that, but nothing of what I'll call a meaningful nature and not much of a run rate impact for the current year. On the risk adjusters, though, we did have a net payable true-up, as high a reserve as we had booked on the risk adjusters. But it's part of the reason we maintain the excess reserves within our roll forward and our balance sheet, because we knew there could be some unknowns and that was some of the protection that we were trying to build against. So the good news is that we reserved in total for it so it didn't have a net negative impact to our bottom line. And then we took that updated adjuster view and then ran rate that for the full year and then booked six-twelfths of that as of June 30. So that is reflected in our outlook as well, what I would call the most current view, as conservative as we can be on it. So we do have that reflected. And then relative to risk corridors, we're pretty much in a net neutral position, not much of a receivable, not much of a payable. It's more of a mathematical calculation and so we're not really expecting any surprises on the last R from our perspective. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC : Sure. Good morning. It's Dave Styblo in for Windley. Some of question's to A.J.'s except on the SG&A and talking about the seasonality and ramp, and I guess as you're thinking about duals coming on, I guess I would have thought that might have created a little bit more leverage than in prior years. So, again, it seems like the guidance there might be biased, having some conservatism. Can you walk us through sort of the bridge from the first half to second half and why maybe SG&A shouldn't lay at the lower end of the range? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : One thing to keep in mind on the duals is that they're actually very heavy on the SG&A during the initial rollout phase, and that the leverage actually comes in more in years two and three than it does in year one. So I think one thing to keep in mind is in the programs that are starting to expand in the second half, when you look at Texas and some of the other pilot programs still ramping up in California. So it actually has the opposite dynamic of what you're describing in the first year of rollout. And then you start to get your leverage more effectively in the later periods of time, and primarily because you continue to ramp up and provide a lot more medical care as you're trying to get these people involved in what I'll call your sustainable programs around medical cost management. David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Got it. I thought there was just a load ahead of that until the revenue started. But I understand what you're saying. And then two quick housekeeping items. On the Florida Medicaid rates, what are you guys expecting on the booking guidance there? And what are your thoughts sort of on how the state's shaking out? And then on taxes, you guys are running about 150 to 200 basis points below your original guidance. Have you done something there to improve the tax profile or is there just some unusual items that are going to shake out where taxes ramp back up in the latter half of the year? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So let me start with the Florida rates. Our guidance reflects what we know the rates are as they're currently being put forward. With that said though, I would indicate that we still believe the rate environment is somewhat challenging in Florida. We would like to see the rate continue to be improved. And we continue to work with our partners in the state around the product designs we have and the geographies. And that's why I indicated we believe we have opportunity for margin improvement in the state still. But again, the initial rates that were put forward were slightly behind what we thought were the rates that were needed, but not meaningfully, which is encouraging. And then I would say that our outlook reflects those rates, at least as they've been put forward at this point in time. Regarding taxes, it's important just to remember that the health insurer fee is a fixed fee. And so it doesn't ebb and flow based on your current year revenues or membership. And so as we have better income performance, and in this case where we are having strong operating gain performance and strong net income performance, it actually creates a leverage on your tax rate. And so in essence, what you're seeing in the lower rate is really a function of better operating earnings. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Rigg from Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead. Chris D. Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Good morning. I just wanted to get some more color as to what you guys are seeing with regard to the duals. And I'm not sure I knew where you started the year in terms of projections enrollment for that group of people in revenue and things. Just trying to figure out how that impacted the $500 million reduction. Thanks. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Chris, good morning. The majority of the reduction is related to the dual space and then specifically in Texas as we looked at the outlook. A couple just reminders, we had three counties in California, Santa Clara, Alameda and L.A. that we were selected in to be part of the demo pilot. Relative to that, Alameda actually ended up withdrawing the pilot so that did impact I would say our full-year outlook from a revenue perspective as we had fully anticipated that pilot would continue. L.A. County went live last year but the membership continues to be a slow uptake at this point. And I would say that phenomenon we saw in California which started last year is really continuing as we get into this year. We're seeing in Virginia the enrollment is slower as well as New York. I do want to remind you that we had a fairly, I thought, conservative outlook for duals revenue over our five-year outlook period. So we had anticipated really only around $2.5 billion of duals revenue by 2018. And based on the current ramp up and the pace that it's going on the pilot programs, we're running closer to about $1.4 billion at this point in time. So we still have a number of years to close that gap, but I would say in general the duals continue to come on much slower than we even we had modeled at this point in time. But the majority of the revenue decline is solely related to the duals uptake being slower than we anticipated. Chris D. Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Great. I'll leave it there. Thank you. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Getting back to the risk adjusters and changes you made relative to the government data that came out, can you quantify the impact of that charge that you took to earnings this year for 2014 for the risk adjustment changes, as well as quantify the amount that you changed your 2015 guidance for? Because you said you had updated that. Can you gauge what the impact was in the quarter of just the risk adjusters? And I understand from what you're saying that you sort of offset that with the reserve drawdowns. Is that the way to think about the reserve drawdowns as well? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. First of all, let me start by saying that what we used in establishing risk adjusters was the Wakely data. It was the best information we had and we continue to use that data. We had concerns though, regarding the Wakely data because we knew a number of competitors had not reported their data. And so we booked our risk adjusters at 12/13/2014 relative to Wakely and then we established additional reserves on our balance sheet for what we thought a range of outcomes could be, and tried to maintain a conservative range for that. And that's what you see running through the reserve roll-forward under DCP. So as we got to this year, and you can look at the public data that was available, but the number was north of $50 million that we were short on the risk adjuster. But at the same time, the number that we have within our balance sheet was more than adequate to cover that because we had assumed that it would be potentially short from what Wakely had posted. So ultimately, our current year earnings to date did not have a detriment to them because of risk adjusters, nor did they have a benefit. And of course, at that point then we could release any additional reserves that we thought we needed related to prior year, which we did. However, those reserves then resulted in collars for Medicaid being paid back to the states as well as risk corridor payables that would be adjusted from there as well as MLR rebate payables. So you have to almost look at the math in a chronological order. So, ultimately, no real benefit to the year, no real detriment to the prior year because we were obviously fully reserved it. And from a run rate perspective, we trued up for that delta. And so you can kind of use that as a gauge of that shortcoming of what we thought it would impact the current year. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So is $50 million the number that I should use to be thinking about moving from the reserves in one area to the reserves for the other areas, or... Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, it's a reasonable proxy. I mean, it's less than $100 million, more than $50 million is what I would say at this point. But, again, I think to try to pinpoint one number down is really not the way I would recommend looking at it because you have to consider that our reserving was done with a lot of unknowns, and you have to evaluate kind of all reserves we had on the balance sheet. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Sure. I appreciate that. Thank you. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Pete. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah, thanks. Good morning. So the first question is I just wanted to understand better when you look at the mix shifts between your fully-insured, individual and self-insured groups, you're obviously growing in self-insured, losing membership in fully-insured, haven't been doing as well on the individual market. Are you retaining all that within your own book? Are you losing it to players like Cigna or even Anthem \u2013 I'm sorry, Aetna or United. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I would say the vast majority of what we're retaining within our own book, it's back to our long-term strategy that we built which was to have the biggest catcher's mitt so that we were indifferent to where the customer wanted to play but rather be in a situation we could have a product offering to them. And I think that's reflected obviously in our overall growth in the first six months of 1 million new customers. So you think about it, we're clearly retaining the vast majority of that between our business lines and then adding to that as well. I would add the national account selling season is starting to draw to a close. We have a small handful of accounts that we're still waiting to hear from that we're optimistic about but we continue to believe we'll be a net grower next year in the several hundreds of thousands range. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : That's helpful, Wayne, thanks. On the $800 million to $400 million, then, this to your point around, where are you in that trajectory? And as you're looking into 2016 with the extension of small group to 100 and potential mix shift to self-insured and individual, how are you pricing for your other exchange book and across the board? And is that likely to go down in a \u2013 is that even bigger headwind in 2016? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The headwind continues to occur in this year at a meaningful clip. What I would tell you, though, is similar to this catcher's mitt scenario we keep describing, we did not see as much small group attrit this year into the public exchange as we thought. So small group is still down year-over-year on operating earnings as we had expected, but not down as much as we had expected so some of the underperformance on the membership and individual is being offset by over-performance on the membership in small group while the EBITDA in small group. So it will continue to add to the headwind for next year, but I would remind you that the headwind next year becomes the lowest headwind of our three-year period and really starts to become very, very manageable beginning in 2016 and beyond. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Very helpful. Thanks, Wayne. Operator : Thanks you, and our next question is from Andy Singer from Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead. Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning. So just following up on those comments you made on the wins in the national account selling season. Any additional color maybe you could talk about and what's driving that success in this self-insured market? Are the wins you're really benefiting from reliance on the Blue Card, or are these primarily wins within your Blue States? Any color there would be appreciated. Thanks. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So the vast majority of the wins are directly associated with our direct bidding in our states and the value benefit that our national accounts continue to bring. Now obviously, the Blue Card is an instrumental part of that value proposition because we can offer a significant discount to those ASO members. As you know, large national accounts are very sophisticated buyers. It's a highly competitive market within the ASO segment, and we're able to show not only the benefits of the discounts, but those benefits pass on 100% to the ASO customers. So our value prop is simple, and it's resonating. Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks. Maybe just following up on some of your comments earlier on the better performance Medicare. I know you touched on some of the drivers there, but can you really just discuss a little bit more detail the changes you guys have made to the Medicare offering that's really driving that performance and any updates related to your bidding strategy for 2016 that you think will continue that trend? Thanks. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So let me start with some of the things that we did. One was, we clearly spent more time and energy ensuring that we got from a best-in-class from a risk-coding perspective. I would call those soups and nuts, nothing crazy, just coding better and really bringing a medical management team in that really understood what to do around coding and making sure that we were looking at the charts. The second thing that we did that's helping us is that we really are medically managing this book of business much better than we believe we have in the past. I think a combination of our historical medical management processes but combining our Medicaid book with our Medicare book and the overall leadership and management has helped meaningfully. And the last thing I want to highlight is one of the things Joe did when he came here was said, it's hard to manage your business when you're on multiple Medicare platforms. And so last year was the last year of consolidating our Medicare platforms onto a single platforming system. That's done a couple of things. One, it's given us platform expansion because the G&A costs associated with that now are behind us. And two is it's giving us better data analytics and more real-time data to respond than we've had historically. And I would say none of those are sexy or unique, kind of nuts and bolts of running a business. Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Sarah James from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Your $65 billion estimate for the Medicaid opportunity through 2018 is at the high end of what peers have been discussing, and I was hoping that you could give us a little bit more clarity on whether or not that includes incremental duals contracts within that 2018 timeframe. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So Sarah, to give you some flavor for it and I can't really speak to our competitors but I can speak to how we plan to participate because we actually participate in a number of markets but if you look at the RFP pipeline that's out there, you've got about $33 billion of what I'll call core Medicaid either re-procurements or new expansion programs, obviously like you've seen in Iowa, et cetera. When you look at long-term services care and ABD, you've got about $13 billion that's out there. And we've got to look at states like Georgia and Louisiana and North Carolina, et cetera. There is a duals demo opportunity out there and that number's closer to about $7 billion. Now, whether or not that occurs based on the slow pace, we'll see. But there's a lot of other areas, and I don't want to touch on them all, but intellectual and development disability, complex children in foster care, behavioral health integration, et cetera. So we've got line of sight I would say on each one of these by market, and feel very confident in our $65 billion pipeline number. Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: And that $7 billion of duals opportunity, what state would that be in? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You're looking more to Ohio and Oklahoma as opportunities there. Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we'll move to the line of Brian Wright from Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead. Brian Michael Wright - CRT Capital Group LLC : Good morning. Sorry about that. My questions have been answered. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Brian. Operator : Thank you. And I'd now like to turn it back over to the company's management for any closing remarks. Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Great. Thank you very much, operator. This is Joe again. Wayne did a great job. Thank you, Wayne, for that update for everyone. I'd like to thank all of you for your questions. We're pleased with our performance of the company in the second quarter as you can tell, and for the entire first half of 2015. It's reflected in our adjusted earnings per share outlook for 2015 of greater than $10. We remain optimistic about the growth opportunities that we believe lay ahead and I remain confident in our ability to execute against them. I also want to thank our associates for their efforts, which are critical to help drive greater affordability and access to quality healthcare for our 38.5 million members. Thank you for your interest in Anthem, and we do look forward to speaking with you at upcoming conferences and events. Again, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you.

Later, there will be a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Douglas R. Simpson - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning and welcome to Anthem's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. This is Doug Simpson, Vice President of Investor Relations. With us this morning are Joe Swedish, President and CEO; and Wayne DeVeydt, our CFO. Joe will offer an overview of our third quarter 2015 financial results and Wayne will walk through the financial details and our updated 2015 outlook. Joe and Wayne are then both available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Joe. Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Doug, and good morning. We're pleased to announce strong third quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $2.73, reflecting solid underlying membership and margin performance. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.43. We're pleased with core operating results in the quarter, which came in modestly better than we had expected and is reflected in our updated 2015 outlook. Of special note, the third quarter did benefit from the favorable timing of retro rate activity true-ups in the Medicaid business and company-wide administrative expense. These were intra-year timing issues that are not expected to impact our full-year results. Performance in our Government business and National, Large Group and Small Group businesses in Commercial are tracking well versus our expectations, while our Individual business continues to lag as a result of lower than expected involvement. We ended the third quarter of 2015 with 38.7 million members, an increase of 174,000 members during the quarter, bringing year-to-date growth to 1.2 million members or 3.2% since year-end 2014. This reflected membership increases in nearly all lines of business, with the exception of lower Individual membership. We added 670,000 Medicaid members, 401,000 National members, and 111,000 Local Group members. Operating revenue was nearly $19.8 billion in the quarter, an increase of approximately $1.4 billion, or 7.6% versus the third quarter of 2014, reflecting enrollment growth in the Government business, additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends and increasing fees associated with Health Care Reform. Also contributing was the growth in administrative fee revenue as a result of our strong self-funded membership trends. This was partially offset by fully-insured membership losses including the previously announced decision to discontinue our employer group Medicare offering in the state of Georgia account. The benefit expense ratio was 83.6% in the third quarter of 2015, an increase of 110 basis points from the prior year quarter. The year-over-year increase reflected the change of our business mix towards the Government business division and the impact of last year's intra-year reserve development related to the exchange business. As we previously discussed, we expect our benefit expense ratio to increase further in the fourth quarter, consistent with previous expectations. On a year-to-date basis, our MLR has improved by 70 basis points in 2015 versus 2014 to 82% with improvements in both business segments contributing to the change. For the full year 2015, we continue to expect underlying Local Group medical costs trend to be in the range of 7% plus or minus 50 basis points, with a bias towards the lower half of that range. Our SG&A expense ratio decreased by 60 basis points from the third quarter of 2014 to 15.6% in the third quarter of 2015. The improvement largely reflected the changing mix of our membership toward Government business as well as the timing of certain expenses, including information technology spend that we now expect to incur in the fourth quarter. I would now like to discuss our Commercial business in greater detail. Commercial membership has increased by 464,000 since year-end 2014. Operating revenues increased 0.7% sequentially, but have declined by 3.8% since the prior year quarter to $9.4 billion. This reflects fully insured member declines including the decision we announced last year to discontinue our employer group Medicare offerings in the state of Georgia account. Self-funded membership trends continue to be encouraging, increasing by another 209,000 during the third quarter and now up 919,000 versus year-end 2014, representing growth of 4%. This was primarily driven by better-than-expected growth in our Large Group business. Large Group and Small Group insured membership in the Commercial business were down slightly in the quarter, as expected. Small Group ended the quarter with a total membership of 1.33 million lives. Individual insured business membership continues to lag our expectations this year, and we have seen the volume and related margin pressures weighing on our profit contributions. Individual membership declined by 99,000 during the quarter as we continue to see contraction in exchange lives and some attrition off-exchange. Our exchange membership declined by an additional 69,000 lives to 824,000 members. Year-to-date, our Individual business has declined by 48,000 lives, meaningfully behind our original growth expectations for this year, as we have discussed previously. Individual enrollment pressures in 2015 reflect much lower than expected aggregate market growth as well as unsustainable pricing by some of our competitors. While we are disappointed with the near-term enrollment picture, we believe we have the right medium to long-term strategy with the exchanges and will continue to target sustainable pricing in our markets. Over time, we believe we are well positioned for growth as this market stabilizes to a more sustainable level. We have a solid pipeline for National Accounts and continue to expect solid growth in this area in 2016 with several large new accounts already closed representing several hundred thousand lives. For the 3Rs related to 2015 benefit year, we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate, and continue to expect to be in a net payable position for risk adjusters and in a net neutral position for risk-corridors. We continue to record a valuation allowance against the risk-corridor receivables in certain markets as we do not believe those receivables will ultimately be collected. We believe our estimates are prudent given the dynamic nature of available information. I would like to now turn to the Government segment and speak to the solid third quarter results. Our Government business segment had another strong quarter, adding 108,000 members, driven by strong organic growth in Medicaid. Revenues are up approximately 20.8% versus the prior year quarter to $10.3 billion. The Government business' year-to-date membership growth of 738,000 members has exceeded our expectations. This growth includes 670,000 members added in Medicaid, 37,000 in Medicare, and 31,000 in our Federal Employee Program. Please note that these results include membership associated with Simply Healthcare. The pipeline of opportunity for our Medicaid business remains substantial. We expect $68 billion of new business to be awarded by the end of 2020, split about evenly between traditional Medicaid and new populations in specialized services. We continue to believe our experience and footprint positions us very well to continue our growth as we help states address the challenges of rising healthcare costs and improving quality for their residents. We are pleased to have announced, during the quarter, that we were awarded the opportunity to offer Medicaid services for the state of Iowa and Texas STAR Kids as well as successfully retaining our business in Georgia and Kentucky. In Medicare, we are pleased with our progress on Star Ratings and expect over 25% of our Medicare advantage members in 2016 to be in Four-Star plans, which impacts 2017 revenue. We remain focused on improving affordability for our members as we plan to offer zero premium HMO and PPO products, where possible, in 2016. We will continue to refine our served markets opportunistically, and we are optimistic that we are getting closer to a positive growth inflection. We know that we must be focused on managing the total cost of care to offer a competitive product, and we will continue to make the necessary investments to improve our capabilities. Overall, Government operating margins improved 280 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 6.1%, ahead of our expectations. This reflected continued strong medical cost performance in certain markets in the Medicaid and Medicare businesses as well as the favorable timing of retro rate adjustments recorded during the quarter for certain Medicaid contracts. Next, we want to provide a brief update on our pending acquisition of Cigna. During the quarter, we filed our S-4, and we are in the process of responding to the second HSR request by the Department of Justice. We also continue to work with our state regulatory representatives to address their questions. Both Anthem and Cigna shareholder meetings to approve the acquisition have been scheduled for December 3. I have appointed Dennis Matheis, an experienced operator with career experience at both organizations, to lead our integration planning. And we have developed a detailed and comprehensive approach to bringing together the strengths of our two companies. Together with leadership contributions from both Anthem and CIGNA, our integration planning teams will ensure we capture the full potential of this transaction for our customers. We remain confident in our ability to close this transaction in the second half of 2016. Turning to our full-year 2015 outlook, we continue to see 2015 as a year of continued growth across our business. We are updating our full year 2015 adjusted earnings per share outlook from a greater than $10 to a range of $10.10 to $10.20. Our revised outlook reflects the strong performance of the first nine months of the year as well as an expectation for meaningfully lower fourth quarter margins in both business segments. We had previously indicated that the third quarter would represent about 60% of our second half adjusted earnings and our core results for third quarter came in modestly above that level. Beyond the core outperformance, the third quarter did benefit from favorable timing related to Medicaid retro rate reimbursements and G&A expenditures. This had the effect of shifting some of the projected earnings from the fourth quarter into the third quarter. Consistent with our prior discussions with you, our outlook expects the Commercial business to generate meaningfully lower margins in the fourth quarter of this year, leading to a full year 2015 margin in the high-single digits by year-end. Our fourth quarter margin forecast reflects the calendar impact of deductible leverage and continued lower than expected contributions from the Individual business. We also expect our Government business margins will compress in the fourth quarter from the third quarter levels, partially reflecting the timing of retro rate adjustments that occurred in the third quarter, which were expected in the fourth quarter as well as normal seasonal patterns and the ramp-up in spending to prepare for the launch of the Iowa business and the annual enrollment period for Medicare. Similar to our discussion one year ago, we also want to highlight a potential timing issue related to the revenue recognition of certain Medicaid contract rate changes in certain markets which could be approximately $50 million. Our 2015 adjusted EPS outlook has previously and continues to assume the revenue will be recognized by year-end 2015. To be clear, this is simply a timing issue as to whether this amount is able to be booked as revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 or the first quarter of 2016. In summary, we are now two years into our five-year targeted growth strategy we shared at our last IR day. And aside from Individual, the remainder of our business has performed well versus expectations during this period. We remain focused on executing against our strategic growth initiatives and are currently in the midst of our annual planning process, including a review of our anticipated headwinds and tailwinds into 2016. I will now turn the call over to Wayne to discuss some key consolidated financial metrics from the third quarter of 2015. He will also provide some initial thoughts around our headwinds and tailwinds looking into 2016. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Joe, and good morning. I'd like to first discuss a few of our key balance sheet metrics. Consistent with our past practice, we've included a roll forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we experienced favorable prior-year reserve development of $818 million which was moderately better than our expectations. While the favorable development was higher than what was recognized in the first nine months of 2014, it resulted in offsetting adjustments for the risk stabilization programs from Health Care Reform. We continue to maintain our upper-single digit margin for adverse deviation and believe our reserve balance remains consistent and strong as of September 30, 2015. Our days in claims payable was 42.3 days as of September 30, down 0.7 days from the 43.0 days as of June 30, 2015. The expected decrease is primarily due to changes in the timing of claims payments between periods. As previously discussed, we expect days in claims payable to come back down closer to 40 days over time. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 41.2% at September 30, 2015, down 70 basis points from 41.9% as of June 30, which reflects the impact of repaying approximately $625 million of long-term debt due in the quarter, consistent with our capital management strategies. We ended the third quarter with approximately $1.6 billion of cash and investments at the parent company and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $463 million as of September 30. Moving to cash flow, we generated strong operating cash flow of approximately $3.2 billion during the first nine months of 2015 or 1.3 times net income with cash flow in the third quarter of $343 million. As a reminder, cash flow in the third quarter was impacted by the payment of the 2015 health insurer fee, partially offset by the receipt of the 2014 reinsurance reimbursement from the federal government. Cash flow trends thus far in 2015 continue to be encouraging and we remain comfortable on our outlook of greater than $3.5 billion for the full year. Due to the impact of capital management strategies put into place prior to the announcement of our acquisition Cigna, we repurchased 0.7 million shares during the quarter for approximately $105 million, representing a weighted average price of $143.89. As of September 30, we had approximately $4.2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining, which is intended to utilized over a multi-year period subject to market conditions. As a reminder, we do not expect to repurchase shares for the remainder of 2015 following the recent agreement with Cigna. We used $163 million during the quarter for cash dividend and yesterday, the Audit Committee declared our fourth quarter 2015 dividend of $0.625 per share to shareholders. Turning to 2016, we are currently working through our planning process and analyzing the impact of various expected headwinds and tailwinds into 2016. The tailwinds include continued enrollment growth across the Government, Commercial National accounts, and Large Group self-funded markets; the continued opportunity to expand margins in Medicare Advantage; and the benefit from capital deployment in 2016 albeit at a lower level than in recent years as we prepare for the Cigna transaction to close. For headwinds, we expect 2016 will be another challenging year for Individual enrollment and margins as result of the continued competitive pressures in various markets and the associated negative operating leverage of that pressure. We remain confident in our strategy and market position, but unsustainable pricing by some of the market participants is persisting longer than we had expected and the overall market growth is lagging expectations. There are potential Medicaid margin pressure reflecting startup losses from large new contract awards as well as an initial view that recent outperformance in certain markets may not repeat in 2016 with a more challenging rate environment. And finally, we plan to make certain technology investments to advance our efforts to improve the cost of care, enhance our provider collaboration initiatives, and improve the consumer engagement. Taken together, these items represent a challenge to our targeted growth strategy in the near-term. As part of our planning process, we are focused on identifying steps to mitigate the impact of these headwinds to our earnings outlook in 2016. We expect to provide more details around our 2016 outlook on our fourth quarter conference call in January, as usual. With that, operator, please open the queue for questions. Operator : Okay. Due to the limited time and in fairness to other listeners, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up per turn. Your first question comes from of A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Hello, everybody. Thanks for the question. Just maybe to drill down on the comments around the Individual business and the higher MLR you're seeing there, is that primarily on the public exchanges or is it off-exchange as well? And how much of it relates to just lower prior period development than what you saw a year ago in the segment? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, A.J., and thanks for the question. Let me first just discuss what I see as a competitive but very rational pricing backdrop outside of Individuals. I want to make sure that the market understands what we're seeing outside of the Individual market, and that cost trend is tracking well with a bias towards the lower half of our stated range. So when you think about what we're highlighting here, we really want to make sure we focus on the Individual book both on-exchange and off-exchange. To give you a little bit more background here, we do continue to believe that our strategy is the right long-term strategy, and our profitable growth over the past two years \u2013 that's not just last year, we continued to have profitable growth this year. But the market is, however, very dynamic, and we continue to see lower overall enrollment growth on a national basis. And as you know, that creates a deleverage of G&A, which does impact our margins. And there continues to be pockets of industry pricing that we just don't believe is sustainable. And we are going to need to be patient until this works itself out, which we hope will be by 2017 and 2018. So due to these dynamics, our position right now is what we thought would be a tailwind going into 2016 is probably going to be a headwind at this point, but as Joe mentioned, we're work through mitigation strategies right now around G&A. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And if I just might follow up on that, obviously, we've had the announcements of a number of co-ops that are closing and some of those are in big states. So in terms of looking ahead in 2016 and headwinds, tailwinds, how do you think about that impacting your thinking \u2013 I mean it seems like given your share position in those markets that you might be a primary beneficiary of some of those exits, and that may ease some of the pressure. Any thoughts? Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. A.J., good morning. This is Joe. Good question. First of all, just to put a number to it, as of last night, there are 10 co-ops that have initiated closure. And as you well know, our pricing for 2016 products are already baked and in market. So, obviously, we are observing the effect closures will have in 2016 in terms of market movement, i.e., membership from plan to plan. Our sense is that, to Wayne's point, the rationality that we've been expecting certainly will begin to take root into 2017 with pricing relative to product going out to market in 2016. In that regard, I think it's kind of got a so-called, a longer gestation period than moving from one year in 2015 to the next in 2016. So we're extremely prudent. We've said this repeatedly, that we will not chase price to buy membership and we've been adamant about that. We've been very clear with respect to our expectation that, to the degree that there is irrationality in pricing, product design, et cetera, that we will ultimately see a stabilization. So again, our sense is that it's more of a multi-year outlook, A.J., and that 2016 will probably give us some key indicators, but it's not going to be so-called the final solution in the states where we reside with these products and pricing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll from Stifel. Please go ahead. Tom A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. A follow-up question on the Medicaid retro rate true-ups that you commented on. If you exclude those payments for this quarter, would Government margins be up, flat, or down from the third quarter of last year? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Tom. First of all, our Medicaid margins are actually still \u2013 we're performing quite well on the Medicaid side of the shop in many of our markets, and overall I'm really pleased, quite honestly, with the execution of the team across not only existing markets but new markets. I do want to emphasize though that, while we're not quantifying what the favorable timing was on either that or the G&A that got deferred to Q4, I can say that the core of our performance excluding those items, is reflected in our updated outlook. Tom A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So I think, on second quarter, you said that you expected Government margins to come down a bit for the second half of the year. Has that changed a bit in your mind? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think fourth quarter will be a heavy period in which it comes down. It's important to recognize that we get a lot of our new rates at least first pass as we look into next year begin to come to us in the September, October timeframe. So we're getting a better view now into the rating environments as we move into next year, and some of that will start to impact fourth quarter. Tom A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg from Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Good morning. Just wanted to come back to the Individual issues, and it's sort of more of a qualitative question. You guys talk about seeing unsustainable pricing from certain competitors, but clearly it's persisted for at least three years. So when you guys say unsustainable, is there anything structurally that might give some non-profits the ability to sustain what you guys believe is somewhat irrational for a longer period of time like a tax issue or something? Or is it just \u2013 I guess, I'm just looking for some better understanding for why you believe it's unsustainable, but yet it's been able to persist for so long. Thanks. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Chris. Appreciate the question. I think one thing to keep in mind though is that the 3Rs were put in place and essentially created sustainability. And as those are making their way out of the system and as you know, two of the 3Rs would dissipate by next year for lack of a better phrase, the training wheels come off, and the business is going to have to be self-sustaining at that point. We're obviously all aware that on the risk-corridors that the government is now indicated that we'll only be paying $0.12 on the dollar regarding the corridors at this point in time. And so we think these dynamics have to work their way through the system. And as that happens \u2013 and we think evidence is starting to come through. As Joe said, we've seen 10 co-ops now indicated they will no longer be in business beginning next year. So we have to see this work itself through the system, but we believe that going into 2017, the 3Rs will have substantially worked their-selves through and we think the backdrop will change. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. And then just a quick follow-up here. When you guys talk about higher favorable PPD last year, was that only in the Individual business? Or is that a general comment on the Commercial side? Thanks. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Chris. It is heavily weighted to the Individual business, but in general, all of Commercial had favorable PPD. The point we want to emphasize, though, is last year versus this year, is you really need to look at a nine month versus nine month, versus a quarter versus a quarter. There was so much uncertainty in the first six months of last year that we maintained very solid reserves. And then as we got better certainty, we began to bring this down intra-year in the third quarter and fourth quarter. We now have, what I would call, much more stable MLR outlook now that we've got a second year under our belts. So it's more about timing between quarters than it is comparing year-over-year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Barclays. Please go ahead. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Wayne, just want to follow up on the comments that you made. I understand you will be giving guidance later for 2016, but it sounded like \u2013 I just want to make sure I get this right that the headwinds \u2013 you sort of emphasized headwinds \u2013 I'm sorry, tailwinds \u2013 headwinds, I'm sorry, instead of tailwinds. Last year, at this time, you spoke about a comfort for guidance \u2013 for consensus. It's $11.17 for next year. So I was wondering, if you can put your comments in the context of where the consensus is? And then, I know I am cheating a little bit with the second question, but even within that, I'm still struggling with the sustainability of your Government margins. You're running at 6.1%, and still over 5.2% year-to-date, and you're talking about margin opportunity on Medicare which would imply Medicaid north of that, so I'm just trying to figure out what you guys think a sustainable Government margin is and maybe how that plays into 2016 relative to where the Street is thinking? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Josh. A number of questions there, so let me first hit your first one about more growth going into next year. Let me start by saying, since Joe joined this company, he's laid out a growth agenda and we remain committed to capitalizing on those opportunities across all of our businesses. So the short answer is it is our intention to grow adjusted EPS in 2016, but we did highlight some headwinds that we're working on and hopefully will mitigate. And we believe we have opportunities to mitigate. Those headwinds, though, really fall into two primary buckets. One is what we just highlighted on the Individual, and the second one is, Josh, what you've indicated, which is the Medicaid margins in certain markets are running higher than what we would have as a long-term sustainable margin and we think it's prudent, at least at this point, to maintain an outlook that those margins will get compressed in some of our markets going into 2016. And the other thing I would simply highlight is we still have opportunity though for margin expansion in MA, although it's improved quite a bit this year, we're pleased with that and we expect growth next year. And we have many new markets that we are still expanding it on Medicaid though that are not at our optimal margin levels, so \u2013 but I think you have to expect in those markets that are above our high-end margins that those are going to contract next year and that's what we're going to plan for. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And within the context of the consensus, sort of, how you made comments last year? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Again, at this point, I don't want to give guidance relative to the consensus, but we are comfortable in saying that we have a growth agenda, and as we build out our plans over the next 90 days to mitigate some of these headwinds we'll give more guidance in January. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Good morning. I wanted to focus on Commercial margin. I caught \u2013 Joe, I joined a little late, but I caught you saying that kind of reiterating the target for high-single digits for the year. It looks to me if fourth quarter stacks up like third quarter, that would basically get you there. But I also thought I understood you to say that margins would drop a little bit sequentially from third quarter to fourth quarter. So I just want to make sure I understand, however you might add some color there, either more precision around what high-single digits means or what the sequential progression would be from third quarter to fourth quarter? Thank you. Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Thank you for the question. Let me just underscore that, consistent with our prior discussions, we continue to expect Commercial business to generate meaningful lower margins in the fourth quarter. And then, of course, leading to full year 2015 margins, we're obviously stating that we believe it will be in the high-single digit by year-end. Our fourth quarter margin forecast does reflect calendar year impact of deductible leverage and continued lower than expected contributions from the Individual business. I think we kind of covered all those nuances or aspects in the commentary. I'm hopeful that, kind of, is responsive to your question. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : And just to put maybe a finer point on that, those are \u2013 you expect those to be incremental additional pressures from the third quarter, which has already dropped 300 basis points or so? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, Dave, this is Wayne. Yeah, absolutely. Again, I want to emphasize, though, you really should be cautious on using Q3 of this year versus Q3 of last year because of how we built up reserves on the Individual book and how we release those intra-year last year versus this year, you have a much more of what I would call seasonality alignment of that reserve development and buildup. This is nothing new that we've discussed in the past. So I think what you have to look at is margins are going to be more similar to what you saw in Q3, more in that 5%, 6% range going into Q4, but you'll still blend to an all-in margin. In fact, if you look at, on a year-to-date basis, our Commercial margins are actually up 70 basis points over where they were at a year from last year, and we expect those to migrate closer to that level. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. Thanks. I want to ask about the Medicare Advantage book. You guys \u2013 if I interpret your comments correctly, you're basically saying that 2016 is probably not going to be a year of membership growth, but that will probably be the last year some of the changes you need to make. So we should think about 2016 as about little membership growth but significant margin improvement, is that the way to think about that? Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think we're building success year-over-year, and to your point, going into 2016, we are continuing to, call it, refine our served markets, really focusing on the opportunistic aspects of being engaged in those markets, calibrating our presence in a way that we can continue to grow margin and ultimately grow little more membership as a springboard opportunity. We're certainly optimistic that we're getting closer to that so-called positive growth inflection that we keep referencing and that we are truly expecting continued growth in those core geographies that we have served, and we're going to probably still experience some offset by further market exits and 2016. So it's still, call it, a dynamic equation that we're managing, but a productive kind of a movement nonetheless. We know that we've got to be focused on managing the total cost of care in MA. And that's been our sort of shoulder to the wheel over the last couple of years. We're seeing really a marked improvement in our profitability in that space, and as we then move forward into 2016 in terms of capturing that so-called inflection point, we're going to be offering competitive products and we'll continue to make those necessary investments to improve not only the capabilities but the execution to capture the growth objectives that we've established for ourselves. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And then you made a comment that you're pleased with the progress on Stars, but you're still lagging the peers on the Stars. One of your competitors talked about their investments in Stars creating a drag in the near-term. I mean, how do you think about the ability to move margins up while still having to make some improvement on the Star Ratings going forward? Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, well, we did achieve improvement in Stars, and according to plan. And we've always had an outlook in terms of a target for 2015 going into 2016 and 2017, and we did meet those targets in terms of our internal expectations. We made progress throughout 2015, we have substantially increased the percentage of membership and with respect to provider collaboration agreements that we believe represents kind of the bedrock of how we're going to improve our Stars performance, and we're continuing to work toward our short-term goal. I think this is important enough to recognize our short-term target being having 50% of our membership in four-star plans, which is for the 2018 payment year. So all in, we're very pleased with sort of a migration path that we put ourselves on. Margins are expected to continue to expand in line with our long-term growth objectives in this space. So all in, again, I think we have some very strong outlook for this space, and we think we're progressing quite nicely with respect to meeting our objectives. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't know, Wayne, do you want to add something? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Kevin, one thing I want to highlight, though, for our investors is this. I've been with this organization for 10 years and my optimism around the turnaround strategy that started two years ago has never been higher. We have seen the margin improvement, we've now consolidated to a single platform. We believe even the markets that we're in the last phase of exiting, we believe we'll be able to cover those markets with growth and all the other markets that we're now participating in. And so while there's a lot of kind of sausage making here and you can't see all the details, I can tell you that the optimism is quite high. In fact, we expect that MA will have a solid growth going into next year within that core line of business on top the growth we had this year. And our original target was that we would have north of 25% of our membership and four-star rated plans this year. We were realistic about how fast we thought we could move the needle, and the team achieved that goal. And we expect to raise that to more than 50% by the following year. So we've laid out a plan. It was a thoughtful plan, and we're really executing well against it. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold from Cowen. Please go ahead. Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, there. I'm trying to understand what's going on in the public exchange Individual business. Was there a meaningful or even \u2013 was there a deterioration in the profitability of that book of business second quarter to third quarter that was beyond what you anticipated? And are you sure you captured any issues there in your pricing? I know you exited Wisconsin. Are there other markets on the block? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi, Christine. No, nothing was unexpected versus what we had anticipated. I think the MLRs are little again misleading because of the excess reserves we put up last year in the first half and started taking down in the second half, but Individual is performing as we expected. We continue to be profitable in that book of business versus our outlook. But as we look into next year, we just see an environment, a backdrop where we now have the benefit of seeing what competitive pricing is and we know where our pricing is at, and ultimately, it's a top line issue that we're not going to get the volume that we would have expected in light of the price point but we believe our price point is still right and we believe pricing below that has profitability concerns. Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: And then can you talk about the $50 million... Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm sorry. Christine, I just want to correct something that you said, which it's very easy to go there and that is you commented that we've exited Wisconsin. We've not exited Wisconsin, we've exited some counties in Wisconsin and then we've adjusted our presence in certain other counties in terms of the number of available exchanges in 34 other Wisconsin counties. I just want to calibrate kind of perspective that, again, as we should, we are adjusting and adapting based on the realities of the marketplace in terms of how we think we can best perform in those states. Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: And then the Medicaid rate changes could be worth $50 million. Is that a this year event? Is that a next year event? Is that in guidance? I assume that's Medicaid rate cut. But I just I'm not sure when to think about that. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Our current guidance is that we have $50 million that we assume we will be getting from a particular state. As you know, the way we recognize revenue is very dependent upon the contract and when that's actually signed. And so ultimately, we still fully expect to get it completed within the quarter along with feedback from the state. This is not a concern about revenue we believe we're entitled to for the current year. It's just a question of will it end up still being in Q4 or does it get pushed to January of Q1 of next year. Right now, we still anticipate it'll be this year and it's in our guidance. Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: Right. And this is a good guide? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's correct. Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Schenker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Good morning. So maybe just talking a little bit more on cost trend there, any additional color? I mean, you clearly stated the bias remains to lower half. Were there any changes throughout the year or quarter worth highlighting? And then also, have you thought about cost trend through your entire book like including Individual, et cetera, which I know is not how you report it? Would cost trends still be below what you price to? Thanks. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi, Andy. So, yeah, cost trend continues to be within our original guidance range and we still believe based on our nine months as well as our projections for the fourth quarter, that will be in the lower half of that guidance range. You are correct, while we don't give cost trend by line of business, I would say businesses are generally still playing within our pricing expectations. In fact, if you were to look more broadly, some businesses performing even better, which is why we have some outperformance in certain markets out there around Medicaid and a few other lines. So again, the broader backdrop is, cost trend is playing fine in really all lines of business. The Individual issue is about volume, it's not about trend. Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And then just real quick... Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, let me just underscore, just \u2013 I think it's important to note kind of some of the tactical initiatives we have at our disposal. We are accelerating the benefit that it can bring to us, such as a lot of innovative tools in and around provider collaboration, data analytics, so one of our key pillars as an enterprise is really heavily focused on better managing the total cost of care. So I think in combination with market as well as what we're capable of administering in terms of the necessary tactics, I think we've got a kind of a nice kind of combination of efforts, and realities in the market that allow us to better manage the cost trend that you're citing. Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning. First on the exchanges, is the drop off just related to sort of either losing market share, not gaining as much versus individuals not paying premiums, I guess, at this point? And then if that is having an impact on MLR in terms of not paying sort of premiums seemingly these individuals utilized before dropping \u2013 so are you on the hook for that bill and is that, anything driving that down as well? Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, let me just jump in real quick, kind of a, more of a higher level commentary. And Wayne can jump in, in terms of some of the technical details, but specifically, volume shortfall got to be put into context, because our 2015 plan was created using the most recent CBO estimates for 2015 exchange marketplace, which at the time was 15 million enrollees nationally. And so the new kind of, I guess, call it, perspective or estimate from CMS, which updates the marketplace size, is going to be somewhere between 9 million and 9.9 million in 2015. So putting all that in perspective, if you look at our circumstance with respect to Individual, we've witnessed an exchange enrollment shift of about 30% downward migration, and related to initial expectations for this time of year, which we believe reflects the lower-than-expected overall market growth as well as market share losses due to so-called unsustainable pricing by some of our competitors. So that's kind of maybe the big story. I don't know, Wayne, do you want to get into the, maybe, the detail as to \u2013 that would be great. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : To Joe's comment, Ralph, let me just be clear. It's not a non-payment issue. Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's not the issue. We're collecting our revenue. The governments paying the portion of those that are subsidized. There's no concerns at all. It's purely a volume issue. When you have fewer national enrollees and you have price points that we don't believe are sustainable, we've just made a conscious decision we're not going to chase it. And so, if you think about it, we're down on Individual in the quarter 99,000 lives and that process we don't see slowing down in the Q4. And so, we're trending in, what I'll call, the wrong direction on enrollment, but we believe the right answer then is to be patient and see this through versus racing to the bottom. And again, we think, as the 3Rs dissipate, you'll start to see that market harden. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Fair enough. And then I guess given the lower exchange ramp, I mean, are you still comfortable or do you see that as sort of a headwind to getting to that $14 earnings target that you had put out there for 2018? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Ralph, really appreciate this question, because this is an important commentary. I want to make sure our shareholders understand. With the exception of the Individual book we're speaking to, our other businesses combined are exceeding our expectations through the first two years and are on-target for our 2018 goals. So if the Individual environment hardens like we anticipate it will, hopefully beginning in 2017 and 2018, then that $14 still remains intact. If the environment remains where it's at today, that will put some pressure on that, although at this point, we do have other lines that are ahead of where we thought they would be at, at this point in time, and hopefully that trend will continue. So, a ways to go, but right now, if the environment stays the way it is on Individual, that would definitely create a headwind to the 2014 outlook. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to follow up again on the exchange question. What I'm hearing you say is, it's market share losses to other plans. Firstly, does that happen throughout the year? And then secondly, as you are looking at the hospital story, which is showing a pretty marked increase in uncompensated care and they're talking about attrition, any thoughts on what that is about and what subsidy levels that is coming at? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi, Ana. Again, relative to the exchanges, we're expecting continue to have market share losses in the fourth quarter and then expect that will continue on Individual going into next year because of the unsustainable pricing. It's an interesting dynamic. I can't really comment on the hospital industry and what they're seeing. I can comment as we've said before, though, that on a broader trend basis, overall trend is playing quite well. So it would seem to imply at least some of our dynamics are impacting them regarding trend, but again I really can't speak to any specifics regarding their issues or concerns. But I do think people are going to have to be patient on this exchange business, and be willing to not participate aggressively until the environment gets better. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : So that, again, on Individual again, we talked about sort of attrition which is \u2013 or market share losses, which is a headwind, obviously, profitability and you have been one of the leaders on the diversified side of the house. It seems like your peers are not doing great, but here you've got Centene and Molina and even Health Net, though they're a California story, doing quite well. You have Amerigroup and Commercial. Are they doing something more about the contracting that's different? Or are they stopping their enrollment at maybe 200% or 250% federal poverty level and that's just a different ballgame in terms of profit? How does that play out for you as an Individual player in the long-term? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Ana, I really appreciate the question. Again, first, let me emphasize that we are still making money in our Individual book and making margins that we think are sustainable margins. So I think it's really important to recognize that we are an outlier, but I think we are an outlier in that we are one of the few lines that is doing quite well. Again, I can't speak specifically to Centene or Molina or others regarding their strategies and what they're doing, but there is a way to go after this market and be profitable and we are doing that. But we participate in different markets as well than they do in some cases. And so when you've seen one market, you've seen one market. Based on what we've seen for pricing next year, though, we believe at this point in time we will not be growing market share. In fact, we believe market share for us will deteriorate next year. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning. I wonder if you might just comment briefly on what you think the impact that the PACE legislation has on your outlook for Small Group, and then maybe just talk about that outlook a little bit. I know previously you anticipated some of the Small Group pressures would be not completely gone but certainly diminishing as you moved into 2016. It seems like PACE would have helped that a little bit and it also sounds like the majority of the concern or the headwind, if you will, is really more around the Individual group business versus Small Group and I just want to make sure that's correct. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Gary. I would say, broadly speaking, I think your assumptions are reasonable. We're seeing the pace of Small Group actually slow down quite a bit in terms of the attrition. As you know, earlier this month, the President did sign in the legislation, repealing the federally mandated Small Group expansion under the Affordable Care Act, which sort of changed the definition to include employers of 1 to 100 employees. So from our perspective, we think that was a positive relative to the Small Group and what we'll see, but generally, we've classified as likely to expand in our Small Group markets, into certain markets next year. We see actually a market share growth opportunity for us, but nonetheless, we want to take a cautious outlook until we see how the markets play out next year. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Go ahead. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Maybe I could ask a question on the group business and the trends you see going into next year. So you think you may get some market share gain on the Small Group side in 2016. So I would infer from that that the aggressive pricing in Individual is not as much an issue there or not an issue there. What about in the middle market and National Accounts in terms of enrollment trends that are shaping up for January on the risk and on the ASO side? Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Matt. Good morning. First of all, we're obviously not in a position yet to give guidance regarding how we're seeing certain markets play. As you know in the middle market, fourth quarter is a big re-enrollment period. So we're in the midst of re-enrollment just starting. So we'll know more as that evolves. But we do have re-enrollment occurring or new wins are in National Accounts, we know that season is now behind us and that is moving forward. So we're very pleased with our results regarding National Accounts, and we expect to be a meaningful market share taker going into next year. We'll provide more details in January, but it will be in the hundreds of thousands of range, again, it's in that taker for National Accounts. Again, I do want to clarify though we're in a very dynamic market. So we're maintaining a level of margins on Small Group we want to maintain. We think our pricing is rational. We think there's pockets where we could potentially not only stabilize but potentially grow in Small Group but we want to continue to see how the broader markets play out. But right now, with the exception of Individual, we think it's a very rational pricing for a competitive market. Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Operator : And your final question today comes from the line of Brian Wright from Sterne Agee. Please go ahead. Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT : Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple real quick. The $50 million Medicaid, I'm just assuming that's California, they seem to have been kind of \u2013 continue to be late on the full ACA gross-up. Is that right? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Again, Brian, we don't call out specific states, but I would tell you the $50 million is not a concern regarding collectability or revenue recognition. It's just a timing issue. Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT : Okay. And then \u2013 and I apologize, could you help us out with just, kind of, the magnitude of the retro stuff in the third quarter to the fourth quarter, just to help us with the magnitude on the Government segment for modeling that? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think again, Brian, as we said, we're not going to break out quarters. We don't give quarterly guidance but I would tell you though that excluding that item and the G&A timing, the outperformance that we've reflected in our new outlook is what the outperformance was in the quarter and so it's in the $0.10 to $0.20 range you can see. Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT : Okay. Great. Thank you. And (53:16) tailwinds and the commentary about the exchanges versus a Small Group. It seems to me, when I put that all together, you have projections out there in the S-4. It doesn't seem like things are materially different than that. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think at this point, we're still in the midst of building out our plan. And as Joe said, we have a growth agenda. And we just wanted to make sure that our shareholders understood the headwinds that we think are real and we continue to work through mitigation strategies and we'll provide more details in January. Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the conference back to the company's management for closing comments. Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Great. Thank you very much. Thanks for the questions and maybe building on the last question with respect to our modeling for 2016, let me say that, first, we're very pleased with the performance thus far in 2015 as reflected in our updated adjusted earnings per share outlook for the year to a range of $10.10 to $10.20. Looking ahead to 2016 now, I want to reiterate that we're focused on our long-term strategic targets and are working to identify the steps we need to take to mitigate the headwinds we've discussed this morning. There are certain key growth drivers over the next several years that I want to highlight before we leave, and that will include continued strong Government enrollment growth, National Account growth, volume and margin improvement in the Individual business, continued Large Group and Small Group execution, improvement in Medicare Advantage margins, and then operating efficiencies in capital deployment. All in, I'm really proud of the execution of our team for 2015 and what's possible for 2016 given this dynamic environment that we are performing in. Finally, I want to thank all of our associates for their continued effort to help our members access quality affordable healthcare as our markets continue to evolve. Their contribution has been critical to our success and formed the foundation of our ability to deliver our strategic goals. We look forward to speaking with you at upcoming conferences and events. Again, thank you very much for being with us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 11 :00 A.M. Eastern Time today through November 11.

Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Anthem Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Douglas R. Simpson - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning and welcome to Anthem's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. This is Doug Simpson, Vice President of Investor Relations. With us this morning are Joe Swedish, Chairman, President and CEO; and Wayne DeVeydt, our CFO. Joe will offer an overview of our fourth quarter 2015 financial results and will walk through the financial details and provide the details of our initial 2016 outlook.. We are then available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Joe. Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Doug, and good morning. We are pleased to announce fourth quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $1.14. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $0.68. For the full year 2015, adjusted earnings per share was $10.16, representing year-over-year growth of 8.7% and GAAP earnings per share of $9.38. It's important to note that our results include roughly $.04 of assessments associated with the State of Colorado dissolution of their co-op, an expense that was not expected when we last stated our full-year earnings outlook. I am very pleased with our 2015 performance. And I believe the growing diversification of our company and the complementary nature of our pending Cigna acquisition will position us well to capitalize on marketing opportunities over the next several years. We remain focused on improving healthcare affordability, quality and choice to our growing membership base. I am going to start with some overview comments on our fourth quarter and 2015 results and then move to discuss our 2016 outlook in more detail. Fourth quarter results capped a successful 2015 with underlying fundamentals that tracked well versus our expectations. The fourth quarter represented the lowest quarterly adjusted earnings per share during 2015 which reflected our evolving business mix and the timing of medical utilization and operating expenses. As expected, this included lower margins in our commercial and government businesses due to a higher benefit expense ratio and an increase in investment spending. Both fully insured and self-funded membership tracked ahead of expectations and we ended the year with 36.6 million members, a growth of 1.1 million lives or nearly 3% since 2014. Our fourth quarter performance creates a favorable starting point for 2016 enrollment. In particular, during the quarter we saw better than expected membership growth in our large group and Medicaid markets. As expected we ended the year with 791,000 individual public exchange lives, a decrease of 33,000 from the third quarter. During 2015, we added a total of 84,000 lives in public exchanges. Our small-group enrollment declined by just north of 100,000 lives in the quarter to 1.2 million lives as we saw higher than expected lapses in plans that had previously earlier renewed with a December 1 benefit start date. During the quarter, medical cost trends continues to came in favorably versus our stated range. Our 2015 medical cost trend came in at the lower half of our previously guided range of 6.5% to 7.5%. For 2016, we anticipate lower-group medical cost trends will be slightly higher in the range of 7% to 7.5%. Operating revenue was $78.4 billion during 2015, an increase of $5.4 billion or 7.4% versus 2014, reflecting strong enrollment growth in the government business. Additional premium revenue to cover over-all cost trends and increased fees associated with healthcare reform. Also contributing was the growth in administrative fee revenue as a result of our strong self-funded membership trends. This was partially offset by fully insured membership losses in our commercial business. The full year 2015 benefit expense ratio was 83.3%, an increase of 20 basis points from the prior year. The year-over-year increase reflected the change in our business mix towards the government business division and a higher benefit expense ratio in the individual exchange business. Our SG&A expense ratio came in at 16% for the full year 2015, a decrease of 10 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by the changing mix of our membership to the government business and a continued focus on administrative expense control, reflecting the need to insure that we have the right cost structure for our public exchange membership outlook throughout 2016. Supporting the strong quality of our earnings during 2015, we reported operating cash flow approximately $4.1 billion or 1.6 times net income with cash flow in the fourth quarter of $949 million. While we're pleased with our run rate cash flow performance, our 2015 results included the benefit of approximately $500 million in timing items related to government and vendor payments. These items are simply timing and accelerated our 2015 cash flow which we originally expected to be in 2016. Including the impact of these timing items, we expect 2016 operating cash flow to be greater than $3 billion. Commercial operating margins in 2015 were 7.6% reflecting year-over-year improvements in all lines of business with the exception of individual. As we have previously discussed, operating results on the public exchanges have lagged expectations during the year as membership was more than 30% behind our original expectations. As expected commercial fourth quarter margins represented the lowest of the year reflecting the timing of benefits, expense and our evolving mix of business. Our government business continued its strong year into the fourth quarter with an ending margin of 4.8%, an improvement of 130 basis points versus 2014 along with better than expected membership results. In particular, our Medicare and Medicaid margins improved meaningfully versus 2014. We're very encouraged by the turnaround plan put in place by our Medicare team, now finishing the second year of a three year plan. Their recent performance is an encouraging next step towards driving meaningful long-term earnings growth. We expect margins will continue to improve in 2016 towards our expected long-term sustainable level, and we have positioned our portfolio to grow enrollment in the right markets with the right products in 2017. For Medicaid, our team has built a process that is focused on the basic blocking and tackling aspects of managing our members' total cost of care and quality. We're leveraging our assets to provide industry-leading solutions to our government partners to help control their population's healthcare costs without sacrificing the quality of care. While this year's margin performance is above our long-term expectations, we feel confident in our team's ability to continue to outperform on a wide variety of care management and performance metrics. Regarding our balance sheet metrics, we have included a role forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. For the full year, 2015, we experienced favorable prior-year reserve development of $800 million which was moderately better than our expectations. While the favorable development was higher than what was recognized during 2014, it resulted in offsetting adjustments for the risk stabilization programs from healthcare reform. We continue to maintain our upward single-digit margin for adverse deviation and believe our reserve balance remains consistent and strong as of December 31st, 2015. For the 3Rs related to the 2015 benefit year, we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate and continue to expect to be in a net payable position for risk corridors. We continue to record a valuation allowance against the risk corridor receivables in certain markets as we do not believe those receivables will ultimately be collected. We believe our estimates are prudent given the dynamic nature of available information. Our days in claims payable was 42.7 days as of December 31, an increase of 0.4 days from the 42.3 days as of September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to changes in the timing of claims payments between periods. As previously discussed, we do still expect days and claims payable to come back down closer to 40 days over time. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 40.8% at December 31, 2015, down 40 basis points from 41.2% as of September 30, which reflects the impact of reducing our outstanding balance in commercial paper during the quarter. We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $1.4 billion in cash and investments at the parent company and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $368 million as of December 31. Turning to our 2016 outlook, we currently expect operating revenues to grow to a range of $80 billion to $81 billion which is light of the long-term projections we laid out at our Investor Day in early 2014. The shortfall was primarily due to our individual exchange membership being meaningfully behind our projections, as we've discussed with you previously. In commercial, we expect relatively steady enrollment during the year. We expect growth of over 300,000 lives for National Accounts in 2016 with strong momentum in securing new contract wins and exceeding our retention expectations. We also expect growth in large group self-funded enrollment reflecting new contract wins. While we expect strong growth in ASO, our commercial-fully-insured growth will be pressured. We expect membership declines of approximately 300,000 in our individual business, as we aren't experiencing the overall market growth on the public exchange that we projected when we laid our five-year plan and unsustainable pricing in some markets is hurting our historic market share. We are encouraged that early indicators of the open enrollment activity are slightly better than our muted expectations. Recent actions taken by CMS to begin addressing the special enrollment period challenges as well as the elimination of the health insurer fee in 2017 are important first steps towards improving affordability for our customers. And you can be assured; we are contributing to the dialog to form a long-term, sustainable and affordable marketplace. We also expect Local Group fully-insured membership losses of approximately 250,000 as members continue to transition into self-funded product offerings. It is important to note that while this trend is in line with recent history, we now do not expect a meaningful offset to this trend from growth on the private exchanges. Additionally, we expect continued pressure from the impact of higher levels of attrition due to the ending of insurance policies that were early-renewed by our clients before the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. For Government, we expect another strong enrolment growth year. We expect Medicaid to add more than 350,000 lives reflecting the addition of new business in the state of Iowa as well as continued organic growth in core and expansion products. We continue to see states gravitate towards managed care to be the solution for more complex populations and services and we expect to be front and center supporting these states' initiatives. Within our Medicare business, we continue to expect enrollment to be relatively steady as growth in our existing markets will be mostly offset by membership losses as we finalize the repositioning of our book in certain markets as part of our turnaround plan. Turning to financial metrics, we expect relatively stable margins in 2016. We currently expect an MLR midpoint of 83.6%, an increase of 30 basis points versus 2015. This reflects the impact of a change in the mix of our business as we expect strong growth in Medicaid, a business with a higher MLR than the consolidated average. Relating to cost-trend expectations, again, we expect 2016 Local Group medical cost trends to be in the range of 7% to 7.5%. We expect our SG&A ratio in 2016 to be 15.4% at the midpoint. This reflects the impact of a changing mix of our business. Strong growth in Medicaid and the impact of the administrative efficiency initiatives our management team is taking to work through the challenging public exchange environment. Below the line, we expect investment income of approximately $650 million, and interest expense of approximately $630 million. Note that our interest expense projection does not include the costs we expect to incur related to the bridge loan financing we have in place for the pending Cigna acquisition. We also currently expect our tax rate to be in the range of 43.5% to 45.5% for the year. We expect some benefit from the impact of capital deployment activities next year. While we suspended share repurchases after the announcement of the Cigna acquisition in 2015, we plan to resume our capital deployment program in 2016 subject to market conditions, albeit at a lower level than in recent years. As a result, we currently expect our share count for the year to be in the range of 266 million to 270 million shares. We remain committed to at least maintaining our current dividend. We plan to review our capital deployment strategies at our next board meeting in February, and we expect to make an announcement on our first quarter 2016 dividend shortly thereafter. To conclude, our 2016 GAAP earnings per share estimate is greater than $10.35. Our adjusted earnings per share outlook is greater than $10.80. The difference between these two estimates is the exclusion of the amortization of deal related intangibles. It's important to note that our 2016 outlook does not include any benefits or transaction costs associated with the pending acquisition of Cigna, which we continue to expect will close in the second half of the year. With that, operator. Please open the queue for questions. Operator : Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Hello. Thanks, everyone. I noticed on your guidance, you are forecasting your medical cost trend to a range of 50 basis points. Traditionally, you guys have always used 100 basis points in forecasting that. I'm just curious on your thinking of narrowing that. Obviously, the step-up sort of seemed similar to what you assumed last year and you came in at the low end. I'm just curious of the thinking behind that? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, A.J.; good morning, Essentially the thinking was that as of the last several years, I think it's fair to say there's been a lot of volatility regarding the exchanges, the Affordable Care Act, a number of new specialty drugs coming in. From our perspective, we generally have a point of view that's within 50 basis points. We've been hanging in pretty tight to that. And so it was more just to make sure that you understood that in fact we were raising our trend assumptions and our pricing going into this year. And have tried to tighten that band within a 50 basis point range. As we are getting better clarity now on the underlying activity associated with our commercial book as well as the new drugs that are coming in. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then just to follow up on the \u2013 I know at a conference earlier in the month, you guys had made some comments about where you were at with your PBM, and I don't assume there is no assumptions and anything in the guidance related to this to any kind of changes in that contract, but is there any update on what you are thinking there, and what the opportunity might be? Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : AJ, good morning, this is Joe. Nothing has changed since our statements earlier this month at the conference. And nothing has been included in the materials regarding the PBM dialog that we've had thus far, so I guess more to come later. But nothing is embedded at the moment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Barclays. Please go ahead. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. First question, I just want to ask about the CMS sanctions at Cigna? And just want to see how does that fit with your understanding? Sort of when did you guys find out about it? Did you know about this as part of the diligence? And does this change anything in terms of your outlook, your financial outlook for the combined entities? Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, thank you. It's Joe again. First let me clearly state, we have two separate companies and obviously activities of that nature within their company, we do not have line of sight of nor should we, I think. And we are kind of considering it as you would expect, but at the moment we really don't have enough line of sight to pass judgment on what effect it may have, if any for that matter. So we will be vigilant and I'm certain that as time marches on, we'll learn more. But quite frankly at this stage there's really nothing for us to say regarding what impact it may have regarding Cigna. And with respect to the transaction itself, we are clearly and unwavering with respect to our commitment to the deal. This does not have an effect on the deal process. And obviously, as we learn more, we'll certainly feather it into our considerations. But at this stage we just do not believe it has a material effect on our transaction. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got you. That's what I was looking for. And then just on the Commercial business, the MLR, I think in the past you guys have been attributing the increase, at least last quarter, to the Individual business. Now you're adding local group into that sort of discussion for the MLR driver. So just trying to figure out what's driving that increase? Did the Individual business deteriorate more? Or is this now more of a small-group issue? And as we look about the overall margin for the commercial segment this quarter being just over breakeven, is it fair to assume you're losing money now? Obviously in Individual, but also on the Local Group side as well? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, Josh, let me clarify. There's normal seasonality that we see in all books of business as deductibles are met throughout the year, so I want to emphasize that relative to the group business, no concerns at all. The primary MLR drivers are mix in the quarter. And as we've been talking about, the public exchanges. So again, I don't want to create any alarms there. Trend finished at the low end, lower half of our range, as we said earlier and the metrics remained strong. One thing I would like to highlight though for each of you on the call is that we tried to maintain a conservative posture on the 3Rs as well while maintaining our reserve balance sheet strength with our high-single digit margin for adverse deviation at year end. So when you look at our run-rate Individual business, we still made a very slight \u2013 I'll call it, closer to breakeven for the year. But keep in mind that's with us maintaining a very conservative position on the 3Rs as well. And going into 2016, we are still assuming we will be profitable on our Individual and exchange business, albeit below our targeted 3% to 5% margins as we continue to see those markets hopefully begin to harden around pricing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thanks. Just I guess, I understand the concept of the mix shift impacting the MLR and the SG&A ratios, but it looks like given that you're growing earnings faster than revenue, you're looking for actual margin expansion next year. Can you point is it one division that you would point to as seeing stronger margin improvement year-over-year? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Kevin, the primary thing I would highlight is a lot of the initiatives we took was to take the G&A deleveraging out across the organization, that if we weren't going to see the membership growth that we expected on the exchanges. And then more importantly, I think as Joe has said, he's committed to us driving towards the $14 in 2018, and so we've had a very aggressive G&A initiative which allows both margin maintenance as well as some expansion in all lines of business as that effort was an enterprise-wide effort. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So it's on the Commercial side that you would say is where more of the margin expansion would be? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And I guess as far as that comment about the 2014 number, I guess last quarter you kind of said, hey, the individual membership is coming in below what we might have thought and over our long-term targets that could be a drag towards hitting that. Are you saying now that you've found some offsets that are still going to make you comfortable with getting $14 on a standalone basis before Express? Or is that still a risk in your view? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. Kevin, I would say that relative to the revenue line item, if the individual membership fully insured market doesn't ramp up over the next several years, I think that $100 billion in organic revenue will be at risk. But I think relative to the $14 of earnings per share, as we've been able to show in 2015 going into 2016, there are many levers that we can pull, and Joe has aggressively pushed the management team to pull those levers with a high degree of confidence, hopefully, in our ability to execute against them. And so I think at this point I would tell you, and I'll let Joe say it for himself, he's committed and this management team is committed to driving towards the $14, but we may get there different than we laid out two years ago. Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Thanks, Wayne. I will just reiterate and emphasize, we recognize the $100 billion might be somewhat flexible in terms of where we may end up in 2018 on that metric. However, we're incredibly committed to the $14. We believe there are certainly a lot of variables in the equation that will map to what the ultimate revenue capture will be. But nonetheless, all parts and pieces are going to line up we believe very effectively for us to make that $14 commitment. And so, again, we've got all actions in place regarding matters like the G&A controls and a variety of other puts and takes on the management side that will get us to the $14 target. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Kevin, as we said previously too, the PBM and the rising interest rates both serve as hedges against the other risks that we see in the business and potential opportunities for upside as well. Kevin, one other item I would like to highlight, as you had asked about other businesses with margin in addition to G&A, the Medicare improvement, as Joe laid out, our efforts over the last two years have been quite substantial, and the results have been very promising. So we will see very nice margin improvement in Medicare going into 2016 as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, I had one question and one follow-up. Just in terms of your costs trend guidance for 2016, would you care to kind of go through components of that? So hospital, inpatient, outpatient, physician form? Even just qualitatively in terms of expectations would be helpful. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We won't break it down, necessarily, although I can tell you that you can typically expect very little change in the physician aspects of it. It's very much driven more towards the specialty pharma being one of the primary drivers. We are expecting an increase in utilization on inpatient. Whether or not that plays out will remain to be seen. But it's primarily utilization and then it's a unit cost on pharma that are the drivers. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then just a clarification, on the reported operating gain for the commercial segment for 4Q, it's $57 million, that's 0.6% margin, is that figure normalized excluding the California franchise tax ruling? Or is there a pre-tax number that's weighing upon that reported operating income margin? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. The only item that is of a unique nature that would be in there from an operating gain perspective is our desire to maintain a strong balance sheet associated with the 3Rs. And that has a direct impact on that. I'd like to be optimistic and hope there'll be upside there, but it appears even in the last year our conservative nature on some of these 3Rs has proved to be prudent. And so we decided to take that same posture in the fourth quarter and strengthen even further some of the 3R assumptions. Based on the public data available, it would imply we're conservative. But at the same time that data would have implied that last year it ended up not being the case. We tried to strengthen even further, and of course that hits the commercial segment directly. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's primarily a risk adjustment number we'll see in the 10-K? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, the risk adjustment as well as the position that we don't see value in the corridors and assume a 100% allowance, as well as on the reinsurance we have stuck with strictly what the law currently says we're entitled to, not what maybe excess funding may be in the pool. And so those are the three positions we have taken a conservative posture in. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning. I may have missed this, I'm not sure if you gave it. Did you say where you ended the year in terms of exchange, enrollment and maybe what's embedded into expectations in terms of exchange enrollment for 2016? And then just expanding on that, maybe where you're at in terms of on versus off exchange for your individual book? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We ended the year just shy of 800,000 members on the exchange enrollment, around 791,000 which was below our planned expectations by about 30%. We now are looking at the book in a more fungible way, we're looking on exchange and off exchange now because it's becoming quite fungible between the two as grand-mothering is moving away. And so for next year, we have individual declining by another 300,000 lives all in going into 2016. At least, that's our assumption. As Joe said in the prepared remarks, the early enrollment application is encouraging against that assumption, but it's very important that we wait and see how lapses actually occur because we will know who ultimately pays and doesn't pay. We won't know that answer until the end of this month. So, again, the applications to-date would imply that we may be conservative there, but until we see actual payments and disenrollment, it's hard to declare. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then just on the ASL book, you continue to show nice growth there. Are you seeing and capturing existing ASO business? Are you may be seeing a continued shift from risk to ASO? Are you seeing more penetration downstream to mid or smaller employers? Just trying to get a sense of the dynamics at play? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's a little bit of both. Clearly, on the National Accounts, those were a lot of new wins for us, obviously some very sizeable wins including the Bank of America account. So from that perspective, I would say a big chunk of the ASO is really new membership and new lives to us. When you look at the shift from fully insured to ASO, that shift continues. I wouldn't call it at an accelerated pace anymore, it seems to have slowed down. But nonetheless, it's still occurring. And so we are retaining a lot of that membership moving from fully insured to ASO. But as you know, on a revenue basis, that really dampens the revenue if you're not getting the offset through either the public exchanges, or for that matter, what we thought would have been a faster pace in the private exchanges, which we believe is a much more muted pace now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead. David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So on the premium number, Wayne, that you were just hitting on the guidance relative to expectations is, call it, $2.5 billion to $3 billion light. The ASO shift accounts for some of that, but maybe less than half. I'm wondering if you believe you're getting \u2013 if there is anything in mix that would be affecting yield? And are you getting full premium yield relative to the cost trend expectations you are expecting for 2016? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Dave, great question. Let me first highlight that this revenue shortfall is almost predominantly associated with the lack of growth on the public exchanges. I can't emphasize that point enough. And ultimately, that would be the one area I would say, while we're projecting profitability still in 2016, clearly at margins below what we think are the long-term margins for sustainable program and product. So that would be the one area I would point to relative to yield. We are still able to cover our cost-to-capital on them and be profitable. But we are looking forward to some of the structural changes that I know the administration is looking at to make these programs even more viable in the long term. But our revenue issue is really a fully insured public exchange issue at this point. The rest of the book-of-business is performing well versus our five-year expectations we've laid out. David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay. My follow-up would be a follow-up on the PBM. Would you guys be willing to comment on how the analysis bridged from the $500 million to $700 million that you talked about say mid to early second half of 2015, to the $3 billion you've now talked about in January of 2016? Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : This is Joe. Let me comment on that. Going back in time to 2015 at earnings day, we did land on the $500 million to $700 million as a proxy statement regarding what may be possible related to market-check analysis, et cetera. Then fast-forward to today. We've gone through a very deliberate analytical process. We've vectored toward an answer related to multiple checks in the marketplace, and that brought us to the $3 billion finding that we believe is very, very credible, and obviously, having made that statement, which we believe kind of recalibrates the number from that $500 million to $700 million to something that we believe is much more realistic. So what we said back in 2015 is that we would update you in 2016 actually hoping to communicate, I'll just call it, a solution to you regarding our PBM inquiry regarding what we would have to do to reposition ourselves to get to the end of the contract in 2019. So having made the statement about the $3 billion, our market-check expectations, we believe we've set the table now for conversations in and around the possibility of recasting our pricing relationship with ESI. So all I can tell you at this stage is that dialog will continue, and we're hopeful that still in 2016, we will reach a resolution to this matter that we are engaged in with ESI. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold from Cowen. Please go ahead. Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey there. I'm looking at the MLR, and as of third quarter of 2015, you expected the full year to be 82.9%, plus or minus 30 basis points and you were above that range at 83.3% for the full year. So was individual entirely the shortfall on that loss ratio? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi, Christine. Good morning. Individual was substantially the shortfall, that's correct. And again, it's important to recognize that some of the balance sheet strengthening we've done would all flow through that as well, regarding not only the 3Rs, but maintaining that high single digit for adverse deviation. So I would point you almost solely to that. Medicaid enrollment was a little bit stronger in the quarter than we had anticipated as well. So that has a little bit of an MLR mix shift to it. But it's predominantly individual and then the strengthening we did on the 3Rs. Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And first half of the year, we were looking at a 3% to 5% margin, second half of the year we're looking at breakeven, so we've completely erased that 3% to 5%. Yet the bids were due in May and June. So can you help me understand how \u2013 when you didn't know about this 3% to 5% erosion in profitability you're confident that this is going to improve next year? Thanks. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Christine, it's a really great question. And it's one of the reasons that \u2013 the issue we had though on our margins this year was the inability to deleverage G&A quick enough. So we were still assuming a 3% to 5% margin, but we were also assuming a 30% growth rate. As we started seeing that growth rate not only not occur, but beginning to see some attrition in the latter part of the year, we realized it was imperative to get the G&A out. And I can tell you that those initiatives have occurred, those actions around head count and other costs have already been taken out now, and we will get the run rate effect going into the year. So from that perspective, we feel fairly confident. Again, I would emphasize the public data that we're getting regarding risk adjustors from Wakely, regarding how 3Rs settled up on reinsurance last year, et cetera would imply we are being conservative in that outlook. But we've chosen to take that posture in 2015, and that's part of the reason of getting close to breakeven. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. please go ahead. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I appreciate you taking the question. The question firstly is around the catcher's-mitt strategy that you had articulated. Now we are two years into exchanges. As you are looking at your small group, that $800 million EBIT headwind \u2013 sorry $800 million to $400 million that you had articulated. When you look at it across, firstly, is that stemmed at this point? When you look at it across small group and individual, are you coming out net positive? Is it net neutral? Or is it continuing to be a headwind? And how do you expect that going forward into 2016 and then 2017? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Thanks for the question. I would say the catcher's-mitt strategy itself is working as we would expect as we are clearly seeing attrition in lines of business. Small group alone lost over 100,000 lives in the fourth quarter. Clearly, we're picking up those lives elsewhere as we were able to exceed our membership targets for the year. I would say, the part of the strategy that's not coming to light at this point isn't about capturing the member now, but where exactly that member is caught and the revenue associated with that member. I think at this point, when we've built our five-year plan, we fully expect that more of these lives will be picked up in the public exchanges as a fully insured. We are finding that some of those lives now are actually getting employed, and more in an ASO market, or we are picking them up on Medicaid, which in some case has a lower PMPM than (39:21) we would have got on the public exchange. So ultimately, I would say the strategy of the catcher's mitt itself is working in terms of getting the customers and continuing to grow membership, but I would say the mix of membership and how it translates to revenue is not panning out as we had anticipated. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : And then following up on that, just now on the public exchanges, but your decline in individual from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, was that mainly the special enrollment period folks that did that? And as you're looking out into 2017 as reinsurance goes away, do you think the policy changes that the administration is making would still allow you to remain on exchange and be profitable into 2017? Is this, again, part of your catcher's mitt? Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Ana, this is Joe. Let me comment on the kind of the continued engagement that we envision the exchanges. Yes, we are certainly very observant of the shifts and changes that the administration is enacting, especially paying a lot of attention to special enrollment period. Very thankful the administration has made some changes. I suspect there may be more changes in the near future which we want to consider very carefully so that we can judge the sustainability of the exchange marketplace and how well we can engage in that marketplace going forward. So we're very observant regarding these moves and changes. We feel that, as Wayne pointed out a moment ago, we're extremely well positioned with respect to matters like G&A that allows us to perform in this space reasonably well. Notwithstanding member deterioration, it's presumably stabilized given what we're observing regarding some uptick in membership for 2016, which obviously, as Wayne pointed out, we'll probably know more within the month. But nonetheless, we're really carefully observing it, looking at special enrollment in terms of its potential impact, and again we're very hopeful that some of the issues will be ameliorated in terms of the risk and we'll have a much more sustainable marketplace to engage in. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Scott J. Fidel - Credit Suisse : Thanks. First question, just if you can give us an update on how the implementation of Iowa Medicaid is coming along? And just interested just in the context of the state having removed WellCare from the contract? What your updated enrollment expectation is for Iowa? And then what type of losses you're building in and expecting? Obviously, United did increase their PDR for Iowa as a result of that, so just interested in how you're approaching this? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Scott, good morning. First of all, relative to Iowa, we continue to be optimistic about this program in the long term and that it will have the similar trajectory of we expect to lose money in year one, get closer to breakeven in year two, and then return to profitability by year three. We got an update from the team yesterday. Actually Joe and the senior leadership team got a full, deep dive on where things are progressing and things are moving exactly as we would have expected at this point. We're very close to starting that implementation on 3/1/2016. We don't have line of sight of what membership we may or may not get. As you know, there are a number of appeals that have been filed both by the one individual that was selected that has been told they were being removed, as well as others that were not selected in the first round, so we have not included any of that and we want to see how that pans out. That being said, if you were to look at Medicaid all in, both margin compressions that we were receiving throughout the year, that we expect. Plus we're assuming even further margin pressure in the back half of 2016 from states, as well as expansion. There's about a few hundred million dollar headwind baked in, but I would tell you that Iowa is less than 25% of that. So it gives you kind of a gauge of how we're envisioning year one to evolve, and then migrate more to year two, and then from there to the normal profitability we would have in these programs. The delay of two months is part of the reason for that level of loss in year one because ultimately we've got the G&A float happening, but we don't have the revenue yet. Scott J. Fidel - Credit Suisse : Got it. Okay. And then just had a follow-up question just on small group. And actually a number that I don't think we've talked about for a few quarters. But just interested \u2013 remember a couple years back you had talked about how small group would potentially have to absorb maybe a $400 million EBIT hit from ACA as thinking about both sort of margin rebasement, and then enrollment attrition. And just interested if you can give us an update on sort of how you're tracking relative to that number? Obviously, there has been recent attrition, but just interested if we're sort of at that number? Or still some ways to go? Or just where we stand relative to that? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So relative to the $400 million, Scott, which was more about margin reset, I'd say we've taken our medicine on that $400 million over the last couple of years. Now it becomes a question of, will small group continue to migrate to other lines of business over time around just pure membership? But we have taken that sizeable hit. As we saw in the fourth quarter, a very sizeable chunk of that membership migrated away from fully insured. And the question is, will we recover that even through the public exchanges and open enrollment or others? Again, our early open enrollment data would imply we are recovering it, but we want to see what actually converts to a pay by the end of the month. But I'd say in terms of the margin compression, we've taken a substantial portion of that $400 million. Scott J. Fidel - Credit Suisse : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Yes, hi. Good morning. If I could just go back to the exchanges for a moment again, a couple questions there. When you talked about the unsustainable price competition and also the lack of market growth, should we read that the decline that you're expecting of $300,000 is all about the unsustainable price competition since, if the market didn't grow then maybe you would expect it to be flat? And my follow-up question to that is, as we look to 2017, how much impact \u2013 favorable impact do you think you'll get from the risk pool as grandmothering plans work their way into the exchanges? Albeit, I know it is not going to be the case for your two largest markets, California and New York. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Matt, I appreciate the questions. A couple of thoughts or at least insights. One is yes, we are assuming that some of the pricing that we continue to see in our markets, our 14 states, is still well below what we think appropriate rates are for a sustainable environment. I think the fact that we're closer to breakeven in 2015 and a profit margin that's below the targeted 3% to 5% in 2016 I think is a good indication of our price point isn't wrong, as much as others need to strengthen their price points. So we are going to assume that the strengthening is not occurring. In fact, we know in many states it hasn't occurred, and that we will continue to trade members. That being said, we are starting to see individuals start to recognize the problems in their books. They are starting to strengthen their pricing quite meaningfully. We are seeing co-ops struggle in the moment with more than half of those now insolvent. So the question comes, will the market start to harden going into 2017? Which has really two effects for us. One is we no longer have the diminishing membership base. But more importantly, we should be, hopefully, a net recipient of that and hopefully start getting some of that revenue back that we talked about in our original five-year outlook. And then relative to 2017, Matt, to your comment with grandmothering. It's really hard to say at this point, the behaviors of the dynamics of what will the market look like in 2017, not just the exchanges, and how grandmothering, but just what's the global economy and the U.S. economy is doing? What implications does that have as well. But the theory of what you laid out would imply that you are going to get more of those lives in that are a healthier population, and should help improve the overall profitability of the book as well. But as you indicated, in our largest markets, we did not allow grandfathering in many cases, and we migrated already. So it won't have as big of an impact, but if the market has hardened, it should improve for us. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for the question. A couple of years ago and clearly last few actual years, we've talked about consumerization of healthcare and the growth of private exchanges, and we really haven't seen that come through in a significant way. Here we are in second year with that not delivering much membership growth. Can you tell us how you're evolving your strategy on consumerization in private exchanges? Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, this is Joe. Thanks for the question. Yeah, I think private exchanges have had a slow uptake probably for a few reasons. But I think it was considered as sort of an offset to the Cadillac tax exposure and other necessities that business and industry considered in terms of moving their employees into a private exchange marketplace. It didn't materialize to the level of speed that anybody anticipated in the early going. And our position at the moment is that we are kind of taking a more muted response to the private exchange formation and execution. Nonetheless, we're going to be ready if and when it does accelerate, and it may very well do so in the future. But at this stage, it really is a sort of a muted response to that strategy. And we believe what you're seeing nationally is sort of an in-market standard in terms of private exchanges is simply not picking up the speed that folks had originally anticipated. So we're basically waiting, wait and see, and we're positioned \u2013 and in fact, we do have private exchange membership that is not a substantial part of our membership, but certainly we are in the space. I guess bottom line is, affordability is still the key and remains critical to long-term positioning on part of employers. And as private exchange presents itself as a solution, we are ready, willing and able to engage in a meaningful way. But again, I think our response at this stage is fairly muted given it's been such a slow uptake. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. This is just a follow-up if you don't mind. Can you talk about the premium tax issue in California and your exposure to that in terms of the litigation against your company? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi Pete. Let me just first highlight that in California the tax laws differ based on legal entity, very similar to any legal entity in the United States has different tax laws. We pay our taxes exactly as the law states within the state of California, as do our competitors that have similar legal entities filed there. And the DMHC has actually agreed that we're paying taxes in accordance with the law. So at this point I can simply state that it is fully our intention to follow the law as we've done so far and it is fully our intention to litigate any action brought against us that would imply otherwise. And so there's nothing more to comment on beyond that other than you should be aware that it is the law that we are following under and the DMHC has supported us in that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg from Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Good morning. Just quickly here on the government segment. I know Wayne, I think you said you're expecting to earn about $200 million less in Medicaid but grow a little bit in Medicare. Net-net, is it going to be flattish or down in the government segment in 2016? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good question. It's going to be slightly down, which gives you a pretty good idea of how well our Medicare is actually performing. But it will be slightly down between those. And again, it's important to recognize we thought it was prudent to have a cautious posture on how Medicaid rates may evolve as the year progresses. So not just the rates we know about in October but what happens in mid-July as well as next October. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Great. And then just on the reinsurance, can you quantify how much you expect from \u2013 how much you expect to receive in 2015 and \u2013 would you have lost money without that amount? Thanks. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I think the first thing to keep in mind is we're just assuming just slightly over 50%. You know, I don't think you can look at it as whether you would lose money with or without that amount because it's important to recognize we're collecting that premium within our premium base on behalf of the government and then submitting that into the reinsurance pool. So our pricing is baked with an assumption that we will get what the law says we're entitled to get without it. So I don't think you can look at it with or without the program because the pricing is built with that program. That being said, as you know there's data points out there that would imply that people may recover as much as 55% to 60% and, again, we're much more aligned with where the law is. When I say slightly over 50%, it doesn't even round up to 51%. So it gives you a little bit of a feel for we're just barely over 50%. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Schenker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning. Could you maybe talk a little bit more on Medicare? Obviously, seen some significant improvements in 2015, calling for continued improvements in 2016, but how should we think about how much room is left beyond that as well as maybe the level of investments currently in Medicare for the repositioning? And will some of that start winding down in 2016, 2017? Thanks. Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : This is Joe again. You know, since I joined the company a few years ago, we really put a stake in the ground that we were going to reposition ourselves in the Medicare space very aggressively. We established \u2013 as I said a moment ago, a three-year plan, and we're well into that three-year plan realization in terms of our targets. The margins we expect to expand over time, and we do believe that we're really heavily focused on medical cost management capabilities and we have an increased focus on our administrative cost structure as being a key contributor to margin improvement. So when you put all that together, we're witnessing a substantial \u2013 I'd call it even a turnaround in our Medicare book that really gives us cause for optimism going forward. We really do remain very pleased with the success that we've created with the team and I'm hopeful that as we get through 2016 and well into 2017 that we'll be able to report on a trajectory that's on a positive track. Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then just real quick on seasonality, here. I mean, it's obviously increasingly front-half loaded. Should we view 2015 seasonality as kind of the framework for 2016, or is there any changes that could swing those numbers? Thanks. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Andy, great question. I would think the seasonality in 2015 will be more reflective of what you'll see in 2016. Just keep in mind the wild card in all of this is really going to be around how these 3Rs ultimately settle out from our perspective. Again, we believe we've been prudent at booking to a conservative point of view, but as more data comes out on those 3Rs, that could create some unique nuances throughout the year. And also how these co-ops evolve throughout the year and how the states plan to solve for that could create nuances into 2016. But generally speaking, 2015 is a pretty good proxy for the seasonality you should expect in 2016. Operator : And your final question today comes from the line of Sarah James from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thank you. You mentioned some potential headwinds on Medicaid rates for 2016, and you're not the first company to spike out that concern. So what are you currently building into guidance for your blended rates in 2016? What was it in 2015? And can you talk about how you view margins on that business for legacy Medicaids, excluding Iowa or any new contracts? How do you think about margins developing for Medicaid? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So good question. One is, though, I do want to highlight, we don't generally give blended rate increases. As you know, it varies by state and because of the underlying economics of each state vary dramatically, we would prefer not to blend them together in a broad discussion. That being said, though, Sarah, I think it's a fair question to understand that we have margins that are exceeding what we believe are our long-term sustainable optimal margins, but know that we are still assuming that we will blend closer to a 5% margin, all in, going into next year. Now, that's higher than what you've typically heard for Medicaid, which would be the 2% to 3% margin range, but it's important to recognize that we do get a gross-up for the health insurer fee as well, so that bumps those margins further. But we think that the guidance we've provided puts us at what hopefully will be a sustainable out-performance margin for us. We believe we should have a better margin because we believe we can execute on this better, and the team that we've brought in from the Amerigroup almost three years now has done an exceptional job in that space. But our pricing assumes slowly landing the plane on those margins to get to more of that sustainable long-term margin. Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. And was there anything moving pieces-wise in the quarter from Medicaid, like a flu benefit? Or I think in the past, you had mentioned the potential for a retroactive premium payment? So is there anything out-of-period or unusual that we should think about with this quarter's Medicaid performance? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, nothing unusual in terms of the actual numbers. Things tied out where we thought they would tie out. What was a little unusual was more on the cash flow. We actually had a couple of large vendors in a couple states in particular pay us on the last day of the year for rates we typically get in the first five days of the New Year. So it affected cash flow, but it didn't actually affect the underlying economics of what we had assumed. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the conference back to the company's management for closing comments. Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Thank you all for your questions this morning. In summary, we're pleased with our 2015 results and believe the increasing diversification of our business positions us well for 2016 and beyond. As you've heard, our team remains focused on executing on our core business while preparing for the integration of our Cigna acquisition. We expect to close in the second half of the year. I want to thank you all for being with us today and I especially want to thank our associates for their ongoing contributions and their commitment to serving our 38.6 million customers every day. Thank you all for your interest in Anthem, and we look forward to speaking with you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 11 :00 A.M.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later there will be a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Douglas R. Simpson - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, and welcome to Anthem's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. This is Doug Simpson, Vice President of Investor Relations. With us this morning are Joe Swedish, Chairman President and CEO; and Wayne DeVeydt, our CFO. Joe will offer an overview of our first quarter 2016 financial results and will walk through the financials and provide some incremental commentary around our updated 2016 outlook. We are then available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Joe. Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Doug, and good morning. We're pleased to announce first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $3.46, with membership tracking above our previous expectations. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.63. I'm pleased with our first quarter results, which represent a solid start to 2016 as the company continues to benefit from the growing diversification of our business. The complementary nature of our pending Cigna acquisition will allow us to further advance affordability and quality for our members. I'm going to start with some overview comments on our first quarter 2016 results and then we'll discuss a few of the key details of our updated 2016 outlook. First quarter results reflect business performance that tracked well versus our expectations. Specifically, membership is exceeding our expectations and we reported strong quality of earnings metrics while maintaining appropriate conservatism on our balance sheet to reflect the dynamic nature of the marketplace that exists today. Within membership, both fully-insured and self-funded membership are tracking ahead of expectations and we ended the first quarter with 39.6 million members, reflecting growth of 1 million lives or 2.6% since year end 2015. Specifically, we ended the quarter with 975,000 lives from the Individual public exchanges, an increase of 184,000 from year-end 2015 and ahead of our initial expectations. Our self-funded business grew by 906,000 lives or 3.8% in the quarter to 24.6 million members, which was also ahead of our expectations as the company experienced higher than expected in-group change in current contracts and BlueCard enrollment. Our Local Group insured enrollment declined by just north of 200,000 lives in the quarter and serves approximately 4 million members as of March 31. In particular, we saw higher-than-expected lapses in plans residing in states that transitioned the 51 to 99 key group size into the small group marketplace. Operating revenue was $20.3 billion in the first quarter of 2016, an increase of $1.5 billion or 7.7% versus the first quarter of 2015, reflecting strong enrollment growth in the Government Business and additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends. Also contributing was the growth in administrative fee revenue as a result of our strong self-funded membership trends. This was partially offset by fully insured membership losses in our Commercial Business. The first quarter 2016 benefit expense ratio was 81.8%, which increased versus prior year as expected. The 160 basis point increase reflected the impact of an extra calendar day during the quarter from the leap year, a higher benefit expense ratio in the Medicaid and Individual businesses as well as a change in our business mix towards the Government Business division, which carried a higher-than-average benefit expense ratio. While we do not include a reserve roll forward payable in our first quarter press release, it is important to note that yearend 2015 reserves have developed moderately better than our expectations so far in 2016. However, we do not believe our first quarter 2016 financial results benefited from that reserve development and we have maintained an appropriate level of conservatism on our balance sheet as of March 31 for the higher-than-expected Individual enrollment. Our SG&A expense ratio came in at 15.8% in the first quarter of 2016, a decrease of 90 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by a continued focus on administrative expense control in light of better-than-expected enrollment trends, as well as the changing mix of our membership towards the Government Business. Supporting the strong quality of earnings in the first quarter, we reported operating cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion or 1.9 times net income. We continue to expect 2016 operating cash flow to be greater than $3 billion. It is important to note that operating cash flow exceeded our expectations in the quarter, which is encouraging. Turning to discuss the first quarter financial performance of our business units let me say that in our Commercial Business, we reported strong membership trends that came in well above our conservative expectations, increasing by 880,000 during the quarter. In particular, we saw strong self-funded membership trends in both our National and Local Group businesses and better-than-expected Individual enrollment on the public exchanges. This contributed to the better-than-expected operating revenue during the quarter, which increased by 1.5% versus the prior year to $9.5 billion. Operating margins were relatively flat compared to the prior quarter at 13.6%, which reflects the impact of a higher benefit expense ratio offset by a lower SG&A expense ratio, as expected. We were diligent with respect to pricing our exchange product offerings for 2016, as this remains a dynamic marketplace. We believe we have taken a conservative posture in the first quarter regarding our expectations for the profitability of this book of business for 2016. We believe we are well positioned for continued growth in exchange lives as this market stabilizes to a more sustainable level over time. Relating to National Accounts, we're pleased that the team has been able to secure some wins recently that should grow membership in both 2016 and 2017. As we said earlier, Local Group membership was down slightly year-over-year, and we continue to see a funding mix shift away from fully insured. We recognize it is vital to offer affordable products with the right network and benefit design in our markets, and our team is focused on improving the historical trends of this book of business. Our Government Business segment had another solid quarter adding 123,000 members and growing year-over-year revenue by 13.9% to $10.8 billion. It is important to note that our results do not yet include an impact from the addition of the Iowa contract aside from startup costs incurred in the quarter ahead of the contract launch where the implementation was delayed from March 1 to April 1. Operating margins for the Government Business in the quarter came in at 3%, a decline of approximately 40 basis points, which was driven by lower gross margins in the Medicaid business. As we communicated previously, we continue to expect Medicaid margins to compress from 2015 levels to a more normalized level, and we are monitoring the performance of this business appropriately. Within Medicare, I'm pleased with the progress the team continues to make as our first quarter margins reflect continued improvement versus last year. We continue to expect margins to improve as the year progresses towards our expected long-term sustainable level, and we have positioned our portfolio to grow enrollment in the right markets with the right products in 2017. The pipeline of opportunity for our Medicaid business remains substantial. We expect $68 billion of new business to be awarded by the end of 2020, split about evenly between traditional Medicaid and new populations in specialized services. We continue to believe our experience and footprint positions us very well to continue our growth as we help states address the challenges of rising healthcare costs and improving quality for their residents. Regarding our balance sheet metrics, our Days in Claims Payable was 43.4 days as of March 31, an increase of 0.7 days from the 42.7 days as of December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the timing of claims payments driven by the new membership that came online during the quarter. As previously discussed, we expect Days in Claims Payable to come back down closer to 40 over time. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 40.2% at March 31, 2016. Down 60 basis points from the 40.8% as of December 31, which reflects the impact of an increase in shareholder equity and the reduction of our outstanding balance in the commercial paper during the quarter. We ended the first quarter with approximately $2.2 billion of cash and investments at the parent company, and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $639 million as of March 31. For the 3Rs related to the 2015 and 2016 benefit years, we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate and continue to reflect a net payable position for risk adjusters and a net neutral position for risk corridors. We continue to record a valuation allowance against the risk corridor receivables in certain markets as we do not believe those receivables will ultimately be collected. We believe our estimates are prudent given the dynamic nature of available information. Turning to our financial outlook, we've increased our operating revenue expectation for 2016 by $1 billion to between $81 and $82 billion. This increase reflects higher projected membership due to the strong enrollment results seen through the first quarter, as we've discussed. Fully insured membership is now expected to be approximately 14.9 million members, at the midpoint of our range at yearend, 250,000 higher than our previous outlook, which reflects stronger than previously expected results in the Individual and Medicaid businesses. Self-funded membership is now expected to be approximately 24.5 million members at the midpoint of our range at yearend, also 250,000 higher than our previous outlook. Taken together, we now project our total membership to be approximately 700,000 to 900,000 lives higher than we ended in 2015. We continue to expect our 2016 medical loss ratio to be 83.6% plus or minus 30 basis points, and now expect our SG&A ratio to be 15.5% plus or minus 30 basis points on a GAAP basis, which includes the impact of Cigna-related transaction cost incurred during the first quarter of 2016. We continue to expect 2016 Local Group medical cost trends to be in the range of 7% to 7.5%. We're encouraged with first quarter operating cash flow, and we continue to project operating cash flows to be greater than $3 billion in 2016. Regarding capital deployment, we raised our dividend during the first quarter by $0.025 per share and declared our second quarter dividend of $0.65 per share. This represents an annualized dividend of $2.60 per share and continues our track record of increasing our dividend every year since it was implemented in 2011. Our 2016 outlook does include some benefit from the impact of capital deployment activities throughout the remainder of the year. While we did not repurchase any shares through the first quarter, we plan to resume our capital deployment program, subject to market conditions, albeit at a lower level than in recent years. To conclude, our 2016 earnings per share outlook is greater than $9.65 on a GAAP basis and our adjusted earnings per share outlook is greater than $10.80. Our outlook continues to take an appropriately conservative posture around the expected financial performance on the public exchanges and the expected year-over-year margin compression in the Medicaid business. Our outlook does not include the adoption of new accounting guidance related to employee share-based payments, which we expect to implement in 2017. For context, we estimate the impact in the first quarter of 2016 would have been a benefit to GAAP and adjusted earnings per share of approximately $0.10. Our outlook does include an adverse impact of $0.03 for the additional assessment in 2016 associated with the State of Colorado dissolution of their co-op. It's also important to note that our 2016 outlook does not include any additional benefits or transaction costs associated with the pending acquisition of Cigna beyond those incurred in the first quarter of 2016. We continue to expect this acquisition will close in the second half of this year. It also does not include any benefit from lower pharmaceutical pricing, which we continue to believe we are entitled to under our current contract with ESI. With that, operator, please open the queue for questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. And the first question will come from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Hi, everybody. I figure I might as well just jump in on the public exchanges and ask you a broad question there, three parts to it, I guess. Obviously, you had good enrollment this open enrollment season. Can you give us any thoughts on what you know so far about the risk profile of those sign-ups and how you feel about that? Second, I know last year, your issue really wasn't in terms of dip in profitability on exchanges an MLR issue, it was rather a G&A issue and you've made some adjustments there. Can you sort of update us on what you did there? And then, finally on the exchanges, the 2017 early outlook in light of some of the commentary from some of the others in the sector? Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Great. A.J., thanks for the question. Good morning. This is Joe. First of all, let me just tell you that we're really pleased overall with how our team has been able to navigate the very challenging landscape that has evolved over the last couple of years. As I stated in my remarks, we're really glad to now be serving 975,000 members across all of our markets, which I think really highlights an incredibly meaningful value proposition to the customers that have chosen to align with us. Over time, we do believe we're well positioned for continued growth in the exchange marketplace if the market stabilizes to a more sustainable level. I think that is a key consideration. Clearly, the performance of the exchange marketplace has lagged expectations throughout the industry, as some of our peers have recognized. And in consideration of that, we are monitoring the market very closely to see that our offerings continue to be, number one, very rational; sustainable for the customers, but also it is built on a platform that is constructed appropriately with respect to the costs that need to drive our presence in that market, again, at a very sustainable and appropriate level. I think it's really critical for me to underscore that we are actively engaged with our government partners to help build that long-term sustainable model that we believe will ultimately create an affordable marketplace. And, in doing so, we believe we can continue to develop kind of a rate structure in the marketplace that's adequate for us and appropriate in terms of affordability for members. And, for example, I think the elimination of the health insurer fee in 2014 sets the stage nicely as we move into that new year with respect to a rate picture. And I think our combination with Cigna is going to present a meaningful improvement in affordability for our membership. So I think put all that together, we're very kind of pleased with how we performed this year. We think we're engaged in a fairly sustainable platform that has potential for continued growth, again, underscore, as long as the model that we are engaged in in the marketplace is a sustainable model. Let me close my remarks in that regard by saying that I think there's some really key drivers to building that sustainable affordable marketplace that I mentioned. Some of the key elements include what has already been put in place for 2017, which is the health insurer tax adjustment. And the second thing would be I think a careful consideration of updating the risk adjustment model, further consideration of special enrollment period adjustments, and that would narrow the variety and number of special enrollment considerations. And we'd like to be able to begin offering some very innovative product designs to the marketplace and hopefully our government partners will be receptive to some of those creative and innovative models. And, finally, I'd like to underscore a modification of the grace period for nonpayment of premiums to prevent abuse. So when you put all that together in a mosaic, I think maybe a sustainable model can be built and we will continue to perform in the marketplace in a way that continues to maybe try to achieve the membership that we had originally anticipated back when this effort first began in 2014. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Wayne, you may want to speak to the MLR question that A.J. put to us. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So, A.J., as Joe addressed at least our views on 2017 and beyond, in terms of the membership we received, I would say we have a slightly higher silver mix, which we think is generally a positive regarding how we price our book and our product. The age distribution and subsidy eligible mix is consistent with those expectations. But I would tell you that we've chosen to maintain a conservative posture in Q1 until we see ultimately how this develops. So we've maintained a conservative posture on risk adjusters despite Wakely data that would imply that we should be booking more. And we are really not booking to the normal seasonality profitability you would see in this book in a Q1 because, again, I think from our perspective, we'd like to see this membership at least get through 2Q to really understand how the book is performing. So, from that perspective, we think it's the prudent thing to do. And then as 2Q evolves, we'll give more commentary on how it's actually developing. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then just maybe on that part just expanding, I know you talked about pulling back on your marketing and trimming your G&A directly related to the exchanges, you've had better than expected enrollment growth. Did you still pull in on those expense items on the G&A side? Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, we did. I mean, I think the lesson learned last year 2015 was that we needed to really true up a very nice platform that was appropriately built for the type of market we were dealing with. And, quite frankly, I think we really built a very stabilized platform that helped us move into 2016 to capture this uptake in membership based on a cost structure that I think was very appropriately built out for the marketplace. And so, quite frankly, our G&A structure I think is well under control. It's appropriately sized and well configured for us to continue grow in this space as appropriate. Operator : And our next question will come from Tom Carroll with Stifel. Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Just a quick follow-up on the exchange business. Are you seeing any signs of adverse selection at all and maybe could you remind us of kind of the items that you're looking for within that book of business? And then secondly, I would like you to chat a little bit about the Medicaid business. Anthem had a great 2015 and you indicated that the Medicaid MLR was likely going to be up and was up during the first quarter. Was it aligned with your expectations, higher, lower from what you expected? And I wondered if you could comment also on the Medicaid managed care regs that were out on Monday? Thanks. Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Got it. Maybe I can pick back up where I left off regarding A.J.'s question on risk profile, which I think relates back to your question on what are we seeing in terms of membership capture. It's a little early. I think we're going to continue to dig into the risk profile that we have brought on. And our sense is that probably somewhere in the 2Q range we're going to be able to get line of sight on risk profile and have more to report to you at the end of 2Q. So it's a little early for us to give you kind of a line of sight on risk profile. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Tom, a couple of other items. I think, as Joe said, we like what we're seeing in early mix. But ultimately, as this business comes on, we'll see how it really develops in Q2. As you know, a lot of the claims activity always has a little bit of a lag when an individual switches to a new carrier and then ultimately that reporting timeline that occurs with the providers ultimately to us. So I think in 2Q we'll get a much better feel. What we want you to be aware of is, one, we're not seeing any early indicators across our broader book on trend or anything that would have us change our overall trend assumptions. Two is, we've maintained a conservative posture going into 2Q around the risk-adjusted data, not only for what we believe 2015 would true up to be, but what we think the impact would be on 2016 in light of this mix. That's not based on just our assumptions but actually using the updated Wakely data we receive as well as some recent CMS data. But as you know, ultimate settlement on those will be very dependent upon who owes the risk adjuster and how that will settle out. So we're going to wait and see how that pans out in 2Q. But I would say on each of these 3Rs, we've maintained a posture that should give us some contingency if the book doesn't develop as we would have expected. And if it does develop as we would expect, then it would give us some upside going into the second half of this year and into Q2. On the Medicaid front, again, no real surprise. Just a reminder that we had a lot of new markets that we're rolling out. We continue to have that book evolve. As you know, Iowa now starts on April 1 as well. So we would expect to see MLR pressure there in 2Q as well, but consistent with our expectations of new markets that are rolling out and continue to be bullish on the Medicaid top line as well as bottom line. And as we mentioned previously, we're going to be slow landing those margins down to what we think are more sustainable. And then on the Medicaid regs, no real surprises. We were fine with the new regs that came out. Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning. First question, just on the 975,000 exchange lives, could you help us break down how many of those are new to Anthem versus existing previously managed lives last year? And then any sense of how many of the new ones came from other plans versus sort of new to the market? And then the follow-up would just be on the MLR, up 160 bps in the first-quarter but guidance up 30 bps for the year. I understand the leap year, but what are some of the deltas, what changes as we sort of progress through the year that would make those year-over-year comparisons look much better? Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, let me take a shot at the first question. We just don't know yet, quite frankly, in terms of what carryover membership is brought over from 2015. Obviously, we're going to learn more about that getting into 2Q. So it's a rather simple answer to the question. I wish I had more to give you, but we just don't know this early. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Josh, a couple other items we would highlight, though, is that generally where we've seen what I would call the unexpected uptake, though, has been markets where the co-ops have become insolvent. So I don't think there's a surprise there. I think where we're probably surprised on the uptake, though, has been that we weren't the next lowest cost carrier. And in many cases, we were substantially higher than the next or several next lowest cost carriers. So there appears to be a little bit of a flight to safety, if you will, and security. And so, again, it's another reason why we want to see how this ultimately pans out. Our pricing is obviously much higher than what would have been available in the market. And so the question will be does that adequately reflect the book that we're inheriting over from the co-ops on that? And frankly, given how 2015 played out, we want to take a more conservative posture earlier this year and see how that develops. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. And you don't know which lives were Anthem members previously and still signed up? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, you ultimately get the data, but I would say that you also have to look at it \u2013 we don't look at it as a single member by state. We look at the broad mix of both on and off exchange membership. And so while we have a feel for some of that, at the same time, I would tell you that the majority of the new membership growth that we're seeing is obviously new to us, and it's coming from other organizations. And clearly, it's in the co-op states. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So do you have like a net sales versus a net lapses number or anything like that, even if you don't know if they're the same? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We do, Josh, but we're obviously not going to disclose that data. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then the MLR year-over-year? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Ultimately, we show that \u2013 we had the impact of the leap year in the year. The thing to keep in mind, though, is the premium, as you know, just inherently the leap year alone, that the premium is spread over the entire year, but you're getting a full day of claims within the quarter. So clearly, there's a positive effect that happens in the out-years as the leap year continues. That's one dynamic. I think another dynamic to keep in mind is that when we look at our mix shift and how that's evolving, we actually didn't do the typical seasonality that you would see for Individuals. So we've tried to book a little more of an MLR factor in the first quarter. That typically would have been lower and then you'd have a higher in the fourth quarter. In this case, because of the new membership, we're doing a little more. I wouldn't call it straight-line, but we're trying to get much more of an upfront view and a conservative posture, as that develops. Again, I would basically put it that we're seeing how 2015 played out. We're just trying to take a much more conservative posture earlier in the year and then let that hopefully blend its way down as the year progresses. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : And our next question will come from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up a little bit and I think, Wayne, your last response kind of gets into my question a little bit, so I'll be brief. But, I guess, I'm trying to understand where the Individual enrollment came. You mentioned a few of the states where the co-ops were insolvent. I was wondering if there was any more detail you could provide than that, particularly whether some of this enrollment would be in states like California, New York where I think your experience was better last year? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Gary, it is. New York is, obviously, clearly one of the markets where the co-ops struggled. And we did pick up, I would say, more than our market share that we typically have relative to the co-ops. California is another market where we did perform well. And in addition, it would be in Colorado and Kentucky, other markets where the co-ops had their difficulties, and I would say we've picked up more than our market share. So the membership available with their exits we're disproportionately picking up market share. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And as a quick follow, I guess, I'm having a little difficulty seeing the degree of conservatism maybe that you're talking about in the book given that's versus the original expectation of Individual being down 300,000, you're now up 200,000, Days in Claims Payable down a couple of days year-over-year, the Commercial operating margin was up 10 basis points even though you booked some additional MLR in the Individual business. Is the response to that just that this Individual seasonality is so skewed to the front end versus the fourth quarter that you still have some modest margin gain year-over-year even though you are booking this additional MLR in the Individual book? Is that maybe just the range of seasonality maybe I'm just not appreciating enough? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, Gary. Yes, that's one dynamic. The second one is, sequentially DCP is actually up since year-end, and as we said year-end did develop favorable to our expectation. So I want to emphasize that it developed favorable and DCP is up sequentially. Two is, I think it's important to recognize that on the 3Rs the data would imply that we have been conservative on 2015, and so we've neither recognized that conservatism yet. And in addition to that, it would also imply then a run rate that we would have available to us in 2016 based on that data. And again, we've not recognized that as well, and it's important to recognize that the 3Rs are not part of DCP, so you won't necessarily get to see that added conservatism that we are carrying into Q2 as we move forward. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Will you ever disclose 3Rs? Will we ever get that from you? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Most likely not. But I will tell you that in 2Q we will give you a gauge, though, of how it maybe benefited us more broadly in terms of the pieces. I think the thing I want to highlight for the group, though, is the reason we are being cautious on 3Rs, and in particular risk-adjusters, which would imply that we would have a nice receivable related to 2015 as well as some run rate into 2016 is, the question is similar to the risk corridor, who ultimately is going to pay that? And if the receivables due from a co-op, ultimately we don't want to recognize that unless we know the co-ops have the financial wherewithal to pay those receivables. And so this is just one of many factors that we believe warrants being conservative until we see final settlements and then how those dollars are actually transferred between companies. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I'll move away from the Individual exchanges for a minute and take you to the PBM and the contract dispute with Express. Can you talk, not about what you are going to do but how would you bring it in-house specifically if that was the direction this ends up? Give us an idea of sort of the timeframe it would take from when you have to start planning it as well as what sort of options would you use in terms of perhaps using some of the other PBMs or even Express by buying NextRx back or something like that to actually manage it given that you don't have the assets anymore to run a PBM? Can you talk about that a little bit and specifically how that would work if you were to try to bring it in-house? Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Peter, interesting question. I think it strikes at one of our various options. Just kind of to help p us all recall where we started this journey, we talked a lot about optionality and recognize that we had some choices ahead of us, one bring it in-house, as you've just described, another would be to recast our agreement with ESI, another would be to go to another vendor, et cetera. So we are considering a full range of options. I think first I need to preface my remarks by underscoring that we've got probably couple of years at minimum before we need to make that call. And, quite frankly, these considerations were actively involved in sort of the various pluses and minuses of each option. So it's really too early for us to comment on specificity. And I think that to your point about bringing it in-house and recognize it's a complex process to do so. It does have costs associated with it, we recognize that. But again, let me underscore, it's not a decision that is imminent. We have \u2013 call it a journey that we have to administer with respect to our ongoing negotiations with ESI regarding our position that we stated to them clearly and now it's taken the form of a lawsuit. So I direct you to that with respect to specificity around our engagement with them at this stage. But optionality, again, I want to underscore, we are in the development mode on our choices, but none of those choices do we have to exercise in any way of an imminent nature, and so I'd prefer just to kind of maybe delay a response to some future date when that is more of an imminent necessity for us to deal with. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Can you talk about sort of the expected savings if you were to bring it in-house? What would that look like relative to the $3 billion that you are seeking from Express on a contract renegotiation? Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. As I said, I think certainly a lot of analytics will go into discerning savings. We haven't actually gone into the depths of administratively how you'd build it and the costs associated with building it that then translates to savings. Again, let me restate emphatically that it's too early for us to weigh in on that. And at some future moment in time where it is appropriate, we'll certainly bring that to your attention. It's just too early now to give you clear line of sight on savings or an option of that nature. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to go back to Medicaid. The first part of the question would be, was the higher MLR in Medicaid a function of just the lower rates that you have anticipated or were there other factors like flu perhaps or population mix acuity of the mix or even rising trend in Medicaid that impacted MLR there? And then second part would be, as we look to the second quarter and the start of Iowa, some of your peers, at least one, I think had established reserves in 2015 in anticipation of pretty significant pressure from Iowa. How should we think about the progression of Medicaid margin into 2Q and the rest of year for Iowa? Thanks. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Dave, good morning. Let me first start with Medicaid. Yes, a significant portion of what you saw in the MLR is a function of what we've been talking around the rate pressure and those rates coming down. I think our outlook for the year from the Medicaid team continues to be consistent with the outlook that we gave when we gave guidance initially and we expect to be at our MLR in trends planning within the levels that we have fully expected within the book. So, no real surprises there. Relative to Iowa, as you know, we did not book a PDR. We typically expect to have a higher MLR and to lose money early on when a program is rolled out. And then ultimately the PDR requires you to look over the life of the contract. And we clearly expect to be a profitability over the life of the contract, which is why we don't have a PDR booked on it. But because the contract was delayed, obviously the MLR will reflect that 9 months of activity instead of 10 months, which means that your MLR will be a little bit pressured in the current year but only by an additional month. The fact that it was delayed by a month will create a little bit of pressure this year, but obviously we expect that to come down next year. But while we weren't necessarily pleased with membership being delayed and the revenue impact, we actually think that additional month probably played well for the industry in terms of getting its contracts finalized and its networks finalized in a manner that hopefully can make this a very strong profitable book, consistent with our historical margins. So we remain optimistic on the program. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Very good. Thanks for that. Operator : And our next question will come from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. Just wanted to dig into guidance a little bit. You beat consensus expectations for Q1 pretty nicely, particularly on the G&A side, but you didn't raise guidance for the year. In fact, you took your G&A number up and kept your MLR stable even though you seem to be talking about pressure on the MLR on the Individual side at least from a mix perspective. Can you talk a little bit about why the puts and takes ended up the way that they were and why we didn't see upward pressure on MLR and downward pressure on G&A? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Let me address a few things. One is, I want to highlight again that if we look purely at Q1 and the results, it would have implied that we should have had a raise, which I think is a very valid question that you're asking. I can't emphasize enough that we are very pleased with all the metrics in Q1, but with those metrics we really thought it was best to maintain a lot of conservatism that we could have otherwise potentially released in Q1 until we see how this book evolves into Q2. I think it's fair to say that the industry last year, and ourselves included, got to see a lot more of how things developed as last year progressed. So we're just taking a much more conservative posture until we see more development. The second thing I would highlight again is we did highlight that we are covering another $0.03 of assessments from Co-ops and maintaining that guidance as well. And then the last thing I would say is that in terms of the metrics, we like our G&A where it's at. And we think with this additional membership, this is the G&A leverage we should have gotten a year ago with exchanges. As you know, it was deleverage impact to us a year ago. This year it's going to be a leverageable impact. And so, we're holding the line on G&A. And, again, if the membership plays out with the risk profile we would expect then that G&A leverage helps to improve the margins. If it doesn't then the G&A leverage helps to offset any surprises. So I'd love to give you a different answer but, I mean, the reality is we just chose to be conservative in Q1 until we can see how this book of business evolves. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then, as you mentioned on the Small Group business that you saw some pressure particularly in the states that expanded the 51 to 100, what percent of your Small Group business is in those states? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. It's actually a decent amount and I would say it was primarily in California. As you know, California was one of those states that made the decision as did New York and Colorado. So, if you're looking at, what I would call your typical market that would be the most significant for us it's California of that group. And as a result, not only did your historical Small Group products no longer be allowed to persist but you actually had to reintroduce all new products and reconsider the product mix of what it would look like if they went to different thresholds for what was defined as Small Group. So we're not happy about the membership we lost in those markets but we also recognize that not every state adopted the flexibility that was offered them under the Affordable Care Act. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Do you think that that's the more states are going to end up doing that, it is a headwind we'd expect to see next year in more states or if you were going to do it you would have done it by now? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I think if you were going to do it, you would've done it by now. The other states have actually gone and maintained the historical Small Group definition. So I think that's behind us now. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thanks. Operator : And our next question will come from Ralph Giacobbe with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning. I just want to go back to the exchanges. I guess, last quarter, you had mentioned that the exchange book was breakeven for 2015. And as you've talked about it, you expected to pull G&A and bring it back to sort of profitable levels. Obviously, you've done better on the enrollment side. So, I guess, you've talked about your conservatism. Can you help us in terms of what margins are assumed at this point for the exchange or maybe what's embedded in guidance for 2016? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi, Ralph. Yeah, in essence, I will tell you, as we said before, our targeted margin is a 3% to 5%. When we built our plan for this year, we were targeting lower than that threshold. We have not adjusted that targeted margin. So, my point is that to the extent this membership does have the risk profile we have, you should expect a better margin as a result of the G&A leverage play and to the extent that those 3Rs, in fact, not only settle up as we've been notified to date between Wakely and CMS but actually cash flowed as well between the parties that have to settle up then you could expect margin expansion as well. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. So, I guess, I just want to go back to the disconnect to the lack of guidance raise. If the assumption is to make still, let's call it, 1% to 2% margin or whatever that number is, on the exchange on a bigger book, may be to help level set, can you give a sense at all what you booked for 1Q in terms of sort of a comparable margin on the exchange? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : As you know, historically when you have an individual member you're very profitable in Q1 and that profitability then declines down to ultimately a loss in Q4. What I would say is that from our perspective, we've chosen not to take that profitability in in Q1 but rather book to a breakeven perspective and then see how this book evolves in Q2 and thereafter. So to the extent that it evolves positively then you'll get the margin improvement both from Q1 as well as in the run rate for the year. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then I think it was asked earlier but I don't think we got to sort of the answer around how you're positioning for 2017. Are there new states or territory that you're going to want to enter? And maybe a sense, I know it's early at this point but when we think about target margins you talked about 3% to 5%, is 2017 sort of an area where you expect to get there, get closer to there. Any just general commentary around that would be helpful. Thanks. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We are not targeting on a standalone basis any new markets outside of our 14 states. I think our goal is to continue to stabilize the market in those states and start trending towards our targeted 3% to 5% margin. I would not anticipate at this point in time that in 2017 we would necessarily achieve that level of margin but nonetheless there's been a lot of activity around the regulations and ways to improve and create more stability, so we'll see. And to be fair, it's a little bit early in the pricing cycle so we ultimately need to see how pricing evolves and what the states ultimately approved in the pricing cycle on whether or not we can get there as early as 2017. But right now, I'd be more cautious on getting there in 2017 and view it more as a 2018 play. Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think the question is interesting the way you put it about expanding to other states. I mean, obviously, I'm going to be blunt, we precluded, Blue Cross Blue Shield presence in our 14 states and I really think we should underscore the value we bring to our markets is our brand legacy, incredibly well known with respect to quality as well as affordability. And to Wayne's earlier point, we have witnessed, we really do believe this flight to safety is real and I think flight to safety is very relevant with respect to how folks are connecting back to us in terms of a known brand. I think we're going to really seek to leverage that more effectively in every market that we're serving. And the last point I'll make I think is very important to underscore is that Cigna will help us with future expansion beyond our 14 states, so that's a story that's not yet told. And when it becomes clear that we can, we will express ourselves probably in more depth in terms of the potential to expand to other markets relative to the public exchanges. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. Thanks. Helpful. Operator : And our next question will come from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hi. Good morning, guys. Apologize if I missed this, but did you guys say what you're now assuming for the reinsurance, co-insurance rate? I know at 4Q, you said a little above 50%. There's some data from CMS which suggests it could be more like 60% to 65%. Just want to get a sense for what you're assuming now and whether that's had an impact on guidance? Thanks. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Chris. Thanks for the question. So we continue to assume a little north of 50%. I would tell you that if the CMS data of 60% to 65% goes forward, we will have sizable upside relative to those percentages. We're not so sure it will evolve ultimately to that level. But based on the most recent data that's been submitted, as well as the Wakely data we received on this, we are at a number below what the data would imply is what I would say, and should have some conservatism going into 2Q and beyond. But again, we want to see ultimate settlement. As a reminder, on risk corridors, we continue to maintain 100% valuation allowance against any receivables. And I would tell you the more sizable upside ultimately will be on the risk adjusters if what we've seen in early data related to 2015 and 2016 is in fact holds truth into 2Q, and again, if it in fact gets monetized by the parties that owe it. So, I would say all three areas represent potential upside. The corridor being the least, though, because we just don't see the money in the kitty to fund those. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : And we'll go to the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. Good morning. I was hoping that you could give us your assessment on the Group Commercial side. The decline of, I think, it was 245,000 lives in the quarter was in line with what you guided to. I know you referred to some states where they expanded the definition of Small Group and that was a factor. I assume that there's some ASO conversions. Does some of that also reflect a conservative pricing posture? I mean, I know you always try to be conservative but have you needed to be more conservative in the current pricing environment? If you could just talk to that. Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi, Matt. Yeah, let me first start by saying, well, it has some conversions from fully insured to ASO. And I think clearly, you can see that in how strong our ASO book has gone and not just in National but in the Large Group business as well. I think it's fair to say that at least half of it though represents those markets that did the switch, with the majority of that being in California. And I would say we've maintained our pricing discipline in California. And it seems that most of that membership went to a single carrier, primarily a not-for-profit carrier that we think priced fairly aggressively. And again, from our perspective, we'll weather that storm as we have in the past and hopefully win those members back in the next year or so. But that I'd say it's about 50/50 split. And then of the 50% that's really left, it's primarily California. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. That's very helpful. And also, if I could ask, what is approximately the amount by which you need to increase price going into 2017 to reflect the lack of reinsurance? And how much of a problem is that going to be for exacerbating some adverse selection that's already a program-wide problem to some degree in the exchanges? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You know, Matt, while we generally haven't given all the specifics in pricing, I think, the reinsurance is one mathematically people can generally back into a range in the 5% to 6% range of what it could impact on upward pricing by itself. And so, I would say that that 5% to 6% range that we've had others ask about is a reasonable proxy of what you should expect for the piece of reinsurance that would run off. Relative to all other pricing, we're not necessarily talking to specifics. We're just in the process now of filing with our states. But this is clearly one area we're spending time making sure everybody is educated on. And I would tell you insurance regulators understand it. They get it. And they understand the implications of it. And so, for competitive reasons, I would like to probably not discuss any further though our rate filings or actions at this point. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go to the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yes, thanks. Good morning. Again, following up on the Commercial book but now taking a view into 2017, you had a 2% gain in your Commercial Businesses. I know it's a mishmash of various things, but as you are looking into 2017... Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Ana, can you start your question over? We're having trouble hearing you. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : I was asking about the trend. Is this better? Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I'm sorry. You are cutting in and out. It's very difficult to hear you. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Better now? Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : A little bit, yes. Please try again. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Okay. I was asking about the 2017 Commercial outlook and whether or not, as you look into 2017, we're likely to see a better operating gain growth rate because the not-for-profit Blues, Aetna, everywhere they're all losing money on exchanges. And I know you don't overlap directly with the Blues, but as you think about Cigna and the post-Cigna world, if the pricing and underwriting spread will get better into 2017? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I would say, while we haven't given 2017 outlook yet and as you can imagine, I would first want to see how 2016 develops. But what I would highlight is that we would expect to see the margins begin to trend to the more sustainable levels of 3% to 5%. I don't think, again, we'll be there by 2017. But ultimately it seems that the environment is starting to recognize the true cost of operating the exchanges and the membership that resides with it. These are large risk pools. So, I think the industry is getting to the point where they have enough data to support the pricing that belongs with it, and we think our job now is to continue to educate our regulators on the risk profile of the pools, actions we can take to help drive the cost down for affordability, and at the same time, though, to the extent that we are limited on actions, to make sure people understand the pricing that goes with it. So I think for 2017, today, as best we would say, it would be our expectation that margins would improve and pricing would continue to improve. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Are you talking about exchanges or Commercial? I was talking about the Group business and the spread between trend and pricing. More, sort of, is it likely to be a silver lining on the cloud just because other companies are losing money on exchanges so they become more conservative on the Commercial pricing? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's hard to know what others may do in their pricing. Clearly, in California, we did not see a player who we know lost money on exchanges necessarily take a more rationale pricing on their Small Group book. So, I guess, what I would say is when you see in one market and then one competitor you see in one market and one competitor, so it's hard for us to understand. I think I would say this is \u2013 our philosophy is we've got to cover cost of capital. We've got to give our shareholders a fair return for the risk that we bear and we price accordingly and then we'll just have to weather the markets whatever they bring in the short term as we did on the public exchanges, the last couple of years. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : And then, finally, on the 51 to 100, once you get past that headwind, is there a reduced tendency towards dumping from employers because exchanges haven't been as stable and there's a lot of volatility there? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We think there is. It seems like the dumping factor has really moved down and I think this was kind of the last clarification of product description and size under ACA that had to be implemented. So I think from our perspective, we view it as kind of stability and, I would say, internally, we are targeting actually trying to get back to Small Group growth again now. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks for the color. I appreciate it. Operator : and we'll go to the last question. It will come from Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. I just had a question on cost trends overall. I'm just interested within the guidance range that you talked about, how trend may be behaving within that range in the first quarter. United had talked about seeing a bit of an uplift in cost trend in the first quarter, maybe around 50 basis points. And then, also just specifically whether you have been seeing an increase in surgical volumes year-over-year in the first quarter relative to last year? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Scott, thanks for the question. First of all, it's important to recognize that we had assumed that trends would move up this year, as you know, what we finished last year versus what we guided to this year. So trends have moved up but within our expectations and our pricing. As we look at various factors I think we would've said early on that trend might've been favorably impacted by the flu, but the fact that the late season happened, ultimately we think for the full year that that won't have a positive upside to us nor downside. We think flu is going to play probably within our expectations. We did expect a fairly sizable uptick in trend in Q1 regarding Hep C and we saw that, which is good. And the good news is, at least on our rolling three-month average that we've looked at, it seems to be playing right in line with our expectation, slightly better than our expectations. But I would tell you that we are not going to bank that yet because we think there may be some warehousing because there is new genotype drugs that are coming out that people may be holding off on until those are available. So, I think, ultimately when I look at what could be the big surprise items, like a Hep C or a flu or other item, everything seems to be playing pretty well relative to our expectations and while we did expect it to be high in the quarter, it was but within our pricing. Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Scott, this is Joe. I think probably it's fair to also comment on a lot of what you can't see regarding the internal activity of the company where we're obviously vigilant regarding trend changes. Internally we're building really robust provider collaboration models really driven toward value-based contracting that then tries to ameliorate the risk of trend escalation. Our data analytics infrastructure has been a remarkable uplift to the company with respect to our investments and the resultant insights that we've captured in order to better manage the cost of care. So there is kind of the macro level that you see, but the micro level within the company, it's amazing how well we've positioned ourselves to really address the kind of prevailing winds that come at us in and around trend changes. Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. And then just on the surgical vols, are you able to tease out whether what you saw year-over-year there, or is it still a little bit too early to tell? Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's a little early. I mean, we obviously look for different areas that might spike. I mean, we see little bit more there, but again relative to expectations, I think, things are playing okay. So nothing of any specificity that I can provide at this point. Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Great. Let me just kind of express the thanks to all of you for your questions. In summary, I'm pleased with our first quarter results and believe that these results position us very well for the remainder of the year. Hopefully, you got a sense of that with respect to our commentaries today. We do remain committed to increasing access to high-quality affordable healthcare. Specifically, we believe our ability to serve our customers will be advanced by the pending acquisition of Cigna, which we still remain of the belief that it is expected to close in the second half of 2016. And also, this concludes our continued focus on improving matters like drug pricing. I also want to thank all of our associates for their continued commitment to serving our nearly 40 million members. And I'd like to also again thank all of you on the call for your interest in Anthem and look forward to speaking with you soon. Again, thank you very much. Have a great day.

We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Joe. Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Doug, and good morning. This morning, we announced second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $3.33, with membership and revenue tracking above our previous expectations. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.91. Before John and I discuss the details of our second quarter financials and our updated 2016 outlook, I think it's appropriate to discuss our perspective on the latest Cigna developments. I'll start by saying, we are disappointed by the U.S. Department of Justice's decision to block Anthem's acquisition of Cigna. A combination specifically designed to tackle our healthcare systems challenges head on and deliver greater value to consumers by expanding access to high quality, affordable healthcare. To be clear, our board and executive leadership team at Anthem is fully committed to challenging the DOJ's decision in Court. As you may have read in Tuesday's published Op-Ed, the DOJ has disregarded the issue of access for two of the most unstable and at high risk health insurance markets; individuals and small businesses. These populations comprise a meaningful portion of the still more than 33 million uninsured Americans who will benefit from the Cigna acquisition through expanded and improved access, affordability, and quality. For example, despite the many and continuing challenges of the health insurance exchanges, Anthem entered into this new and high risk market at its inception. Though several of our competitors have exited this business, we now serve 923,000 public exchange members across 14 states where we do business as Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan. As shared with the DOJ, our acquisition of Cigna will help stabilize pricing in this volatile market, enabling Anthem to continue its commitment to the public exchanges, and provide the opportunity to expand our participation to 9 additional states, where neither Anthem nor Cigna currently participate. Additionally, we estimate this acquisition will significantly lower cost for our self-funded consumers with over $2 billion in medical cost savings that we passed directly back to them. Finally, we also note this acquisition will benefit our shareholders and the pension, retirement, and investment funds they represent. Specifically, 99% of our shareholders voted in favor of this transaction. Now to discuss the consolidated financials we reported this morning. Our second quarter adjusted EPS of $3.33 was slightly ahead of our expectations, albeit with mixed financial metrics to get us there. Within membership, both fully insured and self-funded membership are tracking ahead of expectations as we ended the second quarter with nearly 39.8 million members. This reflects growth of an additional 148,000 lives during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date enrollment growth to 1.2 million lives, or 3%. Specifically, our insured membership increased by 170,000 lives as our Medicaid business grew by a better than expected 280,000 lives in the quarter to over 6.3 million members. This reflected better than expected enrollment growth from the implementation of the Iowa State contract, which started on April 1, as well as better than expected core membership growth within multiple other state contracts. Within Commercial, our insured enrollment came in line with expectations. We ended the quarter with 923,000 lives from the individual public exchanges, a decrease of 52,000 lives from the 975,000 lives we reported in the first quarter and Local Group insured business declined modestly and in line with our most recent expectations. Our self-funded business was relatively stable during the quarter, which was better than our previous expectations as we experienced higher-than-expected growth in membership in existing accounts. Our membership results translated into better-than-expected operating revenue of $21.3 billion. Our second quarter 2016 results represent an increase of $1.5 billion or 7.7% versus the second quarter of 2015, reflecting strong enrollment growth in the Government Business and additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends. Also contributing was the growth in administrative fee revenue as a result of our strong self-funded membership trends. This was partially offset by fully insured membership losses in our Commercial business. The second quarter 2016 benefit expense ratio was 84.2%, which increased by 210 basis points versus the prior year. The year-over-year increase was partially driven by a higher benefit expense ratio in the Medicaid business, as our medical cost experience exceeded the net impact of annual premium rate adjustments and the impact of growth in membership, which the Medicaid business carries a higher benefit expense ratio than the consolidated company average. Further, the benefit expense ratio reflects the impact of higher medical cost experienced in the Individual business and the timing of higher medical cost experienced in the Local Group business. The increase was partially offset by adjustments to the prior and current-year risk adjustment estimates in our ACA compliant Individual and Small Group products. Our SG&A expense ratio came in at a better-than-previously expected 14% in the second quarter of 2016, a decrease of 140 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by an intentional focus on administrative expense control coupled with better-than-expected enrollment trends as well as the changing mix of our membership towards the Government Business, which carries a lower than consolidated average SG&A ratio. We reported operating cash flow of approximately $2 billion, or 1.3 times net income during the first six months of 2016. During the quarter, we reported operating cash flow of $662 million, or 0.8 times net income. As a reminder, we did make our first and second quarter income tax payments during the second quarter, consistent with prior years. I'll now turn the call over to our new Chief Financial Officer, John Gallina, to discuss our business segment's quarterly results and our updated 2016 outlook in more detail. John? John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Joe, and good morning. Turning to discuss the second quarter financial performance of our business units. We added 290,000 members in our Government Business during the quarter and grew year-over-year revenue by 9.5% to $11.4 billion. These results now include the impact from the addition of the Iowa contract, which was implemented on April 1. Operating margin for the Government Business in the quarter came in at 4%, a decline of 190 basis points versus the prior year quarter, which was driven by lower gross margins in the Medicaid business. As we communicated previously, we have been expecting Medicaid margins to compress from 2015 levels to a more normalized level, and we are monitoring the rate environment for the remainder of the year. During the quarter, we also experienced higher than expected claims across Medicaid businesses, with the most notable market being the newly implemented Iowa contract. It is important to note that it is not uncommon to have early challenges in a new market, and our team has a long track record of successfully identifying and implementing revenue and cost of care initiatives to help mitigate issues. We will continue to work collaboratively with our state partner to ensure program stability and high quality care for Iowa's most vulnerable citizens. Within Medicare, we are pleased with the progress the team continues to make and our year-to-date margins continue to reflect improvement versus last year. Our outlook continues to expect margins to improve as the year progresses towards our expected long-term sustainable levels, and we have positioned our portfolio to grow enrollment in 2017. The pipeline of opportunity for our Medicaid businesses remains substantial, with an estimated $78 billion in contracts to be awarded between now and 2021 in markets that we will consider targeting. A little more than three-fourths of this opportunity is in new and specialized services, with the remainder in traditional Medicaid services. We continue to believe our experience and footprint positions us very well to continue our growth, as we help states address the challenges of rising healthcare costs and improving quality for their residents. Switching to our Commercial business, our enrollment decreased by 142,000 lives during the quarter, which was slightly better than our previous expectations. Specifically, we experienced second quarter declines of 86,000 lives and 51,000 lives in our Individual and National businesses, respectively. The better-than-expected enrollment results contributed to a higher-than-expected operating revenue during the quarter, which increased by 5.7% versus the prior year quarter to $9.9 billion. Our second quarter operating margin of 10.9% was 120 basis points higher than the 9.7% we reported in the second quarter of 2015. The increase was driven by adjustments to the prior and current year risk adjustment estimates recorded during the quarter, a lower SG&A ratio due to lower administrative cost resulting from expense efficiency initiatives and growth in self-funded enrollment, which carries a higher than average operating margin. This increase was partially offset by higher medical cost experienced in Individual ACA compliant products and the timing of medical cost experienced in our Local Group business. Within our Individual ACA compliant population, we had previously taken a conservative stance on our balance sheet with respect to various different estimates. This conservatism was very prudent, as our current period claims trends have been higher than expected. We have seen higher than expected costs from membership with chronic conditions such as renal (13:32) disease, COPD, heart disease and diabetes, along with signs of pent-up demand among our new members. We have experienced higher-than-expected payments for dialysis treatments during the first half of the year, which we are in the process of reviewing the drivers of this increase. All-in, our updated outlook now expects the Individual ACA compliant business to incur mid-single digit operating margin losses for the 2016 benefit year. It is important to note that we have assumed the higher-than-expected claims rate experienced thus far in the year will continue for the remainder of 2016 in developing our 2017 pricing assumptions. To be clear, we believe our pricing for 2017 fully incorporates our current expectations for 2016 claims and we are focused on returning to profitability in 2017. Relating to National Accounts, we continue to be pleased that the team continues to secure wins contributing to the track record of membership growth in 2017. Regarding our balance sheet metrics, consistent with our past practice, we have included a roll-forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we experienced favorable prior-year reserve development of $726 million, which was moderately better than our expectations. We continue to be at the upper end of our range of mid- to high-single digit margins for average deviation and believe our reserve balance remains consistent and strong as of June 30, 2016. Our Days in Claims Payable was 40.6 days as of June 30, a decrease of 2.8 days from the 43.4 days as of March 31. The decrease is in-line with our expectations and consistent with the level of decrease seen between the first and second quarter of 2015. As previously discussed, we expect Days in Claims Payable to come back down closer to 40 days over time. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 39.1% at June 30, 2016, down 110 basis points from the 40.2% at the end of the first quarter, which reflects the impact of an increase in shareholder equity and the reduction in our outstanding balance in commercial paper during the quarter. We ended the first quarter with approximately $2.1 billion of cash and investments at the parent company, and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $958 million as of June 30. For the three Rs, we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate, and we continue to establish a 100% valuation allowance against any unpaid receivables for the 2014, 2015 and 2016 benefit years for risk corridors. For risk adjusters, the recent information from CMS shows us in a net receivable position, primarily in our Small Group markets. We have recorded a valuation allowance against certain risk adjusted receivables in some of our markets based on our assessment of the financial solvency of co-op organizations that are payers into the risk adjuster program due to the belief that those receivables may ultimately not be collected. As we have said in recent months and in the results we reported this morning, our operating metrics are expected to be different than we previously expected during the last earnings call. That said, we are reaffirming our adjusted earnings guidance and expect full year 2016 adjusted EPS to be greater than $10.80, excluding greater than $1.46 of negative adjustment items. On a GAAP basis, our 2016 earnings per share outlook is greater than $9.34. We are raising our operating revenue outlook by $1.5 billion to a range of $82.5 billion to $83.5 billion, reflecting stronger-than-expected enrollment across our businesses, including the contributions from Medicaid as well as the impact of adjustments to both prior and current year risk adjustment estimates. Fully insured membership is now expected to be approximately 15 million members at the midpoint of our range, 100,000 higher than our previous outlook, which reflects stronger than previously expected results in the Medicaid business. Self-funded membership is now expected to be 24.7 million members at the midpoint of our range, approximately 200,000 members higher than our previous outlook. Taken together, we now project total membership to be approximately 1 million members to 1.2 million members higher than we ended 2015. We now expect our medical loss ratio to be in the range of 84.9% plus or minus 30 basis points for the year, reflecting our view that higher than previously expected claims rates in our Individual ACA compliant plans as well as our Medicaid businesses remain at elevated levels throughout the year. This includes the worse-than-expected results in the newly-implemented Iowa market. Reflecting the expected higher paid claims, we now expect 2016 operating cash flow to be approximately $3 billion. To offset the expected increase in our medical loss ratio, we are continuing the efforts started last year to ensure we have an efficient cost structure. We now expect our SG&A ratio for the full year 2016 to be in the range of 14.5% plus or minus 30 basis points. We continue to expect 2016 Local Group medical cost trends to be in the range of 7% to 7.5%. Our updated 2016 outlook does not include any benefit from the impact of share repurchase activity for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, we did not repurchase any shares through the first six months of 2016. Our outlook does include the adverse impact of an additional $0.02 in assessments associated with the dissolution of the Ohio Co-op. This is in addition to the $0.03 of assessments we previously discussed in our first quarter call associated with the state of Colorado dissolution of their Co-op. We have not included any additional assessments beyond those incurred in Colorado and Ohio in our outlook. It is important to note that our 2016 outlook does not include any additional benefits or transaction cost associated with the pending acquisition of Cigna beyond those incurred in the first half of 2016, nor does it include any benefit from lower pharmaceutical pricing, which we continue we believe we are entitled to under our current contract with ESI. With that, operator, please open the queue for questions. Operator : Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of A. J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead. A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Hello, everybody. First just to maybe try to clarify a little bit more on the outlook for the year and particularly what you're assuming for the back half. If my numbers are right, you're allowing for about a 300 basis point to 400 basis point deterioration further from what we saw first half MLR to back half MLR and you're getting obviously, as you say, the SG&A leverage. Two parts to this. Is that a normal seasonal pattern? Are you allowing for any other contingencies on the MLR assumption in the back half? And would you characterize what you're doing on the SG&A side as something that's sustainable, or are these sort of extraordinary measures in light of the MLR pressure that you've experienced? John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi, A. J., this is John. Thank you for the question and good morning. Yeah, so a couple questions in there in terms of MLR and G&A. But, first of all, in MLR, your math is certainly appropriate from the first half to the last half. And really what we've seen is that we've got an elevated amount of utilization specifically in the ACA Individual compliant plans as well as in Medicaid and most significantly, they're in Iowa. And we're at least, for purposes of our outlook, assuming that that elevated level is going to continue throughout the rest of the year. So, while certainly if there's any mitigation factors or medical management initiatives end up being more successful than we're planning, there could be upside. But it's really it has to do with taking the elevated levels of utilization we've seen and just essentially run-rating them for the rest of the year. In terms of the G&A, I'd say the bulk of the G&A is sustainable. What we've really done is done an outstanding job of fixed cost leveraging. We're increasing membership here this year between 1 million members and 1.2 million members and maintaining our cost structure relatively constant. We are growing. Our head count increased in the second quarter, but it increased at a far, far slower rate than our membership increased. Revenue's going up about $2.5 billion, $2 billion to $2.5 billion for the change in guidance from the beginning of the year to today, yet the raw SG&A number is only going up very slightly. And so, it's really has as much to do with an excellent job of fixed cost leveraging. And clearly we are looking at some inefficiency and waste in terms of our processes and continue to look at those very closely on a regular basis and try to eliminate those things. And at the end of the day, the last piece of it really is that we're a pay-for-performance company. And as a pay-for-performance company, in order to get our bonus payments, we have to hit our targets. And to the extent that we don't hit our targets, we'll reduce our bonus structure. So that's something that we're looking at very closely, as well. A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. If I could do just a quick follow up. Joe, thanks for the comments about the Cigna transaction. I might just ask, do you have any updated assessment of the timeline from here? And then I think the merger agreement goes through the end of this year. Can you just mention to us what happens after the end of the year if we're still in the Court dealing with the proposed transaction? Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Got it. Thanks, A. J. First of all, when you referenced the end of the year, actually we had the option on our side, our call, to extend it to the end of April, which obviously we intend to do so. So I just want to make that record clear that we will continue and obviously we're going to run out the litigation as long as it takes, working towards the end of April. Our expectation is, I guess, under normal or usual circumstances claims like this, we're expecting the trial to begin somewhere around October, and at the outside, we're looking at four months. We believe it'll be about four months. Obviously it could run a little longer, but that's our expectation. A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Barclays. Please go ahead. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. I think I'm going to ask just very similar questions to A. J., but just I guess a different perspective. So on the MLR, forgetting about sort of the first half versus second half, on a year-over-year basis, the first half is up 188 basis points and that's only three months of Iowa and you get some ACA benefit, but the second half looks more like an increase of 140 basis points. So, the way I'm looking at it year-over-year you're actually expecting some noticeable improvement in the second half. So my MLR question is, what's causing that improvement on a relative basis? And then, John, on the G&A side, I think you mentioned that growth is going up a lot less than the revenue growth. But the way I look at it is, second quarter you added $1.5 billion to revenues, but took $600 million of G&A out. So it looks like there are noticeable savings. And I guess I'm just curious, is that deferred investment or is that some other sort of savings on the G&A side? John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, Josh. Great question. So, yeah, first half we'll be clear. On the MLR, yeah, the first half of the year had the benefit of three Rs in it. The run rate of claims outside of three Rs is worse, and so that's obviously being baked into our outlook and our thought process. On the admin side, quite honestly, the single largest driver of that year-over-year is the bonus program that I referenced at the end of A. J.'s question in terms of being a pay-for-performance company. We adjusted our bonus payable appropriately based on ensuring that we're going to hit our $10.80. And so, that's certainly a positive, the reconciliation. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And John, what was the three R benefit? And I don't know, is there a way to size Iowa's impact in 2Q as well? John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. The three R benefit in and of itself, we don't provide the level of specificity that you're probably asking for. In terms of Iowa, I'll just say that Iowa is a brand new market and we expected it to be dilutive in 2016 as we implemented our various medical management and revenue optimization processes. We ended up with about 25,000 more members in Iowa than we originally expected when we did our plan at the beginning of the year. And, quite honestly, the MLR in Iowa, is 25 basis points to 30 basis points higher than we expected when we did our plan as well. So we got the additional members and it's more dilutive simultaneously with the elevated claims level. The really good news for that is that our plan, we look at what we've done here historically, what the team has done historically in terms of new markets and implementing the managed care type processes and procedures and the fact that the first-year markets have historically been dilutive and that we've guided to target margins within our 18-month to 24-month period of time. There's no reason to believe that that's not going to occur again here in Iowa given though the starting point may be a little bumpier than we had hoped. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And you said 25 basis points to 30 basis points or points higher? Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Josh, 25 points to 30 points higher, not basis points. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Points. Okay. So it's a huge number. Yeah, yeah, okay. Okay. That makes sense. Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good morning. It's Dave Styblo in for Windley. Just wanted to come back to \u2013 maybe if you guys could help us bridge sort of the puts and takes. I know obviously the overall guidance remains the same in terms of EPS, but I think by the math that you guys presented on the Individual book being at a mid-single digit loss, it sounds like that's about a (30:26), and then on top of that, you've got the Medicaid challenges that you highlighted. Is that sort of the right way to think about it? And then the offset being largely just the SG&A improvement on top of that to offset those two negatives? John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, the other part of that is the top-line growth is very clearly a good guide, it's part of all that. But, yeah, those are the most significant pieces. I think the good news is, and just to sort of maybe answer your follow-up question before you ask it, is that as we look at 2016 versus 2017, let's be very clear, as I said in the prepared comments, when we did our pricing for 2017, we already had taken this elevated level of claims and utilization into account and baked it into our 2017 outlook. So we believe that this is more of a one-year type of issue and that we're very committed to returning the ACA block of business back to profitability in 2017. David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC : So you did address my question earlier on the follow-up. So is it \u2013 I guess so it seems like you priced for these things to happen, and in some ways, it still seems like it's worse than expected. So if you were filing rates and benefit changes earlier in the year, maybe you can just give us more comfort about specifically how you caught these things earlier on when we're starting to see more of the development come in with higher utilization on the dialysis and COPD and the other elements that you've talked about? John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, sure. Well, the rates were developed in the April/May timeframe, and so if you look back at our \u2013 when we closed the books in March and the information we had available to us at that point in time, we had seen some of the spikes and the elevations, just not to the same \u2013 we weren't crystal-clear then it was going to continue for the rest of the year or not. However, we wanted to be conservative. We wanted to be prudent. And so we believed \u2013 we had hoped that it was not a trend. However, when we did our pricing, we felt it was best to assume it was a trend. Here we are 90 days later. I believe our conservatism turned out to be prudent, in that something that we weren't sure if it was going to be a trend or not probably is. There's still the opportunity that seasonality could be in our favor and that things could get a little bit better in the second half of the year. We just have decided not to assume that at this point in time. David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then if I could just ask on Medicaid, I know obviously you highlighted Iowa and then you mentioned that broadly, there was just higher trends. Is it predominantly just Iowa being the drag in Medicaid, or are there some specific other states? And maybe if you could sort of share a percentage of the weighting? Is it 75% Iowa, 25% other states, and highlight what those other states might be and the issues that you're seeing there? John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : In terms of \u2013 it is both, Iowa as well as other states, and we really don't get into specifics state-by-state. We're just calling out Iowa as a marker because it's brand new and it is a significant driver in and of itself. I will say that the primary drivers of the elevated trends, they're pharmacy, nursing facilities, ER, and outpatient surgery. Those four items are really the most significant part of our trend issue in the other states. So \u2013 but we are seeing elevated trends in several states and we're addressing those accordingly. David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC : Okay. But fair to say well above 50% is attributable to Iowa, though? John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We really don't get into that level of detail on a state-by-state basis for competitive reasons. David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Schenker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. So just going back to the exchange business here. Just think about it big picture, right? In 2014, you guys were actually profitable. Last year you were close to break-even. This year you're now losing money here. So what has really changed over that timeframe? Is it just the risk pool has continued to get worse? And therefore is this something you can actually rectify with pricing? Are there structural issues to the exchanges, or are there other more meaningful benefit changes, i.e. networks or other design changes that you've also incorporated for next year that are going to be necessary to offset what's been a steady deterioration in the profitability of this book every year? Thanks. John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, sure. No, great question. And in terms of will pricing by itself rectify it, no. Because there's no one single bullet that actually solves the entire problem. The administration is extremely focused on having a sustainable marketplace, and we think that we've been a very active participant in the exchanges and been a great partner with CMS in trying to help with the stability of the marketplace. They've made changes over the years of tightening the supplemental enrollment a bit and various other requirements. The penalty continues to increase. We think all those things obviously have to be done. Other things that would certainly help the acceleration of the stabilization would be to eliminate the health insurer tax beyond 2017. The risk adjuster model, it does a lot of what it's intended to do, but quite honestly, there's a bit of an imbalance that it overcharges for healthy and over-reimburses for certain moderately unhealthy disease states. We think, as I said, the supplemental enrollment period, we really do need a better up-front verification process. And that there should not be any restriction on our efforts to innovate product designs to meet consumer needs. And then modifying the grace periods for nonpayment of premiums would be something else. So those are just, in addition to the pricing, things that we've been working with the administration on and believe should occur. We do believe that with the medical management and various other issues that we can help get this back to profitability here in 2017. Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, this is Joe. Let me just weigh in to add to what John just shared with you. Just to reiterate. We've been a very active participant in the exchanges from the very beginning, and recognize the markets have taken longer than expected to stabilize, and we've stated that repeatedly, and I think we've been working very closely with the administration and conducting our own modeling to best judge how we're going to continually engage year-over-year in as profitable a context as possible. It's interesting to reflect back at the end of the first quarter, we told you that \u2013 end of June 30, we'd probably have greater insight into the membership we've captured, recognizing that we had a substantial uptick in membership. It deteriorated a little bit at the end of Q2 to around 925,000 or so members. But what we've observed in terms of the intensity of illness is that as, John pointed out in his earlier remarks, we're dealing with some chronic illnesses like cardiac, diabetes, COPD, we've had what we think is a material uptick in dialysis cost that have hit us. So we're going through an appraisal of all of that in terms of how to better medically manage those members as well as begin pricing it into 2017. That's the trick. I think John has stated it and I'll restate it. We believe we're well positioned for pricing in 2017 given what we now know about the membership we've captured. And so, I guess, when you put all that together, what we're waiting for now is rate approvals by state, and I can assure you that we're going to be extremely prudent in our continuing engagement. I think we're in something like 138 or so rating regions, and we're going through an appraisal of every one of those regions. And we'll make prudent business decisions in terms of flexing our engagement in appropriate ways going into 2017, and so I just want to assure you that notwithstanding we've been active participants, we're also very, I'll use the word prudent, very thoughtful in terms of executing a good business practice in terms of how we continue to stay engaged in the public marketplace. Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. That was very helpful. Thinking maybe a little bit more broadly, you kind of reiterated your Small Group or Local Group, rather, trend assumptions here, but you did kind of call out timing and medical cost experience for Local Group. Maybe you can just talk a bit more about what you're seeing around trend, if there's any pockets you're seeing in patient, et cetera, as it relates to how you define it? Thank you. John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, sure. So in terms of trend on the Local Group side, that's actually going very well, and we reaffirmed the 7% to 7.5% outlook for that and feel very comfortable with that given the results for the first half of the year. In terms of the timing, that relates to just a couple really accounting and calendar quirks. The first quarter of 2016 had an extra workday in it driven by leap year. The second quarter of 2016 had an extra workday in it driven by how the weekends fell. The fourth quarter of 2016 has one less workday in it, and so it's significant enough to change the timing pattern on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And you take that into effect that our overall product mix in the group side is slightly richer than the overall product mix in the group side a year ago. That changes the timing as well given how the deductibles work. Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Please go head. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Just a couple questions. Did you give us the total exchange enrollment as of the end of 2Q? Did I miss that? John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, it's 923,000 members. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And the total \u2013 when you talk about the ACA compliant book now being mid-single-digit losses, what is the total ACA compliant enrollment that you're speaking to? So presumably that's some op exchange and some Small Group ACA compliant as well? John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : A little more than half of the remainder is ACA compliant. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And I just wanted to come back to the risk adjustment. Because it seems like potentially it was quite material in the quarter. I know you guys only disclose that you had a payable at year-end. We calculate that payable about $105 million in the swing factor to $190 million payment that CMS was citing for 2015 was about $0.60. You say that you booked some valuation allowances against that because of the Co-op situations, but, I mean, should we assume that material portion of that $0.60 was trued up in his quarter? John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : There was a lot of things that went against it, and I'm not going to really comment on your estimate of the payable. But in terms of valuation allowance, it was clearly part of it. Certainly medical loss ratio rebates were part of it. After all the dust settled, we're going to pay over $100 million in MLR rebates in 2016 related to the 2015 calendar year. And so that's part of it. You've got the Small Group versus the Individual component is clearly a piece of it, risk corridor true-ups, I mean, there's so many moving parts it's hard to, on a call here, pin that down exactly. And then quite honestly, whatever benefits existed after all the other offsets have now been baked into our trend outlook and our guidance for the rest of the year. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. If I could, just two quick clarifications. I think Josh was asking about the G&A run rate and sustainability of that. The guidance for the second half certainly implies this reduced G&A is fairly sustainable. But as you head into 2017, do you feel like there's going to be a deferred level that has to rebound, or is this sort of G&A ratio a number that makes sense as a jumping off point heading into 2017? John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The most significant driver of the G&A benefits here compared to our guidance or our outlook is the top line revenue growth and the fixed cost leveraging associated with that. And so that clearly is run rate and sustainable. In terms of certainly as an employee of the company, I'm fully supportive of getting back to the bonus structure back to target levels, but there's a natural hedge associated with that. So as results warranted, we then record the expense. If they don't warrant it, we don't record the expense. So what the impact that might be on an exact ratio is to be seen, but the bottom line has a natural hedge built in. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : My last one. When we think about the year, ACA compliant business worse than you had anticipated. Iowa and Medicaid overall worse than anticipated. Yet you maintained the guidance. So the two components that were better that allowed you to maintain compliance was risk adjustment and some of the additional enrollment growth? Is that fair? John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, certainly admin, risk adjustment, enrollment growth, we're doing extremely well in the National, and large local ASL in terms of enrollment. Our Medicare Advantage and our Senior business are doing very, very well and exceeding expectations for the year. And, quite honestly, we had a bit of an initial conservative posture at the beginning of the year as well. So, it's a lot of things. Our specialty product line is beating expectations, so I would hate to just point to one or two items because there are far more positives than there are negatives. It's just that the two negatives have really caused our conservative posture to be a more prudent posture. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good morning. First just a follow-up on the SG&A number for that bonus program. I understand that, as you said, it's a hedge and other things have to improve to offset it, but can you give us a ballpark number there in terms of how much cost comes back into SG&A if you fully accrue that for next year? John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, in terms of exactly how much that is, the bonus program at target is certainly a significant number in and of itself, but, Justin, that's just not a number that we're comfortable giving out. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Is there any way to proportion it, for instance? You're losing \u2013 you said mid-single-digits on the Individual side, I mean can you remind us what's the ACA compliant premium number for this year, ballpark? John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's a bit north of $6 billion. Close to that. Maybe closer to $7 billion. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. So you're talking about $300 million plus in potential just getting back to break even, right, in the Individual business? Right? Is that how we should think about the earnings power of the business? I assume you're not expecting to run losses for even the intermediate term here as you talked about? So... John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'm not going to argue with your math. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. So if Individual comes back to break even or better, does this SG&A basically offset that? Or is it larger or smaller than Individual coming back to break even? John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, there's \u2013 certainly it's a natural hedge built in, but to answer your question would be to answer the question that you asked the first time. So good luck. It's a big number. But we're not going to size it specifically. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. But you wouldn't call me crazy if I said it was in the same ballpark as getting back to break even in Individual? John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I would never call you crazy. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : All right. Last question just on the Government side. So you've laid out the issues here and you were very clear coming into 2016 saying, for instance, Medicaid was \u2013 the margins were unsustainable, they were going to come down, plus you were going to have the Medicaid pressure in Iowa. I guess, what I'm trying to think about here is, these margins are down meaningfully for 2016 in the Government overall, and you're saying Medicare is actually improving. So Medicaid's the full brunt. My question is, is Medicaid now at a target margin for 2016 when you think about it overall, or does the Medicaid margin actually improve going forward from here given how tough it's been and the worse-than-expected cost overall? Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, it's \u2013 the Medicaid margins are within our target range. Obviously, we're hopeful that we can improve it to the high end of the range, but even with all these headwinds and the negative comments that we had earlier in the year, we're still within the range. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : So for the full year you're within the range, but closer to the midpoint to the low end, and potentially can improve it towards the higher end again, where you've typically been? Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's a reasonable way of thinking about it, yes. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch : Hi. I've got a couple questions. I guess first on the exchanges, I guess obviously you guys believe that you've caught everything as far as pricing for next year and you expect margins to improve next year. But I guess we've seen now, I don't know, five quarters or six quarters in a row where it kind of seems like the costs continue to rise for you, but really for a lot of the players out there. I mean, can you give a sense as to why you feel confident saying that, given the experience of most companies over the last year-and-a-half? John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Why we believe that we've caught everything? Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch : Yeah, exactly. John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think \u2013 well, a lot of it obviously has to do with our data analytics and how we track things. And as you look at the rate increases that we've put in, approaching 20% range on a weighted average basis across our 14 states, very significant. And as we \u2013 we also believe that we have some of the best-in-class risk adjuster capabilities of really understanding what drives risk adjuster and things like that and I think the results that we saw from the CMS true-up really helped verify that. So, the other piece that gives us a little bit of comfort in terms of having caught everything is that our 2016 risk adjuster that we're assuming in 2017 really is based on 2015 experience. So we think that that gives us a natural cushion associated with how that's being approached. But at the end of the day, the question is, how do we know we've gotten everything? Well, we've got six months of information, obviously, there's a lot of new members associated with this block of business. And we can't provide absolute certainty, but we think we have a very, very good line of sight. What we saw at the end of the first quarter, we sort of predicted from a pricing standpoint and what we saw at the end of the second quarter was exactly consistent with that pricing prediction. So we feel good that we've got a good line of sight on that. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch : I guess is there anything different about you heading into Q3 this year versus you heading into Q3 last year as far as what you're doing from a data analytics perspective, or anything there that gives you more confidence or visibility this year than what you had heading into the back-half of last year? Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, this is Joe. I certainly believe that we're always improving year-over-year and especially in this space, given we've got more and more data. We certainly recognize that this is a company that's had a longstanding engagement in high-risk pools. We have a lot of data that has backed us up for a long period of time. And I think that we just, as I said a moment ago, always expect to continue to improve in this space. However, I'll reiterate what I said earlier. We're going to be very surgical with respect to our analytics in and around rating regions. We're going to be very mindful of what price increases are awarded to us by state, and so we'll be making very, call it, accurate business decisions going into 2017 and beyond regarding our continued engagement on a broad scale in the public exchange space. John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. And then the other comment that I'll just add to that I think maybe to address your, what would be different going into the third quarter is, 2016, we actually had more members come on board on January 1 than we did in 2015 or 2014. 2014 in particular, if you recall, we had a vast majority of the members come on board early second quarter, and in 2015, with the extension of the open enrollment period, a lot of members came on later in the first quarter. 2016, a lot more January 1. So we actually do have a full six months of information this year and we had not had that in prior years. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then just last question. Last quarter you said that when you expected the exchanges to be pretty much breakeven this year, you said next year was probably going to be below your target 3% to 5%, but by 2018, you'd be in your target margin. Do you still feel like you still have that same ramp over the next couple of years, or does this setback kind of push back when you're going to get to your target margins on exchanges? John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The pricing increases that we've put in really do keep us on that same ramp. And it's very important that we do receive the pricing increases that we've filed for in terms of that. Obviously, we expect the market to continue to harden and pricing to be more reasonable. I mean, clearly there's a reason that so many co-ops have gone insolvent in terms of their pricing methodology. So as more and more of those folks exit the market, it should provide a more sustainable stable marketplace in 2018 and beyond. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. Operator : And your final question today comes from the line of Chris Rigg. Please go ahead. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Good morning. Just with regard to the ACA compliant membership, do you have a sense at this point how many of the individuals were new members to Anthem? And is there \u2013 if you have that information, is there a pronounced difference in utilization trends among those who are new to Anthem versus those that have been enrolled for a year or two? Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. A very quick response to the question, a little less than half of the membership was new to us in 2016. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. And then just one quick follow up here. Of the Individual that's non-ACA compliant at this point, will most of them become \u2013 roll into ACA compliant plans in 2017 because of the grandmothering dynamic, or will they still stay outside the compliant side? Thanks. John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, no, a great question. We do expect some attrition in that area, as you pointed out whether the enrollment remains to be seen, but historically, we haven't seen the uptake in ACA compliant plans that maybe was estimated by the CBO when the law was passed. But, yeah, that's certainly a watch area for us. Operator : And I would now like to turn the conference back to the company's management for closing comments. Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, as usual, thanks for your questions. They're all very insightful. As a company, we remain committed to tackling our healthcare system's challenges head-on and deliver greater value to consumers by expanding access to high-quality, affordable healthcare. That's why we're committed to challenging the DOJ's recent decision to block our acquisition of Cigna in Court. We also want to thank all of our associates for their continued commitment to serving our 39.8 million members every day. Thanks for your interest in Anthem, and we look forward to speaking with you very soon. Again, thank you very much.

Later there will there be a question and answer session, instructions will be given at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Douglas R. Simpson - Anthem, Inc.: Good morning and welcome to Anthem's third quarter 2016 earnings call. This is Doug Simpson, Vice President of Investor Relations. With us this morning are Joe Swedish, Chairman, President and CEO, and John Gallina, our CFO. Joe will offer an overview of our third quarter 2016 results and our updated 2016 full year outlook. Then John will walk through the financial details and provide some incremental commentary on 2017, before Joe closes with some longer term strategic commentary. We will then be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Joe. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you, Doug, and good morning. This morning we announced third quarter 2016 GAAP earnings per share of $2.30. Adjusted earnings per share was $2.45, consistent with our previous expectations. Within membership, we continue to post strong fully insured and self-funded enrollment results, as we ended the third quarter with over 39.9 million members. We grew an additional 160,000 lives during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date enrollment growth to 1.3 million lives or 3.4%. Specifically, insured enrollment increased by 39,000 lives during the quarter, as our Medicaid business grew by 81,000 lives to over 6.4 million members. Since closing the Amerigroup transaction in 2012, we've grown Medicaid enrollment by nearly 1.9 million lives or 41%, including growth of approximately 800,000 lives from Medicaid expansion. Within Commercial, our insured enrollment came in slightly ahead of expectations, as Local Group fully insured membership tracked well, particularly in the Large Group marketplace. Our public exchange enrollment declined by a less than expected 34,000 during the quarter to 889,000 lives. Our self-funded business increased by 121,000 during the quarter, reflecting the impact of enrollment growth from existing accounts and recently awarded contracts. Our solid membership results during the year translated into better than expected operating revenue of $21.1 billion during the quarter, an increase of $1.4 billion or 6.8% versus third quarter of 2015. The increase reflects the strong enrollment growth in the Government Business and additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends. Additionally, administrative fee revenue grew by 6.4% versus the prior year quarter as a result of our strong self-funded membership trends. These increases were partially offset by fully insured membership losses in our Commercial business. The third quarter 2016 benefit expense ratio was in line with our previous expectations at 85.5%, an increase of 190 basis points versus the prior year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the Medicaid business, as higher than expected medical cost experience, notably in Iowa, has exceeded the net impact of annual premium rate adjustments made over the last 12 months. In addition, it reflects the impact of growth in membership, as the Medicaid business carries a higher benefit expense ratio than the consolidated company average. Further, the benefit expense ratio reflects the impact of higher medical cost experience in the individual business. These increases were partially offset by the timing of lower medical cost experience in the Local Group business. Our SG&A expense ratio was also in line with expectations at 14.8% in the third quarter, a decrease of 80 basis points from the third quarter of 2015. The decrease was driven by an intentional focus on administrative expense control, coupled with better than expected enrollment trends, as well as the changing mix of our membership towards the Government Business, which carries a lower than consolidated average SG&A ratio. Turning to discuss the third quarter financial performance of our business units. In the Government Business, we added 92,000 members during the quarter, and grew year-over-year revenue by 10.9% to nearly $11.5 billion. As a reminder, our third quarter results include the impact of the addition of the Iowa contract, which was implemented on April 1. Operating margins for the Government Business were 4.2% during the third quarter, a decline of 190 basis points versus the prior year quarter, driven by lower gross margins in the Medicaid business. As we communicated previously, we've been expecting Medicaid margins to compress from 2015 levels due to rate actions. In addition, we've been experiencing higher than expected claims across the Medicaid business in the current year, including materially higher than expected costs in the recently implemented Iowa contract. As expected, there was a rebalancing of funding based on risk pool during the quarter. In addition, we've been informed of a retroactive rate increase, which extends through June 2017 when rates will again be adjusted. Unfortunately, the recent rate increase is still inadequate, given the claims experience to date. We remain confident we can make a meaningful impact by improving the cost and quality of care in Iowa as we've done for our other state partners. However, we will remain disciplined in only participating in markets where we receive rates that are actuarially sound. Within Medicare, we're pleased with the progress the team continues to make. And our year-to-date margins reflect continued improvement. During the quarter, CMS announced we earned Medicare star quality ratings for 2017 consistent with our long-term strategy. In the most recent ratings released by CMS, 51% of Anthem's Medicare Advantage members will be enrolled in plans that achieve four stars or higher. This accomplishment represents significant growth from the 22% of MA members in four star plans last year. The improvement is the direct result of investments made in the Medicare program over the past 3 years. Our 2016 outlook continues to expect margins to improve as the year progresses towards our expected long range sustainable level. As we stated since our MA restructuring began, we have positioned our portfolio to grow MA in 2017. The pipeline of opportunity for our Medicaid business remains substantial with an updated estimate of $81 billion in contracts to be awarded between now and 2021 in markets that we will consider targeting. Approximately three-fourths of this opportunity is in new and specialized services with the remainder in traditional Medicaid services. We continue to believe our experience, targeted investments in critical capabilities, and geographic footprint positions us very well to continue our growth, as we help states address the challenges of rising healthcare costs and improving quality for their residents. Switching to our Commercial business. Our enrollment increased by 68,000 lives during the quarter, which was slightly better than our previous expectation. Specifically, we experienced growth of 171,000 lives in our Local Group business, partially offset by declines of 48,000 and 54,000 lives in our National and Individual businesses respectively. These results translated into better than previously expected operating revenue of $9.7 billion, representing growth of 2.4%. Our third quarter operating margin of 6.6% was flat versus the third quarter of 2015. Commercial operating margins during the quarter reflected a lower SG&A ratio due to lower administrative cost resulting from expense efficiency initiatives taken by the company as well as fixed cost leverage on a growing membership base. In addition, our Commercial business experienced the favorable timing impact of lower medical cost experienced in the Local Group business. These increases were offset by higher medical cost experience in our individual ACA compliant product. Within our individual ACA compliant plans, costs during the third quarter were marginally better than recent expectation, which is reassuring. We continue to experience higher than initially expected costs from members with chronic conditions, as we've discussed with you previously. Overall, the financial performance in individual ACA compliant products has been disappointing, as membership has been short of our original expectations since its inception. And operating margins have been lower than expected beginning in 2015. We believe we've taken the appropriate actions across our served markets to return to slight profitability in 2017. Clearly, 2017 is a critical year, as we continue to assess the long-term viability of our exchange footprint. We will continue to closely monitor this business, and if we do not see clear evidence of an improving environment and a path towards sustainability in the marketplace, we will likely modify our strategy in 2018. We believe both the pricing and regulatory environment need to be improved to drive toward a sustainable and affordable marketplace over the long term. Relating to National Accounts, which typically encompass the most sophisticated purchasers of coverage, we're pleased that the team continues to secure wins, contributing to the track record of membership growth in 2017. We have added 602,000 lives so far in 2016, building on the growth of over 900,000 lives during the previous two years. And now turning to our 2016 financial outlook; our third quarter results were largely in line with the expectations we laid out during our last quarter call. We expect our full-year 2016 GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $9.28, including approximately $1.52 of negative adjustment items. On an adjusted basis, we expect earnings per share to be approximately $10.80. We now expect our 2016 operating revenue to be approximately $83.5 billion, which is at the high end of our previously-guided range, reflecting the impact of slightly better enrollment trends during the quarter. Fully insured membership is expected to be in the range of 15 million to 15.1 million members, or 50,000 higher than our previous outlook, which reflects stronger than previously expected results in the Commercial business. Self-funded membership is expected to be 24.7 million members, which is at the midpoint of our range, unchanged from our previous outlook. Taken together, we are now projecting total membership growth of just over 1.1 million lives at the midpoint of our range versus where we ended in 2015. Consistent with our expectations last quarter, we expect our medical loss ratio to be in the range of 84.9%, plus or minus 30 basis points; the SG&A ratio to be 14.5%, plus or minus 30 basis points; and operating cash flow to be approximately $3 billion. We continue to expect 2016 Local Group medical cost trends to be in the range of 7% to 7.5%. Our 2016 outlook continues to not include any benefit from the impact of share repurchase activity for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, we did not repurchase any shares through the first nine months of 2016. It is important to note that our 2016 outlook does not include any additional benefits or transaction costs associated with the pending acquisition of Cigna beyond those incurred in the first nine months of 2016. Nor does it include any benefit from lower pharmaceutical pricing, which we continue to believe we are entitled to under our current contract with ESI. I will now turn the call over to John to discuss some key financial metrics and our initial thoughts on headwinds and tailwinds for 2017. John? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you, Joe, and good morning. As Joe stated, our third quarter results were very consistent with the expectations we laid out last quarter. In order to provide you a bit more clarity on our performance, I will highlight some of our key financial metrics. First, I'd like to discuss the balance sheet. Consistent with our past practice, we have included a roll-forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we experienced favorable prior-year reserve development of $773 million, which was moderately better than our expectations. We continue to be at the upper end of our range of mid to high single-digit margins for adverse deviation and believe our reserve balances remain consistent and strong as of September 30, 2016. Our Days in Claims Payable was 40.6 days as of September 30, unchanged from the 40.6 days we reported last quarter. As previously discussed and consistent with our expectations, this metric has trended down over the past year. And we expect Days in Claims Payable to be around 40 days over time. Our debt to cap ratio was 38.7% as of September 30, down 40 basis points from the 39.1% at the end of the second quarter, which reflects the impact of an increase in shareholder equity, as we did not repurchase any stock during the quarter. We ended the third quarter with approximately $2.1 billion of cash and investments at the parent company. And our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $983 million as of the end of the quarter. For the three Rs, we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate and continue to reflect a net receivable position for risk adjusters. We also continue our conservative posture of recording a 100% valuation allowance against any unpaid receivables for the 2014, the 2015, and the 2016 benefit years for risk corridors. Moving on to cash flow; we reported operating cash flow of approximately $2.9 billion or 1.4 times net income during the first nine months of 2016. During the quarter, we reported operating cash flow of $964 million, which was 1.6 times net income. These results include the receipt of a CMS Medicare prepayment of approximately $650 million during the third quarter. For the full year of 2016, we continue to expect operating cash flows to be approximately $3 billion. We used $171 million during the quarter for our cash dividend and yesterday the audit committee declared our fourth quarter 2016 dividend of $0.65 per share to shareholders. Now, turning to 2017; we are currently working through our planning process and analyzing the impact of various expected headwinds and tailwinds. Our current view of the tailwinds include, number one, enrollment gains across Medicaid, Medicare, and National and Large Group self-funded businesses. Two, margin improvement due to improving results in our individual ACA compliant plans, the Iowa Medicaid contract, and the impact of the one-year health insurer fee moratorium in 2017. And three, we expect to resume capital deployment activity in 2017. However, the timing and magnitude is dependent on the timing of the pending Cigna acquisition. Potential headwinds include the return of the 2017 one-time administrative expense cuts that we made in 2016; the impact of lower Local Group enrollment and gross margin pressures as a result of the migration towards ACA compliant product offerings; and finally, we expect to experience continued margin pressure in the Medicaid business, primarily driven by rate actions within the Medicaid expansion population over the next year. Taken together, these items are expected to represent modest earnings growth from 2016. As part of our planning process, we will continue to be focused on identifying steps to maximize our opportunities to drive improved earnings growth over time. We expect to provide more details around our 2017 outlook on our fourth quarter conference call. With that I'm going to turn the call back over to Joe to discuss our longer term outlook. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you, John. Three years ago, we laid out our plan for growth, which reflected our strategy to capitalize on the substantial opportunities in the Government Business, while recognizing the changing nature of the Commercial marketplace, as a result of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Our plan was to establish a leadership position in the Medicaid market, stabilize our Medicare Advantage platform, and grow individual ACA compliant and ASO enrollment and mitigate the expected pressure in the Local Group fully insured segment. Since that time, we've been pleased with the growth in our Medicaid business, where enrollment has grown 47% since 2013. And we are well positioned to capitalize on the $81 billion pipeline of opportunity between now and 2021 that I mentioned earlier. In addition, we have reconfigured and upgraded our Medicare platform, as evidenced by the improvement in our margin profile and star rating performance. We expect to leverage our upgraded Medicare platform to grow MA enrollment in 2017 and beyond. Overall, the Government Business segment has grown nicely and now represents 54% of our consolidated company revenue, up from 44% in 2013. And we remain very optimistic about continued growth potential in this business. Switching to Individual, as we've discussed previously, the earnings contribution from the Individual ACA compliant business represents a meaningful headwind to our original targets. The volume shortfall from our previous expectation remains substantial. For your reference we laid out a plan to grow Individual ACA compliant enrollment to 3 million members by 2018, using the assumption that the overall Individual marketplace would be approximately 25 million members, in line with CBO estimates. In 2016 the overall marketplace was about half of the expected size. It has only grown to roughly 10 million to 11 million members. And subsequently, we have grown our Individual ACA compliant enrollment to approximately 1.4 million members as of the third quarter of 2016. We are closely monitoring the progress of our actions to improve the margin profile of this business toward our low to mid-single digit margin targets of 2018. In our self-funded business we've added 4.4 million members since 2013, as our value proposition has resonated with large employers who are focused on quality and affordability. This ASO growth has helped mitigate some of the pressure from higher than expected decline in our Local Group insured enrollment. Across our Commercial segment overall, we are generally pleased with our aggregate enrollment growth. But the mix of enrollment has skewed more than expected to self-funded than fully insured, pressuring revenue and earnings growth. Looking ahead, we still have meaningful opportunity to improve the per member EBITDA contribution from ASO by increasing the penetration of our specialty and other product offerings to help further offset pressures in Local Group. I want to spend a few moments on the pending acquisition of Cigna. We are committed to this combination, which will further Anthem's vision to be America's valued health partner. This is truly a compelling opportunity to positively impact the health and well-being of our members and advance our commitment to expand access to high-quality, affordable healthcare for consumers. It will also save consumers more than $2 billion in medical costs annually, directly benefiting the most vulnerable populations in the country. I also would like to briefly address the upcoming trial with the Department of Justice, which will begin on November 21. We continue to believe the DOJ's action to sue to block the acquisition is based on a flawed analysis and a misunderstanding of the dynamic, competitive, and heavily regulated healthcare landscape. And we're fully committed to challenging the DOJ's decision in court. In terms of the court proceeding, the judge has decided to bifurcate the issues and will first hear evidence on the National Accounts issue. If the judge decides in our favor on the National Account issue, we will then move forward and try the other two remaining issues with a decision on those issues being rendered before the end of January. To summarize, we are in the process of updating our long-term growth plan and expect to target improved core earnings growth rates beyond 2017. The Individual ACA compliant headwinds and our enrollment mix discussed previously represent a meaningful challenge to achieving our $14 earnings target at 2018. And we expect to provide additional clarity around our long-term growth prospects after the Cigna transaction process is complete. With that, operator, please open the queue for questions. Operator : Due to limited time and in fairness of other listeners, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. And our first question will come from the line of Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah, hi, thanks. Good morning. My question was about the Individual book. You said that there were losses this year, and they continued into the quarter. Sequentially speaking, what were the losses in \u2013 that you estimated in second quarter? And have they gone up since then? And why are you expecting that'll improve next year when the reinsurance phases out? Are you getting adequate pricing to do that? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. Hi, Ana, this is John. So thank you for the question. Associated with our Individual exchange business, we certainly did in the second quarter indicate losses. And that we expect that our operating margins are going to be on the mid-single digit loss for the year. Now during the third quarter, the reserve development was okay. The trend had been moderated a bit. And we still expect those losses in the same general range of what we said, maybe just a little bit better than we had indicated. In terms of 2017 reinsurance is obviously a very important factor, but it's only one aspect of pricing and one aspect of the overall structure of the program. We've got rate increases that average in excess of 20% across the country. I think there's been studies that have been published that have stated that our rate increases are a little bit higher than the average rate increases. We've made adjustments to product offerings, we've changed networks, we've enhanced product designs. We've done many, many things to improve affordability of the specific product mix. So we feel very good about the previous guidance that we provided that we're really targeting a small profit margin in 2017. And then returning to more closely related to target margins in 2018 and beyond. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Christine Arnold from Cowen. Please go ahead. Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, there. Couple things. On Iowa, your language there suggests that you got a rate increase, but it may not be adequate. And that you're disciplined. And you're only going to be in markets that are actuarially sound. Is there an out to get out of that if in fact, we can't get to actuarially sound rates? And then with respect to Individual, what do you think you need to see in order to feel that there's sustainability into 2018? What legislatively or administratively do you want to see there? Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. Christine, good morning, this is Joe Swedish. Yeah. First question regarding I guess the out possibilities. As you know the contract went live earlier this year. And obviously we're very concerned, because it has experienced a deterioration that certainly exceeded our forecast expectations regarding the medical loss ratio. We are in the process of having deep discussions with the state regarding the possibility of adjustments. I commented in our discussions just a moment ago that we have realized some positive effect from that discussion. And quite frankly, we're hoping for more. Unfortunately, the recent rate increase is still inadequate. And again we're hoping for a better outcome with respect to more discussion. With respect to the legal construct of the contract, we are examining our position. We quite frankly are waiting for the state to respond to the inquiries that we've submitted to them. And I think it's a little early for us to maybe put commentary out regarding our legal position, given the fact that there's still administrative considerations that are working their way through the system. And we're hopeful for a very positive outcome at the end of that review. We are concerned about the actuarial soundness of the rates. And that's been expressed by all the MCOs from the get go. We are engaged in an extensive process of meetings, as I've mentioned. And we'll continue to be deeply concerned until we get a resolution to this. And then we'll weigh our options with respect to the end point of those negotiations with the state. I think the second question dealt with the exchange, Christine? I wonder if you could restate that for me. I'm sorry. Operator : One moment please. Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: Sure. And then it sounded like your language suggests that if 2017 doesn't go well, you could change your strategy for 2018. What do you need to see administratively or legislatively in order to fix this and in order for you to feel that this is where you're going to stay for 2018? Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Right. Well on or about mid-year 2017 obviously, we'll be maybe coming to a conclusion on our review about how the adjustments have played out that we're expecting. To your point, what we're looking for are a variety of fixes, such as elimination of the health insurance tax or at least extending the 2017 moratorium. Another one that you probably heard quite a bit about is updating the risk adjustment model substantially to address existing imbalance that we believe deteriorates the overall risk pool. We are also looking at additional adjustments in the special enrollment periods, which we believe need to be continually narrowed with respect to the variety and number of special enrollments. We also believe that we need to have the flexibility to develop innovative products that should go to market to meet the needs of our customers. Modify the grace period is another great example. And finally, we want to work very closely with the states to ensure actuarial justified rates being approved. Now what I just specified for you, let me just put a characterization to it that I think it is very important. And that is this is a specific recipe for solutions. And we believe these recipe characteristics represent a form of long-term, sustainable, and an affordable marketplace. So as I said earlier in my commentary, we believe we must see adjustments such that we can easily map to a 2018 situation of sustainability in this marketplace. And quite frankly given what may or may not happen, we'll be evaluating the regional engagement across our markets moving into 2018. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: And, Joe, I'd just like to say, obviously everything there is very appropriate. But, Christine, we will be watching margins, trends, performance on a state-by-state and region-by-region basis in 2017 as well. So certainly the decision in 2018 could be a piecemeal decision as opposed to an altogether decision. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. I think thus far we've been very surgical in our approach, and we'll continue that theme. And so again we have a hope that the sustainability that's expected and commented on quite a bit by leadership of administration actually will occur during the early stages of 2017. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Hello, everybody. And I just want to follow \u2013 I appreciate the comments on the headwinds and tailwinds and the comment about modest growth. I guess there are three variables I just want to throw on the table. You're saying you'll go from a mid-single digit loss on the exchanges or in the Individual book to a positive. We got I guess about a \u2013 that would represent I think about a $0.70 swing, roughly 6% to 7% growth in and of itself. I just also wondered are you including anything in your comments about capital deployment when you talk about modest growth or anything on the PBM and what's the latest thinking on that? And then just to make sure the $10.80 is the baseline number upon which you're assuming modest growth? Or is it some other number that you would adjust for as the starting point for 2016? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. Sure. No, A.J., thank you for the question. And in terms of capital, we do expect to resume capital deployment in 2017. However, that won't be until after the pending Cigna acquisition process is completed. And so the timing and the magnitude of the capital deployment is still somewhat of an unknown. Associated with the starting point, yeah, very clearly $10.80 we believe is the appropriate starting point. That's our guidance. That's been our expectations now for some time. And that's our 2016 \u2013 approximately $10.80 is our 2016 guidance number. And then of course you have the tailwinds that offset that. But in terms of the PBM, we don't have any of the upside baked in. I think, Joe, maybe some comments, just about the PBM situation in general might be helpful. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah, A.J., thanks for question on that. As I've repeatedly stated, we're hopeful we can negotiate a settlement to our concerns, our dispute. And I don't need to restate what we've said repeatedly about our perspective on our contractual rights. But let me say that we do believe that we are continually focused on improving the pharmacy pricing on behalf of our customers. We expect to issue a new RFP during the year, that's early 2017, to understand the impact of various pharmacy options available to us, as we migrate to potential of a new agreement. And I have to underscore that it's critical that we engage with a really trusted partner with aligned interests in advancing cost effectiveness and quality for our membership. I guess we've not ruled anyone in or out in this process of securing an RFP. And I think with respect to any other comments made by ESI or others, we prefer not to comment on that. We do believe that a period of negotiations is still possible. And again, I'll underscore I'm hopeful that we can resolve our differences moving into the future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Matt Borsch from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes, thank you. Maybe on a slightly different topic. One of your peer companies has talked in considerable length about pressure in this Small Group ACA compliant book. I know you've alluded to that some. Can you just give us an update on how you see that business? Maybe breakdown in size and breakdown your Small Group between what's ACA compliant and what's grandmothered, grandfathered? And how you see that transition happening, working going into next year? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. Sure. Thank you for the question. Very good question. And that really is a meaningful headwind. And I think I did try to highlight it in the script. But in terms of the specificity of the question, we don't talk about a lot of this information for competitive reasons. But maybe two-thirds of our block is non-ACA compliant today. The grandmothering expires here at the end of the year. And we fully expect to be very aggressive in pursuing and renewing that block of business. The margin aspect of it may be slightly different, slightly lower as the ACA compliant blocks typically have a slightly lower margin compression. So but we'll ensure that we renew it at appropriate prices and have it to be profitable business on a go-forward basis. But we did want to spike it out as a headwind in 2017. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great, thanks. I guess two questions. First a clarification. You mentioned that as far as the Cigna lawsuit, they're going to break it up in two pieces, and that they're going to do National Accounts first. Just wondering if you had a timeframe for when we'd hear that? But then specifically on the Medicaid business, sounds like Iowa should get better next year. Medicaid expansion should get worse. Are you looking for net margin improvement or margin pressure on the Medicaid business as a whole in 2017? Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. Let me comment on Cigna hearings. Beyond the December judicial process, which we're anticipating a decision sometime on or about mid-December, we would expect that moving forward from there, that's possible then a trial would begin shortly thereafter, probably early January. And our hope is that that would be resolved with a judicial decision by the end of January. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: And then on the Medicaid question, just provide a little clarity. So certainly Iowa is going to be a tailwind into 2017. Yeah. We experienced significant upfront losses in Iowa. And even with the rebalancing of the portfolio and the retroactive rate increase, it still we do not believe is actuarially sound. And the expectation is that there will be improvement in 2017. However, associated with the remainder of the Medicaid block, we are seeing some slight margin pressure. We were phenomenally successful the past couple years with our margins. And specifically our expansion margins have been very, very, very good. And then as those get repriced throughout the balance of the year, they're going to be repriced at more of a target margin ratio \u2013 or target profit ratio, I'm sorry. And that will create a bit of headwind or margin pressure for us in 2017. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. A couple things. First, I remember back when we were going into the ACA, and there was concerns around Small Group. You guys had put out a number of about a $400 million headwind for next year for the coming couple of years in terms of a Small Group margin pressure. Is there any way for you to do something similar here? Just to give us an idea of as you go through this repricing, is there a number you can point to say here's \u2013 sounds like Small Group's going to be a pretty big prefer (42:26) next year as expected, maybe a little larger than we thought. Is there a way to put a number on that for us? And then on SG&A, it's been shifting around a bit here. And wanted to get your thoughts for the fourth quarter and how we should think about this for 2017 when we add in the \u2013 when we add back some of these one-time benefits that you had this year? Thanks. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. Sure, Justin, great questions. In terms of the Small Group we're still working through it. And I really am hesitant to provide an answer until our planning process is done and some of the grandmothering associated with the early renewals that exist. We actually have several of our \u2013 many of our Small Group plans renewed early on December a couple years ago in order to maintain their non-ACA compliant plans. And I think it'd probably be premature to throw a number out until we work through that process. So we will update that and provide more clarity on our fourth quarter call. Associated with the general administrative expenses, yeah. I think maybe I'll just repeat sort of the commentary from last time. It's down quite substantially in 2016. And a little more than half of it is a good sustainable run rate, meaningful decrease in SG&A expense. That has to do with more efficient processes, better performance in some of the administrative and core areas of the company. And we grew into our membership. We had a really good membership year from both a membership and premium perspective, raising guidance on that. And we're able to do that by maintaining our administrative expense levels. Obviously then the ratio went down. The other half, or a little less than the other half, were more one-time items. And those are nonsustainable. And the most significant part of those other \u2013 less than the other half is our incentive compensation plans. As we've stated, we're a pay-for-performance company. And we had our promises to Wall Street and what we expected earnings to be. And we ensured that we delivered those earnings. And unfortunately, we had to lower our incentive compensation expense as part of that process. But so a little less than half come back in 2017. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Newshel from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks, good morning. Does your expectation for slight profitability in the ACA compliant business next year assume that the National enrollment is going to be stable or growing? And how would you frame the downside risk to margins if enrollment declines and the risk pool deteriorates? And also I mean it looks like your relative pricing versus competitors is generally higher in 2017 than it was \u2013 than it is this year after the price hikes and market exits, at least on healthcare.gov. Do you think that provides you any buffer against adverse selection next year? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Well there's quite a few questions in there. Hopefully I can address all of them. But I think maybe the most simple is that we expect that overall Individual ACA compliant membership on a National basis will be slightly down next year. And that our membership will reflect that. We still have many, many competitors in our markets. I just do want to point out that some of the exits that have been very widely publicized, very few of them impact our market specifically. So like for instance, California still has 11 competitors, Virginia still has eight competitors, just to rattle off a couple of our states. In terms of the risk pool we believe that we understand the risk pool. We're very good at the Individual marketplace. We've been number one in Individual market carrier for years and years prior to the ACA. Our products are designed in such a way to really get a good risk pool that allows us to maximize on risk adjustors and then be a risk adjustor collector. So we feel good about our assumptions at this point in time. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: John, let me add that there are a few key points I think we really need to consider and keep in front. Number one, on average our price point for targeted bronze/silver plans in the marketplace is higher than our competitors. We certainly recognize that and acknowledge it. And while the number of competitors in our markets has declined overall versus 2016, for the most part those declines are in less populated areas, such as the rural market where we have had historically high market share. There's \u2013 on the flipside there's really still substantial competition across all of our markets, those served markets, most notably in these highly dense urban markets. And finally, some of the largest markets you'll not see any significant reduction in competition. For example, California still has 11 competitors, down one from last year. Virginia still has eight. Georgia still has five. So we know we're in highly competitive markets. And we believe we will compete very effectively. But again I think we very effectively managed the price points with respect to the products that we've offered in the marketplace. And so we have a fairly good outlook, as John commented earlier in his remarks, about our expected margins. And as I said then, follow on to that we'll be evaluating our situation in those markets \u2013 all of our markets through the beginning of the year to see how well we perform and how well the regulatory adjustments play out leading up to mid-year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Lance Wilkes from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Morning. Just wanted to follow-up on a question with respect to self-insurance margin strategy. Wanted to understand how the progress was going on specialty penetrations, looking at 2017? And what your 2018 and beyond strategies were there? How much upside you saw with respect to self-insurance margins. And then in particular right now with PBM, how does that fit into how you're looking at penetrations? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. Great question. And certainly that's one of our growth areas for the future, as we look out into our long-term outlook. We believe that the opportunity to enhance the EBITDA associated with our ASO members is meaningful. We are developing \u2013 we have ongoing efforts to drive penetration, specialty products, various ancillary-type products, other add-ons. We think that we are under penetrated right now and believe that we have incredible amount of upside. We've been the number one company in growing the ASO Large Group National membership over the last several years. And we've made quite a nice margin percentage on that business. But it's very small dollars. And so now the focus is to take the fact that we do have best in class discounts. And the most sophisticated purchasers of coverage are picking us. And so now it's our opportunity to really penetrate that better and enhance the EBITDA associated with that membership block. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. Just a couple more questions on the Individual business. First, just wanted to follow up. I know you had just said you're anticipating exchange enrollment to decline heading into 2017. I know you also thought that would be the case heading into 2016. So is just your rate positioning why you still believe that might play out in 2017 versus what happened this year? And then just secondly, could you just comment on any PDRs used in the Individual business this quarter? And your experience with the special enrollment period enrollment this year versus last year? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Sure, Gary, great question. And 2016 was interesting, because what we ended up seeing was a flight to safety. And that was one of the reasons that our 2016 Individual exchange membership grew more than expectations. And so if you go backwards a year, and then you look at the number of co-ops who were in our markets that failed, it was a significant impact on our membership. And then as those customers then went into the marketplace, they \u2013 as I said, it was a flight to safety. They went for Blue. I think the real key difference in the expectations in 2016 and the expectations in 2017 is really the amount of exits within our markets of carriers and who the exits were and how much membership those that exited had. So long story short, the co-ops in certain markets were \u2013 had extremely high market share. Then they went insolvent, and their market share of \u2013 when then (52:09) was absorbed. Where in 2017, while we certainly have some exits of carriers in our markets, they do not have the breadth or the magnitude of the market share that the ones who actually a year ago had. Associated with the premium deficiency reserves, we have none recorded. We had none recorded in 2015. We have none recorded in 2016. It's a very easy question, which means that our results are pure, our results are clean in that we don't have the puts and takes that maybe you have in some of the other companies that you're modeling. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Raskin from Barclays. Please go ahead. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, thanks. Question \u2013 a short term and a long term. Short term, I heard the commentary. I think, John, you said the results were very consistent with your expectations. And just looking at sort of the cadence of earnings, you saw some mid to high single digit growth in the first half, a big decline of double digit percentage on EPS in 3Q, and now an expected increase back in 4Q. And so I guess if that's all very expected, what changed this year from a seasonality perspective? And then on the long term, from a strategic perspective when you guys announced the Cigna deal \u2013 and I know we're going back a year and a half now \u2013 you talked about Cigna bringing commercial expertise and exposure to Medicare, the strong specialty, and then the international segment. And so I'm curious kind of where those priorities sit today? And in the case that the judge disagrees with you guys and the transaction does not move forward, how do you guys think about the reaction? Is there a need for scale? Is there an appetite to do other stuff? Thanks. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Sure. Thank you. I'll take the first question, then turn it over to Joe for the second. Yeah. I did say that our results were very consistent with expectations. When you're looking at the seasonality of 2015 to 2016, yeah, 2016 is a bit challenged. The MLR is a little bit higher in the fourth quarter than it was last year. There's a lot of variables associated with that. Clearly the Iowa variable, the Individual exchange variable. Please note that we do have the G&A offset that allows us to enjoy the growth in EPS year-over-year. But it's not that there was a significant change in seasonality patterns or a huge business flux, as much as it was some of the very specific items that we pointed out to as headwinds for 2016 continue to be headwinds throughout the fourth quarter. On the \u2013 I think Joe wants to address your Cigna question. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah, let me take that for a moment, Josh. First of all, to your point about, call it, pivoting in the event of an adverse decision. We're going to focus very heavily on what we talked about earlier regarding our tailwinds. Obviously, in the MA growth space a very strong focus on our Government business across the entire spectrum and a variety of other initiatives that I've already mentioned. I think it's really important to underscore that we'll be coming to you at the time of that announcement whenever, we will then share with you our outlook in terms of pivoting the company to tackle some of those opportunities, tailwinds, as well as quite frankly address the headwinds as robustly as we would anyway. But certainly we believe ameliorating some of that risk would be a great opportunity to us as well. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. I would just add to that that we believe that we have long-term sustainable growth opportunities regardless if the deal closes or not. Cigna may help accelerate those. But we're very confident about our future under either scenario. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yeah. Good morning, guys. John, I know you commented earlier about the dynamic of compliant versus noncompliant in the Small Group book. But it looks like in the Individual side, you still have about 20% of your membership that's noncompliant. Are most of those, the plans for the noncompliant individuals going to remain in force through or until December 2017? And then more of a macro question. Do you guys have a sense for how many grandmothered \u2013 how many people have grandmothered plans in your markets at this point? Thanks. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. No, great question. First of all, in the compliant versus noncompliant, the majority of those will not be noncompliant through 2017. So that the headwind/tailwind that I talked about with that, that would include both the Small Group and the Individual commentary. In terms of how many grandmothering are in our markets, including what our competitors have, we actually do not have the specificity of that. But obviously, all the dynamics that we're experiencing and the changes in the laws they're experiencing. So, there's really not a \u2013 if your question is, is there an opportunity to get someone else's grandmothered business, answer is really no. It would have to be \u2013 we would have to get it as part of an ACA compliant product. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning. First, just wanted to clarify the comments on the exchange again. Joe, you mentioned 2017 as a critical year. And if there was no clear evidence that you'd sort of modify your strategy in 2018. I mean does that mean market exit or willingness to exit if you're unprofitable again in 2017? And then also separately, was hoping you could parse out the pressure from Iowa? I know one of your peers took a PDR in that book, while you're absorbing the losses through the P&L. So just hoping to get a sense of margins and maybe magnitude of loss this year? And what the improvement would be next year even on sort of the inadequate rate bump? Thanks. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Great. Thanks. I will pivot the second part of the question to John, so he can get into some of the technical aspects of it. But with respect to the first question, let me just underscore that as I said a moment ago, we're going to be very surgical. And let me define market. For those that define market to be state. But I want to be very clear that we deal with a significant array of regions. So we will look at both regional impact as well as state impact, and then make determinations with respect to what I call the surgical assessments and then decisions and execution that are necessary in order for prudent engagement in that marketplace. I believe that probably covers what you were asking. Yeah. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Okay, yes. And then in terms of Iowa and the headwind for 2016, which becomes a tailwind for 2017 with the Medicaid block there. We did get a retroactive rate increase. Unfortunately, we think it's still not actuarially justified. We really are not providing an exact number at this point, as we continue to work with the state and don't want to get out ahead of the state and negotiate this publicly. But just as Joe said, consistent with the Individual exchange business, we need to partner with states that want to be partners. And we believe that we need actuarially justified rates. And if \u2013 we will continue to negotiate it. We feel very good about that fact. But if we don't get it, then we'll have a decision to make in Iowa as well. Operator : Thank you and our last question this morning will come from the line of Peter Costa. Please go ahead. Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a couple of clarifications on things you said. You said you'd put out an RFP for your PBM in early 2017. So presumably that means we'd see an answer sometime in mid-2017. What sort of things are you going to be looking for besides the $3 billion in savings that you already talked about? And then are you specifically coming off the $100 billion revenue target that you set out in 2014 for 2018? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Why don't I do the second one first, Peter, while I've got the line. In terms of the headwinds, tailwinds for 2018 in Joe's commentary, it's highly unlikely that we would be able to achieve that number at this point in time. Just look at our guidance for 2016 and roll that forward and roll our membership forward. It all boils down to the exchanges. And the CBO had estimated, what, 25 million, 26 million lives to be insured through the exchanges. When we did our 2018 plan, we relied on some of the CBO estimates as part of our estimation process. And we're still maintaining our market share. We still believe that we can hit the target margins that we had for those things. But when the entire country has just over 10 million versus that other, that's a significant delta. And that goes straight into our numbers. And I think you'll see that the revenue shortfall can be entirely explained with that dynamic. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah, let me pick it up now regarding the PBM question. Yes, that RFP goes to market early 2017. I've said repeatedly that our intention is to be able to deliver to you a solution with respect to ongoing analytics, which obviously in the current state is significantly impacted by our discussions and of course potential legal proceedings with ESI. We were hopeful to bring you a meaningful commentary and maybe solution by the end of 2017. We've never diverged from that commitment. And our hope is that we sort of will be able to put all the parts and pieces together to give you clarity in and around the decisions we're going to execute specific to the termination of the contract by 2019. Operator : Thank you. And please go ahead with any closing remarks. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Well again, thank you, everybody, for your questions. They're always very, very good. As a company, we do remain committed to tackling our healthcare system challenges head on, as evidenced by the work that we've communicated to you today. And we believe that we can and will deliver greater value to consumers by expanding access to high quality affordable healthcare. We've stood by that repeatedly. This is why we are committed to challenging the DOJ's recent decision to block Anthem's acquisition of Cigna in court. Speaking to my associates, I want to also thank all of them for their continued commitment to serving our nearly 40 million members every day. To all of you on the phone, please accept our thanks for your interest in Anthem. And we look forward to speaking with you soon at upcoming conferences. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. And, ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be made available for replay after 11 :00 a.m. today through November 16. You may access the AT&T executive replay system at any time by dialing 1-800-475-6701 and entering the access code 378818. International participants can dial 320-365-3844. Again the numbers are 1-800-475-6701 and 320-365-3844 with the access code 378818. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T executive teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Anthem Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later there will be a question-and-answer session; instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Douglas R. Simpson - Anthem, Inc.: Good morning and welcome to Anthem's fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. This is Doug Simpson, Vice President of Investor Relations. With us this morning are Joe Swedish, Chairman, President and CEO; and John Gallina, our CFO. Joe will provide an update on recent developments and our 2016 financial results; John will then discuss our business unit performance and other key financial metrics; and then Joe will discuss our 2017 outlook, and provide some incremental commentary on earnings expectations beyond 2017. We will then be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict, and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Joe. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you, Doug, and good morning. This morning, we announced fourth quarter 2016 GAAP earnings per share of $1.37 and adjusted earnings per share of $1.76, with membership and revenue tracking above our previous expectations. For the full-year 2016, GAAP earnings per share was $9.21, and adjusted earnings per share was $11, representing year-over-year growth of 8.3%. As we previously stated in an 8-K filed a few weeks ago, we increased our adjusted earnings per share outlook from $10.80 to $11, primarily driven by a retroactive change in the minimum MLR calculation under California's Medicaid expansion program. Before John and I discuss the details of our 2016 financials and our earnings outlook, I'd like to start by discussing our perspective on the changing political landscape. Anthem remains actively engaged in the policymaking process on behalf of our customers at both the Federal and state level. We believe the health insurance industry in general and Anthem in particular, is part of the solution in addressing the major issues of access, quality, and affordability. As we have said repeatedly, the individual market under ACA has not been working well, and changes are needed to ensure stability. We're hopeful that Congress and the administration are taking a measured approach to repairing the ACA that seeks a smooth transition to prevent health coverage disruptions for Americans whenever possible. Changes are needed to ensure both a stable and sustainable individual market and a smooth transition for consumers. Specifically, steps must be taken to address two key shortcomings in the current market \u2013 risk pool integrity and affordability. Suggested changes include : Repeal the health insurance tax and extend transitional or otherwise known as grandmother plans indefinitely to improve affordability; decrease the number of special enrollment periods, and requiring pre-verification of eligibility; address challenges with nonpayment of premium, grace periods, by requiring consumers to pay outstanding premiums before enrolling in new coverage with the same health plan; prohibit third-parties with financial interest from steering individuals to the individual market who are eligible for Medicare and/or Medicaid; maintain risk adjustment changes included in the 2018 Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters to balance incentives for both healthy and moderately unhealthy enrollees. While the direction in Washington has been positive, we still need certainty about short-term fixes in order to determine the extent of our participation in the individual market in 2018. And we will be watching developments closely in the first half of 2017 as we evaluate our longer-term strategy for the health insurance exchanges. Now, to discuss consolidated financials, we reported this morning. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.76 was ahead of our previous expectations, with membership and revenue tracking well. Within membership, both fully-insured and self-funded enrollment came in ahead of expectations, as we ended the fourth quarter with over 39.9 million members. For the full-year 2016, this represents total membership growth of over 1.3 million members, or 3.4%. Specifically, insured enrollment was ahead of our previous expectations as our Commercial group insured and Medicaid enrollment grew more than expected during the quarter. We currently serve over 6.5 million Medicaid members, representing growth of 613,000, or a 10.4% increase in just 2016 alone. As expected, individual enrollment declined by 93,000, and we ended the fourth quarter with just over 1.3 million individual ACA-compliant lives, 839,000 of which came from the individual exchanges. Our membership results in 2016 translated into better than expected operating revenues of $84.2 billion, an increase of $5.8 billion, or 7.4%, versus the full-year 2015. The increase reflects the strong enrollment growth in the Government Business and additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends. Additionally, administrative fee revenue grew by 6.5% versus 2015, as the result of our self-funded membership trends. These increases were partially offset by fully-insured membership losses in our Commercial Business during the year. The full-year 2016 benefit ratio was 84.8%, which was better than our previous expectations, primarily reflecting the impact of the retroactive change to the minimum MLR calculation, under California's Medicaid expansion program. Our ratio reflected a 150-basis-point increase versus the 83.3% we reported in 2015, primarily driven by higher than initially expected medical cost in the Medicaid business, notably, in Iowa. In addition, our strong membership growth contributed to the higher benefit expense ratio as the Medicaid business carries a higher ratio than the consolidated company average. Further, the benefit expense ratio reflects the impact of higher than initially expected medical cost experience in the Individual business. These increases are partially offset by lower medical cost experienced in the Medicare business. During the quarter, cost trends overall were in line with what we had expected on the third quarter earnings call, which reflects the impact of our medical management strategies. Our 2016 Local Group insured medical cost trend came in at the low-end of our previously guided range of 7% to 7.5%. Our 2016 SG&A expense ratio of 14.9% was slightly higher than previously expected, but still declined by 110 basis points versus the 16% reported in 2015. The decrease versus 2015 was primarily driven by an intentional focus on administrative expense control, coupled with better than expected enrollment trends, as well as the changing mix of our membership towards the Government Business, which carries a lower than consolidated average SG&A ratio. During the quarter, our administrative costs were slightly higher than what we had expected, as our previous guidance did not include costs that have been excluded from adjusted earnings per share. Additionally, the company incurred higher-than-expected incentive compensation expense, as well as additional severance expenses to support ongoing efficiency initiatives. I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss our business unit performance and other key financial metrics. John? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Thanks, Joe. In the Government Business, we added an additional 109,000 members during the quarter, bringing the total 2016 enrollment increase to 614,000 members, representing 6.9% versus year-end 2015. The enrollment growth and pricing increases translate into 2016 Government Business operating revenue of $45.5 billion, a growth of 11.4% versus 2015. Operating margins for the Government Business was 3.9% in 2016, a decline of 90 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by lower gross margins in the Medicaid business. As we communicated previously, we expected Medicaid margins to compress from 2015 levels due to rate actions impacting 2016. In addition, we experienced higher-than-expected claims across Medicaid business in the current year, including materially higher-than-expected cost in the recently implemented Iowa contract. Operating margins in the fourth quarter of 4.5% were higher than expected due to the retroactive change in the minimum MLR calculation under California's Medicaid expansion business we discussed earlier. Importantly, core medical cost trends during the quarter were relatively in line with our most recent expectations. The pipeline of opportunity for our Medicaid business remains substantial, with approximately three-fourths of the pipeline in new and specialized services, and the remainder in traditional Medicaid services. We continue to believe our Medicaid asset and geographic footprint is very well positioned to capitalize on these growth opportunities over the next five years, as we continuously demonstrate that we are part of the solution to addressing the challenges of rising healthcare cost for our state partners' constituents while improving quality. Within Medicare, we are pleased with the progress the team continues to make, as our 2016 margins reflected improvement versus 2015. The improvement is a direct result of investments made in our Medicare business over the past three years. We have now positioned our portfolio to grow MA in 2017, which we will discuss in more detail when we turn to our 2017 outlook. Switching to our Commercial business, our enrollment came in better than expected, growing by over 700,000 members during 2016 to 30.4 million members, representing growth of 2.4%. This growth translated into better-than-expected operating revenue of $38.7 billion during the year, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 3%, compared to 2015. Our 2016 operating margin of 8.3% compared to 7.6% in 2015, an improvement of 70 basis points. Commercial operating margins during the year reflected a lower SG&A ratio due to lower administrative cost resulting from expense efficiency initiatives, as well as fixed cost leveraging on a growing membership base. In addition, operating margins benefited from membership growth and our self-funded product offerings, which carry a higher-than-average operating margin. These increases were offset by operating margin losses in our individual ACA-compliant business, driven by higher-than-expected medical cost experience, as we have discussed previously. Within our ACA-compliant plans, our performance during the fourth quarter was generally in line with previous expectations. We continue to experience higher-than-expected costs from members with chronic conditions. Next, I'd like to discuss the balance sheet. Consistent with our past practice, we have included a roll forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. For the full-year 2016, we experienced favorable prior-year reserve development of $850 million, which was moderately better than our expectations. Our reserves continue to include a provision for adverse deviation in the mid to high-single digits, and we believe our reserve balances remain consistent and strong as of December 31, 2016. Our days in claims payable was 41.3 days as of the end of the year, an increase of 0.7 days from the 40.6 days we reported last quarter. Our debt to cap ratio was 38.5% as of December 31, lower by 20 basis points from the 38.7% at the end of the third quarter, which reflects the impact of an increase in shareholders' equity as we did not repurchase any stocks during the quarter. We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $1.4 billion of cash and investments at the parent company, which was impacted by the timing of changes in intercompany funding arrangements, and the settlement of intercompany receivables. Adjusted for the timing impact of these changes, cash and investments at the parent company would have totaled approximately $3.3 billion, as of December 31, 2016. Our investment portfolio was in unrealized gain position of approximately $568 million as of the end of the quarter. For the 3Rs, we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate and we continue to reflect a net receivable position for risk adjustors. As we have consistently done since 2014, we have continued our conservative posture of recording a 100% valuation allowance against any unpaid receivables for the 2014, 2015, and 2016 benefit years for risk corridors. Our reported earnings have never benefited from the amounts we are due under the U.S. corridor program. Now, moving on to cash flow. For the full-year 2016, we reported operating cash flow of approximately $3.2 billion, or 1.3 times net income, which was stronger than expected and reflects the quality of our earnings. Cash flow in the quarter totaled $275 million. As a reminder, our third quarter operating cash flow included the favorable timing of an extra CMS payment, which had an offsetting impact in our fourth quarter operating cash flow. We also used $171 million during the quarter for our cash dividend. With that, I will turn the call back over to Joe to discuss our 2017 outlook, and provide some incremental commentary on earnings expectations beyond 2017. Joe? Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Thanks, John. Before we begin, and it's important to note that this commentary about the 2017 outlook details reflects Anthem on a standalone basis. We expect operating revenues to grow to a range of $86.5 billion to $87.5 billion in 2017, reflecting growth in higher revenue PMPM insured membership in the Government Business and premium rate increases to cover overall medical cost trends. In total, we expect our enrollment to increase by about 200,000 to 400,000 in 2017. Specifically in Commercial, we expect membership to increase by a little less than 150,000 members. Our self-funded enrollment is expected to increase by approximately 350,000 lives in 2017, with positive momentum in securing new contract wins and maintaining retention rates in the large group segment, along with expected growth in BlueCard enrollment. While we expect another growth year in ASO, our Commercial fully-insured enrollment will be pressured. We expect membership declines in our Individual business as individual non-ACA compliant membership will continue to decrease. We were encouraged that the early indicators of the open-enrollment activity are ahead of these expectations with a demographic mix that is consistent with our expectations. At this time, however, we do not yet have visibility on the makeup of our renewal membership or the health of the overall risk pool. Our outlook continues to expect our individual ACA-compliant plans to be breakeven to slightly profitable in 2017. We expect Local Group fully-insured membership losses of approximately 100,000 as members continue to transition into self-funded product offerings, albeit at a slower rate than recent years and the impact of membership declines as Small Group plans migrate into ACA-compliant products. For Government, we expect another year of growth, with membership expected to increase by more than 150,000. We expect Medicaid to add more than 100,000 lives, reflecting organic growth of new contracts implemented during 2016 and growth of existing contracts. During the year, we expect to be active participants in various RFPs as we continue to see states gravitate towards managed care to be the solution to manage the health and cost of their complex populations in services such as : Long Term Services and Support, Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, and Aged, Blind and Disabled (sic) [Aged, Blind, or Disabled] (20:20). Within our Medicare business, we are pleased to expect growth of approximately 75,000 members, primarily in our Medicare Advantage product offerings. This represents faster than market average growth of 6% to 9%, as we have been able to capitalize on the opportunities through an increasing number of 4-star plans. Turning to the financial metrics, the one-year waiver in the health insurer fee in 2017 impacts all of our major financial metrics, such that comparisons to 2016 on a reported basis will be distorted. We expect a 2017 consolidated MLR midpoint of 87%, an increase of 220 basis points versus 2016, largely reflecting the impact of the waiver in the health insurer fee. Aside from the fee impact, our outlook reflects the migration of members on to ACA-compliant plans in the Small Group and Individual businesses, which carry a higher loss ratio. Offsetting the migration impact is an expected improvement in the individual ACA-compliant MLR, as the price increases we've put forward during 2016 are expected to improve the overall profitability of that book of business, to be relatively breakeven to slightly profitable next year. Finally, in our Government Business, we expect the medical loss ratio to be higher as we expect continued gross margin pressure in the Medicaid business, primarily driven by rate actions within the Medicaid expansion population, partially offset by improvement in the Iowa Medicaid contract financial performance. In 2017, we expect Local Group insured medical cost trends to be generally consistent with 2016 with the exception of Hepatitis C cost. Treatment costs are not expected to increase in 2017 like they did in 2016, which was driven by a change in our coverage policy at the end of 2015. As a result, we expect Local Group insured medical cost trends to be in the range of 6.5% to 7%. We expect our SG&A ratio in 2017 to be 13.3% at the midpoint, a decrease of 160 basis points from the 14.9% in 2016. The decrease largely reflects the impact of the one-year waiver in the health insurer fee and the impact of Cigna transaction costs during 2016 that are not part of the 2017 outlook. To a lesser extent, our SG&A expense ratio is impacted by continued strong administrative expense control and the impact of fixed cost leveraging, while we grow membership and revenue, all of which, more than offset the return of one-time expense reductions made during 2016. Below the line, we expect investment income of approximately $740 million and interest expense of approximately $660 million. Note that our interest expense projection does not include the cost we expect to incur related to the bridge loan financing we have in place for the pending Cigna transaction. We also currently expect our tax rate to be in the range of 33% to 35% for the year, an improvement versus 2016, which is also driven by the waiver of the fee. Operating cash flow is expected to increase to a more normal level in 2017, as the impact from the receipt of the final reinsurance payment in our individual ACA-compliant plans will be roughly offset by Medicaid rebate payments back to certain state partners. For the full year, we expect operating cash flow to be greater than $3.5 billion. We expect some benefit from the impact of capital deployment activities, with the majority of the benefit recognized in the second half of the year. Our outlook assumes we resume share buyback activity during the second quarter of 2017 at a previously normal level of $1.5 billion to $2 billion during the year. As a result, we currently expect our average share count for the year to be in the range of 262 million to 266 million shares. To conclude, our 2017 GAAP earnings per share estimate is greater than $11.11. Our adjusted earnings per share outlook is greater than $11.50. The difference between these two estimates is the exclusion of the amortization of deal-related intangibles. It is important to note that our 2017 outlook does not include any benefits related to improved pharmaceutical pricing, which we believe we are entitled to under our current contract with ESI. It also does not include any potential assessments related to Penn Treaty, which we would be required to accrue when the judge give us a liquidation order. Current estimates for our portion of the overall assessment is in the range of $190 million to $220 million, which we would exclude from adjusted EPS, if incurred. Looking longer-term, beyond 2017, we're targeting an improvement in earnings growth rates towards the upper-single to lower-double digit range, driven by growth in our Government and Commercial Businesses, coupled with effective use of capital deployment. Within Government, we are confident that our business will be able to capitalize on the opportunities to increase enrollment. As we previously discussed, our best-in-class Medicaid asset is very well-positioned to capture its fair share of the significant pipeline of opportunity. Our reconstructed Medicare asset is now well-positioned to meaningfully grow membership with operating margins in our targeted range going forward. We expect our growth rates to exceed market average over the next few years as we continue to increase the percentage of members in 4-star plans. Switching to Commercial, we expect to continue our strong track record of growing self-funded enrollment, and we're working to improve the recent trends in our Commercial fully-insured enrollment. We have reviewed our competitive position in our markets and we've identified various growth opportunities. For example, we're focused on driving improved penetration rates of specialty offerings to raise the earnings contribution from self-funded membership. While we have improved the penetration of certain products, like dental, in recent years, we know that we're not capturing the full wallet share potential of certain self-funded customers, as we are meaningfully underpenetrated in the cross-selling of our specialty integrated healthcare management and stop-loss product offerings. In recent years, we have managed through a meaningful headwind as employer groups migrated from a fully-insured product into a self-funded product at a lower earnings contribution per member. We're focused on driving improved penetration rates to help narrow the earnings contribution differential between these two funding types. In addition, we're also focused on optimizing our products and networks to improve our Local Group fully-insured trends. Across both business units, we expect to remain disciplined with our administrative expenses. By appropriately prioritizing investments, we believe we will capitalize on these growth opportunities while optimizing our cost structure. We also expect to be a diligent and effective steward of shareholder capital to improve our growth potential. Our balance sheet is strong, and we will be opportunistic in both M&A and share buyback activity. Lastly, there is a significant and growing opportunity to improve our competitive position and financial earnings potential with a new and improved pharmacy contract. We are pleased that we've been able to grow membership in spite of paying above-market rates to our PBM vendor. Getting this issue resolved will solidify our leading market position. As we've committed, we expect to finalize our scenario planning and inform the market by the end of 2017 about our long-term pharmacy strategy, while the litigation with our current vendor continues. With that, operator, please open the queue for questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. Thanks. That's helpful, the long-term commentary. I guess maybe just following up on that. One clarification, first, and then a question on it. I think you said, high-single digit, low-double digit earnings growth. Did you mean EPS growth, not earnings growth? And then, the question \u2013 the other question would be, when you look at the three products, Medicaid, Medicare, and Commercial, where are you versus that long-term target margin in each product? Do you see pressure in any of them? Do you see margin opportunity on any of them? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah, thank you, Kevin. In terms of the high-single digit, low-double digit, that was on an EPS basis, so that would include a little bit of capital deployment associated with that on a long-term basis. Associated with the second part of your question, the Medicare, we've done extremely well over the past few years trying to get that platform fixed and get it corrected. And we're very close to target margins in that block of business right now, albeit at a lower membership level than we would like to have on a long-term basis. We think that there is some significant opportunities for growing the top-line and maintaining those target margins. On the Medicaid, it's a mixed bag. The Medicaid expansion, we've done extraordinarily well, and we've actually been earning above target margins. And that's one of the headwinds we have going into 2017, is the pricing associated with the Medicaid expansion book of business coming back down into target margin levels. And then on the Commercial, we think there's a lot of opportunities associated with wallet share, doing a better job of penetrating our large group ASO block of business, as well as trying to retain and maintain our ACA-compliant and non-ACA compliant Small Group books of business. So it's not a simple question, but we think we're very well positioned for growth, but we're doing pretty well right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Barclays. Please go ahead. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. First, just a clarification, if you could quantify the impact of the HIF holiday on the MLR at the G&A and the revenues? And then, my second question is just the buybacks, or I guess the share count coming down 2 million to 6 million shares seems relatively conservative in light of the $3.3 million of parent cash, not to mention the $3.5 billion that you'll generate over the year. And I understand your plan is to start in 2Q. But I think, Joe, you said you'd resume sort of normal share repurchase activities, and I guess I'm just curious why you wouldn't resume a more aggressive stance, in light of the pause you've taken over the last two years? Is there pending M&As? Is there something else that you want to provide that additional flexibility? Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Josh, good morning. Thanks for the question. Let me answer the second question, maybe John can pick up the first question and get into some detail, but I think I also underscored the use of the word opportunistic. I think your point is a good one in terms of the commentary, which is, we are certainly going to target a certain level, but I believe, if we see the opportunity present itself, we may become \u2013 use the word more aggressive, so I wouldn't rule it out. But, again, being opportunistic is critical. And then to your point, that certainly gives us powder with respect to other opportunities in and around M&A and investments and other capital deployment arenas, that would pursue certain growth opportunities for the company that we think would be very vital to our success going forward. John? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah, sure, thank you, Joe. And then, Josh, on the other question on the HIF holiday, as we had indicated in our prepared comments, that makes many of our metrics non-comparable on a reported basis year over year. I would look at it this way, in 2016, the amount of health insurer fee that Anthem is going to be required to pay, and is expensed, is approximately $1.2 billion. And we've had a very cognizant approach to try to ensure that our pricing associated with that maintained a constant EPS number. So we're pricing for the fee, the tax gross-up, and the non-deductibility of that again and again, so you can sort of then calculate the impacts. Once you go through that, you'll see that the MLR ratio, year over year, it is going up nominally, really not much at all. The single biggest driver by far is the fee. The G&A ratio is coming down a bit, but the single biggest driver of it coming down \u2013 the magnitude's coming down, is the fee. And then you also have to realize that in the competitive environment that we work in, occasionally there can be some fungibility associated with the pricing and how much it's fee versus other things. As well as that in the Medicare Advantage area that we've taken the waiver of the fee and we've baked it into product design and benefits to the customer so that the members actually enjoy that. So a lot of moving parts, but the vast majority of our reported movement is the fee. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah, thanks, good morning. The first question was, can you just quantify the magnitude of your loss on Iowa in 2016 and where your margins ended up? And then, what is your rate increase that you are expecting, and will it be in Jan or in July? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah, Ana, thank you for the inquiry. In terms of \u2013 I'll answer the second part first. The renewal was due on July 1, and that's when we would expect to obtain actuarially justified rates associated with Iowa. We are still negotiating with the State of Iowa in terms of the rates. So it's premature to provide a specific point estimate or data element on that, other than to say that we're requesting actuarially justified rates. In terms of 2016, as we had stated, I think in the second quarter call that the expense \u2013 the medical loss ratio is a good 20 percentage points higher than we expected. It did come down a bit over the rest of the year, in some of our medical management initiatives and some of our other cost of care initiatives went into place, but it still ended up at a loss in the 10 to 15 percentage points higher than we would have expected, based on that block of business. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: I might underscore \u2013 to add on to John's commentary, we continue to be in dialogue with the Governor's Office. As you may know, there has been a transition or there is a transition now in process regarding the appointment of a new governor. The Lieutenant Governor is moving into the office and we're in dialogue with her office, and we're hopeful that that continued dialogue in and around the needs that we have for \u2013 I guess, call it correcting the inadequacy will produce results. But, again, we will not know that for still some period of time. But, again, we remain hopeful that the dialogue will produce intended results. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold from Cowen. Please go ahead. Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company LLC : Hi there, you mentioned that some of your individual enrollments was coming in higher than expected. Where do you think you're landing as of now? I know open enrollment just ended last night. But, where do you think your individual enrollment wound up entering this year? And if this turns out to be another year of losses, without some meaningful legislation \u2013 I know we're hopeful that there will be meaningful legislation and administrative action, will you exit for 2018? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yes. So Christine, let me answer your question on enrollment, and then I know Joe has some commentary on the second part of your question. In terms of the enrollment, even though open enrollment ended last night, that only provides us one portion of the equation, and that's the applications, and we monitor that very closely. Applications are a little bit stronger, a little bit better than we expected. Not dramatically, but a little bit stronger. And as we look at the demographics associated with those applications, whether it's age and income distribution, subsidy eligibility, metal levels, various things like that, we're very comfortable with the overall amount of applications as compared to what we planned for. What we do not know and what no one knows at this point is how the renewals work and what percent of renewals that you'll retain versus who jumps to another plan versus who goes somewhere else. And so that's really premature to give an exact membership number because it's really unknown. But I will say the applications were a little bit stronger than we had anticipated. Joe? Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah, thank you. Christine, let me deal with our outlook with respect to how we might further engage in the market or retract. As I said in third quarter earnings call, that we are very carefully evaluating how the marketplace will evolve related to the legislative and regulatory changes that may be enacted as certain regulators and legislators seek stabilization of the marketplace. We have weighed in considerably and continue to do so with all the leadership in Congress, and I can tell you that we have some very specific asks, and I commented on those asks in my remarks. But also there are probably about four or five other expectations. And what all that maps to is a set of expectations that we will be monitoring very carefully to see if they are implemented, such that as we approach the end of the first half of this year, we will have to make decisions, as I said, on the last earnings call, whether or not we surgically extract ourselves from certain rating regions, or quite frankly even on a larger scale, depending on the stability of the marketplace. We believe that this year, we have a \u2013 I'd call it maybe a fairly modest outlook in terms of being able to pursue or accomplish a profitability that would be \u2013 would recognize stability, because of the price increases that we achieved for this year's entry into the marketplace. But if we can't see stability going into 2018 with respect to either pricing, product, or the overall rules of engagement, then we will begin making some very conscious decisions with respect to extracting ourselves. We will have more to say by our Q2 call. I think it's fair to say that we still are in a state of evaluation, but I think I wanted to share with you that we are very mindful, very vigilant, and we will make the right decisions to protect the business with respect to moving into the next year. Conversely, as I said, I believe, and we do have some positive indicators that stabilization could very likely occur, and given the advocacy that's occurring on behalf of the industry, and I'm again, hopeful that our recommendations will be looked at very carefully, and adopted. But, again, it remains to be seen, and we'll say more as we end up our Q2 call, so. Thank you, Christine, for that question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Austin T. Quackenbush - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hi, this is actually Austin on for Sarah. Can you go into a little more detail on the California minimum MLR retroactive change? Is there any offsets under the legal settlement and that offered margin targets for California Medicaid? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah, sure, thank you, Austin. The California Medicaid retroactive adjustment \u2013 the medical loss ratio calculation, just for a little bit of clarifications, had to do with how taxes are treated and getting the definition within the California Medicaid arena to more closely align with the definition that already existed as part of the ACA MLR rebate calculation. In terms of \u2013 that was the primary driver of us going from $10.80 to $11 for 2016. We were already in an MLR rebate position in California when this occurred. And so what had happened was once we re-performed the calculation under the corrected rules, under the corrected definition, it allowed us to reduce the amount of liability we had on the books associated with the MLR rebate. So there is no offset or \u2013 it's just a \u2013 we perform the calculation, we'll settle the MLR rebate with the state in 2017, as was previously prescribed and it allowed us to be the primary driver of adding $0.20 per share to the shareholders here at the end of 2016. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe a question and then point of clarification. Didn't really comment too much on the Cigna deal, and you probably can't. But I'm just looking for clarification, the extension of the agreement, is that something that you can unilaterally ask for? Or does Cigna have to sign off on that? And then I thought the judge had indicated in the case that we would probably hear something by the end of January. Obviously that has passed. Has there been any communication as to either why the delay or the updated timing? And then I'll just ask my point of clarification. On your comment about Local Group medical cost trend, you are expecting it to be down, you referenced this Hep C change. Is that the only thing that's different, otherwise your medical cost trend would be the same expectation this year versus 2016? And is that related to Express in any way or is that strictly something you guys did unilaterally? Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. A.J., again, good morning. Thanks for the question. Regarding the Cigna deal and the extension, that is a unilateral determination decision on our part, and obviously we've already expressed our exercise of that position, with respect to a filing recently. So we are moving forward. And with respect to the judge, it's certainly not uncommon and we're not bothered by the length of time, because it is a very complicated case, lot of moving parts, and the submittals were very extensive. So certainly \u2013 again, we're not bothered by it. Obviously, we certainly would like a decision soon so we can move on. And obviously we're still hopeful too. But, again, I think give the judge her due in terms of the thoughtful process she has to go through. We're very confident that we should be getting a decision very soon. You may recall, she did say somewhere in the end of the month timeframe, and I think it's come upon us, so we'll see when it happens. Hopefully in the coming days. John? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah, thank you, Joe. And A.J., your specific question on trend, so just to clarify, trend for 2016 came in relatively in line with our expectations. Felt very, very good about that, maybe closer to the low-end of the range that we provided at the beginning of 2016. And then, as we look into 2017 in general, trend is relatively stable year over year, except for the one item that you pointed out, and that was the Hepatitis C drug spend. So that has nothing to do with Express Scripts. In 2015, we changed the coverage options and allowed a broader coverage of people that qualified for Hep C treatment. We proactively went out at that point in time and did some rebate contracting and various other things that really mitigated the significant increase that we saw in 2016. The increases would have been even greater without the proactive steps we took. Now, we believe that the cost structure associated with that, the utilization associated with that is going to stay flat from 2016 to 2017. It's just that by staying flat from 2016 to 2017, it means we did not have the increase that we saw from 2015 to 2016, so it's impacting our overall trend calculations. So at the end of the day, trend is really stable year over year. We just have the mathematical dynamic of what's going on with Hepatitis C. But thank you for the question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Just had one clarification and one question. So first, the follow-up is can you give us the precise number of ACA individual compliant and non-compliant individual members assumed in the overall 2017 membership guidance? And then can you give us some more color on the PBM? Specifically, is the RFP already out in the market yet? And then you said you would have a decision by the end of the year. Would that include sharing with us the expected drug cost savings estimates and the expected economic impact to the business when the new deal starts? Thanks. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah, hey, Justin. In terms of the individual ACA compliant, just to give you a frame of reference, it's about 80%. Just a tiny bit over 80% is ACA compliant in our plan, which means that approaching 20% is non-compliant. So yeah. And then in terms of the \u2013 in terms of the \u2013 what was the question? Could you repeat the question on the PBM? Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Sure. Is the RFP out in the market yet? And then you said you'd have a decision by the end of the year. Would that include sharing with us drug cost savings estimates and the expected economic impact to the business when the new deal starts, relative to what you said before? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah, no, thank you. Yeah, so the RFP is not yet out, although it's imminent. And as we have stated previously, we expect to go through and then be very thoughtful in our approach, and by the fourth quarter of 2017, provide more clarity to all of you associated with our future pharmacy strategy. At that point in time, we would expect to provide some quantification and clarification associated with what the economics are, which could be as a 2020 type upside at that point in time. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: But still, the base that we're building off of in terms of what we've communicated many times is $3 billion savings per year, obviously escalated over time. So I think we'll certainly be able to give you some line of sight regarding $3 billion as a base, and then how that might improve leading up to 2020. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. How much of that is passed back through the customer and provides affordability aspects, versus how much is retained by the shareholders. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, good morning. Just wanted to clarify first. On the long-term guidance, is it fair to sort of back away from that $14 EPS number at this point, just kind of considering the guide for 2017 and your growth targets that you laid out? And then my question was more around sort of the components of trend guidance. If you could maybe break those down for us, and maybe put it in the context of \u2013 look, I certainly understand that trend came in at the lower end of the 7% to 7.5% range, and even if Hep C was sort of at 50 bps, it doesn't suggest sort of the typical cushion of, say, that expectation of potential trend uptick in that 50 bps to 100 bps range. So if you could maybe reconcile for that as well? Thanks. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah, sure, Ralph, thank you. So in terms of the $14, we've talked about some of the headwinds that we're facing on the third quarter call, and those headwinds are still very real, and we continue to work through them. Commercial insured mix was a headwind. The most significant of which was the ACA exchanges, the fact that there was supposed to be 26 million people enrolled in the exchanges by 2018, and we're at far, far short of half of that from a basis within the country, and what the impact is on us. But clearly, we're keeping our foot on the gas. We're trying to do everything possible in order to bridge the gap. But we wanted to ensure that everyone realized, back 90 days ago, that these headwinds were significant and we may not be able to completely overcome them. But we've got a lot of things going on that are going very, very, very well. Medicaid is ahead. We talked about Medicare, given the great growth we have with that. And all of this is without the PBM having any real upside in the $3 billion we talked about. So, we have not declared specifics on 2018 yet. Little premature to do that, but the headwinds are still very real. But we are working very hard to overcome as many of them as we possibly can. And then on your trend question, just say that we really don't go into specific trend information associated with each type of procedure, each type of process. But, as I said, the overall trend is relatively consistent year over year, except for the Hep C movement, in terms of how that's impacting it. So you can \u2013 now you can assume that that trend is normally unit price driven, that's the most significant driver of it on a year-over-year basis. Our utilization, we track that very closely, that remains pretty much in line with our expectations. In our medical management, our provider collaboration, those various other things have done a really nice job of keeping the utilization patterns fairly constant and fairly low movement year over year. So it's predominantly price. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes, hi, good morning. Let me ask about the Medicare Advantage and drug plan advance notice. Are there particular elements or factors that you'll be looking for when that notice comes out? And just, by the way, I'm curious on timing, whether you expect that will be today or tomorrow? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Well, how about if I say we expect it to be this week? Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: It's with anything else, yeah, we certainly do expect it to be imminent and if it came out either today or tomorrow, neither of those would be a surprise. But, I mean, as you know with all those things, the devil is always in the details. I mean, we really need to evaluate it, need to understand how it impacts various aspects of our business and various aspects of our membership. We've got a \u2013 we're cautiously optimistic. Like I said before, our Medicaid \u2013 or, I'm sorry, our Medicare asset is a reconstructed asset, really poised for growth. And we feel very, very good about where we're going to be as a company in the Medicare and Medicare Advantage area specifically, over the next several years. So, tomorrow is just one piece of the puzzle. But until we actually see the details, it's a little premature to declare anything. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question on SG&A. I think early in the year, you had talked about, not only the administrative efficiency savings, but also kind of Pay for Performance in environment and insinuated some comp cost cuts. And I think that that comp side of it was about half. I guess I'm curious now, at the end of the year, how that progressed, kind of the balance of sustainable cost cuts through admin efficiency versus comp that you need to reinstate? And then, the final part of this would be, how do you think the SG&A base is positioned or structured to support either of your kind of bigger outcomes \u2013 the deal closing with Cigna or your intent around perhaps some alternative strategy on the PBM? Thanks. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Dave. Let me respond to the comp question and underscore that what we referenced during the year is that our annual incentive plan is at risk \u2013 fully at risk \u2013 and we made a conscious decision, in terms of the modeling, that our award scheme would be based on, obviously, successful achievement of our expectations. And that we also balanced the payouts related to our support of the shareholder interest. And therefore, if we did not achieve expectations, then of course, our incentive plan would be cut accordingly, which, mid-year, we signaled that we were very intentional about that, and in fact, as the year progressed, we're able to witness because of the all-in commitments of management, that we were significantly improving our SG&A performance. There were other uptakes in the business model, and at the end of the year, we were able to provide advanced annual incentive plan payouts, above and beyond what was forecasted in the middle of the year. The point being that it's incentive-based, it is truly at risk, comp as a base wasn't affected, but again, I'm very proud of the fact that we were able to effectively control SG&A as well as bring in other advantages and performance improvements to the company that allowed us to significantly award our leadership teams with the incentive payments necessary for recognition. So all-in, we're very proud of how we managed it, and then the outcome is the result of the management process of our annual incentive plan model. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: And Dave, just to give you maybe a little more specificity associated with your question, on the back of Joe's response. The fourth quarter SG&A ratio is a little bit higher than what we had initially stated. But when you take a step back and look at the entire year, it's still about half of the savings or half of the decrease from the initial SG&A guidance back at the beginning of 2016 is non-recurring, and maybe half is operational efficiencies along with fixed cost leveraging. So even though we did increase the amount of compensation expense here in the fourth quarter, we're still below target on that. And so it still is a headwind as we get into 2017. Associated with the operational efficiencies, I mean, there has been a lot of very successful projects that have been done here over the past few years. Our higher accuracy of auto adjudication rates of claims continue to go up year over year. Our claims cycle time decreased. Those are things that actually improve the accuracy of our claims payment process, and we do it in a more cost effective and cost efficient manner, just as two examples of things where part of the savings in 2016 are recurring, and will be part of our run rate for 2017. So it's a bit of a mixed bag, but as Joe said, we're very proud of how we finished 2016, and think we're heading into 2017 with some nice momentum. Operator : And your final question today comes from the line of Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, sliding in here at the end. Like everyone else, I have one actual clarification and then a question. Just want to clarify, John, I thought you said on the 3R risk adjustment, you continue to run a net receivable position as you had consistently. And I thought you ended 2015 in a net payable position, CMS actually paid you and that's what created a year-to-year pickup. Did I not hear that correctly? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: We've been in a net receivable position consistently for a while. We were maybe a slight payer back in 2014, but we've been in a net receiver position most of the time since then. So hopefully that clarifies it. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then my question just on tax rate. So without the HIF returning to comp a normal tax rate in 2017, 33% to 35%. I think consensus was closer to 38%. So we just didn't do a good job of modeling that, because it looks pretty consistent with where you were running pre-ACA. The question is that number, even pre-ACA, was 200 to 300 basis points lower than kind of the other big five. Can you just remind us why your recurring tax rate runs a couple of hundred basis points lower, at least, than others? Is there one sort of obvious item to point to? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: It's not one significant obvious item. There is many, many things that are part of the effective tax rate. You really have to look at the states, and where companies make money, and what is the state tax situation \u2013 is it a premium tax state? Is it an income tax state? What is the income tax? Is it a franchise tax state? So all those things are clearly part of the variation. The investment portfolio, what percent of an investment portfolio is in tax exempt versus taxable yields? And how does that impact it? I mean, there is any fair share of permanent tax differences that occur. We're pretty comfortable with a lot of the tax planning strategies we've made. We all do start with the 35% rate on a pre-ACA, non-HIF type basis. And I'm not positive I know all of the differences between our rate and everybody else's, other than to say that we see this as a huge focus item, that every time that we can do a tax planning strategy, that just ignores the benefit to the shareholders. And so we put a lot of time and effort and focus on taxes behind the scenes that nobody really sees, and I think our effective tax rate helps confirm that. Thank you, Gary.

Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Anthem First Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Douglas R. Simpson - Anthem, Inc.: Good morning and welcome to Anthem's first quarter 2017 earnings call. This is Doug Simpson of Investor Relations. With us this morning are Joe Swedish, Chairman, President and CEO; and John Gallina, our CFO. Joe will provide some high level commentary in our first quarter financial results, discuss our business unit performance, and then provide some high-level commentary on our updated 2017 financial outlook. John will then discuss our key financial metric performance during the quarter and provide some additional details on our updated 2017 outlook, before turning the call back over to Joe to discuss the pending Cigna acquisition, and the long-term PBM solution development process. We will then be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at www.antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict, and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in today's press release, and in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Joe. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you, Doug, and good morning. We're pleased to announce strong first quarter 2017 GAAP earnings per share of $3.73, and adjusted earnings per share of $4.68, which is ahead of our expectations with membership and revenue tracking well. It was a great quarter, and John and I look forward to discussing it with you. I'm also going to offer my perspectives on the dynamic political landscape, the premium rate calculation process we will use to file preliminary rate filings in the individual ACA-compliant business, provide you an update of the pending Cigna acquisition, and provide an update on our PBM strategy. Our first quarter results reflect business performance that track well versus our expectations. Specifically, membership grew more than expected, and we reported strong quality earnings metrics, while maintaining appropriate conservatism on our balance sheet to reflect the dynamic nature of the marketplace that exists today. The company grew enrollment by 715,000 during the quarter. Insured enrollment grew by 330,000 in the quarter, driven by growth in all of our major lines of businesses. As an example of the value proposition we are bringing to the market, our Local Group fully-insured enrollment grew by approximately 50,000 lives during the quarter, well ahead of expectations and in a line of business that is contracting across the marketplace. In the Individual business, enrollment increased by 222,000 lives, and we ended the quarter with nearly 1.6 million ACA-compliant members with 1.1 million of those members on the individual exchanges. The remaining, approximately 300,000 members, are in non-ACA compliant grandmothered or grandfathered plans, which continues to decline as expected, a decline of a little less than 100,000 since the prior-year quarter. Medicare enrollment grew by 38,000 during the quarter, primarily driven by growth in our Medicare Advantage product offerings. Our self-funded business grew by 385,000 members, in line with our expectations, to 25.1 million members. This marks the fourth consecutive year of membership increases, demonstrating the value that Anthem brings to the marketplace with our best-in-class cost of care position, coupled with highly effective medical management capabilities. We're pleased with our first quarter results and updated outlook, and we remain focused on optimizing performance of our assets to drive sustainable growth. We recognize many opportunities across our businesses, as our industry continues to face disruption on multiple fronts. In response to this dynamic external environment, I believe it is critical to improve our speed to market, corporate agility, and overall performance. I've challenged our leadership to take a hard look at our business operations, and culture, to optimize sustained value creation for all of our stakeholders. Anthem is in a position of strength, with a diverse portfolio of outstanding assets and a dedicated team of leaders and associates. This strategy reinforces our confidence in improving our long-term earnings growth rates toward the upper-single digit to lower-double digit range beyond 2017, as we discussed in our last earnings call. We are continually balancing our near-term results with our longer-term strategies. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the future. Our strong first quarter financial performance reflected contributions from both Government and Commercial Businesses. In the Government Business, we added 70,000 members during the quarter, reflecting growth of 38,000 in our Medicare business; 29,000 in Medicaid; and 3,000 in the Federal Employee Program. The enrollment growth, coupled with rate increases, translated into first quarter 2017 Government Business operating revenue of $12 billion, or growth of 11.4% versus first quarter of 2016. Operating margins for the Government Business were 2.6% during the first quarter of 2017, a decline of 40 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. The expected decline was primarily due to the impact of the one-year waiver in the health insurance tax in 2017 which, as you know, is not tax-deductible. During the quarter, we recognized retroactive revenue related to the Iowa Medicaid contract. This adjustment has been agreed upon with the State to partially cover the significantly higher than expected claims costs experienced since April 2016. While the additional revenue enhanced our first quarter performance, our initial outlook expected the improved Iowa rates to take effect with the July 1 rates. Therefore, the benefit of this adjustment has not yet been incorporated in our updated 2017 outlook. We will continue to work collaboratively with our state partner and make progress with the understanding that we need to receive actuarially justified rates in the rate renewal process. We remain confident we will meaningfully impact Iowa citizens by improving the cost and quality of care, as we have done for other state partners. Aside from the additional revenue recognized in Iowa, our first quarter performance was in line with expectations in the Medicaid business. The current Medicaid pipeline continues to be robust. We're implementing new business in Virginia and Texas that should go live later in 2017. In addition, there are six active RFPs of which we expect to hear about over the next couple of months, with those awards expected to be implemented in 2018. Looking out over the horizon, we are monitoring an additional 15 to 20 RFPs that we expect to be released over the next year and half, which will include both opportunities for additional business in new and existing states; and existing contract re-procurements, which in many cases will offer the potential for additional opportunities in our current contracts. Within Medicare, we're pleased that enrollment growth of 38,000 during the quarter exceeded our expectations, primarily in our Medicare Advantage product offerings, as we now have over 50% of our membership residing in 4-star plans. We continue to expect to grow MA enrollment by low-to-mid double-digit percentages in 2017, and perform within our targeted operating margin range. Switching to our Commercial Business, as I discussed earlier, our enrollment came in better than expected, growing by 645,000 members during the first quarter of 2017, to 31 million members. This growth translated into better-than-expected operating revenue, totaling $10.3 billion in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of nearly $800 million, or 8.2%, versus the first quarter of 2016. The strong enrollment gains were across the entire segment, with better-than-expected growth in the Local Group business, fully-insured, and self-funded product offerings. The Commercial team has been focused on identifying opportunities to mitigate the fully-insured enrollment trends experienced over the last few years, and we are pleased that these strategies are proving to be effective in the market. First quarter 2017 operating margins of 12.7% declined by 90 basis points from the 13.6% in the first quarter of 2016. This decline was due to the impact of the Penn Treaty assessments that were recorded during the quarter, and the first-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017. Partially offsetting the margin decline was the benefit of one less calendar day during the quarter, as first quarter 2016 was a leap year, a lower SG&A ratio due to expense efficiency initiatives, and fixed cost leverage from growing operating revenue. We continue to target improved penetration rates in our specialty product offering, and we're very pleased that our efforts are taking hold in the marketplace. Our dental membership increased by 373,000 or 6.8% during the quarter, and vision membership increased by 405,000 or 6.3% during the quarter. While we still have additional opportunities to continue to increase the penetration rates for the various ancillary specialty product offerings, I'm encouraged with the momentum this business has generated, as we continue to improve the value of the products we bring to the market and align incentives appropriately within the distribution channel. In the individual ACA-compliant business, we're all pleased with the membership growth in the open enrollment period, with claims experienced in the first quarter coming in better than prior year, which is reflected in our improved medical loss ratio. However, the claims experienced during the quarter was slightly higher than we anticipated, and we're closely monitoring and analyzing the morbidity of our membership. Given a little under 50% of the population is new to Anthem, we are also not yet able to determine the morbidity of the entire marketplace, which would have implications for the risk-adjusted calculation. We should have a more thorough understanding in Q2 of our expectations for full year 2017 financial performance. Reflecting on these dynamics and recognizing the level of volatility in the individual ACA-compliant product offerings, we are assessing our market footprint in 2018 as well as rate increases necessary to reflect the underlying morbidity and expected cost of this population. Our financial expectations vary by market and some markets are expected to be operating on a sustainable basis. We will continue to focus on participating in only those markets, which are in a visible path towards sustainability, including factors like the expected financial performance, regulatory environment and underlying market characteristic. We are pleased that some steps have been taken to address the sustainability of the market, such as addressing the risk adjustment formula in 2018 and verification of eligibility requirements for special enrollment period members on the federal exchanges. We're pleased to see the final market stabilization regulation and anticipate that it will have a long term positive impact. These changes should help improve stability, but there's still significant uncertainty around some key funding components. For example, we do not yet have certainty that funding of the cost sharing reduction subsidies will be continued. Additionally, under current law, the health insurance tax will be reinstated in 2018, negatively impacting the affordability of fully-insured products, including Medicaid and Medicare. It's estimated that before accounting for any other issues, rates could increase by an additional 20% or more if CSR subsidies are not funded. The return of the health insurance tax is also expected to increase rates by an additional 3% to 5%. Obviously, this level of additional increase would cause further market instability to a level at which it would be even more challenging to appropriately estimate actuarially sound rates. At this point, we plan to file preliminary 2018 rates with the assumption that the cost sharing reduction subsidies will be funded. However, we are notifying to our states that, if we do not have certainty that CSRs will be funded for 2018 by early June, we will need to evaluate appropriate adjustments to our filing. Such adjustments could include reducing service area participation, requesting additional rate increases, eliminating certain product offerings or exiting certain individual ACA-compliant markets altogether. Funding CSRs in 2018 and eliminating the health insurance tax going forward are only some of the steps necessary to ensure that the individual ACA-compliant marketplace is not further de-stabilized. We believe that additional funding in programs such as high-risk pools and reinsurance should be done to help improve the stability of the marketplace, and we continue to work with the administration and members of Congress on these issues. As we stated in our fourth quarter call, we are monitoring developments closely in the first half of 2017, as we evaluate our longer-term strategy in the individual marketplace. We're analyzing the impact of regulatory changes along with updating our expectations of underlying cost trends, while we continue to advocate for additional regulatory adjustments to ensure both a stable and sustainable individual market. We expect to provide additional clarity on our 2018 market footprint during our second quarter earnings call, if not sooner. Turning to discuss our updated 2017 financial outlook, we now expect adjusted earnings per share of greater than $11.60 for the full year of 2017, an increase of $0.10 from our previous outlook. I believe our updated outlook is prudent, given the uncertain nature of the individual ACA-compliant marketplace. With that, I'll turn the call over to John to discuss our financial statements and provide additional details on our updated 2017 outlook. John? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you, Joe, and good morning. I'll begin by discussing the consolidated financial highlights during the first quarter. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $3.73 in the first quarter of 2017. These results included net negative items of $0.95 per share. Excluding these items, our adjusted EPS is $4.68 for the quarter. These results were favorable to our expectations and, as Joe noted, we are pleased with our strong start to 2017. As highlighted earlier, our membership results in the first quarter were strong and translated into better-than-expected operating revenues, totaling $22.3 billion. This represents an increase of $2 billion or 9.9% versus the first quarter of 2016. The increase in revenue, as a result of premium rate increases, cover overall cost trends across all lines of business, and higher enrollment in Medicaid, Medicare, and Local Group fully-insured and self-funded businesses. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017, which allowed us to decrease premiums for this component as part of our efforts to address affordability. The benefit expense ratio was 83.7% in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 190 basis points from the prior-year quarter. This expected increase was driven by the impact of the one-year waiver in the health insurance tax. As expected, the rate pressures and medical cost experienced in Medicaid is contributing to the increase. The Iowa contract, which was not effective until April 1, 2016, is the primary driver of our year-over-year increase in the medical loss ratio. These increases were partially offset by the impact of one less calendar day in 2017 as the first quarter of 2016 was a leap year, and the net impact of premium rate increases in individual business, particularly within our individual ACA-compliant product offerings and the impact of a retro-revenue adjustment in the Iowa Medicaid contract recorded during the quarter. Our first quarter 2017 SG&A expense ratio of 14.3% came in higher than expected due to a non-recurring assessment recorded due to the Penn Treaty insolvency, but it's still declined by 150 basis points from 15.8% in the first quarter of 2016. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact of a one-year waiver of the health insurance tax and from lower administrative cost, which resulted from expense efficiency initiatives coupled with fixed cost leverage on our strong membership growth. These decreases were partially offset by the Penn Treaty assessments that were recorded during the quarter, which are included in SG&A expenses, but excluded from our adjusted earnings per share calculation. Turning to the balance sheet, we have included a roll forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. For the first quarter 2017, we experienced favorable prior year reserve development of $795 million, which was moderately better than our expectations. Our reserves continue to include a provision for average deviation in the mid-to-high single digits, and we believe our reserve balances remain consistent and strong as of March 31, 2017. Our days and claims payable was 40.6 days as of March 31, a decrease of 0.7 days from the 41.3 days we reported at the end of 2016. The decline was expected, and is primarily due to the faster claims payment speeds, as we continued to migrate membership on the faster payment platform, primarily within the Government Business. Our debt to cap ratio was 39.7% as of March 31, 2017, an increase of 120 basis points from the 38.5% at the end of 2016, which reflects the impact of an increase in commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by an increase in shareholder equity and a repayment of a $400-million note that was due in mid-February. During the first quarter of 2017, the company repurchased approximately 300,000 shares of its common stock for $51 million at a weighted average price of $160.81. As of March 31, 2017, the company had approximately $4.1 billion of board-approved share repurchase authorization remaining. We ended the first quarter with approximately $4.2 billion of cash and investments at the parent company, and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $687 million at the end of the quarter. For the 3Rs, consistent with our strategy, we are in a significant net receivable position for risk adjustors for both the 2016 and 2017 benefit year, where we find our insurance estimates and are expecting the pool to pay out at the 50% coinsurance rate. And finally, on risk corridors, we continue to record a 100% valuation allowance for all unpaid receivables for the 2014, 2015 and the 2016 benefit years. Now, moving to cash flow, for the first quarter of 2017, we reported operating cash flow of approximately $2.7 billion or 2.7 times net income, which was stronger than expected. Cash flow in the quarter included the impact of collecting an extra CMS Medicare payment, and also the fact that we did not make an estimated federal tax payment. As a reminder, we will make two estimated tax payments to the federal government in the second quarter. Even after adjusting for these items, operating cash flow was still strong, reflecting the quality of our first quarter earnings. We used $172 million during the quarter for our cash dividend, and we declared a second quarter dividend of $0.65 per share. Turning to our financial outlook, we increased our operating revenue guidance for 2017 by $1.5 billion to a range of $88 billion to $89 billion. This increase reflects higher projected membership due to the strong enrollment results seen through the first quarter as we have discussed. Fully insured membership is now expected to be in the range of 15.2 million to 15.3 million, or 100,000 higher than our previous outlook, which reflects stronger-than-expected growth in both the Individual and Local Group insured businesses. Self-funded membership is still expected to be in the range of 25 million to 25.1 million, as better-than-expected results in our large group self-funded business is largely offset by slower-than-expected growth in BlueCard enrollment. Taken together, we now project a total membership to be nearly 300,000 to 500,000 lives higher than at the end of 2016. We continue to expect our 2016 medical loss ratio to be 87%, plus or minus 30 basis points, and now expect our SG&A ratio to be at 13.6%, plus or minus 30 basis points on a GAAP basis, which includes the impact of the Penn Treaty assessments, and the Cigna-related transaction costs incurred during the first quarter of 2017. We continue to expect 2017 Local Group medical cost trends to be in the range of 6.5% to 7%. We are encouraged by our first quarter operating cash flow, and we continue to project operating cash flow to be greater than $3.5 billion in 2017, excluding the potential cash payments related to the Penn Treaty assessments during the year. Regarding capital deployment, the 2017 outlook continues to include the benefit from $1.5 billion to $2 billion in share repurchases through the remainder of the year. To conclude, our 2017 earnings per share outlook is greater than $10.37 on a GAAP basis, which increases our adjusted earnings per share outlook to greater than $11.60. We believe our outlook is appropriately prudent, given the uncertainty in the individual ACA-compliant marketplace and the expected year-over-year margin compression in the Medicaid business, particularly within the expansion population. It is important to note that our outlook does not include any additional benefits or transaction costs associated with the pending acquisition of Cigna beyond those incurred in the first quarter of 2017. Our outlook also does not include any benefit from lower pharmaceutical pricing, which we continue to believe we are entitled to under our current contract with ESI. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Joe to discuss the pending Cigna acquisition and an update on our PBM strategy. Joe? Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Thanks, John. Relating to the pending Cigna acquisition, we continue to work through the expedited appeal process through the court system. We participated in oral arguments at the end of March, and expect to hear a decision from the appellate court relatively soon. Concurrently, we were also granted our motion for a temporary restraining order to enjoin Cigna from terminating the merger agreement. The next hearing on this motion is scheduled to be held on May 8 in the Delaware Court. We remain committed to completing the acquisition as soon as possible. Turning to discuss the process of forming our long-term pharmacy strategy, we did issue the RFP during the first quarter. And we expect to receive all responses during the first half of the year. It is important to note that we have not ruled anyone in or out as the best strategic option for the company going forward. After we receive the responses to the RFP, our pharmacy team will thoroughly and thoughtfully analyze what has been proposed in order to decide how to construct the best pharmacy solution for our members. As I previously stated, this process will be completed by the end of 2017, and we have committed to informing the market of our strategy by that time. We continue to believe that we will be able to lower our pharmaceutical cost by more than $3 billion annually in 2020 and beyond. With that, operator, please open the queue for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Christine Arnold from Cowen. Please go ahead. Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, there. Let's start with Individual. How did Individual develop relative to your mid-single digit range? And, given that we don't know how the risk adjuster's going to look, because they don't have the data and you are last man standing in a couple markets, how did your risk adjuster accrual look versus a year ago? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you, Christine. We're happy to respond to that question. In terms of Individual \u2013 I'm not positive what you mean by mid-single digit range, if that's the long-term aspiration in terms of profitability, we did state 90 days ago that we expected our 2017 Individual block of business to be essentially a breakeven, maybe a little bit better. So those are the expectations that we've had for the year this entire time. In terms of risk adjusters, yeah, we are a risk adjuster receiver. We have \u2013 really have designed our products and had our entire strategy around collecting receivables associated with risk adjusters. In the areas where we were the last man standing, we went back to the various states and changed our rating formulas associated with that, to get additional rates in 2017 associated with those. So, all in all, the Individual business started out 2017 significantly better than it started out 2016. However, a little bit behind our expectations. We've been very cautious in terms of recording any incremental risk adjusters in 2017 versus what we believe we are entitled to from our strategic standpoint. So to the extent that our morbidity is a little bit worse than the entire pool, we have upside associated with our expectations. If our morbidity is consistent with the overall pool, then our expectations, I think, are very prudently and appropriately stated. But at the end of the day, we do expect to be a significant risk adjustor receiver. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: You know (32:01) John, I might add also that you just pointed out about claims per quarter being a little excess of our forecast. Our sense is that, as you would expect, one quarter doesn't make a year trend. And we're going to be monitoring this very carefully, given the fact that we've got a member mix that we still have to analyze very carefully. And our sense is that a lot will be known and become clear, as we get into the second quarter leading up to the end of June. And then, we'll be able to obviously report more details to you in the next earnings call. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, you've spoken a lot about the Medicaid impact in the Government segment business. But I was hoping, given the growth in Medicare, if you could give us a sense for how that side of the business is trending? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. Sure, Chris. Thank you for asking that question. We grew our Medicare Advantage by about 38,000 members in the quarter, which was consistent with our expectations. As Joe had mentioned that we have over 50% of our membership in 4-star plans. We think we're very well positioned for future growth. We are projecting to grow that membership in the double-digit range. The marketplace that we operate in has a market average growth rate of 6% to 9% per year over the next several years, and we're looking at a low-double digit growth rate in that area. We obviously have the agents that we'll get our fair share of over the rest of the year, and our operating margins right now are very much in line with our target margins associated with this line of business. So we actually think we're very well positioned and feel very good about our start of year in the Medicare arena. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Hi, everybody. I'm just going to follow up a little bit more on your comments, Joe, around your PBM contract, if I could. Obviously, there seems to be a little bit of a divergence between what you're communicating today, and what was released by your current PBM earlier in the week. I wonder if there is any way to reconcile that. And another aspect of this discussion is they put on the table $1 billion in each of the next three years plus, quote-unquote, market rates after that. Can we assume that if you're not taking that, you think you can do better than that? And then finally, on this issue, is there any update on the status of the litigation and what is happening with that? Are there any dates upcoming on the litigation with the PBM? Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Good morning, AJ. Let me take your question in the following order, dealing with, so called, reconciliation regarding what was said by ESI, the $1 billion offer, and then the litigation outlook. With respect to reconciling statements, quite frankly, that's not easy, if possible, quite frankly, because they certainly have made statements that support their perspective. We made our position very clear. We've been steady with respect to our expectations, beginning with our first declaration back in January of 2016, and I can underscore that we really have not changed our position with respect to our expectations around a $3 billion opportunity for us to recover costs that we believe we are due, relative to both our contract as well as go forward for 2020 and beyond. So I can't speak and won't speak on behalf of ESI and their perspective, other than continually refer everyone back to what we've reportedly said and, obviously, we continue to stand by our statements. I do want to underscore and I've said this repeatedly as well that we are hopeful that we can resolve our dispute with respect to our interpretation of the agreement as well as our expectations with respect to supporting our cost structure in a more positive manner, and how that then translates to support our customers. And however, we certainly are coming upon some very critical due dates. As I stated a moment ago, we have issued RFPs. We have stated that on an earlier call. We have followed through and issuing an RFP to many, many respondents. We expect to receive all the final details by the end of the first half of the year. And then, we'll go to the analytical phase, and then as I've said repeatedly, we will report to you in Q4 our decision, with respect to how we plan on proceeding with respect to executing on our PBM strategy, January 1, 2020 and beyond. With respect to litigation, we are currently in discovery phase. That's really kind of, let's call it, the sum and substance of what I can report at the moment. We're expecting to complete discovery some time after mid-year. That could be pushed back, as you would expect, in litigation proceedings. So I would ask you to stay tuned in that regard. Once discovery is finished, then I think some critical dates in terms of timing on various matters related to the litigation will become clear. I do want to underscore that we're very excited about the opportunity to put together a new solution that serves our members better than our current situation. Our teams have been focused heavily on identifying the right solution for the long term. We've talked about some possibilities in and around stated course, under a new arrangement, going in a different direction with respect to vendor support, crafting a hybrid model. We've stated all of that publicly, and we're still very focused on crafting the absolute best solution to best serve our customers. So, we believe we have all the ingredients to keep marching forward and to give you the answers that we always declare we would give you by Q4. So, A.J., I hope I've covered up everything you wanted me to touch on. There may be other questions from others, but I think in the main, I think I've covered all of the critical aspects of where we are at the moment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. First, just let me follow up on the PBM. Joe, you mentioned you haven't ruled anybody out. Does that mean that ESRX has gotten a copy of this RFP and is participating? And then, can you talk about the hybrid model that you mentioned here in terms of what that means? And is that a reason why that even though Express may or may not be offering you interesting economics here on the short term to renew, you're looking to go in a completely different direction and, therefore, the $1 billion a year settlement here to extend wouldn't be interesting to you? And can you just verify whether you feel that they have put that offer on the table in the first place? I apologize for the follow-up, but I think people are pretty interested. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: No. It's all one big ball of yarn, and I certainly understand how you kind of packaged it together. No problem at all. I can respond and must respond as you would expect, and I don't want to comment on any specific vendor and their engagement with respect to the RFP process, where they've chosen to participate or not participate or how that \u2013 the final submittals will look. So, again, I don't want to kind of comment on who got what. So with respect to decisions, obviously, we've not made a final decision with respect to any vendor, and I have just stated that clearly that we've not done so and we've not ruled anyone in or out. I think that covers the entire spectrum of vendor possibilities. And I will leave it at that. With respect to the $1 billion statement, again, that's a statement that came from ESI, I really don't want to and can't obviously, for many, many reasons, talk about negotiation discussions. And I'd just come back to the point that's repeatedly said, we're hoping for an amicable resolution to our current litigation. What that might mean, with respect to engagement in our PBM strategy execution going forward, remains to be seen. But my sense is that we've got a lot of possibilities as we use the word repeatedly, I think I can underscore it here and answer your question yet again, and that's optionality. Optionality has been a watchword for us, and I can use the word hybrid, because hybrid means kind of a mixture of possibilities around formula management, mail order, and those kinds of things that, in terms of how you manage it, may look remarkably different than constructing a contract that maybe as old as five, six, seven, eight years. The world has changed in this space and we're certainly going to take advantage of the absolute best performance possibilities to serve our customers. I must again underscore that there has been no change to our $3 billion annual expectation for lower pharmacy costs. We are resolute on that point. We believe we've done enough analytics around market checks that we believe it's a very credible expectation, and we are holding firm on how we believe we're going to be looking at our performance for the balance in the term of agreement as well as January 1, 2010 and beyond. Operator : You're next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte from Leerink. Please go ahead. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I'm just trying to follow up on your guidance and the puts and takes, so I'd make sure I understood this. You beat by a significant amount, I would assume you knew about the leap day tailwind when you've guided, but your raise is $0.10. For exchanges, it's about, I guess, a little under $0.10 for every 100 basis points on margins give or take. And I'm trying to understand how much conservatism or what margins are you seeing right now, firstly, and how much potential deterioration might you expect going forward or is this mostly about the risk adjustor payment coming in less than you expect. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Sure, Ana. Thank you for the question. First of all, I'll just clarify. Leap year does not influence our 2017 outlook. Leap year was a dynamic of 2016 that caused the first quarter of 2016 to be less profitable than it would have been on a seasonality basis. So then, when you compare the seasonality of the 2016 results for the first quarter versus our first quarter of 2017, of course, our seasonality would enhance our first quarter profitability in 2017, but for the full year, it's not relevant. In terms of the guidance, as we said, we're trying to be very prudent. I just want to be clear that the individual business is doing markedly better than it did last year. A lot of the information is consistent with expectations. The claims activity were a little bit higher to the point that as we are looking at the morbidity of the membership, it's really too early to know will our risk adjustor position be enhanced or not. And we've taken the conservative outlook that our risk adjustor position will not be enhanced. If it is enhanced, we have upside. And so we believe that we're being appropriately prudent here with our expectations for 2017, because it is so early in the year. Very clearly, we'll have a lot more information in the second quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask on the commercial risk business. It sounds like enrollment is tracking ahead of expectation, and that's been a business that's seen some pressure and you mentioned strategies around that. I guess I just want to understand that a little bit more. And then, how much is it sort of market share gains, or are you seeing any shift from ASO to risk? Thanks. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Great question, Ralph. We are very pleased with the growth that we've seen in Commercial fully-insured group business, and very happy with that. There has been several things. We really went to the market with improved product designs that were received very well by the marketplace. In terms of \u2013 really focused on price points, as you know, we've gone through several years of really fine-tuning our administrative cost and have really done a great job of growing membership and getting a great fixed cost leveraging associated with that, and allowed some of those savings to go through, in terms of more attractive price points to the membership. We're, obviously, ensuring we offer competitive product and, given the leading provider relationships we have, and the medical management we have and, quite honestly, the number one cost of care position we have in our marketplace, we've got a great product and really very well-positioned from a competitive marketplace. In terms of what's going on with the overall market, and is it groups going from ASO to fully-insured or are we increasing share, it's really \u2013 it has a lot to do with capitalizing on a shrinking marketplace. Joe, did you have a few other comments you wanted to add? Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. It's a great question related to our engagement in the market with our provider community. I really don't want to let the moment to go by without calling out some tremendous success in and around provider collaboration. As you know, that's been a \u2013 I'd call it a hallmark of a company now for a few years and a pillar regarding our success going forward. You used the term value, and when I speak or think about value, I'm thinking about our provider collaboration engagements, such as the 159 ACOs in our markets. We've got over 64,000 providers now engaged in ACOs, and patient-centered medical homes who are accountable for cost and quality of care for over 5.5 million commercial members, which is a huge uptick compared to prior years. It's interesting to underscore also that aggregate spend regarding value-based contracts tally up to about 58% of our total medical spend across all lines of business, and over 75% is represented by shared savings agreement, shared risk arrangements, population-based payment models. And then we've got sort of the remainder of that spread between 75% and 100% but (48:02) 58% is in various Pay for Performance arrangements. So we're really pleased with those kinds of stats. I think it really speaks volumes regarding our shift to value-based payment models in partnership with our provider community, whether it's small group practitioners, large scale organizations like Aurora Health Care in Wisconsin. There are many, many other groups that we've aligned with, with respect to our product offerings in markets that are now delivered in tandem with our provider community. So, again, I'm very proud of that performance, and I really want to call it out because I think, again, it's a hallmark of the company's performance in all the markets we're serving. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Just a two-part question. I just want to go back to guidance for a second, maybe come at it just a little bit different way. In the first quarter, earnings were up $1.22. And I know, obviously, leap year that's part of that. But for the full year, your guidance is that earnings are only up $0.60. So it implies that the combined earnings over the next three quarters are actually down. And given the increased seasonality, maybe that might be true of the fourth quarter. But just kind of wondering why that much conservatism in the remainder of the year. Is that still just primarily related to exchanges? And then the second part is, if you're \u2013 it'd be great if you could size the retro-Iowa. But also, I didn't quite understand the comment on why the Iowa rate increase wasn't yet in the guidance. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yes. Sure, Gary. And actually, those questions, I think, can all be answered simultaneously. I appreciate the two-part question. In terms of the first quarter and how you've calculated it, a couple of other things do need to be taken into consideration versus the expectations in your analysis. Number one, we did have the change in the treatment of the taxes associated with stock-based compensation that we implemented in the first quarter of 2017. So that was certainly additive as a one-time catch-up or true-up associated with adopting that accounting principle. And then, the second part is the retro-Iowa true-up. We really cannot go into specific dollar amounts associated with it, other than to say that that retro payment was reimbursement for a portion of the losses that we experienced in 2016 under that contract. We continue to work with the state to obtain actuary justified rates as of July 1. As those negotiations are ongoing, it really would be premature and inappropriate to comment on them publicly, other than to say that we want to be very cautious in terms of what we're including in our outlook associated with the overall situation there. So, we've again tried to be very prudent in terms of how we're looking at that. And as you look at the metrics that you rattled off, we have a prudent approach to Individual. We have a continued margin pressure in our Medicaid expansion business that we've been signaling for quite some time. It's actually very much in line with expectations, but it is a real issue. And then the seasonality of the leap year, I think, are all significant metrics that need to be taken into consideration, when you do the math that you did. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Newshel from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI : Thanks. Good morning. So, my question is on the remaining timeline and legal strategy around the Cigna transaction. So, first, if you lose the appeal decision, is that the definitive end? Or is there any last minute hope for a DOJ settlement? And if you do win the appeal, if you're still waiting on the court, when you get to that May 8 hearing, is it your intention to ask the judge to keep the injunction in place to hold Cigna to the agreement beyond the April 30 expiration? Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you very much for the question. Obviously, like you, we're kind of trying to evaluate our options depending on which way the court goes, which we believe the decision is relatively imminent with respect to the Appeals Court. And to underscore what you said, the Delaware Chancery will be convening on May 8, so there's still a lot of judicial proceedings to occur. In assessing that, we believe the Appeals Court \u2013 probably I'm telling you something you already know, but there are probably about three directions it can go in, which would be : to just categorically deny our appeal across the board; and another would be to accept it but in part, remand some of it back to the District Court; and then the final one, obviously, would be to accept our appeal in its entirety and have us move forward. So each one of those requires very significant discernment on the choices that we have and I'd probably leave any further commentary regarding our choices to another time, when it becomes clear what the court's decision is. So I really don't want to speak exactly to what we can or can't do relative to each one of the decisions. Regarding the Chancery Court, obviously, how it evaluates the situation is dependent on the appeals outcome. And so, I guess, long story short, we're going to have to judge our go forward position based on the decision by the Appeals Court. And then, obviously, make the best choice possible for us, but I do want to underscore that we are continually committed to the acquisition both with respect to the board and management. And we are proceeding with all the effort necessary to come to a reasonably good outcome regarding our commitment to the acquisition. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Barclays. Please go ahead. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Just two clarifications. First, I just want to make sure I understood on Iowa. Are you including a rate increase for July 1 in the guidance? And then the second question was, I think, I heard Joe talk a little bit about the long-term EPS growth rate of that high-single digit to low-double digit. Did I hear sort of a change towards the higher end? Is that something you're more comfortable with now? Or are you guys sort of shifting your thoughts on long-term EPS growth? Thanks. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: This is Joe. I'll respond just very quickly. No, you didn't hear anything that's any different than the first comment we made with respect to high-single digit, low-double digit expectations. So, John, do you want to pick it up from here? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. Sure. So, the first part of your question, Josh, was on Iowa. And our plan has all along been to receive actuarially justified rate increases as of July 1. We still believe we're entitled to those and we're working very closely with the state in order to achieve those. However, as I commented, the first quarter of 2017 benefited from this one-time retro premium adjustment. We are very cautious to include it, and a full actuarially justified rate increase on July 1 in our guidance or in our outlook. We believe we're entitled to it. But until we have more clarity, we don't want to get out ahead of the negotiations. But our original expectations all along have been July 1 actuarially sound rates. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: John, I probably need to add some commentary to the question about high-single digit, low-double digit expectation on long-term growth. We do have our strategies that we are targeting, and I think it really is important to underscore that those strategies are targeted at Government Business, as you know, with respect to both Medicaid/Medicare. We've talked liberally about our Medicare outlook, particularly in terms of organic growth and combined with M&A opportunity. Our Commercial Business had a lot of targeted opportunities, particularly in the area of increased wallet share in and around specialty offerings to the market, and then membership gains and a variety of places. Our SG&A expense controls we believe will be a key contributor with respect to the operational improvements we believe are possible, as we better adapt to the marketplace, and also be able to effectively leverage our growth in membership based on very prudent and highly efficient application of our expenses. And then, finally \u2013 and I'll let John speak to this with respect to capital deployment choices that we have ahead of us. I can't leave out the PBM repricing process as well. So, in any event, we've got a very significant combined effort, a variety of opportunities that we think will take us to point of meeting the expectations that I stated last call, as well as this call. I don't know, John, if you want to add anything. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah, no, thank you, Joe. On the capital allocation, that clearly \u2013 the capital planning structure, that clearly was part of our high-single to low-double digit thought process as we go through and evaluate future M&A opportunities, share buyback opportunities, other ways to return capital to shareholders through dividends, getting an appropriate balance of all those things we think are critically important. And I just want to reemphasize, when we say high-single to low-double that is a long term view over many, many years. And obviously, some years, it can be at the lower end and some years it can be at the higher end. So any one year is not indicative of what a long-term multi-year view might be, and we are very comfortable given our strategy, given our track record and given our growth prospects, that we can achieve high-single to low-double on average over a multi-year period. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: You know what, I think, John, just to reinforce something I said at the very beginning of my commentary, and that is internally, we are looking very carefully at our operational performance, trying to understand the transformative responsibilities we have to better manage the company in terms of supporting our business model. And in particular, now, as you've just heard, related to these strategic initiatives that we have targeted, it's not just about the pieces of the puzzle we just described, but also how we then support each part of that puzzle being accomplished with respect to our go-forward success that we envision, so a lot of internal shifts and changes with respect to better performing in support of our strategic commitment. Operator : And your final question today comes from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. And I hate to end it and going back to the PBM, but I just want to try to continue to reconcile the differences in your statements and ESI's. You've talked about needing to get that $3 billion or believing you're owed the $3 billion in annual savings. Express has shared numbers and suggested that they can't give you $3 billion in incremental savings. So, is that really what's causing the difference in terms of their view of what you've said to them and your view of saying it's open to everybody? Is it really only open to everybody to the extent you get $3 billion in savings? Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Well, appreciate you bringing it back to the table, and hope you can appreciate my comeback, which I've repeatedly stated, which is we stand by our $3 billion expectation. And, quite frankly, we believe that's at a minimum $3 billion based on the analytics, market check performance that we've administered now over quite a lengthy period of time, and so our outlook at January 1, 2020 and beyond is very much guided by that reality. And as such, obviously, we're driven by our focus on creating value for our members and our shareholders. And you may recall what we said repeatedly is that about 20% of that pickup, and improvement is going to flow to the shareholders. Conversely, it's going to be 80% going to our members. So, it's a huge nut that we believe needs to be cracked for the benefit of so many. And I understand your question with respect to the $1 billion. But again, that's their number, and I really don't want to comment on their analytics, why they believe, what they believe. I know that all of you are very focused on applying the math to their numbers, as you do our numbers. And I'll just have to leave it at that, and let them speak for themselves, and I certainly respect where they're coming from. But obviously, we have a different point of view, and we believe it's a point of view that's validated by the statistics that have flowed out of our analytics. So we stand by our position and the negotiating process with respect to litigation we're in. I really don't want to comment on that either because there is some sanctity related to the litigation process through discovery and beyond. And I think the prudent approach is simply enough to comment on any matters of litigation. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Okay. Well, thank you for all your questions. As always, it's great to hear from you and get an appreciation for what's on your mind relative to what we've reported on for the quarter. As you know, this company is committed to running our healthcare systems challenges. We're focused on expanding access to high quality affordable healthcare for all of our customers. And I also want to thank our associates for their continued commitment to serving our 40.6 million members every day. Thanks for your interest in Anthem, and we look forward to speaking with you soon at upcoming conferences. Again, thanks for dialing in and look forward to seeing you in the future. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 11 AM Eastern Time today through May 10.

LLC Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Anthem second quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Doug Simpson - Anthem, Inc.: Good morning, and welcome to Anthem's second quarter 2017 earnings call. This is Doug Simpson and with us this morning are Joe Swedish, Chairman, President and CEO; and John Gallina, our CFO. Joe will provide some high-level commentary on our second quarter financial results, discuss our business unit performance, and then provide some high-level commentary on our updated 2017 financial outlook. John will then discuss our key financial metric performance during the quarter and provide some additional details on our updated 2017 outlook. We will then be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict, and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in today's press release, and in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Joe. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you, Doug, and good morning. We're pleased to announce strong second quarter 2017 GAAP earnings per share of $3.16 and adjusted earnings per share of $3.37 with both membership and revenue tracking well. Our second quarter financial results show that we are continuing to carry forward the strong momentum we built coming into the year and during the first quarter. Our membership growth coupled with the strong quality of earnings so far in 2017 gives us confidence that the value proposition we bring to the marketplace is resonating well. Within membership, both fully insured and self-funded enrollment continue to track well versus our expectation, as we ended the quarter with nearly 40.4 million members. In the first six months of 2017, our membership has grown by 468,000 lives. We're particularly pleased with the membership trends in our commercial insured business, as both Large and Small Group membership came in ahead of expectations again during the quarter. Our membership results on a consolidated basis translated into second quarter operating revenues of $22.2 billion, an increase of $924 million or 4.3% versus the second quarter of 2016. During the quarter, our Individual enrollment declined by 107,000 lives which was expected. Our total Individual enrollment of approximately 1.8 million members consists of 1.5 million ACA-compliant members and 300,000 non-ACA-compliant members. Of the 1.5 million ACA-compliant members, approximately 1 million or less than 2.5% of our total enrollment were from the individual exchanges. Self-funded enrollment in Local Group and National Accounts were in line with expectations. Before I discuss the details of our business unit performance, I want to spend a few moments on the evolving policy landscape. As a company, we recognize that access to affordable and high quality healthcare is immensely important and intensely personal for all American. Anthem has always been committed to our members and sought to provide value and limit disruption, no matter their financial circumstances or health status. Our commitment to all of our members, including the most vulnerable populations, has not changed and will not change in the face of what we believe will be an ongoing period of debate and policy and regulatory adjustments in healthcare. State and federal regulatory and legislative changes will likely impact our Individual and Medicaid businesses and we remain focused on informing government leaders as they develop policy to achieve the common goal of creating stable and affordable marketplaces. For example, insuring appropriate funding for all whom we serve, a balanced risk pool, effective rules and regulations that limit expensive abuses prevalent in today's marketplace, elimination of unnecessary taxes that add to the cost of insurance. Altogether, Anthem will continue to contribute in an ongoing discussion in Washington and the states on behalf of our members and all American, as we work towards stability and sustainability by providing ideas built on experience, data, and member feedback. Turning back to our financial results. Our strong second quarter financial performance reflected contributions from both the Commercial and Government segments. In the Commercial business, we grew our Local Group insured enrollment by 22,000 lives, bringing our year-to-date enrollment growth to 69,000, despite a market that is shrinking overall. Operating revenues were $10.3 billion in the second quarter of 2017, an increase of over $400 million or 4.1% versus the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to premium rate increases, reflecting overall cost trends in our Individual and Local Group businesses, as well as enrollment grew primarily in the Local Group business. These increases were partially offset by the one year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017, which improved affordability for our members. Our second quarter 2017 operating margin for Commercial of 9.4% declined by 150 basis points from 10.9% in the second quarter of 2016. The decline was largely due to the impact of less favorable adjustments to prior year risk adjuster accruals, the one year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017 and higher performance-based incentive compensation accruals. The decline was partially offset by the impact of strong operating performance in our Local Group business and improved core medical cost experience in our Individual business. In the Individual ACA-compliant business, our second quarter financial performance was in line with our most recent expectations. The overall morbidity levels of our enrollment identified in the first quarter has stayed consistent, giving us better line of sight into the expected claims experience. Our updated 2017 guidance continues to assume that this business will operate at a slight loss for the year. We're focused on mitigating the claims pressure through medical management capabilities. At the end of June, we received the final 2016 risk adjuster and reinsurance data from CMS and have updated our accruals. We're pleased that the reinsurance rate of 52.9% was slightly ahead of our expectations and the significant risk adjustment receivable for the 2016 benefit year was in line with our expectations. The work to determine our final 2018 market footprint in the Individual ACA-compliant business is not yet complete. We expect to provide additional clarity on our final 2018 market footprint during our third quarter call, if not sooner. As a company, our strategy has been and will continue to be to only participate in rating regions where we have an appropriate level of confidence that these markets are on a path toward marketplace stability. Thus far, we have notified state regulators of our decision to largely exit the Individual ACA-compliant marketplace in three of our states, which represents a little less than 10% of our total Individual ACA-compliant enrollment. While we have filed initial rate request in all of the other states, it is important to note that those filings do not necessarily indicate the final level of participation. There are still many areas of marketplace uncertainties, principally, cost-sharing reduction subsidy funding that make it challenging to be comfortable with the level of predictability of a sustainable marketplace. If we aren't able to gain certainty on some of these items quickly, we do expect that we will need to revise our rate filings to further narrow our level of participation. That said, we are closely monitoring state and federal legislative and regulatory developments. And if the level of uncertainty in the marketplace is reduced, we would have increased confidence in our ability to predict the appropriate level of market participation. Switching to the Government business, membership was flat during the quarter, but we grew year-over-year operating revenues by 4.5% to $11.9 billion. Operating margin for the Government business was 2.5% during the second quarter of 2017, a decline of 150 basis points compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily due to higher performance-based incentive compensation accruals and the impact of the one year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017. In our Medicaid business, our financial performance was largely in line with expectations outside of the Iowa contract. While our operating performance improved in Iowa versus the second quarter of 2016, it did underperform our expectations during the second quarter of 2017. We continue to believe the medical performance of the business supports higher rates than provided under the current contract. We remain highly engaged in working to secure actuarially sound rates that reflect the acuity of the populations we serve. We continue to see a strong pipeline of RFP opportunities for future growth in the Medicaid business, and expect 15 to 20 RFPs to be released over the next year-and-a-half. The pipeline includes opportunities for new business in both new and existing states, as well as re-procurements of existing contracts which, in many cases, offer the potential for additional business beyond our current footprint. Additionally, the pipeline is largely concentrated in new and specialized populations and services, such as long-term services and support and those with intellectual and developmental disabilities. In these areas, Anthem has a proven track record of providing market-leading capabilities, which are necessary to effectively manage these vulnerable populations. In the Medicare business, our core gross margin performance was in line with expectations. We continue to expect to organically grow our Medicare Advantage enrollment by low to mid double-digit percentages over the next few years, with a financial contribution that is within our long-term targeted operating margin range. We also continue to target M&A opportunities to augment our growth profile. Turning to discuss our updated 2017 financial outlook. We now expect adjusted earnings per share of greater than $11.70 for the full year 2017, an increase of $0.10 from our previous outlook. Our updated outlook reflects the improved performance in our Commercial Local Group business and reflects the uncertain nature of the Individual ACA-compliant marketplace. Finally, as it relates to our PBM strategy, our pharmacy team is analyzing our options to create the best long-term pharmacy solution. While it would be premature to share specifics regarding the RFP process, we remain very confident in our ability to drive significant value for our clients, members, and shareholders. The RFP process has further validated our expectation to be able to lower our pharmacy cost by more than $3 billion annually, once we transition to our future state. Should we decide to leave Express Scripts, we're very confident in our ability to thoughtfully plan for the transition of our customers to our new solution. A seamless transition for our members is a key component in our evaluation process, and we will be very focused on mitigating any potential abrasion for our customers throughout this process. We remain committed to informing the market of our long-term pharmacy strategy by the end of 2017. With that, I will turn the call over to John to discuss our financial statements and provide additional details on our updated 2017 outlook. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you, Joe, and good morning. I'll begin by discussing the consolidated financial highlights during the second quarter. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $3.16. These results included net negative items of $0.21 per share. Excluding these items, our adjusted earnings per share was $3.37 for the quarter. These results reflect our strong underlying financial performance. Operating revenues in the second quarter totaled $22.2 billion, an increase of $924 million or 4.3% versus the second quarter of 2016. The increase is primarily due to the premium rate increases across all lines of business to cover overall cost trends, as well as higher enrollment in our Medicaid, Large Group, and Medicare lines of businesses. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the one year waiver of the non-tax deductible health insurance fee in 2017, which allowed us to reduce premiums in 2017 to help improve affordability. Additionally, the increase was partially offset by less favorable adjustments to prior year risk-adjuster accruals compared to the second quarter of 2016. The benefit expense ratio of 86.1% in the second quarter of 2017, an increase of 190 basis points from the prior year quarter. This expected increase was largely driven by the impact of the one year waiver in the health insurance tax, partially offset by improved medical cost performance in the Local Group and Individual businesses. Our second quarter 2017 SG&A expense ratio of 13.8% came in higher than expected, but still declined by 20 basis points from the 14% in the second quarter of 2016. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact of the one year waiver of the health insurance tax and from lower administrative cost, which resulted from expense efficiency initiatives, coupled with fixed cost leverage on our strong membership growth. These decreases were partially offset by higher performance-based incentive compensation accruals and the 2015 cyber attack litigation settlement that was recorded during the quarter. Turning to the balance sheet. We have included a roll-forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. For the first half of 2017, we experienced favorable prior year reserve development of $951 million, which was moderately better than our expectations. Our reserves continue to include a provision for adverse deviation in the mid to high single-digit range, and we believe our reserve balances remained consistent and strong as of June 30, 2017. Our days in claims payable was 40.5 days as of June 30, largely unchanged from the 40.6 days we reported at the end of the first quarter. Our debt-to-cap ratio was 38.1% as of June 30, 2017, a decrease of 160 basis points from the 39.7% at the end of the first quarter, which reflects the impact of the repayment of a $529 million note that was due during the quarter and an increase in our shareholders' equity. During the second quarter of 2017, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares of common stock for $458 million, at a weighted average share price of $182.83, bringing our total year-to-date share repurchases to 2.8 million shares at a weighted average share price of $180.37. As of June 30, 2017, the company had approximately $3.7 billion of board-approved share repurchase authorization remaining, which we intend to utilize over a multi-year period, subject to market conditions. We ended the second quarter with approximately $2.8 billion of cash and investments at the parent company, and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $846 million as of the end of the quarter. For the 3Rs, we have adjusted our accruals to reflect the final 2016 benefit year data received by CMS at the end of June. As Joe mentioned, we were pleased that the reinsurance program came in slightly ahead of expectations and the risk-adjuster receivable we had accrued for 2016 was in line with our expectations. For the 2017 benefit year, we continue to maintain a significant net receivable position for risk adjusters, and we have not changed our accounting policy for risk corridors. Our historical results have not benefited from the amount due under the risk corridor program, and we continue to record a 100% valuation allowance for all unpaid receivables for the 2014, 2015 and 2016 benefit years. Now moving to cash flow. For the second quarter 2017, we generated operating cash flow of $393 million or 0.5 times net income. Cash flow in the second quarter included the impact of making two estimated federal tax payments consistent with expectations. On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow was $3.1 billion or 1.7 times net income. Our operating cash flow continues to reflect the impact of collecting an extra CMS Medicare payment in the first quarter, which is expected to reverse itself during the fourth quarter. After adjusting for the Medicare prepayment, operating cash flow was still strong, reflecting the quality of our first half 2017 earnings. We used $172 million during the quarter for our cash dividend and our Audit Committee approved the increase over a third quarter dividend by $0.05 to $0.70 per share. With this increase, we have increased our dividend every year since we began paying a dividend back in 2011. Turning to our financial outlook. We increased our operating revenue guidance for 2017 by an additional $500 million to a range of $88.5 billion to $89.5 billion. This increase reflects higher-than-expected premium rates in the Federal Employee Program and Individual businesses. We expect our fully insured membership to be in the range of 15.2 million to 15.3 million, and our self-funded membership to be in the range of 25 million to 25.1 million as better-than-expected results in our Large Group self-funded business was largely offset by higher-than-expected losses in BlueCard enrollment. Taken together, we expect our total membership to be in the range of 40.2 million to 40.4 million members, nearly 300,000 to 500,000 lives higher than at the end of 2016. Our 2017 medical loss ratio is projected to be 87%, plus or minus 30 basis points. We expect our SG&A ratio to be at 13.6% plus or minus 30 basis points on a GAAP basis, which includes the impact of the Penn Treaty assessments, the 2015 cyber attack litigation settlement, and Cigna-related transaction cost incurred in the first half of 2017. We expect our 2017 Local Group medical cost trends to be in the range of 6.5% to 7% with a bias towards the lower end of the range. We are encouraged by our first half 2017 operating cash flow and we project operating cash flows to be greater than $3.5 billion, including potential cash payments related to a portion of the Penn Treaty assessments and the 2015 cyber attack litigation settlement. Regarding capital deployment, our 2017 outlook continues to include the benefit from $1.5 billion to $2 billion in share repurchases during the year. To conclude, our 2017 earnings per share outlook is greater than $10.35 on a GAAP basis, and we have increased our adjusted earnings per share outlook by $0.10 per share to greater than $11.70. Our updated outlook reflects the better-than-expected operating performance in our Local Group business and the uncertain nature of the Individual ACA-compliant marketplace. It is important to note that our outlook does not include any additional transaction or legal costs associated with the terminated Cigna acquisition beyond those incurred in the first half of 2017. Our outlook also does not include any benefit from lower pharmaceutical pricing, which we continue to believe we are entitled to under our current contract with ESI. With that, operator, please open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from the line of Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. On the guidance assumption of greater than $11.70, was looking for more color on what's being baked in on the exchange margins and the outlook that it will remain negative for the full year, is that conservative? Or is there something on the 2R true-up that has driven continued conservatism? And then, secondly, on the 2016 Iowa true-up, is that already in guidance for the Medicaid? And as far as the first half of 2017, have you included something where you haven't received the rate? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Hi, Ana. This is John. Thank you for the question. Let me see if I can answer both of those. So, in terms of our raising guidance to greater than $11.70 per share, the exchange business, as you know, there's a lot of moving parts associated with that. We had some true-ups here associated with the 2016 business, based on getting the final CMS information at the end of June. Fortunately, the true-ups were relatively small. The reinsurance paid out slightly higher than we expected. But on the risk adjusters, we are quite pleased with the analytics that we had done prior and the fact that what we ended up in terms of our risk-adjuster receivers and the magnitude of the receivables that we are entitled to was virtually spot on what we had recorded, which really does show that we understand that line of business and then really do have very great data analytics associated with that. So, the true-up process itself really had minimal impact on our 2017 reported results. And in terms of the outlook for the rest of the year, in the first quarter, there had been a bit of commentary associated with the morbidity, it was a bit higher than we had planned for, due to a shrinking risk pool and various other issues. So, we've adjusted our thought process for 2017 risk adjusters, and we believe that they're all relatively, appropriately stated in terms of what's been recorded for the first six months and what's expected for the last six months. So, I would not say that there's a significant amount of conservatism associated with the guidance related to exchanges, as much as I would say is that our track record was doing a pretty darn good job of predicting it. That's pretty much where we stand on that. Related to Iowa, we've not finalized a rate increase for July 1. We did experience higher-than-expected claims during the second quarter of 2017. I'm not really going to go into much more detail than that. Yeah, we did, at the beginning of 2017, receive a partial payment associated with a portion of the 2016 losses into the 2017 period. And we continue to work with the state in Iowa in order to come up with actuarially justified rates for the future. So, we really haven't taken that into consideration yet. We're hopeful there's some conservatism in those numbers, but until we finalize the work with the state and get actuarially justified rates, that's still a bit of an open item. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Hi, everybody. Thanks. Just \u2013 maybe I'll ask about the capital deployment. I know \u2013 if I look at what you did in the current quarter, that's consistent with your $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion you might even to \u2013 $1 billion in target for the year, you might even need to step up a little bit in the back half to get to where you're trying to be, but I also know that coming out of the Cigna transaction, I think Joe had mentioned in the spring at some events that there were some tuck-in MA-type of deals that you were looking at. Something \u2013 maybe things along the line of the Simply Healthcare deal you did a few years ago. Can you update us on your thinking about capital deployment there? And I know, Joe, you have a lot of interaction in Washington. Do you have \u2013 have you gotten any sense of the administration and their views on industry consolidation relative to what you may have faced in previous administrations? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, A.J. Thanks for the question. Let me briefly address the capital and then I'll turn it over to Joe to \u2013 and he wants to talk about the rest of your question. So, in terms of the capital, you're exactly right that we've begun our share buyback once the Cigna deal was terminated. And your thought process on we may need to do a little bit faster acceleration in the second half than we have so far, I would say, on a weekly basis, we are exactly on track to delivering that $1.5 billion to $2 billion, because we didn't start the share buyback until into the second quarter, because we didn't have the finalization of the Cigna thing until several weeks into the second quarter. So, when you look at our path that we have in terms of share buyback on a weekly basis, we feel very good about our ability to deliver back to the shareholders the $1.5 billion to $2 billion. So, anyway, Joe, I'll turn it over to you for the other part of A.J.'s question. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Right. Good morning, A.J. Thanks for the question. Very quickly, maybe chop your question up into a couple parts. First of all, regarding some prior comments regarding M&A around MA, we still are very focused on examining markets, market by market looking at opportunities. Yes, we're still mindful of the opportunities for tuck-ins. We think that there certainly are opportunities that we should focus on very carefully and so we're going to continue that pursuit. As you know, we've got a MA platform that is now restructured and completely ready for expansion, both organically as well as by way of M&A. So, we're going to keep our options open. We're going to continue to look at the right fit for us in the markets that we believe where we can perform at a very, very high level. And so, we do have teams that are very actively engaged and focused on the best proposition possible. M&A, broadly speaking, is still a very significant long-term strategy for us given that \u2013 kind of an overarching theme is that it's still all about access, affordability and quality of services, both with respect to service as well as safety. We're very mindful of that fact that scale does matter in this pursuit, and we will continue to very carefully examine the marketplace to assess our optionality, our targets and hopefully create fits that are really synergistic with respect to how we're going to best serve the marketplace. Great example of \u2013 you may recall, a few years ago, the acquisition of Simply Healthcare probably stands out as the kind of transaction that I think and will be incredibly beneficial for the company, not just serving the marketplace, but also from a financial perspective being a great fit with respect to the synergies that I mentioned a moment ago, Simply was a incredibly well-run company. And I think we're very pleased to be able to, brought that into our portfolio, then being able to leverage off of that significant strength that it brought to us and continue to expand in the Florida marketplace. I think that \u2013 hopefully that's a response to the question about M&A and more specifically MA open for more questions there. With respect to the political landscape, I think we're all very observant of what's happening. I don't think it's an exaggeration by the hour, leading up to just maybe a week or so ago, we tried to stay very, very engaged in sharing our thoughts about what it would take to stabilize the marketplace. We do have ingredients that we have continually communicated as sort of the recipe or the ingredients to create stabilization in the marketplace, the ingredients that we believe will repair the Affordable Care Act issues that we've come upon repeatedly over the last few years, and we do believe we have been heard. A.J., with respect to how that all might play out in the end with respect to policy decisions that will be made by way of a vote in Congress, I think, is anybody's guess, but quite frankly, we do believe we have the ability to share our opinions, our voice is heard, and we're hopeful that the kind of stabilization, we believe, is essential to best serve our marketplace is going to be embedded in whatever may come out of Congress. There are other points of view that maybe nothing will happen in the short run. I can't weigh in on that at all. I don't know. But again, we're very hopeful, and we do believe that stabilization is a distinct possibility and obviously, as I said, we will continue to make the contributions necessary for our voice to be heard, as well as the voice of the industry overall. So, thanks for the question, and I look forward to maybe talking more about this as these policy decisions are created and put into force. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to ask a couple of questions on the Individual business. First, in the three states where you're downsizing next year, do they contribute a disproportionate amount of the losses this year? I know it's a small percentage of your membership, but would love to get a sense for how profitable those states are. And then, Joe, you commented that you might have to revisit your rates for 2018 if the level of uncertainty changes. Is that primarily CSRs? Or are there other reasons that you might have to come back and look at the rates? Thanks. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah, hey, Chris, thanks for the question. I'll address the first half and that's about the three states. As you indicated, it is a very small component of our membership associated with individual exchanges. In terms of profitability, it really is not significant, one way or another, in terms of the overall profile for the Individual book of business. So, it in and of itself is not a significant driver in terms of 2017 expectations. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Okay. Yeah. John, thank you very much for that comment. With respect to rates, you asked a question about what other characteristics of the market might influence our decisions around rate adjustment. Clearly, CSR is a standout. We've repeatedly said that that aspect of pricing and the subsidies that support membership in our markets can translate to as much as a \u2013 maybe 18% to 20% uptick in premium, if subsidies aren't granted. It remains to be seen whether that will ultimately be allowed, but if not, then obviously we're going to have to revisit our pricing market by market in order to judge whether or not pricing adjustment is necessary or even if re-entry on any measure of scale is appropriate. As I said earlier, so much is dependent on stability of each of those markets of which you may know. We have 139 rating regions and so those rating regions are going to be carefully analyzed, sliced and diced and then determined if quite frankly a rating \u2013 or excuse me, a premium increase is tolerable beyond a certain point, and if in fact we will be able to remain as an active participant in those rating regions. Right now, as you know, our extraction represents about 10% of membership and our hope that between now and, let's say, through September a lot of decisions will be made, but I can't underscore that time is of the essence, and some of our critical decisions may have to occur in a relatively short period of time. So, I would tell you, the decision making is going to be, as they say, fast and furious and time is of the essence for us to make the right decisions for the benefit of the markets we serve, the membership we serve, as well as for the company overall. John? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you, Joe. And, Chris, I was just going to maybe expand on your question about, is CSRs the only issue. Maybe a sort of think through what that means when we talk about CSRs. CSR \u2013 without CSR funding, as Joe said, we're talking about incremental 20-plus-percent rate increases. Well, we have 20-plus-percent rate increases with CNRs (38:40), so those are additive to each other. And in order to come up with a target margin with that level of rate increase is really a very difficult thing to do. And you look at \u2013 gee, if CSRs are not there, then what does that do to the number of people who are actually going to participate in the exchanges? And so then if that changes, how does that impact the risk profile or the risk pool associated with it? How will that then impact our ability to collect risk adjusters and the price for that and the various other aspects? So, there really is \u2013 this one item impacts multiple things downstream in terms of how we look and assess at these things. So, I just wanted to make sure it wasn't just the CSR, it was all the ramifications and there are many associated with that. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. And John's absolutely right, there's a cascading effect. One other key ingredient, which is material, is the tax. And the tax, if it were to have the moratorium lifted, it's probably something on the order of 4% to 5% premium increase, so you can see the compounding effect of all of these issues that don't map to stabilization that then creates this cascading effect that John mentioned earlier. So, again, that's all included in our analytics specific to 139 rating regions that we are looking at very carefully to judge the in and out decisions that we have to make. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold from Cowen. Please go ahead. Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi there. A couple of things. Thanks for the question. One, with respect to Iowa, what are your options? What if you don't get what you view as actuarially sound rate, can you exit? I'm not sure what the contract gives you in terms of latitude. And then in D.C., I understand the whole issue with CSRs. How much can the administration do? Like if the Trump administration stops saying, we're not going to fund this, we're going to let it implode, is that enough or do you need legislation and where do you think the administration can do something and is willing to versus where you need to see legislation? Thanks. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Two parts, one, Iowa; one CSR in terms of further exploring that issue. Regarding Iowa, we got a great state partner and, obviously, we've been engaged in dialogue with them now for a quite lengthy period of time and we're very hopeful that, as John pointed out in his remarks, the actuarial soundness that we're pursuing, I think, will be made clear and the right decisions will be able to occur. And again, it's a work in process and I think going beyond, any kind of conversation at that level, I think, is not appropriate given the intricacy of the dialogue that we're having with our state partners. And with respect to contract terms, obviously, probably, in fact, cannot go into those terms at this time, but in the main we do believe that over time we'll be able to have the right kind of facts laid out that demonstrates the degree of adjustments that are necessary to create the actuarial soundness that we need to continue to serve the membership in Iowa. So, we're optimistic, but it is truly a work in process. With respect to CSR, there are a variety of paths and, obviously, the first path focuses specifically on action taken by Congress and if CSRs will be embedded in some type of legislative model and that's going to have to kind of play out based on the votes that occur in Congress. Absent that, and again I don't want to predict where all of that might go with respect to yet again another path, but obviously, there may be other choices that may occur related to funding by other means. Funding specific to an action taken by the administration, but I think put it altogether, I believe that the leadership that we deal with in Washington are very mindful and fully aware of how CSR really maps to stabilization and, in particular, the effect on premium increases for the people that we serve across the country. So, I think it's \u2013 that too is a work in process, but it's yet \u2013 remains to be seen exactly how that funding will flow to us to support our marketplace. We just don't know yet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch from BMO. Please go ahead. Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets : Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Question, if you could just \u2013 you had mentioned higher-than-expected enrollment losses or maybe it wasn't losses, maybe it was slower growth in the BlueCard product. Can you just talk about that and talk about your outlook for your own large employer, ASO National Account enrollment going into next year and how good a vehicle you think BlueCard is going to continue to be for you? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. Sure, thanks, Matt. So, in terms of the BlueCard, as I had \u2013 in the prepared comments had talked about that that was an offset to some of our other gains in terms of our overall membership outlook. And just to remind everyone, BlueCard is where it's another Blue Cross and Blue Shield carrier and owns the account and has sold the account and their member as a resident in our state is a typical methodology of how we obtain BlueCard membership, and that was a bit lower. However, as we look at the national account selling season, we really are pleased with the expected growth in membership for 2018. It's been a bit quiet for large jumbo national accounts, but we're a very strong player in the market and we expect to at least hold, if not, increase our market share in the national account space. We've had some great success with zero trend guarantees related to first-year customers. We have consistently delivered on that guarantee, providing value, saving customers medical cost. And we already have received a few RFPs for 2019, so we feel pretty good about our positioning, and quite honestly we're not all that worried about the small drop in BlueCard membership year-over-year, because we think that national accounts is \u2013 that the sales cycle is going to work its way out and that we're going to do just fine. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Morning. I wanted to ask a little bit about the PBM or RFP process, and understand you can't go into the specifics on who is bidding what right now. But if you could talk a little bit about what you've learned going through the process, in particular, your views on hybrid versus outsourcing, your views on which functions perhaps are best housed within your company. And also what segments on the insurance side do you think would benefit the most from a growth perspective from the improved pharmacy rates? Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Great. Lance, thanks for the question regarding PBM. Questions really come at us repeatedly on this point and obviously, it's evolutionary from the very beginning back in January of 2016. And go back in time, we've always stated that we would make it very clear, quite frankly make a clear statement of the choice we've made in terms of contracting by the end of the fourth quarter and we still are committed to that. With respect to that, we've been engaged in a very analytical process. You all well know that RFPs went to the market and we now have received those RFPs and are in an analytical mode that's very thoughtful, very thorough. And as we've repeatedly said, we think our pursuit has always been about optionality and kind of constructing a hybrid model has been one of those options that we've carefully evaluated, meaning that we have probably multiple paths that can best serve our customers, our members, whether it's a mail order proposition that is sent out to someone to administer by way of maybe private labeling it, the fact that we will always retain control of our formulary, and then other characteristics of a hybrid model, which represents various constructs within a model that equates to great value for our membership. Of course, the other extreme would be to send it all out to another vendor and so we've always been mindful of the many choices we have, which I think speaks to the power, the significance of optionality being very much in our favor. We've stood by, as you well know, our expectation in terms of $3 billion per year in terms of savings, go forward at 01/01/2020 and beyond and nothing that has occurred thus far has moved us off of that expectation. And so again, we're working very carefully with respect to the analytics around an RFP. I do want to underscore that it's not just about the money. It has a lot to do with customer service, our commitment to a transition that is virtually seamless. Given the complexities, we well recognize that and so whichever direction we go in, we will be very careful in our choices regarding best serving our customers with a seamless transition. So, it's obviously a complicated formula for success, but it's literally \u2013 it's all hands on deck to get us from today to 01/01/2020 and I feel really good about the path we're on and I don't think there are any complexities that we aren't aware of and working on. And I think we again feel very, very good about the process and what potential will come our way in terms of very positive characteristics beginning 01/01/2020. John? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you, Joe. And, Lance, in terms of the second part of your question of growth areas, I'm not understating this when I say that it will impact and help every line of business we have. And in terms of existing business, it will be very significant for new business and maybe specifically the question you're looking for is that we believe it will make our Medicare business that much more competitive, our Medicare Part D that much more competitive. We are growing that because of all the other benefits and things that we offer to the marketplace, we think it'll really help accelerate the growth in that area. And then in the Large Group ASO, it's not uncommon to have a PBM carve-out as part of the National Accounts or the Large Group ASO, and we believe that we can minimize the PBM carve-outs on that in the future, that's just two examples, but when I say it will help every line of business, we believe it will help every line of business. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Just got a quick question on Individual and then a follow-up on Medicaid. So, Joe, on the Individual ACA-compliant business, you've previously indicated a focus on getting to profitability here in 2018, or exiting where you needed to. Understanding that there're still unknowns, should that still be our expectation next year in terms of how you're making decisions in this business? Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Justin, thanks for the question specific to this continued formation of the ACA marketplace. We've always said that our target is 3% to 5% margin. We certainly haven't backed off of that. As you can imagine, toward the day-to-day grind of best managing that portfolio is governed in large measure by rules of engagement and the stabilization necessities that I talked about earlier coming to reality. Our sense is that stabilization is a distinct possibility. We are still committed to the 3% to 5% margin performance and we're also committed, as I've said repeatedly over nearly a year now and going back to last summer, kind of worked off the characterization of surgical extraction, we still are very focused on that as well. And I think, Justin, that we will make the right decisions with respect to engagement in the market, detachment from a market. Our hope is that we will be able to continue to perform in a very robust and meaningful manner in all 139 rating regions, but so much depends on how legislative process plays out and what stabilization rules are put into place, but again I'll reiterate, we're still hopeful that a 3% to 5% margin is achievable. And so, John, I don't know if you want to add to kind of the outlook and how engaged we are in making that a reality. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. So, no, Justin, as Joe said, we're committed to that. I just maybe wanted to reframe the 2018 commentary you said. Back in 2014, we did extremely well in exchanges. And then, 2015, we ended up being closer to breakeven, and that's when we really saw how the co-ops were pricing on an irrational basis, some of the other issues were going on in terms of the stability of the marketplace. And we've looked at it and thought it would take a few years for all that to work its way through, again, for some of the co-ops to continue to exit and we predicted that it wouldn't be until 2018 until the marketplace obtains stability. So, we still, as Joe said, believe that that's possible with the appropriate regulatory and legislative changes. But as you've phrased your question, I would say, the short answer is yes. We want to ensure that there is a path to target margins in a sustainable marketplace. Did you have a follow-up on Medicaid? Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Just to repeat, Medicaid rates for 2018, anything you could tell us there, and specifically the governor's budget indicated in California that 2018 Medicaid expansion rates might be cut high single digits. Just want to hear what you guys saw there in California Medicaid expansion, particularly. Thanks. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah, thanks, Justin. So, in terms of 2018, the Medicaid, it's a little premature to talk about the specificity and we really would prefer not to talk about any one state. We're closing in on being in 50% of the states of America in terms of providing Medicaid services. And as you can imagine, within all those states, some do a little bit better and some don't do as well as we would have liked, and it's really a portfolio type approach. And it's really, I think, premature to discuss any one particular state, especially for 2018, other than to say that we are extremely high on the pipeline associated with future Medicaid opportunities and continue to capitalize on that. And we do see it as a growth area for the company, even without Medicaid expansion in the future with all the other various long-term support services; aged, blind and disabled; and various other things that are all part of the future pipeline. So, Medicaid clearly is continuing to be a growth area for us in the future. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. We're seeing an investment cycle pickup at your peers in adding to IT and analytic assets, especially in the artificial intelligence area which feeds into strategy decisions around benefit design and underwriting. So, can you speak to where Anthem is in the investment cycle on IT? And what Anthem is doing specifically on the AI front? Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Sarah, that's kind of the question that is very powerful perspective on the future of our industry. I've been a great believer that so-called secret sauce for our performance in the marketplace moving into the future is all about translating data to information, meaningful information that supports our provider community, especially in terms of better choices that they can make in and around evidence-based practice. Information that supports the needs of our consumers given the significant risk position that they're now being subjected to in terms of higher deductibles, etcetera. They need to make very well-informed decisions in terms of accessing healthcare and remaining healthy. Therefore, we are very committed to the wellbeing of all of our members. In that regard to your point about artificial intelligence and the foundational aspect of how you support the development of useful information, we're investing quite heavily with respect to data infrastructure, foundational buildout with respect to our IT systems. We are definitely using artificial intelligence today and optimizing our ACA benefits across 139 rating regions and actually, this has been a three-year journey for us in the AI space specific to that process. Again, I do want to underscore we will recognize that this is the future of a very successful health benefit manager and in that regard, the appropriative amount of funding is being distributed, allocated to our technologies that will advance artificial intelligence that can best support the needs of all the interests that we engage with, whether it's a provider or a consumer, government, what have you, we are intimately involved in building out that kind of capability today. Hopefully in the near future, we'll be able to talk more about that. So, thanks for questions. Very appropriate and very significant. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the conference back to the company's management with the closing comments. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Great. Thank you, operator. And thank you all for your questions. They were great questions today. And I just want to underscore that as a company we remain committed to confronting some really tough questions and challenges in and around the healthcare delivery system, as we are focused on expanding access to high-quality affordable healthcare to our customers. And I think that it's really critical for me to underscore the key contributors to that success being our associates who've given continued support to the company and to our customers, which total 40.4 million members. And our associates do that every day with incredible commitment. Thank you all for your interest in Anthem, and we look forward to speaking with you soon at upcoming conferences. Thank you very much for the time. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 11 AM Eastern Time today through August 19.

Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Anthem Third Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time all lines are in listen-only mode. Later there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Doug Simpson - Anthem, Inc.: Good morning and welcome to Anthem's third quarter 2017 earnings call. This is Doug Simpson and with us this morning are Joe Swedish, Chairman, President and CEO; and John Gallina, our CFO. Joe will begin the call by giving an overview of our third quarter financial results, discussing our business unit performance, and providing some qualitative remarks around our strategic positioning and high-level headwinds and tailwinds going into 2018. John will then discuss in more detail our key financial metrics, performance during the quarter, and provide some details on our updated 2017 outlook. We will then be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectation. We advice listeners to review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Joe. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you, Doug, and good morning. Before we discuss our third quarter financials, I wanted to take a moment to highlight the acquisition of America's 1st Choice that was announced last night. America's 1st Choice is a Medicare Advantage company that offers HMO products, including Chronic Special Needs Plans and Dual-eligible Special Needs Plans. America's 1st Choice currently serves approximately 130,000 members through its proprietary technology tools, managerial processes, and member engagement programs that helps the company deliver efficient, cost-effective healthcare services to its members. Its two health plans in Florida receive a 5.0 and 4.0 Star Rating for 2018. The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018 and be slightly accretive to earnings in year one. Turning to discuss our third quarter financials, we announced GAAP earnings per share of $2.80 and adjusted earnings per share of $2.65, reflecting continued strong execution across our businesses. We ended the third quarter with 40.3 million members, translating to a growth of 338,000 lives since the end of 2016. We continue to be pleased with the enrollment trends in our Commercial group insured business, which grew again during the quarter. Our Individual enrollment declined by 83,000 lives in the quarter, as expected. As of September 30, 2017, our total Individual enrollment was approximately 1.7 million members, consisting of 1.4 million ACA compliant members and approximately 300,000 non-ACA compliant members. Of the 1.4 million ACA-compliant members, a little more than 900,000 were from the Individual exchanges. Finally, our employer self-funded business grew by a little more than 100,000 members during the quarter, as we continued to win new sales and benefit from an improving labor market. Our membership results translated into top line growth that continues to be solid, with consolidated third quarter operating revenues of $22.1 billion, an increase of nearly $1 billion, or 4.6%, versus the third quarter of 2016. The benefit expense ratio in the third quarter of 87% came in slightly better than expectations, reflecting improved claims trends in Individual, continued strong performance in our Local Group insured business, and the impact of a retroactive revenue adjustment in Medicaid. Our third quarter SG&A expense ratio of 13.6% came in higher than expectation, as we increased spending on our growth initiatives during the quarter and recorded slightly higher than expected incentive compensation expense due to the outperformance in the quarter. Finally, cash flow remains very strong and we generated over $2.4 billion in operating cash flow during the quarter, bringing year-to-date operating cash flow to $5.5 billion, or 2.1 times net income. John will go into more detail in a moment, but our third quarter operating cash flow is impacted by several timing items that are expected to reverse in the fourth quarter. Moving on to our business unit results, our enterprise earnings reflected contributions from both our Commercial and Government segment. In Commercial, operating revenues grew by 4.1% versus the prior-year quarter to $10.1 billion in the third quarter of 2017. The increase was mainly driven by premium rate increases, reflecting overall cost trends in our Individual and Local Group businesses, as well as enrollment growth primarily in the Local Group business. These increases were partially offset by the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017, as well as lower current year risk adjustment accruals versus the prior-year quarter. Our third quarter 2017 operating margin for Commercial of 5.3% declined by 130 basis points from 6.6% in the third quarter 2016. The decline was due to the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017 and the higher investment spending in the current year quarter. The decline was partially offset by improved medical cost experienced in our Individual business, as well as the impact of continued strong operating performance in our Local Group insured business. Our Specialty business continues to perform well in 2017. Our dental membership has now increased by 317,000, or 5.8%, this year and vision membership has increased by 517,000, or 8.1%, this year. As a company, we continue to make the necessary investments to capitalize on our opportunity to improve the Specialty penetration rate of our medical book of business. In the Individual ACA-compliant business, our third quarter financial performance was slightly better than our most recent expectations. As a result, our updated claims projection for 2017 have improved, as the morbidity of our population is slightly better than we previously estimated and our medical management efforts are positively impacting our results. These improvements are partially offset by a reduction to our current year risk adjuster receivable estimates. Overall, our updated 2017 guidance now assumes that this business will be relatively breakeven. It is important to note that our outlook currently assumes that CSR subsidy cut does not have a material impact on our results. However, additional regulatory clarity is required for us to fully understand the financial impact of ending CSR subsidy. In 2018, our Individual ACA-compliant market participation will look materially different than it does today. As a company, our strategy has been and will continue to be to only participate in rating regions where we have an appropriate level of confidence that the financial performance in these markets is predictable. We will offer Individual ACA-compliant products in 56 of the 143 rating regions across our 14 states in 2018. To put our 2018 market footprint into perspective, the rating regions where we are no longer participating represent a little more than one-half of our expected 2017 Individual ACA-compliant membership. In addition, we were selective in the plan offerings we put into the remaining markets. In total, we believe these actions will cause our Individual ACA-compliant membership to decline by approximately 70%. There were multiple factors that were considered in each market to determine whether or not continued participation was appropriate. Unfortunately, marketplace instability created a variety of uncertainties, including cost sharing reduction subsidy funding. The uncertainty around CSR subsidy funding was an important factor, as we engaged in constructive dialogue with state regulators and evaluated the appropriate levels of participation. Based on the information we know today, we are expecting our 2018 Individual ACA-compliant membership to be slightly profitable in 2018, albeit below our long-term target operating margins of 3% to 5%. We are continuing to closely monitor state and federal legislative and regulatory developments. And if the level of uncertainty in the marketplace is reduced, we would have increased confidence to reenter certain rating regions in 2019. Shifting to the Government business, operating revenues of $12 billion in the third quarter grew by 5% compared to the prior year. Operating margin for the Government Business was 3.8% during the third quarter 2017, a decline of 40 basis points compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily due to the impact of higher investment spending in the current year quarter and the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017, partially offset by the impact of retroactive revenue adjustments in the Medicaid business. Our margin performance was in line with the expectations in the Medicaid business, excluding the impact of a retro revenue adjustment, which had previously been expected to be realized in the fourth quarter. We continue to work with the State of Iowa and CMS on approving final 2017 rate increases, and we are hopeful that this process will be completed by the end of the year. We continue to see a significant RFP pipeline of opportunity in the Medicaid business over the next five years, largely within specialized services populations. In addition, we're looking to continue our momentum in forming strategic alliances with other health plans that allows them to utilize our best-in-class Medicaid operating platform and enables us to further augment growth. In the Medicare business, our core gross margin performance continues to be in line with expectations. We're pleased to have grown membership again this quarter in our Medicare Advantage business. During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of HealthSun, a South Florida Medicare health plan and a provider system, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. The HealthSun acquisition is an example of our commitment to expanding our footprint in an attractive geography with a well-run asset. We're also pleased with the CMS Star Ratings that were recently released. More than 60% of our 2018 Medicare Advantage membership will reside in 4.0 Star or higher plans, a meaningful increase from the 22% we had in 2016. Additionally, three of our plans received a 5.0 Star rating, and the HealthSun and America's 1st Choice assets each have a plan that received 5.0 Star Ratings as well. We feel very well positioned to continue to capitalize on our growth opportunities in the Medicare Advantage business going into 2018. Before I turn the call over to John, I wanted to provide a few high-level thoughts on our financial outlook. For 2017, we increased our adjusted EPS outlook to a range of $11.90 to $12. As it relates to next year, we're currently developing our 2018 plan. There are a few high-level headwinds and tailwinds that we've identified, which will impact our financial performance next year relative to 2017. The primary headwinds to earnings that we are managing through are, the return of the health insurance tax and the timing impact of midyear contract renewals, which we expect will impact 2018 by a little more than $0.40 per share, and the impact of fixed cost deleveraging from Individual ACA-compliant market exits. As I stated earlier, we currently expect our Individual ACA-compliant footprint to decline by approximately 70%, which covered fixed costs that otherwise would've been allocated elsewhere in 2017. For tailwinds to earnings in 2018, we expect continued enrollment growth in Medicare, Medicaid, Specialty, and employer self-funded product offerings. Next, improved profitability in the Individual ACA-compliant business, from relatively breakeven in 2017 to slightly profitable in 2018. Normalization of incentive compensation expense is another category which is expected to be higher than target based on 2017 financial performance. And finally, capital deployment during 2017, including M&A activity and share repurchases, which were more weighted to the back half of 2017, as well as all of 2018. Taken together, we're targeting a growth rate in 2018 that is consistent with our long-term growth expectations in the high single- to low double-digit range when you exclude the impact of the health insurance tax. We expect to provide more details around our 2018 outlook on our fourth quarter conference call. With that, I'll turn the call over to John to discuss our third quarter financial performance and updated 2017 outlook in more detail. John? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you, Joe, and good morning. I'll begin by discussing the consolidated financial highlights during the third quarter. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.80. These results included net positive adjustment items of $0.15 per share. Excluding these items, our adjusted earnings per share was $2.65 for the quarter. These results reflect our continued strong underlying financial performance. Operating revenues in the third quarter totaled $22.1 billion, an increase of $972 million, or 4.6%, versus the third quarter of 2016. The growth was primarily driven by premium rate increases across all lines of business to cover overall cost trends, as well as enrollment growth in our Large Group, Medicare Advantage, and Medicaid businesses. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the one-year waiver of the non-tax deductible health insurance tax in 2017, as well as lower current year risk adjustment accruals compared to the prior-year quarter. Our benefit expense ratio of 87% in the third quarter increased by 150 basis points from the prior-year quarter. This increase, which was slightly better than expectations, was largely driven by the impact of the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax, partially offset by improved medical cost performance in the Individual business. Additionally, we benefited from a retroactive revenue adjustment in the Medicaid business, which was expected to be received in the fourth quarter. Our third quarter 2017 SG&A expense ratio of 13.6% declined by 120 basis points from the 14.8% in the third quarter of 2016. The decrease, as expected, was primarily driven by the impact of the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017 and the impact of fixed cost leverage on operating revenue growth. These items were partially offset by the impact of the increased spend to support growth initiatives during the current year quarter. Now turning to the balance sheet. It's been our practice, we have included a roll forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. For the first nine months of 2017, we experienced favorable prior year reserve development of $1.1 billion, which continues to be better than our expectations. Our reserves continue to include a provision for adverse deviation in the mid-to-high single-digit range, and we believe our reserve balances remained consistent and strong as of September 30, 2017. Our days in claims payable is 40.5 days as of September 30, unchanged from the 40.5 days we reported at the end of the second quarter. Our debt-to-cap ratio was 38.5% as of September 30, 2017, unchanged from the end of 2016 and an increase of 40 basis points from the 38.1% at the end of the second quarter, and reflects the impact of share repurchase activity during the quarter. We repurchased approximately 5.9 million shares of common stock for $1.1 billion at a weighted average share price of $189.85, bringing our total year-to-date share repurchases to 8.8 million shares at a weighted average share price of $186.80. As of September 30, 2017, the company had approximately $2.5 billion of board-approved share repurchase authorization remaining, which we intend to utilize over a multiyear period, subject to market conditions. We ended the third quarter with approximately $2 billion of cash and investments at the parent company, and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $861 million as of the end of the quarter. We used $181 million during the quarter for our cash dividend, and this week our audit committee declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.70 per share to our shareholders. For the three Rs, our balance sheet continues to reflect the net receivable for risk adjusters, although our current year risk adjuster estimate is not as high as we were previously anticipating, as the claims experience in the Individual businesses is coming in slightly ahead of our expectations. Now moving to cash flow. For the third quarter 2017, we generated operating cash flow of $2.4 billion, or 3.2 times net income, and on a year-to-date basis operating cash flow was $5.5 billion, or 2.1 times net income. Our year-to-date cash flow through September 30 continues to be impacted by several timing items that are expected to reverse, including collecting 10 CMS Medicare payments during the first nine months of the year, while only expecting to collect two payments in the fourth quarter; receiving provider capitation pass-through payment funding at the end of the third quarter, which we will be paying to various providers in the fourth quarter. And finally, our original cash flow expectations assume we would make certain Medicaid collar payments in the fourth quarter of 2017, which are now expected to be made in 2018. After adjusting for these timing items, operating cash flow was still strong. We now expect full year 2017 operating cash flows to be greater than $4 billion, reflecting the high quality of our earnings so far this year. Turning to our updated 2017 financial outlook. Our 2017 GAAP earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $10.80 to $10.90, and we have increased our adjusted earnings per share outlook by $0.25 per share at the midpoint to a range of $11.90 to $12. Operating revenues are expected to be in the range of $88.5 billion to $89.5 billion. Fully-insured membership is now expected to be in the range of 15.1 million to 15.2 million, and our self-funded membership in the range of 24.9 million to 25 million, as our Medicaid and BlueCard enrollment is coming in lighter than we previously expected. Taken together, we expect our total membership to now be in the range of 40 million to 40.2 million members. Our 2017 medical loss ratio is now projected to be 86.8%, plus or minus 30 basis points, reflecting better-than-expected performance in our Individual ACA-compliant and Local Group insured businesses. We now expect our SG&A ratio to be at 13.8%, plus or minus 30 basis points, on a GAAP basis, which includes the impact of the Penn Treaty assessments, the 2015 cyber attack litigation settlement, and transaction costs related to the terminated Cigna transaction incurred in the first nine months of 2017. The increase versus our previous expectations now reflects the impact of higher spending in our growth initiatives, as well as higher incentive compensation due to our better-than-expected performance in 2017. We continue to expect our 2017 Local Group insured medical cost trends to be in the range of 6.5% to 7%, with a bias towards the low end of the range. Regarding capital deployment, the 2017 outlook includes some additional share repurchase during the beginning of the fourth quarter, bringing us to the higher end of the $1.5 billion to $2 billion range communicated previously. It is important to note that our outlook does not include any additional transaction or legal cost associated with the terminated Cigna acquisition, beyond those incurred in the first nine months of 2017. Additionally, our outlook also does not include any benefit from lower pharmaceutical pricing, which we continue to believe we are entitled to under our current contract with ESI. With that, operator, please open up the line for questions. Operator : And, ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. We appreciate the commentary directionally on 2018. Now I had a couple of follow-ups. The first one is on the HIP headwinds, $0.20 each, I think, roughly on Commercial and Medicare. Do you see any offsets from utilization into 2018? You have a very good loss ratio in the third quarter, possibly even ex-hurricane it looks really good, given your presence in Texas and Florida. So how should we think about that for 2018? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Hey, Ana. This is John. Thank you for your question. Yeah, the HIP headwind \u2013 make sure I've got your question correct. Yeah, we've actually got a tailwind here in 2017 associated with HIP of about $0.20. That then turns into a little bit more than a $0.40 headwind in 2018. But specifically related to the hurricane, it really didn't impact us that much. We do not have the Blue properties in either Florida or Texas. And the Medicaid business that we had was fairly well-controlled. So the hurricane \u2013 neither of the hurricanes really had a significant financial impact to our results or our outlook. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Just want to go to exchanges and your exchange expectations into next year. I guess, how do you approach it in terms of just an overall enrollment? I mean, is it just expectation that things are stable? Do you expect there to be a lot of churn? How committed are you, I guess, to the marketplace in general? I mean, if you expect membership to be down 70%, kind of what's the benefit of sticking it out? And then just a follow-up around that was just, the executive order, how you see that potentially impacting you? Any thoughts on how the short-term plans \u2013 or how you think association health plans will sort of impact the small group for you? Just trying to get a sense of your position and how disruptive that may or may not be. Thank you. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Ralph, this is John. Why don't I start out by addressing a couple of your financial questions, and then I think Joe will weigh in on some of the strategic elements to your questions. In terms of the enrollment, as Joe stated, we're expecting our footprint to decrease by about 70% in 2018 from our current 2017 perspective. That's about half of the rating regions that we're currently in, we're getting out of, maybe a little bit more than that. And then for the rating regions that we're staying in, really refining our product designs and our offering in the various meta levels, and that all relates to about a 70% decrease in footprint. In terms of being committed, it's really related to providing optionality associated with 2019 and where do we want to head in 2019 based on what happens in 2018. It's really premature for us to make a decision on 2019 today. So with that \u2013 well, obviously, we do have the CSR funding issues need to be resolved as well, and that's part of why we're actually pretty comfortable with the significant drop in membership that we have in 2018, given the uncertainty of that area. So a lot needs to be resolved in the next 12 months before there's a final declaration. But we've been in this business since day one, and we think it can be a viable business, assuming that the appropriate legislative and regulatory fixes are in place. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. Ralph, good morning. Let me weigh in based on that background. I think that \u2013 well, let me key in on one phrase you used, which is sticking it out. I think, surgically speaking, I've used that term quite often in the last year. I think we've successfully repositioned ourselves in a way that allows us to participate in a more stable environment with respect to the rating regions that we have remained in. Specifically, we will continue to participate in 56 of the 143 rating regions, which, comparatively speaking, we were in virtually all of the rating regions previously. My sense is that where we are sticking it out, we've got, I think, a reasonably good line of sight to the year. And our expectation is that by the end of 2018, we'll be making the choices that are necessary, considering the advancement of stability, which still there's tremendous amount of lack of clarity in terms of what the future state might look like until further legislation occurs or specificity around certain policy announcements bring clarity. So long story short, I think, again, surgically we're very well-positioned. I think our pricing is appropriate relative to the hand that's been dealt us. And so, again, I think we have said that we're targeting a low single-digit margin, albeit certainly not at the 3% to 5% target that we continually hope to achieve. We're not there yet. But as John just pointed out, I think we've got the technical and kind of the strategic insights necessary to effectively perform that then we are well-positioned to make the right choices by the end of 2018. So, hopefully, that gives you some line of sight with respect to the ask about our ability to stick it out. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. Can you just quantify how much the Medicaid retroactive payment was in the quarter? And, I guess, just clarify, it sounds like you're saying it was in your guidance. This is just the timing of it that was the issue, as far as the guidance goes, that did not contribute to your guidance raise. Is that correct? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. You're correct with your assessment there at the end of your question. We really don't go into exactly how much a retroactive adjustment is. There are retroactive adjustments in the Medicaid arena on really a regular basis. We only spike it out when it's material enough to move the needle. But we have retroactive adjustments every quarter within that \u2013 our block of business, and we have been expecting it all along and we expected it to occur in the fourth quarter. So we actually got it early, which is good news. But it did not change our annual guidance at all. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead. Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company : Hi. Two questions. One, prior period development looked pretty significant. Was it heavily weighted towards Government or Commercial? And looking at Commercial earnings, they were down about 15% year-over-year this quarter versus about 10% in the prior quarter. And I think the prior quarter also had some cyber security drain. Is there a comp issue we should be thinking about when looking at this quarter year-over-year on the Commercial operating earnings that I'm maybe forgetting about? Thanks. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Hey, Christine. On the PPIA, I'll say that our reserves have been calculated consistently conservative across all lines of business. And some of the favorable results, I think, reflect the fact that we do have consistently conservative methodologies associated with our reserving patterns. So I really can't say more about a specific line of business after that, but we continue to target a high single-digit margin for adverse deviation. And again, we believe our reserves continue to be consistent and conservative. In terms of the other questions of year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter, there are several things that are going on. Obviously, the HIP Fee always impacts every analysis, and the fact that we had HIP Fee in 2016, and then not in 2017, and then presumably we'll have it again in 2018, profitability by line of business, all the ratios, all the metrics, are all really non-comparable. You're correct in terms of compensation expense, and basically our bonus program had issues in 2016, if you recall. We reduced our compensation in 2016 and we have been fortunate enough that we have not had to do that yet in 2017. Hopefully that helps answer your questions. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Can you talk about what you are assuming now in updated 2017 guidance for Iowa performance relative to what I think was breakeven expectation in the second half of this year on actuarially sound rates? And then can you tell us why admin fees were down nearly $100 million sequentially in the third quarter? Thanks. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Justin, good morning. This is Joe again. With respect to Iowa, we're continuing negotiations with the state, and there are adjustments that have occurred from time to time and we're in the middle of negotiations as we speak. And there have been some recommendations with respect to those rate adjustments, which we've now \u2013 those adjustments have been put forward to CMS for review and, hopefully, approval. We've not heard back from CMS as yet and expect at least, hopefully, we'll get something by the end of 2017. But in any event, Iowa is still a work in process, and obviously we're always optimistic that we'll finally be able to work out the situation there. And so, I guess, we'll just have to ask you to kind of stay tuned with respect to the final solution that will be given to us by CMS. John, do you want to speak to the other matter? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. On the admin fees, there's really nothing within that line item that's problematic or an issue, Justin. It's a good question. The revenues are very much in line with expectations. Our membership is very strong. We did exit the Massachusetts Medicaid ASO arrangement that caused that to drop out and just some other true-ups, but nothing that's really overwhelming associated with that line item. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Management embarked on some fairly significant SG&A streamlining efficiency initiatives going back, I think, as early as maybe 2015. Some of that SG&A savings continued in 2016, obviously, over and above the comp issues that you've already discussed. And then in the press release today you talk about some investments in growth initiatives. I wondered if you could describe where you've been able to take costs out, and then where you are now putting costs into the business, and kind of clarify that those are distinctly different buckets. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah, Dave, great question. This is John. So, happy to respond to that. In terms of where we're taking costs out, we continue to focus on non-value-added services, things that really don't provide a lot of impact to the members and eliminating any duplication of processes and things like that, and just being wise stewards of shareholder dollars and member premiums. In terms of some growth initiatives, I'll just give you a few examples just to get you comfortable on that, like, for instance, we're really building out our capabilities to enhance our position with the employer group retiree business for Medicare offerings is an example that we see some significant long-term potential, and we really need to enhance our capabilities. We're focusing on the aging population, and what we mean by that is, let's take a look at the 63 and 64-year-olds, who actually buy insurance through Anthem's Commercial marketplace and get them signed up for a Medicare offering when they age into Medicare. Addition, building out offerings for Specialty, stop loss, integrated healthcare management for ASO customers. All very specific items associated with our growth imperatives and our growth strategies that are clearly different than systems consolidation and elimination of duplicate processes. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah, let me jump in here. Thanks, John, and maybe I can step up a little bit higher just to let you know, just by reminder, back in first quarter communicated to you that we've embarked upon some really detailed review of our SG&A specific to capturing more efficiencies as we service our customers. I challenged our senior leadership at that time to take a really hard look at our relative performance, as well as our cultural characteristics, and we compared ourselves against our competitors and performance variations across our business environment. We are taking those insights and really translating it to strengthening the assets that we do have, and by way of some specific examples, for instance, our service operation center is really getting streamlined tightly now with respect to how well we service each one of our members with respect to their necessity to have a very efficient and effective engagement with us. So we're taking out costs, but translating that level of performance in a way that leverages, for instance, digitization by way of mobile technologies, by way of other assets that makes it a lot easier for our customers to use our business model. And so, I guess, that's just one small example, but we've got a really significant commitment now to digitization that gives the kind of leverage we think is necessary to optimize the spend that we've historically placed with respect to eliminating customer abrasion. Again, one small example is producing very meaningful large results for us, in addition to what John said with respect to capital deployment that really is supporting our growth imperatives, which we've mentioned to you. I think there's seven key areas I won't get back into, because we've made that clear to you with respect to where we're putting our commitment going forward with respect to growth. But it's literally just reallocating our cost structure in a way that optimizes our commitment to our customers, as well as our growth imperatives. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Just one quick clarifying, could you remind us of the 1.7 million Individual, how many are ACA-compliant? And then my real question relates to Medicare Advantage. How do you guys think you'll grow organically next year when you think about how your plans stack up against the competition? Do you think you're positioned to take market share or grow more in line with the market? Just wondering how you're thinking about that. Thanks. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. So, Chris, this is John. In terms of the Individual membership, we have about 1.4 million ACA-compliant, and of that 1.4 million ACA-compliant a little less than 1 million of it, maybe a little bit more than 900,000 actually purchased via the exchanges. So that, hopefully, will help you reconcile that. In terms of where we are in the marketplace we feel very comfortable with our ability to grow. We're going to grow our self-funded membership, we're going to grow our Medicare membership above and beyond the M&A issues that we have in terms of nice Medicare growth associated with the two acquisitions that we've announced here in the last several weeks, continue to grow that. Local Group, we expect the enrollment to be stable in a slightly shrinking marketplace, in terms of the overall market share we expect our market share to increase, so our enrollment will stay stable in that. So we feel pretty good about where we're positioned and, of course, the Medicaid pipeline continues to be extremely strong in terms of some of the specialized services, whether it's LTSS populations, aged, blind and disabled, various other areas within Medicaid that have not historically been in a Medicaid managed care arrangement that we can provide a lot of savings to the states by providing our support there. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Two-part question. One, I just wanted to make sure I'm following what you had laid out for 2018 correctly. So, midpoint of this year would be $11.95. Midpoint of your long-term guidance 10% growth takes you to $13.15. Back off $0.40 of HIP would be about $12.75 for 2018. So is that \u2013 is there anything wrong with that math? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Gary, your math is very credible and reasonable without \u2013 saying that we, obviously, can't comment on specific point estimates, and I really don't want to go into providing guidance on 2018 yet, since our planning process is not yet complete. But your math is credible. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. I appreciate the comments around the exit in specific exchange counties with lack of clarity, but I wanted to get a little bit more context around the evaluation process and what you perceived as the biggest risk or swing factor. So some of the common characteristics in markets where you decided to stay versus commonalities you saw in markets where you decided to leave. Thank you. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Regarding levels of specificity, obviously, it varied by state, as you would expect. And it's obvious there were multiple factors that we considered when we examined the rating regions. In the main, the instability was a big driver for us, and we tried to map the instability that we could observe and determine how then it would be applied to each one of those rating regions. In some cases, we did feel that exiting was appropriate. Then we began working very carefully with state government to get a better line of sight as to what could occur, and then what adjustments would be necessary to create stability that we needed to stay in the marketplace. So we did look at trend expectations and we examined various risk profiles that then gave us some line of sight regarding what our position needed to be. We looked at our competitive factors with respect to how they were performing in the markets. And I think in the main, we were able to target some long-term margin expectations based on how we could price, and then what we would sell. And, quite frankly, at the end of the analytics, we then made decisions to stay in certain rating regions and exit others. So I think that that probably pretty much sums up kind of our outlook going rating region by rating region. CSR subsidy certainly was a very serious consideration. And the fact that we priced accordingly, recognizing that that probably would not \u2013 well, we assumed it would not be in place and that gave us, quite frankly, a line of sight or a commitment to pricing that we felt put us in a good standing with respect to at least being able to price effectively and position ourselves well in the rating regions that we did decide to stay in. Operator : And our last question this morning comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron. Please go ahead. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to sort of maybe take a step back just from an overall strategy perspective and get your views, Joe, in terms of what's the plan for Anthem's growth, right, as you think about sort of expanding markets. And I guess I'm curious on a couple of fronts. The understanding there's timing issues. The cash flow's been really strong, and I think what we're seeing in the last quarter was really a big acceleration in buybacks, largest we've seen probably in three years, three years plus. And then a couple of Florida Medicare Advantage deals. And so I'm just curious, is the strategy here to buy back stock, but look for selective opportunities to expand beyond the 14 markets or do think more of the growth is going to come from your 14 markets? And maybe within that, how do you play with the other Blue's Plans? Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Well, covered a lot of territory there. And I think it's obvious, share buyback is always an element of our capital deployment strategy and we have targets. We've made it very clear what that is year-over-year, and so I think in that regard we're very prudent with respect to how we deploy capital in that regard. With respect to growth overall, we have made it clear that we do have numerous strategic growth imperatives that actually are playing out quite nicely. As an example, M&A in the Medicare Advantage space, which obviously we were just able to make two very significant announcements in short order in the last few weeks in the Florida marketplace. I think that is going to be a contributor with respect to M&A opportunities. And, obviously, we are targeting organic growth in the Medicare space. I think looking more long view, as an example in the Medicare space, our PBM opportunity going forward will give us \u2013 albeit it's still a couple years off in terms of 01/01/2020, but I think we will be incredibly competitive in the Part D space that we cannot take advantage of today as effectively as we envision after 01/01/2020. I think that the big unknown \u2013 I've already mentioned it \u2013 is the hopeful stability in the Individual marketplace, and that's a story that probably is going to unfold in the coming 12 to 18 months. There are a variety of other opportunities. John already mentioned a few, such as our very heavy focus on Specialty cross-selling to our medical membership, and overall our PBM outlook is very strong, not just Part D, but broadly speaking, it's going to give us a lot of opportunity going forward in terms of capturing share. John, am I missing anything that maybe... John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: No. Thank you, Joe. I really think there's no way we can oversell the ability for our new PBM contract to really accelerate growth in 2020 and beyond. Every line of business is going to benefit from it significantly. Certainly, in the Part D in the Medicare space, where drug spend is a higher percent of total, it benefits even more, but the large National Accounts, not having carve outs on ASO, really positioning ourselves better for Local Group fully-insured, every line of business benefits from that in 2020 and beyond. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. Probably I'm remiss not mentioning other strategic imperatives that we've talked about for growth, like solidifying our Commercial portfolio so that we stem the historic tide with respect to out-migration of certain parts of the business, and we're hopeful to really make that a very strong part of our portfolio going forward. And... John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: And, Joe, maybe... Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: And Medicaid, obviously, is another great example. We keep talking about that pipeline. So, John? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: I would say just to finalize one of Josh's other comments on capital deployment, our share buyback sits consistent with our expectations. We had not done any share buyback for a couple of years while we were going through a large M&A deal that ended up falling through, and so the fact we just came back to a more normalized level of M&A, but really the capital deployment thought process is that we want to be very opportunistic. We want to be diligent in the effective use of capital. To the extent that there's additional merger and acquisition opportunities, we'll focus the capital on that. To the extent that we think it's a better return of capital to shareholders to do share buyback, we'll do that, and we'll always pay one of the market-leading dividends as well. So there's a lot of different places to go with capital deployment, and any one year is literally just any one year. And we'll make the decisions as the market allows us to. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. I guess, in summary, it's an overarching question. I think it's on everybody's mind, but I can assure you that the team here has well thought out our outlook for next year, and then beyond. That's why we can say that our earnings growth rates, certainly we can hold firm with respect to upper single-digit and low-double digit outlook. And just in summary, I can tell you our Government business is strong. Our Commercial business is continually repositioning and strengthening in many, many ways. And then the core element of performance of the company around SG&A controls, our capital deployment strategies, as John just pointed out, and another sort of driver is our PBM outlook in terms of repricing opportunities. So I think your question really allowed us to give you kind of a summary statement about the entirety of our performance outlook and the commitment that management has made to the growth agenda for this company. I think the proof points are there and we're very excited about the potential for the company going forward. Operator : And thank you. I'd now like to turn the conference back to company management with the company's closing comments. Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.: Great. Thank you for all your questions. As always, they are very insightful and very probing, and I'm glad we're able to give you line of sight to our directions going forward. As you know, as a company, we are committed to confronting our healthcare system's challenges and we're focused on expanding access to high-quality, affordable healthcare for our customers. I have to again underscore, thanks to all of our associates for their continued commitment to serving over 40 million members every day. Thank you for your interest in Anthem and we look forward to speaking with you soon at upcoming conferences. Have a great day. Thank you.

These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advice listeners to review the risk factors discussed in today\u2019s press release and in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Boudreaux : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us as we review Anthem\u2019s fourth quarter and year end 2017 performance and our plans for continued growth in 2018 and beyond. This morning, we reported fourth quarter 2017 GAAP earnings per share of $4.67 and adjusted earnings per share of $1.29, which were ahead of our expectations driven by balanced performance across our businesses. Operating revenues in 2017 grew by 5.8% to over $89 billion. Our medical loss ratio came in at a better than expected 86.4% for the year and operating cash flow exceeded $4.2 billion for the year growth of 28% over 2016. We are pleased with our improved business momentum in the quarter and our continued traction in the marketplace as evidenced by solid membership trends in key parts of our business, including our fully insured large and small group commercial markets and the completion of the HealthSun transaction, which added approximately 40,000 new consumers to our Medicare Advantage business. We finished 2017 slightly ahead of expectations serving the benefit needs of more than 40.2 million consumers, representing growth of 325,000 members during the year. Also medical costs were well managed for the year and our full year medical loss ratio came in better than expected. Our continued focus on cost of care improvements drove improved medical expense trends, specifically in our Medicaid individual and local group insured businesses and resulted in a medical loss ratio of 88.6% in the fourth quarter. As a result of our solid fourth quarter 2017 results, we entered 2018 with operating momentum and are well positioned for sustainable long-term high-quality earnings growth. One of my key priorities since joining Anthem a little more than 2 months ago has been to perform a thorough review of the business and to quickly gain a deep understanding of how the company operates and the opportunities we have to improve our performance in 2018 and beyond. I spent a lot of time in recent weeks visiting our local markets around the country and meeting with our associates as well as care providers, customers, brokers and other business partners. I have seen firsthand a strong business foundation built on a deep commitment to our communities and the people we serve and a culture that embodies our value of being accountable, caring, easy to do business with innovative and trustworthy. Building on our strong legacy, I believe we have a substantial opportunity to further raise our performance across the Anthem. I have challenged our organization has a relentless focus on day-to-day execution in order to deliver continuously greater impact on the affordability and quality of healthcare in America. Specifically, we need to advance our consumer focus innovation and data analytics capabilities to leverage our strong brand and local market position and drive greater value for our customers. While we will continue to find my view, I have some initial thoughts to share on my priorities and vision for Anthem. In the near-term my primary focus is on optimizing execution across our business segment. Anthem has been building a strong operating platform, but there is still more that we can do to better serve our customers and improve our financial performance. In order to meet the increasing expectations and needs of our members we need to increase our focus on developing innovative solutions that emphasizes affordability and flexibility and increase speed to market and delivering these solutions. We will continue to focus on the drivers of medical costs and identify new ways to deploy cost of care solutions more quickly and effectively so that we can further improve the quality of care our members receive while also reducing the costs they incur. And we will work to better leverage Anthem\u2019s many best-in-class capabilities to drive further growth including our deep expertise in integrated care, our increased focus on provider relations, our medical cost value proposition, our growing consumer capabilities, our local market presence and our brand advantages through our Blue Commercial business in the Amerigroup name. In 2018 we will also be making incremental investments in technology modernization efforts, consumer facing digital technologies and product development capabilities. Specifically, we are accelerating our efforts to migrate our membership onto our end state platform which will improve consistency in the consumer experience and make us more efficient. Additionally, we are investing in new digital and mobile capabilities to drive greater automation and enhance our consumer experience. This includes developing new external facing applications and portals that will make it easier for members, agents and care providers to conduct business with Anthem and also enhancing capabilities for more personalized and responsive customer\u2019s choice. We are also building an end to end modular process to allow control flexibility to efficiently configure product designs and make it simpler to integrate those products onto our data platforms. These investments are a few examples of our efforts to make the healthcare systems simpler to navigate, more effective and more affordable for our consumers. Looking more specifically at the growth opportunities in our businesses, Anthem\u2019s government business which currently represents over 50% of consolidated operating revenue is positioned for sustainable growth across the Medicaid and Medicare platforms. Our Medicaid team is targeting a significant pipeline of opportunity as states increasingly recognize the role of that healthcare companies like Anthem can play as their partner, working with an ever tightening budget constraints to better manage the healthcare of the individuals they serve. We see $80 billion worth of incremental business opportunities between now and the end of 2022, much of which encompasses state specialized service population. We are also focused on developing strategic partnerships with other health plans and providers including plans in the Blue network that combine our best-in-class Medicaid operating platform with their local market expertise. For example, we recently formed a partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota which goes into effect in the fall of 2018 and will serve approximately 375,000 members by the end of the year through its Medicaid and dual eligible program. In 2017 we also partnered with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana to form Healthy Blue which currently serves approximately 240,000 Medicaid members. Looking ahead, we see opportunities to continue to leverage our deep expertise in Medicaid to form new partnerships and alliances with our Blue colleague providers and other health plans to expand our presence and reach into new markets. In Medicare, we continue to see substantial growth opportunities as approximately 11,000 baby-boomers aging to Medicare eligible population everyday. Historically, Anthem has lagged the Medicare Advantage penetration and we have been working to capture more of our fair share of this market. I believe we are now well-positioned to leverage our improved individual Medicare Advantage platform. Specifically, I am confident that we have the ability to leverage our strong brand, our more competitive product offerings and our focused marketing and sales investment to further capture share in this growing market. We are encouraged with our strong individual Medicare Advantage growth rate in 2017 and continuing through the 2018 open enrollment period where we have outpaced the growth rate as a market. We continue to expect organic growth rates in the low to mid double-digits over the next few years outpacing growth in our existing markets of 6% to 9%. Our Medicare Advantage market share will also benefit from the completion of our acquisition of HealthSun and the pending acquisition of America\u2019s 1st Choice. Together, these companies will add approximately 170,000 new Medicare Advantage lives as well as deep provider relationships in the key Florida market. With the addition of these plans, our total Florida Medicare Advantage membership will be approximately 220,000. We are now focused on strengthening our capabilities in the employer group business and expect to see noticeable growth in this Medicare Advantage segment soon. Supporting all of this growth is our improved star rating now with over 70% of our membership residing in 4-star plans for the 2018 payment year. Additionally, Anthem will be only carrying with five 5-star plans following the close of America\u2019s 1st Choice acquisition. In the commercial business, there is meaningful opportunity to leverage our local market knowledge and improve the historical membership trends of Anthem\u2019s fully insured medical business at appropriate margins by providing more consumer focused offerings and investing in digital capabilities. We have a solid foundation to build even deeper relationships with consumers and care providers. For example, Anthem operates 3 of the top 10 best performing commercial health plans as ranked by the NCQA. These are superior plans, which consistently deliver top scores in customer satisfaction, preventive care and outcomes in areas such as diabetes, asthma and heart disease. In addition, we plan to extend the breadth of our self-funded customer relationships by improving the penetration rates of specialty products. The specialty team has made significant progress over the past few years improving the competitiveness of our dental and vision offerings. We ended 2017 with a commercial dental penetration rate of a little less than 20% and vision penetration rate of about 25%. Both of these rates have improved meaningfully over the last several years. We will continue to invest in our specialty products and expect continued improvement in those penetration rates in the years to come. While we have significant opportunities in 2018, another key priority during my first 60 days at Anthem has been to align the organization around plans to develop a long-term strategy focused on accelerating our top line and bottom line growth. We need to augment our recent successes in commercial fee business and Medicaid with stronger, profitable growth and higher revenue businesses. We are building an organization with an agile culture that proactively identifies and engages in new opportunities to drive revenue growth by leveraging our existing capabilities and better packaging our assets in the marketplace. One of those opportunities will be to better leverage the power of our local market presence, which is key to driving change in healthcare. Anthem has best-in-class local market share and we needed to combine that strength with our increased cost of care initiative to drive down the cost of healthcare for our members, while also delivering a more consumer focused experience and continuing to build on our depth of experience in provider collaboration and integrated care. Success in these priorities will accelerate our growth, improve affordability for our customers and strengthen our financial performance as we enhance our competitive position. Anthem also has quite a few unique assets that we are focused on packaging to better deploy in the market. A great example is our AIM Specialty Health subsidiary, which provides a variety of medical cost management provide our workflow integration and member engagement solutions to its customers and supports evidence-based care and affordability across all major clinical areas, including oncology, cardiology, advanced imaging, genetic testing, specialty RX and several others. Depending on the clinical domain, AIM solutions have been able to provide savings of 10% to 40%. Additionally, our technology platform enables 75% of provider interactions to be electronic with a user satisfaction rate of 95%. By better organizing our existing assets as well as investing in or acquiring new capabilities, we will be better able to accelerate our top line growth and diversify our revenue base. In addition, we will continue to work with our Blue partners to explore ways to leverage Anthem\u2019s capabilities to help them improve their product offerings and competitive position. We have a unique opportunity to cultivate strategic partnerships with our Blue Plan colleagues to grow and advance the impact of the Blue system as a whole. We will also continue our strong focus on becoming a more consumer-centric company. Anthem has made some meaningful improvement to the consumer experience, which drives loyalty and helps to make the healthcare experience simpler for individual. For example, we have been focused on improving the visual clarity and usefulness of our member communication and have deployed a real-time notification feature to help inform our members of key updates like the status of a claim. By combining these opportunities with improved integrated medical and pharmacy offering through our new PBM, IngenioRx, we have a unique opportunity to deliver a highly innovative product offering to the market. We continue to expect our new PBM to deliver at least $4 billion of gross pharmaceutical savings on a run-rate basis once we migrate our enrollment to the new platform by January 1, 2021. We also continue to project that at least 20% of this benefit will accrue to shareholders on a pre-tax basis. Additionally, we will continue to be a strong community partner in the markets we serve through more than 40 million in open community activity. The Anthem Foundation is positively impacting some of the nation\u2019s most pressing health issue. For example, together with the American Heart Association, we are tracking towards doubling cardiac arrest survival rate through hands-only CPR training. To-date, we have trained more than 6.5 million Americans. This is just one example and we believe that it\u2019s important that our members seek Anthem out in the community and making a difference for those that we serve. As it relates to overall capital deployment, my view is consistent with what you have heard historically. We will prioritize making the necessary investments in the business first, then evaluate with M&A opportunities exist in the market, and then finally deploy capital to shareholders through a balanced approach of share buybacks and dividends. I believe a coordinated, thoughtful long-term strategy should drive our M&A plan. We will be very disciplined and how we leveraged the M&A pipeline to help build Anthem for the long-term and evaluate how to strategically position and enhance our current asset base to capitalize on the opportunities of tomorrow. Our acquisition of HealthSun and pending acquisition of America\u2019s 1st Choice demonstrates this focus. Both of these companies fit well into our larger strategy, well run Medicare assets in strategic locations which we can further grow and scale. As a company, we remain committed to achieving our long-term earnings per share target growth range of upper single to low double-digits with a focus on generating sustainable high-quality earnings. I am optimistic that over time we can move to the upper end of this range. As I played out, our emphasis would be on improving our ability to manage the total cost of care as well as leveraging the capabilities we have to diversify our revenue base leading to improved top line growth. Combining these opportunities with an improved integrated medical and pharmacy offering through IngenioRx with very competitive economics will position Anthem very well for growth. Finally, we will focus on being efficient and effective stewards of shareholder capital. With that, I will turn the call over to John to discuss our 2017 financial results in more detail. John? John Gallina : Thank you, Gail and good morning. As Gail mentioned, our strong fourth quarter 2017 results came in ahead of expectations and we entered 2018 with positive operating momentum. Fourth quarter 2017 GAAP earnings per share was $4.67 and adjusted earnings per share was $1.29. During the fourth quarter, we recorded $1.1 billion one-time non-cash deferred tax benefit as a result of the recently passed tax reform legislation. For the full year 2017, GAAP earnings per share, was $14.35 and adjusted earnings per share was $12.04 representing growth of 9.5% over 2016. The results are within our longer term targeted range and we are optimistic that we can build on this performance and drive towards the upper end of our targeted range. Membership came in slightly ahead of expectations primarily driven by our fully insured business as we finished the year with over 40.2 million members representing growth of 325,000 members during 2017. Fully insured membership finished 2017 with 15.3 million lives, a slight increase over the prior year and a little ahead of our latest projections. The better-than-expected enrollment was primarily driven by higher membership gains in the Medicaid business and approximately 40,000 HealthSun members, which closed at the end of the fourth quarter. Year end 2017 self-funded membership totaled $25 million representing growth of $278,000 or 1.1% versus the end of 2016. The increase over the last 12 months was mainly driven by growth in our local group business as our market leading medical cost value proposition continues to drive new account wins in the marketplace. Our 2017 operating revenue of $89.1 billion grew by $4.9 billion or 5.8% during the year. The increase is reflective of our enrollment growth, especially in Medicare and local group as well as premium increases across their business to cover overall cost trends. These factors more than offset the decrease in revenue from the waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017. Our 2017 medical loss ratio came in at 86.4%, an increase of 160 basis points from the prior year. The ratio for the year was better than previously expected driven primarily by our continued focus on cost of care improvements. We saw better-than-expected medical loss ratios in our individual ACA compliant and Medicaid businesses during the fourth quarter. Our Local Group insured medical cost trends for the year was approximately 6.5%. I want to highlight that we are updating the reporting of our underlying local group medical cost trend in 2018. We will now report trend based on the allowed amount, which represents a contractual rate due to providers where the amount is paid by Anthem or our members through co-pays and deductibles. The previous methodology was based on paid amount, which is the allowed amount less the co-pays and deductibles, representing only amounts paid by Anthem. This revised methodology is a better indicator of overall healthcare cost and trend. On this basis, the company anticipates Local Group medical cost trend will be in the range of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points in 2018. On an apples-to-apples basis, Local Group medical cost trends would have been approximately 5.5% in 2017 under this methodology. The 2017 full year SG&A expense ratio came in at 14.2%, 70 basis points lower than 2016 mainly due to the 1-year waiver of the health insurance tax. The ratio for the year was higher than previous expectations driven by incremental investment spending during the fourth quarter and higher incentive compensation expense from the better than expected financial performance. Now, turning to our business unit financial results, our commercial business finished 2017 strong, with operating revenues of $40.8 billion for the year, an increase of $2.1 billion or 5.3% in 2016. Commercial membership finished the year with 30.7 million members, an increase of 278,000 or 0.9% over the prior year end. This increase was mainly driven by growth in our Local Group business in both fully insured and self-funded products. These increases were partially offset by lower enrollment in our national business and the expected decrease in our individual business. Our individual enrollment declined by 108,000 during the quarter which was in line with our expectations. We ended 2017 with 1.6 million total individualized of which 1.3 million were ACA compliant and a little less than 300,000 were non-ACA compliant. Of the 1.3 million ACA compliant lives, a little more than 850,000 of them were from the public exchanges. The operating margin in commercial for the year was 7.1%, a decrease of 120 basis points from the 2016 ratio. This decrease as discussed was mainly driven by the impact of the 1-year waiver of the health insurance tax, partially offset by better than expected medical cost trends in our local group and individual businesses. The claims experienced in our individual ACA compliant business is better than expected during the fourth quarter. As a result our business was slightly profitable during the year, better than the relatively breakeven performance we have expected in our latest outlook. Now turning to the government business, we ended 2017 with 9.6 million members, growth of 87,000 lives during the quarter and 47,000 during the year. We are pleased that our Medicare membership grew by 107,000 lives including approximately 40,000 members from the recently completed HealthSun acquisition. Excluding HealthSun, we grew our individual Medicare advantage enrollment by 68,000 with 13.5% during 2017. Total operating revenue in the government business was $48.3 billion for the year, an increase of $2.8 billion or 6.2% versus 2016. The increase in revenue was driven by premium rate increases to cover overall cost trends, the full year impact of membership growth in our Medicaid business during 2016 and enrollment gains in our Medicare advantage business. The government operating margin for the full year 2017 was 3%, which is 90 basis points lower than the prior year. Fourth quarter operating margins of 2.9% reflect better than expected claim trends in our Medicaid business, partially offset by the previously discussed timing impact of retroactive revenue adjustments that were made in the third quarter that were originally expected to occur in the fourth quarter. In Iowa, we continue to work with our state partners in CMS to ensure rates for the July 2017 and 2018 period are actuarially sound and appropriately address any new members from the AmeriHealth exit. Additionally, we are very focused on making sure our July 1, 2018 rate increase is actuarially sound and establishes a path to target profitability. Moving to the balance sheet, consistent with our past practice we have included a roll forward of the medical claims payable balance in this morning\u2019s press release. For the full year 2017, we experienced favorable prior year reserve development of $1.2 billion, which was better than expected. Our reserves continued to include a provision for average deviation in the mid to high single-digits and believe our reserve balances remain consistent and strong as of December 31, 2017. Our days in claims payable is 39.4 days in the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of 1.1 days from the 40.5 days we reported in the third quarter. The decrease was driven by operational improvements on our claims processing systems where we continue to focus our efforts on improving the payment integrity and increasing our auto adjudication rates leading to improve cycle times. As a result of these and other ongoing efforts, we believe our DCP will continue to trend down and be in the high-30s over time. We ended 2017 with a debt to cap ratio of 42.9%, an increase of 440 basis points from the 38.5% we reported at the end of the third quarter. The increase was primarily due to the issuance of a $5.5 billion debt offering during the quarter at an average coupon rate of 3.5%. During the quarter we did use some of those funds to complete a cash tender offer allowing us to repurchase approximately $1.5 billion of higher coupon debt including the entire 7% notes that were due in 2019. The debt raised in the quarter was also used to complete the HealthSun acquisition and will fund the America\u2019s 1st Choice acquisition upon closing. We plan to decrease our debt to capital ratio over time back towards the low-40s. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of the parent company of $2.8 billion, which included the timing impact of approximately $900 million of inter-company funding range. Excluding the timing impact, which was resolved early in the year cash and investments at the parent company would have totaled $3.7 billion. For cash flow, we reported operating cash flow for the full year 2017 of $4.2 billion or 1.1x net income. Cash flow in the fourth quarter was negative $1.3 billion as expected driven by several timing items including the timing of monthly CMS Medicare receipts as discussed on our third quarter call and the payment of provider capitation pass-through funding, which was received in the third quarter. We also used $179.5 million during the quarter for our cash dividend. Yesterday, our Board of Directors increased our first quarter dividend by $0.05 to $0.75 per share and we continue to pay industry leading dividend. We have increased our dividend every year since we began paying a dividend 8 years ago. With that, I will turn the call back to Gail to discuss our 2018 outlook. Gail? Gail Boudreaux : Thanks John. Before I begin, it\u2019s important to note that our 2018 outlook does not include any impact from the pending acquisition of America\u2019s 1st Choice, which we continue to expect to close during the first quarter. We expect operating revenues to grow to a range of $90.5 billion to $91.5 billion in 2018, reflecting the impact of the return of the health insurer fee in 2018. Premium rate increases to cover overall medical cost trends and growth in higher revenue PMPM insured membership in the government business. These will be partially offset by the impact of reducing our footprint in the individual ACA compliant marketplace. In total, we expect our enrollment in 2018 to be relatively flat to down a little more than 200,000. In government, we expect another year of solid growth with membership expected to increase by more than 600,000 consumers served. However, we expect commercial membership to decrease by about 700,000 members, because of our reduced individual ACA compliant footprint. We expect Medicaid to add about 500,000 lives reflecting the recently announced Minnesota partnership as well as organic growth from existing contracts. During the year, we also expect to be active participants in various RFPs. With our Medicare business, we are projecting growth of approximately 125,000 members, primarily, in our individual Medicare advantage product offering to an increasing percentage of enrollment in 4-star plans. This represents individual Medicare advantage growth in the mid double-digits and has fast driven the overall market average of 6% to 9%. In commercial insured, we project our enrollment will decline by a little more than 1 million members over the next 12 months. Our individual ACA and non-ACA compliant enrollment is expected to decline by approximately 950,000, reflecting the actions we took to only participate in rating regions where we have an appropriate level of confidence that the financial performance in these markets is predictable. Finally, our local group insured enrollment is expected to decrease by about 50,000 lives as a result of funny conversions from fully insured to self funded, as employers look to lessen the impact of rate increases resulting from the return of the health insurer fee. The decrease in commercial fully insured will be partially offset by the growth in commercial self-funded enrollment, which is expected to increase by approximately 300,000 lives in 2018 with positive momentum in securing new contract wins and maintaining retention rates in national accounts and large group employers. We expect our BlueCard enrollment will be down slightly year-over-year. Turning to the financial metrics, the return of the health insurer fee in 2018, impacts all of our major financial metrics. Such a comparison to 2017 on a reported basis this will be distorted. We expect our 2018 consolidated MLR to be 84.5% at the midpoint, a decrease of 190 basis points versus 2017 largely reflecting the impact of the return of the health insurer fee. Aside from the fee impact, our MLR outlook is flat to slightly better than 2017. Our outlook reflects the impact of an intensified focus on driving down the cost of care across our businesses, while maintaining a disciplined approach to pricing. Also profitability in our individual ACA-compliant business is projected to improve towards our targeted margin range as a result of the pricing and participation strategies deployed in 2017. These improvements are partially offset by a change in the mix of premium revenue coming from the government business, which is the higher MLR than the consolidated average. We expect our SG&A ratio in 2018 to be 15.5% at the midpoint, an increase of 130 basis points from the 14.2% in 2017, which also largely reflects the impact of the return of the health insurer fee. We anticipate using a portion of the corporate tax reform benefits for incremental investment spending as I referenced earlier in the areas of technology modernization efforts, consumer-facing digital technologies and product development capabilities. Finally, we will continue to incur some cost in our individual ACA-compliant market, which allows us to be positioned to reenter certain markets in 2019 if appropriate. Below the line, we expect investment income of approximately $825 million and interest expense of approximately $775 million. We also expect our tax rate to be in the range of 25.5% to 27.5% for the year, reflecting the impact of the reduced corporate tax rate partially offset by the return of the non-deductible health insurer fee. Operating cash flow is expected to be relatively consistent with 2017 at greater than $4 billion. As we discussed previously, 2017 operating cash flows were positively impacted by the financial reinsurance receipt related to 2016 claims and the timing of incentive compensation payments. Partially offsetting these headwinds to cash flow in 2018 is the net cash benefit of corporate tax reform as well as increased core earnings. We also expect 2018 will benefit from the impact of share repurchase activity in both 2017 and 2018. As a reminder, our 2017 share repurchase activity was more heavily weighted towards the back half of the year and our 2018 activity will look more normalized throughout the year. Our outlook assumes we repurchased approximately $1.5 billion worth of shares during 2018. We do have certain equity units that will be issued in May of 2018 and our outlook currently expects the repurchase activity we have committed to in 2018 to more than offset the dilution impact of the equity issuance. As a result, we now expect our average share count for the year to be in the range of 260 million to 264 million shares. We will continue to evaluate the best use of available capital for deployment during the year to strategically position Anthem for long-term growth. Overall, the reduction of our corporate tax rate to 21% will drive a gross tax benefit of a little less than $4 per share and our outlook expects a net benefit of about $2 per share. The difference between these two numbers reflects two items. First, we expect higher MLR rebates and pass-backs in Medicaid and certain other refunding contracts. Additionally, roughly 25% of the gross tax benefit is funding the incremental investment priorities we laid out for you earlier. To conclude, our 2018 GAAP earnings per share estimate is greater than $14.28 and our adjusted earnings per share outlook is greater than $15. The difference between these two estimates is the exclusion of the amortization of deal-related intangibles. With that, I will turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Welcome to Board Gail. Best wishes in the new role there. I was going to jump off of some of your comments about strategy in two quick areas to ask about. First, you touched a little bit on the IngenioRx stand up. I wondered if you would highlight what you are looking for in terms of milestones to know that is on track, any opportunities or challenges, which you see in that or maybe looking at it with fresh eyes would highlight and then aspect about it with the selling season for 2019 to 2020, I know most of it happens in 2020, 2021, but I am wondering given 3-year contracting, how fast do you think you guys would get engaged in actually marketing the capabilities to try to win outside accounts? Gail Boudreaux : Well, great. Good morning, A.J. and thank you for the comment. First, let me address your overall comments on IngenioRx and my thoughts, but then I am going to ask Brian Griffin who leads that area to also add his commentary on it. First and foremost, as I think about the Ingenio contract with CBS, it\u2019s quite frankly great value creator for us. As I shared in my opening comments, our ability to deliver greater than $4 billion of gross savings with 20% of that on a pretax basis incurring to our shareholders just really incredible opportunity for us. Our opportunity here is really first and foremost to focus on execution. We have got a lot of optionality in that contract and I remain very confident in our ability to execute on that across our book of business. We have been very focused on that. We want to see a flawless execution. But I think I will do that was ask Brian maybe to comment a little bit more about how the team has been working together and our outlook for the future on that. Brian Griffin : Thanks very much Gail. Good morning A.J. At this point, I would just \u2013 I am very impressed with where the level of commitment that we are seeing out of the CVS relationship. They have been very engaged with us. They have had their senior leadership team directly engaged in the planning process. And I have been also very impressed with the dedicated resources that they are putting into IngenioRx dedicated division. Relative to the implementation itself, in terms of success factors as you can appreciate, we are building out a very detailed implementation plan that will to Gail\u2019s point put us in a position to realize the value that we have discussed starting 1120. And in terms of key metrics, obviously we are going to be looking at things like the testing environments ensuring that we have got interfaces across our systems and doing the appropriate user testing to ensure our claims adjudication is well-positioned, well in advance of the implementation itself, including parallel processing, etcetera. So without getting too detailed in terms of the implementation process itself that detailed implementation plan where we are going to be finalizing over the next several quarters and then we will start to look at metrics against that implementation plan, but with a very heavy focus on testing itself. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks Brian. I would just add A.J. we have been also building our own PBM capabilities here. So we are standing up our own model in addition to working very closely with them on the execution of the transition of the membership. So overall feel that things are progressing very well and we feel very confident about this. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold from Cowen. Please go ahead. Christine Arnold : Hi there, welcome back Gail. Could you talk a little bit about these partnerships with the Blues and I am particularly interested in how the economics might work for that particularly on the Medicaid side and then separately how are you thinking about association health plans and the impact they might have on your small group business? Thanks. John Gallina : Good morning Christine. Let me address the first question around the partnerships that we have with the \u2013 our Blue partners, strategic partnership. As I have come back to the Blues, one of the things that clearly I have seen in my time with a healthcare service company is understanding the strength of the Blues overall and the partnerships and strategic opportunities we have. We have a very, very strong Medicaid platform in our Amerigroup presence. And we have formed over five of these partnerships not only with Blue with other health plans and basically what we are doing is leveraging the strength of our platform in Medicaid with the local market expertise and their relationships in the provider network. So that\u2019s been a really strong opportunity for us. It allows us to leverage our investments and quite frankly our return on capital for an investment that that we think gives us greater presence and depth in the marketplace. We also have some other capabilities and I have been really impressed by some of the other assets that we have inside of Anthem for example our AIM subsidiary that I shared with you is another great opportunity that I see an ability to package that, to continue to scale it and invest in capabilities. And we already do a lot of that work with other Blues across the system. And again that\u2019s another great opportunity for us to have I think very strong strategic partnership. In terms of the association health plan, I think quite frankly there is a positive for expanding access for consumers across the space and so we are very supportive of that. We do have expertise in working in different types of association businesses across our book, so it\u2019s something that will continue to innovate our products, but overall I feel pretty positively about our small book of group of business because we are doing quite a bit of work on affordability, obviously our brand presence and also offering new products in that marketplace. So overall I think it gives us another option for consumers and it gives us an option to continue to put additional products in the market with association health plans. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Chris Rigg : Good morning, just wanted to touch on the tax reform investment spending and then tax reform generally, I guess first I think you are saying you are going to spend about $260 million-ish on investment spending this year, I was just wondering is that something you see in the base line over the long-term or something you would expect to dial back. And then separately with the tax reform you heard some chatter out of New York and California about seeking ways to potentially claw back some of the benefit over time, would love to just get your thoughts on that? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question Chris. Just a couple things first is as John I think and I shared about 25% of the tax benefit is going into acceleration of investments that are predominantly focused on growth. I see some pretty significant opportunities to one simplify our business in terms of system migrations and getting us to our destination platforms plus investing in digital capabilities and product development modularization. And those are things that we had started already and that we are continuing to accelerate. But I will let John maybe give a little bit more color on the overall picture and how we are thinking about the tax. John Gallina : Yes. Thank you and good morning Chris. So in terms of the tax reform maybe I will just spend a minute going through some of the dynamics associated with it. It\u2019s really a good thing when you have lower taxes that can really help drive affordability in the marketplace and share that with the members and the consumers. And of the gross benefit that we will receive from the tax reform in 2018. About 25% of that is going to go back to the customers directly either through MR rebates or just the true up of how the health history works and things like that. And then as you said maybe another 25% associated with accelerating investments as Gail talked about. And then the remaining 50% I guess return to the shareholders. Your question specifically associated with is our investment strategic priority to the new model, tax reform has allowed us to accelerate our investment spending and growth initiatives. And we will continue to have an ongoing focus in investing in growth and adding to our market leading capabilities. As we look at our uses of capital reinvesting in the business is always something that\u2019s a very, very high on the list and something that we believe we need to continue to do. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. And I will Echo the comments, welcome to the new role Gail as well. I wanted to ask just first on the Medicare advantage acquisitions just looking at the cash flow statement it looks like you did about $2 billion for HealthSun maybe there is some other true up type of stuff in there, but obviously that screens as a big number for 40,000 lives, so could you talk a little about more of the capabilities, I assume there is some provider business in their, etcetera. And then just I would be curious I know it\u2019s hard to say explicitly on a call like this, but from your perspective on the management side, do you think there is a need for augmentation or more changes and I would be interested to get your sense on the Anthem team working together, historically it\u2019s been geographically diverse management team, I am curious if there is thoughts to get people closer together? Gail Boudreaux : Well, good morning and thank you. Two questions in there. Let me start with the management team and then I will touch on HealthSun NFP also to provide some commentary. First, I have spent the last 75 days since joining Anthem really meeting with our leaders and our managers across the country and my assessment is we have a strong leadership team with a deep understanding of the business. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to meet many of them and I look forward quite frankly to engaging with all of our leaders, that\u2019s something that I am going to continue to do over the next several months and through the course of time. Part of that is we are going to continue to invest in our leaders as we build the new capabilities that I have discussed and we will also be adding talent in those areas as we are going to be investing in some areas around consumer focused and digital capabilities and we will add talent to those areas. But overall I do feel that we have a strong team in place today. In terms of how they work together, I think we have a really unique opportunity and that\u2019s why I am pretty excited actually about the opportunity to focus on execution and growth. And as I think about the strong brand our local market presence part of bringing that together, which actually has begun already and leveraging that with some scale opportunity. So, I see that as really a blending of taking advantage of our market presence and our leadership in those markets with also bringing scale and discipline from our corporate offices and our segment leadership. So I actually see a nice balance there and I think we have got a real opportunity on continuing to focus on execution at the market level bringing new products and new capabilities. And again, I am very bullish about Medicare, Medicare and our commercial penetration and feel good about our leaders. In terms of your second question, I will start my commentary on that a little bit, because I think it plays into the strong growth I feel that we have in the Medicare space. Over the last several years, Anthem has been investing in really repositioning Medicare and you will see from the results as over 70% of our members right now are in 4-star plans plus we have 5-star plans, which is very unique among competitors in the space and two of those are in Florida. HealthSun really gave us the nice footprint along with America\u2019s 1st Choice and gave us scale in that key Florida marketplace. And it\u2019s more than just the health plan and the members, obviously, it gives us clinical capabilities in the market and a deep penetration and an opportunity to really leverage some of the work that\u2019s been done in that community. But before I go into too much detail, let me ask Pete to comment, because he leads that business and I think he can give you some great color on what\u2019s happening. Pete Haytaian : Thanks a lot, Gail and good morning Josh. Yes, I will just reiterate what Gail said in large part we are really excited about this transaction and a key geography for us Florida, which we think is a really important Medicare Advantage market. Don\u2019t think about this transaction in isolation of 40,000 members as Gail talked about and you mentioned Josh in terms of capabilities included in the HealthSun transaction are 19 wholly-owned care centers. We are very focused on managing the chronically ill. We talked about that being a very important part of our business going forward managing the chronically ill effectively as well as managing dual eligibles. And then I will add obviously a high-quality asset, one of the few companies nationally that have a 5-star plan. So, we are really excited about this transaction and also the growth opportunities that exist down in South Florida. And with the combination of America\u2019s 1st Choice, we are talking about spanning a lot of the state of Florida both in the central part of the state as well as in southern part of the state. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, thanks. Just want to go back to taxes for a minute do you have any thoughts today as to the sustainability of the $2 per share into the future years? And then I guess the HIF in coming back in 2018, but not in 2019 I guess one of your competitors talked about that actually being a headwind in 2018, I was wondering if you factor that into this guidance as well? John Gallina : Yes, thank you, Kevin, this is John. I will answer the first question \u2013 or the second question first on the 2019 HIF being waived and of course we are pleased with the waiver for 2019. As I stated earlier, whenever taxes and regulations decreased and helps with the affordability of healthcare through those premiums and so two pieces on the HIF, so coming into 2018, the HIF came back. And as we had stated, that\u2019s about $0.40 to $0.45 headwind on our growth rate in 2017 and 2018 given how the midyear renewals work and now that\u2019s all processed in. So then when you get into 2018 you do the mid-year renewals from 2018 and 2019 that can actually create a tailwind associated with 2019. So again it\u2019s something that we are going to manage through. And yes all of those things are already included in the guidance that we provided to all comparing in the greater than $15 earnings per share number that Gail had mentioned. In terms of the sustainability of how much of the tax reform can be maintained, it\u2019s really premature to speculate on that at this point in time. We believe we are in a very competitive marketplace that we believe with competition and really the need to drive more affordable products that the savings from the tax reform will help address that in some regards. And we will continue to be opportunistic in terms of reinvesting it in the business associated with accelerating our growth opportunities. And at this point in time, we really can\u2019t put a percentage or a number on a run rate sustainability associated with tax reform. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Ana Gupte : Yes, thanks. Good morning. Hey, congrats Gail, great to see you back. My question is near-term and long-term both on the medical cost trends, in near-term it looks like your guidance is 50 basis points higher apples-to-apples relative to 2017 and is this conservatism or are there any components either pricing or utilization that you are beginning to see pressure we had one of the larger public hospital yesterday to put pretty strong volumes. And then on the medium-term strategically you have had this competitive advantage for a while on cost of care the local market share, there do you think you could go relative to your competition and would that be a pricing advantage, would that be on beds per thousand and might you consider buying doc, so we are starting the three centers is the likely just market share good enough to get to get the leg up? Gail Boudreaux : There is a lot of questions in there Ana. So thank you. I will try to parse through them and hopefully we will get to each of them. Let me first start with where our trend finished and then a little bit of our guidance or actually ask John to give his commentary to. We finished 2017 at 5.5% under our \u2013 under the new methodology which essentially was at the low end of our guidance range. And we put in a intense focus on managing costs overall. So cost of care initiatives across investments in those across our business. But I think more than just specific cost of care, we have had a big commitment to integrated care and really moving value based payments along across our continuum of care providers and that has been a differential for us. And I believe Anthem has been a leader in that front and that\u2019s an area that we continue to invest in across our business. As we think about our forward view of trend we are always obviously very prudent about how we think about the forward view of trend. And we have given you a trend of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points taking into consideration this year we obviously have a more intense flu season than we have had in the past, so that\u2019s baked into our assumptions. And as we look at trend overall, basically placing it we do have very detailed drill down of each of the components of inpatient and outpatient pharmacy, etcetera. And at this stage what we are seeing is roughly at the midpoint about a 50 basis point increase and obviously we \u2013 that\u2019s something that we continue to watch across all of our businesses. In terms of your other question about care delivery assets one of the things that I would like to point out in the assets that I had the opportunity to spend time with is our CareMore assets. I am not sure if people know how much that we use that asset in our government business right now, we have seen some very, very strong results in terms of managing our more acute populations not only in Medicare, but have also expanded it to our Medicaid population. And we are expanding that model to not just be facility based, but also at home and at the workplace. So we think that asset gives us a really nice footprint to expand upon, to continue to scale and it has delivered some strong results in terms of readmission rates managing our most acute population, integration of behavioral and social elements and recently kicked off a program around isolation and loneliness nationally across that platform. So there is some very, very good work going on in CareMore. So, I feel between our integration of our value-based payments what we are doing there integrated care as well as our provider enablement and then what we do through CareMore and now our clinics down in the Florida market that we have a really nice footprint upon which to grow. But I will turn it over to John maybe to give a little bit more color on sort of the numbers around our trend guidance. John Gallina : Yes, thank you, Gail and good morning, Ana. In terms of the trend, I do want to just clarify we changed the metric in terms of how we calculated from a paid basis to an allowed basis. That has no impact on our pricing methodologies. It has no impact on our reserving. It has no impact on our financial statement issues. It is really a metric that is utilized to discuss healthcare trend and we believe that this change really provides a better view of healthcare trend overall to look at it on allowed basis versus paid basis. But with that as Gail said, we are at the very low end of our range in 2017 really driven by lower than expected increases in AWP with the cognizant effort to tighten up our formulary during the year, lower than expected hepatitis C spending and lower utilization trends overall. Of course, we did have the bump of the flu here at the end of the fourth quarter and then we are heading into 2018 really the single biggest drivers for the 50 basis points that we are looking at raising it at the midpoint of our range. Really the AWP pricing is going up a little bit faster than the overall trend and taken the flu into consideration. Now, all in though, everything else we believe is a very well controlled trend and we are really returning to a more of a normalization process. Thank you for the question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Lance Wilkes : Yes, good morning. Congratulations Gail on the role. Great to speak with you again. Just I have two quick questions really strategic in nature. One is further on the care delivery side and just thinking about your value-based care strategy and trying to understand if your market share makes it easier and more attractive or less attractive to own providers in those markets? And then the second question is really related to your cross-selling efforts and focus in particular in the self-insured market and trying to understand where you think the biggest opportunities there are and what are some other capabilities that you need to add to be able to sell into that market? So thanks a lot. GailBoudreaux: Great, Lance. Thanks again for the question. Again two questions. Let me take the first one around our capabilities and market share, which you appropriately referenced. Absolutely, that market share has an impact on our ability to drive best-in-class medical costs and I think that\u2019s actually a very important component of it. And we have had I think fairly comprehensive approach of value-based incentives all the way from gain shares through full risk-sharing and our primary approach is enablement with the providers and partnership, because we feel that\u2019s the right approach in the marketplace. Another market as I have mentioned we also are augmenting that certainly in the Florida market with the clinics now that is the more standard of how things are done and then with our CareMore model across the country. So, I think it\u2019s a combination for us of what best fits the marketplace as opposed to one stated strategy. We do have an overarching strategy around moving to more value-based payment. We are over 60% now and we would expect to move to over 70% going forward and continue to work with providers. In terms of your second question, specialty penetration, we have been investing in the capabilities and have seen a nice improvement in the penetration rates of our dental and vision business, in particular. I shared that on my opening prepared remarks. Our investments there are really on product, product positioning, technology, broker support sales effectiveness. Obviously even with the penetration rate improvements we have had we think that there is a significant upside there that we can continue by different businesses to increase that penetration rate significantly. I will ask Brian Griffin who leads again that area maybe to give a little bit of commentary about the kinds of things that we have been working on and what he is seeing in the marketplace. Brian? Brian Griffin : Thanks, Gail. Good morning. In terms of the \u2013 Lance, your question around the specialty, to Gail\u2019s point, we\u2019ve had significant success in really driving specialty penetration across all of our key products. I think you have seen that and we have talked about that in previous calls relative to dental and vision. To Gail\u2019s point, I do believe that there is incremental opportunity specifically around our life and disability products, I think that there is more that we can do there. Obviously, we talked earlier about pharmacy and we are seeing significant interest in the integrated value proposition in medical and RX together, particularly in our large group and national account marketplace. That message seems to be resonating significantly in those markets. And I think we have a unique value proposition that we can bring to market up. Obviously, you have heard me talk about that, but we are seeing at this point given where we are in the implementation of our own PBM significant interest there in that value proposition. I think actually that will help us more broadly across all of our products, because we can then begin to think about integrated value propositions across dental vision and pharmacy altogether in a single package. So, I think to Gail\u2019s point there is quite a bit that we can do in terms of the repackaging of our value proposition to drive that penetration rate. The other key investment the Gail alluded to is we made a really significant investment in our broker portal, which is really designed to allow the brokers to more efficiently compare plan designs, various products. It brings in our specialty products into that evaluation and it just makes it candidly easier to do business with us in that regard and allows them to look at the full product suite that we bring to both small group and large group. So, that was an investment that we see paying off. We are getting great reaction from the broker community and I think we will get deeper penetration rates as a result of it. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for your questions. Next please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks. Good morning. Gail, can you maybe talk about the competitive landscape obviously big vertical deal in the space, maybe just broad thoughts about opportunity maybe near-term during potential disruption there and maybe longer term sort of the comfort with the margin profile, particularly within commercial risk? And then just your position again as we sort of see models evolve that seemed to offer a lot more than largely an insurance product in terms of your position or where you would like to be positioned there? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks, Ralph. Let me try to get through the different parts of your question in terms of the landscape and I will go back to where I started I think again in my remarks and then I think we have significant opportunity for growth across all of our businesses. And as I think about the competitive landscape, I think we are actually fairly well positioned. I am going to be intensely focused on the execution of the capabilities we are investing in growth, we are investing in product modularization, so we can get product to market more quickly and that we can be simpler in terms of how we face off externally to our clients and brokers and customers and more agile. In terms of the overall market space, I will start with what where I think we have a significant opportunity is the Medicare space. We have been historically underpenetrated in the Medicare Advantage individual market. Our acquisitions give us some nice scale and we had a very strong open enrollment and we will continue I think to do very well in the dual eligible market. We have got strong capabilities, a strong star rating and those will help position us well and so we see that as the significant growth. The other area that I haven\u2019t talked about is the group Medicare market. That\u2019s an area that we really have not participated in that extensively in the past. We have been investing in that area to build our capabilities. And I think that we are going to see very strong enrollment going forward because of quite frankly the strong Blue brand resonates very well with that marketplace and we do think we have an opportunity to also have agents from our current book of business or commercial book to keep the Blue brand into Medicare. So, that\u2019s one strong area of growth and I think we are well positioned competitively in that market. And we have been \u2013 and our margins have been improving in that marketplace and it\u2019s again the area of investment and certainly having a 4-star 70% this year and 4-star helps in that regard. In the Medicaid side, I do think we have a best-of-breed asset and we will continue to compete for RFPs. We do see an opportunity with an $80 billion pipeline to compete in the specialized services marketplace. Again, our CareMore assets are really interesting opportunity for us there, because it allows us to take some of the most acute and ill population and really managed their care to deliver extraordinary results both in cost of care, but also in outcomes for those patients. So, that\u2019s an opportunity. We are expanding that into the Medicaid population. And then we also talked about the partnerships that we recently formed and we think that we have recently formed and we think that there will be more opportunity for those partnerships across other plans as well as our Blues - Blue brother. On the commercial side again the margin profile there, I think we have market leading commercial market share, but I think there\u2019s an opportunity for us to do more and I see that opportunity again with leveraging our Blue brand, but also leveraging our local market expertise with greater ability to put new product into the market improve our digital facing capabilities and streamline how we work with each of the partners that we have in those investments that we started making and we\u2019re accelerating those as part of our outlook into 2018. Again, we have very, very solid margin profile and I feel good about our ability to manage medical costs and our focus really is on affordability and access for consumers. So that will continue to be there is a priority and then finally again going back to some of the other assets, that I\u2019ve seen inside of Anthem, which I don\u2019t think as well known game we have an opportunity again to invest in scale those across the system may already delivering good value and I think we can evening increase and enhance those more. So overall I\u2019m pretty, pretty positive about the competitive environment, obviously we are in a very competitive environment there is many players in our space in each of the markets that I shared, but I feel good about our positioning and where we\u2019re heading in the future and our opportunity to continue to enhance and focus our execution. Thank you for the question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tanal from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Steve Tanal : Good morning, guys. Thanks \u2013 thanks for the question and congrats Gail on the new role. Just wanted follow-up on sort of discussion around value-based contract being and kind of thoughts and the opportunity moving forward. So 60% penetration so it sounds like a high number, it also sounded like the mix maybe those arrangements are bit lower on the risk factor. I was wondering, if you could kind of frame the opportunity from sort of earnings perspective and then what inning you would say were in overall and I guess just relatedly, but little bit separate here. Should we expect to see you guys moving into the provider space in a bigger way and maybe the localities are states where were your shares highest? Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, Steve. In terms of it\u2019s a great way to frame what inning when I think \u2013 we think about that a lot and I would say it\u2019s probably early innings and truth across the entire industry. We\u2019re all looking for ways to find greater affordability and drive I think more integrated care. And so we have as you can imagine a breath of relationships across our market and we try to meet the care provider community where they are, we would love to see them be willing to take a more risk and part of where we\u2019re investing is also in provider enablement capability. So I would say, we\u2019re going to continue to focus on a building those relationships and moving them from you maybe just to gain share to taking more upside downside risk to more fully participation. But again we also realize that some that \u2013 that\u2019s not going to be perfect for each of the \u2013 the care providers that we work with and they have to come along and feel comfortable about the relationship. In terms of our focus on where we are focused on our best use of capital to drive value and we do think the partnership model makes sense, again we do own some assets ready and we feel good about those, we\u2019ll continue to invest in those, because we see the real return that they aren\u2019t but some overall, we\u2019re going to look to leverage the best use of capital in the markets, where we are and one of the advantages that we have is our deep market share. So partnerships can work because, we have deep market share across all of the businesses, we serve in we see that as a real opportunity. Operator : And your final question today comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks for squeezing me and I\u2019ll add my welcome and congratulations to Gail as well. First to follow-up on the PBM, Gail, the company has done a good job of laying out the earnings benefit from retaining the 20% of savings to the bottom line, but you also going to be returning $3 billion or more here to customers. And I was hoping you could flush out your view of how your top line could benefit from the significant improvement in competitive positioning that should come here? And then my core question is what are the 2 or 3 areas that we should be focused on that are going to drive the shift at the higher end of your earnings target that you talked about and over what time period? Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Let me take your second half of your question first, Justin and then I\u2019ll start with the PBM and I\u2019ll ask Brian also to give his commentary. In terms of what will drive, where we look to be at the top end of our earnings per share guidance, I think it\u2019s the growth opportunities that I\u2019ve outlined that the opportunity in Medicare both group and individual, the opportunity in partnerships to leverage our capital effectively in Medicaid. And I also see opportunities in commercial. The other area that I think has really been underleveraged is of the existing assets. So, the assets that we have a name in CareMore to leverage those in the marketplace across other Blues and form real strategic partnerships, so I see that giving us the lift and I think just much more detailed execution on the initiatives that we have had I think give us a really nice pathway to the type of growth that we are looking for across our business. In terms of the PBM questions, I am going to ask Brian maybe to comment on those directly, because I know he has been very directly involved in all of this. Brian Griffin : Good morning, Justin. Just I guess tied back to my commentary on Lance\u2019s question, I think with us launching our new PBM and really as a result of that taking full control over all the key financial levers, I think that really puts us in a very different competitive position moving forward. Our focus through Ingenio is really on better overall health outcomes. And I think that\u2019s very different than the way that the PBM industry has looked at that. I think that there has been a focus on driving pure rebate optimization as opposed to a focus on total healthcare costs. But I think as I mentioned earlier, our integrated value proposition is really resonating out in the market. And I think as a result of that that positions us really nicely for growth both in terms of our local business, but our national ASO business. My vision for Ingenio is really to become a utility within the Blue system as well and we have seen interest in that regard that\u2019s already developing. And I think we are building our own platform that really meets the needs of other Blue plans. So, I see that as a great new opportunity. We have just in executing against our strategy already, we have made significant progress in terms of driving improved values in terms of new formulary designs as well as new network strategies. That will continue to be a focus for us as we launch Ingenio 1120 more broadly. And I think as a result we will be in a better overall competitive position. So, expect us to really focus on growth outside of both within our local markets, local small group and large group and our national account business, but really looking at new ASO standalone pharmacy business as a new market for us as well as that Blue opportunity. And in addition to that additional sets of clinical services that we will be offering through Ingenio that have been developed here at Anthem over the last several years, so we are excited about what the new growth opportunities mean in terms of to your point, obviously, we are going to see significant savings as a result of our new contract position that will flow through to our customers, but then the expanded growth opportunities in these new markets, where historically we haven\u2019t participated. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Brian. And I will put a fine point on maybe Justin, just the three things that will really drive volume we see has granted success in our new RX-only RFPs, increasing the penetration rates in our existing medical book of business and being the PBM for other health plans. Those will be three key drivers for us going forward. Gail Boudreaux : Well, thank you very much everyone for all of your thoughtful questions. As I hope you can tell I am excited to be here at Anthem and the opportunity to advance our strategic priorities to create a healthcare system that\u2019s more affordable and simpler. As I outlined earlier, we will be focused on optimizing execution across our business and ensuring that we leverage our unique assets to strategically position the company for sustainable high-quality earnings growth. I want to thank each of our associates for their commitment to Anthem and for living our values each and every day to deliver on the promises to our consumers. Thank you for your interest in Anthem and I look forward to speaking with you at future events. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T executive teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

LLC Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Anthem First Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Chris Rigg - Anthem, Inc.: Good morning, and welcome to Anthem's first quarter 2018 earnings call. This is Chris Rigg, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with us this morning are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Peter Haytaian, President of our Commercial & Specialty business division; Brian Griffin, CEO of IngenioRx; Dr. Tunde Sotunde, President, Medicaid; Marc Russo, President, Medicare; and Tom Zielinski, our General Counsel. Gail will begin the call by giving an overview of our first quarter financial results, followed by commentary around our focus on execution, leadership rotations and growth priorities. John will then discuss our key financial metrics in greater detail and go over our updated 2018 outlook. We will then be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Anthem's first quarter 2018 earnings call. This morning, we reported first quarter 2018 GAAP earnings per share of $4.99 and adjusted earnings per share of $5.41, which were ahead of expectations, driven by strong medical cost performance and improved operating margins. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of America's 1st Choice, which added 135,000 Medicare Advantage lives in Central Florida. This acquisition, along with the acquisition of HealthSun in late 2017, aligns with our strategy to grow our business through deep integration in the markets we serve. Anthem is now the third largest Medicare Advantage plan in the fast-growing Florida market, serving more than 225,000 members in the central and southern portions of the state. With the addition of America's 1st Choice and HealthSun, Anthem is now the only national health care company to offer five 5 STAR Medicare Advantage plans. First quarter operating revenues were relatively flat at $22.3 billion, due primarily to a reduction in Individual membership resulting from planned exits in the ACA-compliant marketplace. Revenues for Government business grew 10% year-over-year as a result of our continued focus on quality and our leadership in serving the complex social and medical requirement of the Dual Special Needs population. Growth in service fee revenue reflects increased sales of our member and clinical engagement program to self-funded customers, an area where we see additional growth opportunity. Anthem's medical cost ratio came in at a better-than-expected 81.5%. The better-than-expected results reflect our commitment to strong medical cost performance by effectively leveraging community-based, innovative and integrated clinical and value-based care arrangements across our markets. Our SG&A ratio was in line with expectations at 15.3%, leading to a favorable first quarter operating margin of 8.4%. Based on our strong first quarter financial performance, the strengthening of our operating discipline and our updated expectations for the remainder of the year, we are raising our full year 2018 adjusted earnings per share outlook to greater than $15.30, a 27% increase from 2017. We are intensely focused on delivering on our financial commitments, optimizing execution across our business segments, offering even greater value for those we serve and investing wisely in our future growth. During the quarter, we continued to make strategic investments in technology modernization, population and consumer digital health, data analytics and product development capabilities to enhance our consumer experience, increase speed to market and position Anthem to respond to the evolving needs of our customers and the changing health care environment. Moving beyond financial performance, we continue to align our organization and investments to accelerate growth across Anthem and more effectively leverage our strong brand and local market position. We expect continued growth across our Government business and our fee-based commercial membership throughout the remainder of the year. The solid growth in our fee-based membership during the quarter reflects our focus on combining Anthem's best-in-class medical position with innovative consumer engagement program, flexible network strategies and integrated clinical management tools. Anthem Health Guide is an example of one of those programs. Health Guide helps employers manage their total cost of care through improved consumer engagement and an integrated clinical and customer service model and to-date, more than 5 million individuals are enrolled in the program. For every dollar invested in Health Guide, employers realize up to $4 in savings. Anthem Engage is another example of how we're improving the consumer experience through digital capabilities that provide real-time access to information and a range of personalized tools to help our members make better health decisions. Roughly 800,000 Anthem members have already adopted Anthem Engage after its launch this quarter and we expect that number to more than double over the next 12 months. We are disappointed in the decline of our large group insured membership. With reintroduction of the insurer fee, negatively impacted persistency and a greater-than-expected number of customers converted from insured to self-funded. We recognize that we did not respond quickly enough to market dynamics and competitor actions with more affordable product options to help offset the impact of the insurer fee. Going forward, the investments we're making in modularization and product development along with better alignment of our segment and local market leadership will enable us to more effectively leverage information and respond to changes across all of our markets while maintaining our disciplined approach to pricing. Our newly established sales effectiveness organization is focused on driving commercial sales through an increasingly sophisticated, coordinated go-to-market strategy that we expect to translate into membership growth for the remainder of 2018 and into 2019. In Medicaid, we continue to develop strategic partnerships with other health plans and care providers that combine our best-in-class Medicaid operating platform with their local market expertise. During the quarter, we launched a new Medicaid joint venture with the Arkansas Provider Coalition, marking our eighth Medicaid alliance. Under this partnership, we will be initially responsible for providing behavioral health management services with an expansion into a full-risk health management product next year. As I shared during our last earnings call, our partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota will go live in the fall of 2018 and serve approximately 375,000 Medicaid and Dual-Eligible members by the end of the year. We are intensely focused on capitalizing on the pipeline of activity in our Medicaid business. The overall opportunity includes 10 RFPs to be released in the next 18 months and approximately $80 billion in Medicaid contracts that will be awarded between now and 2022, representing incremental opportunity to our existing business. Much of this opportunity is focused on new and specialized service populations, where Anthem continues to invest and differentiate ourselves. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to grow Medicare Advantage business faster than the industry growth rate overall, driven by strong sales performance during the annual election period and throughout the year. We are pleased with our progress and are increasing our investments in 2018 to drive greater membership growth and support continued star-rating improvement. With the addition of America's 1st Choice, we now expect to end the year with approximately 900,000 Medicare Advantage lives with more than 70% in 4 STAR plan. With a total of five 5 STAR plans, we believe that our ability to market year round coupled with our enhanced capabilities will help improve our penetration in the market. We are pleased with the progress in our integration planning ahead of the launch of IngenioRx. We continue to expect to fully migrate our membership on to our new platform by January 1, 2021 and feel very good about the growth opportunities that lie ahead for us with a competitive PBM offering. Earlier this month, we released our first IngenioRx drug trend report, which summarizes the consolidated pharmacy and medical drug trends for Anthem's affiliated health plans. The report demonstrates unique value that our holistic, integrated approach will bring to the PBM marketplace through our ability to leverage both medical and pharmacy data to reduce drug costs, identify gaps in care and improve compliance and outcomes. Finally, I want to update you on how we are progressing in our efforts to improve execution across Anthem. On the previous earnings call, I shared my focus on operational performance discipline and the work we're doing to create an agile culture that proactively identifies new opportunities to drive profitable top line growth. Within the current dynamic health care landscape, we have a unique opportunity to leverage our assets and better serve customer needs by enhancing quality and affordability. Our primary focus is in optimizing our performance within our current business, while also creating an organization that can maximize the many growth opportunities we have identified and capitalize on new growth opportunities as they emerge. We will continue to be opportunistic in our approach to M&A. Our recently completed acquisitions of America's 1st Choice and HealthSun are examples of solidifying our market presence in Florida, the fastest-growing Medicare Advantage state. We're also evaluating opportunities that expand our capabilities or broaden our geographic position to better serve our members. Within our businesses, we're increasing our focus on leveraging the power of our local market presence, which is key to driving change in health care. By combining our best-in-class local market share and our broad capabilities in medical, pharmacy and specialty, we can deliver innovative approaches to ensure our members receive high quality care in the right setting at the right time. For example, our Anthem Whole Health Connection is an innovative program that leverages Anthem's broad capabilities to provide a holistic approach to care for our commercial members. Through the program, network providers can access Anthem's medical, pharmacy, dental, vision and disability claim and clinical data, which can help them better diagnose and improve the health of their patients. For example, an eye care provider is able to access clinical data that helps determine whether a patient's eye condition is also linked to other chronic diseases, such as diabetes or heart disease. Additionally, we remain focused on improving the overall quality and cost of health care by aligning incentives in the provider community and rewarding the highest quality, most innovative providers. Anthem has been recognized as the leader in this area through programs like Enhanced Personal Health Care, which was launched in 2012 to support primary care providers in coordinating, planning and managing care for their patients. A recent analysis of our Enhanced Personal Health Care results from 2013 to 2016 demonstrated that we saved over $1.2 billion of medical costs per year over the three-year period. Enhanced Personal Health Care provider consistently delivered better outcomes than a matched group of peers, who do not participate in the program. We continue to see growth in this program in both participating care providers and members, with more than 61,000 providers and 5.7 million Anthem Commercial members benefiting from the programs demonstrated value and reducing costs and improving care. We know that in order to provide consumers with high quality health care and improved outcome, we also need to look beyond traditional health care delivery. Through our integrated care delivery programs and the Anthem Foundation, we are focused on addressing social and societal issues in areas such as housing and food supply, which also significantly impacts good health. For example, our CareMore Togetherness Program is the first in the industry to address the growing issue of senior loneliness. The program, which launched last year, provides isolated seniors with weekly phone calls, home visits, transportation and a connection to community-based programs. Through the Togetherness Program, we've been able to close gaps in care and increase participation in CareMore's Care Centers. Despite the participant's higher Comorbidity Index Scores relative to other members, their admits per 1,000 were 5% lower in year one and their total medical cost, 13% lower for seniors participating in this program. Finally, as you may have noted from the introductions at the beginning of the call, we've made some leadership changes to better align the strength of our executive team with critical opportunities to drive improved execution and growth. First, Brian Griffin has been appointed as CEO of IngenioRx, one of our most important growth opportunities. With more than 30 years of experience and a deep understanding of pharmacy benefit management, Brian brings the leadership skills necessary to build and launch IngenioRx as a transformative PBM offering, with best-in-class capabilities to deliver better outcome and a lower cost of care. Pete Haytaian is now leading our Commercial & Specialty business. As President of our Government business, Pete demonstrated his ability to deliver consistent results, with double-digit revenue growth and new Medicaid partnerships. In this new role, Pete will be able to apply his broad operational skill set to drive growth within the commercial side of our organization. We are currently conducting a search for a new leader of our Government business division. Within the Government business division, Dr. Tunde Sotunde has been appointed President of our Medicaid business. Tunde has proven to be a strong operator, with extensive Medicaid experience and, most recently, led Anthem's North Medicaid region. Additionally, Marc Russo will continue to lead our Medicare business. Marc has been highly successful in driving our work to rebuild our Medicare Advantage business over the last four years. Dr. Craig Samitt is now leading our newly formed Diversified business group. Today, Anthem's clinical performance has been driven, in large part, through a collection of medical management, care delivery and analytics solutions represented by our AIM, CareMore, Health Insights and HealthCore division. We have now unified these businesses under the Diversified business group umbrella and we'll invest in this division as a vehicle to enhance Anthem's clinical performance and drive Diversified growth. Craig brings more than 20 years of experience in health care delivery and service organization and is ideally suited to lead our efforts in capitalizing on new sources of growth and deepening our relationships within the health care community. In addition to the leadership changes on my executive team, we are also implementing a new management structure within our Commercial business that will allow us to better deliver innovative solutions with greater speed to market and accelerate growth. This new structure is organized around our Products segment with a focus on our large group, small group and Individual products and will align our product, underwriting and network strategies, consistently driving best practices across all 14 Anthem states and enabling our local leadership team to execute and deliver the most appropriate solutions for our customers. We will be adding talent across the organization that will help us further capitalize on growth opportunities and execute on our planned investments. As you already know from this call, Chris Rigg has joined Anthem as Vice President, Investor Relations. Chris comes to Anthem after spending more than 15 years as a sellside equity research analyst covering the health care services industry. And finally, we recently announced that Rajeev Ronanki will be joining Anthem in the second quarter as our Chief Digital Officer. Rajeev brings more than 15 years of leadership experience in health care and technology, most recently focused on advancing analytics through artificial intelligence. Rajeev will oversee the execution of our digital, artificial intelligence and other exponential technologies. To summarize, while we are pleased with our first quarter performance, we know we have more work to do to unlock the full potential of our company, deliver shareholder value and make a meaningful difference in the health care experience for our members. With that, I'll turn the call over to John to discuss our first quarter financials in greater detail. John? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you, Gail, and good morning. As Gail mentioned, our financial performance was strong for the first quarter, with GAAP earnings per share of $4.99 and adjusted earnings per share of $5.41, both ahead of our expectations. Our results reflect strong medical management performance across the enterprise. We ended the quarter with 39.6 million members, a decline of 616,000 members since the end of 2017. Our self-funded membership grew by 333,000 members during the quarter to 25.3 million lives, equating to growth of 1.3% versus the end of 2017. The increase was mainly driven by new account wins in our National and Local Group businesses. Our fully insured membership declined by 949,000 members during the quarter, primarily driven by the actions we took last year to reduce our participation in certain Individual ACA-compliant markets. Our Individual membership ended the quarter with 755,000 lives, a decline of more than 800,000 versus year end 2017. Of our remaining members, roughly 500,000 are in ACA-compliant products and approximately 250,000 are in non-ACA-compliant products. Additionally, as Gail mentioned earlier, our large group insured enrollment declined by more than we expected. These declines were partially offset by growth in our Medicare business, reflecting the recent acquisitions as well as strong organic membership growth across our markets. In the first quarter of 2018, operating revenues of $22.3 billion were relatively flat compared to our prior year quarter. Revenue results versus the prior year reflect premium rate increases to cover overall medical cost trends and to cover the impact of the return of the health insurance tax in 2018. Additionally, first quarter 2018 revenues include the HealthSun and America's 1st Choice acquisitions, along with the organic enrollment group in the Medicare business. These increases were mostly offset by the impact of our lower Individual, Local Group insured and Medicaid enrollment. Our first quarter results benefited from a few retro premium adjustments in our Medicaid business. These are adjustments where we have been proactively engaging with our state partners and we had expected to receive the adjustments in the second quarter. Fortunately, certain adjustments were received at the end of first quarter, increasing our first quarter results by nearly $0.20 per share. The medical loss ratio in the first quarter came in at 81.5%, a decrease of 220 basis points from the prior year quarter. The decline was primarily driven by return of the health (sic) insurance tax in 2018. In addition, medical cost performance across our business segments came in better than we had expected, supported by our integrated clinical and care management programs. Additionally, we improved the financial performance in our Individual business as a result of the strategic actions that were taken in 2017 and our results also include the timing benefit from the retroactive revenue adjustments in our Medicaid business. Our continued focus on deploying effective medical cost of care initiatives across the enterprise is bearing fruit, as evidenced by our gross margin results in the quarter. Our strong results include covering the cost of an elevated flu season. Not only did the flu season start earlier than normal, which impacted our fourth quarter 2017 earnings, it also peaked at levels not seen since the 2009, 2010 flu season. Our initial 2018 guidance assumed the impact of a more severe flu season than normal, but flu activity peaked even higher than those estimates in February. Fortunately, flu activity returned to normal levels in early March, which was faster than we had anticipated. Related to the 2018 medical cost trends, we continue to expect our Local Group insured medical cost trend to be in the range of 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Our first quarter 2018 SG&A expense ratio came in at 15.3%, 100 basis points higher than the 14.3% in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in the ratio versus the prior year was mainly due to the return of the health (sic) insurance tax in 2018 and the impact of increased investment spend to support our growth initiatives. Additionally, our first quarter 2017 SG&A ratio was elevated due to the Penn Treaty assessments. Overall, our results were very strong and slightly better than our expectations. We aggressively managed the impact of fixed cost deleveraging from our reduced footprint in the Individual market and remained disciplined in managing our administrative expense, while funding a meaningful increase in our investment spending. So, now turning to the balance sheet, as in the past, we have included a roll forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. For the first quarter of 2018, we experienced favorable prior year reserve development of approximately $650 million, which was moderately better-than-expected. Our reserves continue to include a provision for average deviation in the mid to high single digits and we believe our reserve balance has remained consistent and strong as of March 31, 2018. Our Days in Claims Payable was 40.3 days in the first quarter, an increase of 0.9 days from the 39.4 days we reported at the end of 2017. We continue to believe that our DCPs will be in the high 30s over time. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of our outstanding common stock with $395 million at a weighted average price of $223.51 per share. We also used $192 million during the quarter for our cash dividend. And yesterday, our audit committee declared a second quarter dividend of $0.75 per share. Our debt-to-cap ratio was 42.4% at the end of the first quarter, a decrease of 50 basis points from the 42.9% we reported as of the fourth quarter 2017. We continue to expect a decrease in debt-to-cap ratio towards the low 40s. During the quarter, we raised approximately $850 million from the debt markets. The additional debt, along with cash on hand, was used for the purchase of America's 1st Choice, the repayment of $625 million of debt that matured in the quarter, share repurchases and the payment of ordinary dividends and interest expense in the quarter. As a result, we ended the quarter with cash and investments at the parent company of $1.1 billion, a decrease from the $2.8 billion we reported in the fourth quarter. And finally, our operating cash flow during the first quarter was $2.2 billion or 1.7 times net income. Cash flow in the quarter included the impact of collecting an extra CMS Medicare payment and also the fact that we did not make an estimated federal tax payment. As a reminder, we will make two estimated tax payments to the federal government in the second quarter. Overall, first quarter operating cash flow was in line with our expectations. Turning to discuss our high level expectations for the remainder of the year, we continue to expect our fully insured enrollment to be in the range of 14.8 million to 14.9 million members by the end of the year, reflecting higher Medicare Advantage enrollment from America's 1st Choice, offset by the lower-than-expected membership in our Local Group insured business. Self-funded membership is now expected to be in the range of 25.3 million to 25.4 million members, an increase of 100,000 members from our previous outlook, driven by better-than-expected enrollment in BlueCard. In total, we now expect medical membership to end the year within a range of 40.1 million to 40.3 million lives, relatively flat from where we ended 2017, which means we successfully replaced the lost membership from our reduced footprint in our Individual ACA-compliant markets. Operating revenue is now expected to be in the range of $91 billion to $92 billion, an increase of $500 million at the midpoint in the prior range. The increase is driven by the addition of America's 1st Choice, partially offset by lower-than-expected enrollment in our Local Group insured products. We now expect our consolidated medical loss ratio to be 84.4%, plus or minus 30 basis points, a 10-basis point improvement at the midpoint from our previous expectations. Our updated medical loss ratio reflects the better-than-expected medical cost performance in the first quarter across the enterprise. The SG&A ratio is now expected to be 15.4%, plus or minus 30 basis points, a decrease of 10 basis points at the midpoint as the mix of our operating revenue profile is more weighted with revenues that have a lower-than-average administrative expense ratio. We continue to expect 2018 operating cash flows to be greater than $4 billion. Taken together and reflecting our strong first quarter and positive outlook for the remainder of 2018, we now expect our full year 2018 GAAP earnings per share to be greater than $14.12 and adjusted earnings per share to be greater than $15.30. And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : And, ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question today comes from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Congratulations, Chris, on the new role there. Just thanks, Gail, for laying out all those initiatives and priorities that you have. I wondered when you think about capital needs and where you're going to direct capital, do those initiatives require much capital? Do they change your thinking on capital uses? John, I don't know, if you affirmed the $1.5 billion buyback target. Is that still the target? And then sort of a variation on the priorities and initiatives aspect, also ask you about industry consolidation, how that's factoring into your strategy? Obviously, other people's consolidation I guess I'm more thinking about. Does that change any priorities for you? Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Great. Well, good morning, A.J., and thanks for the question. There is a couple of things embedded in your question. So, let me start and then I'll ask John also to comment on capital. Our capital priority is consistent to what I shared in the fourth quarter call, which is a balanced approach to dividends and buybacks as well as continuing investments in our own business and we see a number of opportunities, as I've shared, that we're continuing to invest in; the modularization of our product capabilities, consolidation of our systems to two and platforms. We're also investing in our digital capabilities to provide more personalized and responsive support. And so, we see these as a couple of the investments as well as the continued investment and how we work with our care providers across integrated delivery opportunities. So, I guess I would answer your overall question with our capital deployment priorities are pretty consistent. On the M&A front, as I shared in my comments, we are certainly opportunistic as we were with the two Medicare Advantage assets that we currently purchased, which are high quality and we think help us provide a much deeper penetration into our Medicare Advantage business. And we also are opportunistic about capabilities that we think can help drive the growth opportunities across our business. From an industry consolidation standpoint, we feel we've got significant growth opportunities in terms of our own business. The launch of IngenioRx provides us with some really significant growth opportunities over the next several years and we think that's going to resonate very strongly in the marketplace and as I've also shared, I think, across the Medicaid space, significant pipeline of specialty, different specialized populations as well as core growth. Medicare, again, we're investing in that space and continue to invest in that space, we're very positive about it. And I also do believe that we have opportunity, as I've shared, in our Commercial space as we improve our execution at the Individual market level. I'll ask John maybe to make some additional comments given that? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yes. Thank you, A.J., and good morning. So, I'll just \u2013 on the share buyback, yes, we do intend to still buy back approximately $1.5 billion during the year. If you look at our first quarter results, we're a little bit north of one-fourth of that associated with actual buyback those occurred so far in the first three months of the year. And on the capital deployment, as Gail said, we want to be opportunistic and we also want to be very capital efficient. I don't know that there's a better example of standing up a new line in a capital efficient manner than how we're handling the IngenioRx rollout. I mean, we're going to stand up our own PBM in the most capital efficient manner within the industry and feel very, very good about that. And then, you take the other capital that we have in terms of being opportunistic, we think we can really deploy it very wisely over the next few years. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Great. We'll go to the next question. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah, thanks. Good morning. So, your MLR is looking great, you've improved your guidance. Your operating margin expansion is great. It sounds like, of course, the fully insured just generally remains pressured for the industry. If you look forward into 2019, do you think we could see your MLRs and margins sustainable while you still grow membership just because it looks like your medical cost structure is improving, you may get more specialty penetration (36:11) or might we see some compromise on the margins versus membership? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. Hi, Ana, this is John. So, thank you for the question. In terms of the MLR, we're very pleased with the performance that we have here in the first quarter and I believe that our outlook and increasing guidance by $0.30 to greater than $15.30 actually helps us solidify the sustainability of that. As we look to 2019, it's a little premature to provide specific information associated with metrics. But what I will say is that when we price, we'll price in a disciplined manner. We'll price based on our target margins, which are determined on a pre-tax basis and feel very good about the fact that we have a good sustainable platform in order to grow our business. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Thank you. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Our next question. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot. Good morning, guys. I guess just a bigger picture question, maybe for you, Gail. On the last call, you sort of reiterated a commitment to a long-term EPS growth algorithm of high singles to low double digits and I guess your optimism toward moving to the higher end of that range. And of course, there's some of your competitors that have higher growth rates out there, but granted with a different mix of business. And so I guess, what I'm trying to understand is what would it take to sort of reset that algorithm higher? And should we assume that some of those specific actions are part of your longer-term plan? Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Well, thanks for the question, Steve. What I shared with everyone at the last call is we feel very optimistic about our business. There's a number of things inside of our business, which I've already outlined and we'll go through them again, but the growth opportunity is \u2013 the organic growth opportunity is plus the growth that the standing up of IngenioRx brings to us, I think, provide us a lot of confidence around moving from high single to low double digits at the higher end of that range. So, I'm not going to comment beyond that, but I would say that across our leadership team and the work that we're focused on, which is clearly executing on our opportunities, we always aspire to do better, but we're intensely focused on delivering on the commitments that we've laid out. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Next question? Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Gail, this one is around kind of you changing your organizational structure and go-to-market strategy and the service areas. I've heard you talk before and today about preparing that IngenioRx PBM business for external sales. What other services do you envision potentially being able to go-to-market and provide to, say, Blue Sisters or other plans? And again, within the organizational structure change, are those going to be attached to or folded into IngenioRx in some way or just thinking about how do you plan to go to market with that? Thanks. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Great. Well, thank you for the question. There's a couple of ways to look at it. IngenioRx, by itself, is a significant opportunity for us to sell a, I think, a new model PBM, so we've shared that opportunity. But in addition to that on the call today, talking about our Diversified business group, we have historically had a number of companies and assets that we are looking to leverage more extensively. Assets like AIM and CareMore, or Health Insights, or Health Analytics, payment integrity, those are assets that first and foremost we deployed inside of Anthem to help deliver many of the medical cost results that we've had. Provider enablement and tools, the Enhanced Personal Care initiative that I shared with you is another example of not just contracting methodologies, but data, informatics and tools in supporting care providers at the market level. What we're doing is really bringing those together. First and foremost, we're focused and we think we do have an opportunity to sell those to other plans within the system and also do partnerships with them. I think the Medicaid partnerships are great example of our goal, I think, to help leverage our assets to help overall system and we think that we've got some very strong capabilities there. But it's also I think beyond the Blue system working with care providers and their system I think we've got opportunities to sell into that as well. So, it's a fairly broad strategy. We've just brought this asset together. So, at this stage, it's an emerging component, but it's something that already provides us support inside of our business. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Next question? Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. Wanted to ask a strategic question about the deals that are going on around here, I guess, there's two things, I guess, that I'd like you to respond to. The first one is this perception that some companies have decided to mainly to build or, sorry, buy capabilities to get the benefits of what they're doing. I understand that you think that you can build things through IngenioRx, but obviously, there's a time difference and potentially something that's already there in place and working well versus building something out and proving out that concept. So, I want to get your thoughts around that. And the second part, really being the cash flow impact of these transactions, when I look at United from a free cash flow basis doing $13 billion and CVS-Aetna doing $12 billion. I think about free cash flow of the parent at Anthem, it's going to be maybe quarter of that size or a third of that size. So, how do you think about your ability to kind of compete for the next round of deals or next kind of capabilities given your competitors are getting much bigger? Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Kevin, thanks for the question. Let me address the strategic opportunities and then I'll have John speak to a little bit of the cash flow impact. First and foremost, I think John stated it particularly around the PBM. We're going to be able to build an incredibly cash efficient, capitally efficient PBM by leveraging the buying power of our partner, CVS, in this. We're going to put into the market sort of all new capabilities essentially and I think, from that perspective, we feel that we're advantaged that we have an opportunity to build the next-generation PBM with brand new technology and at scale and not only across our business, but an opportunity to sell that into other businesses. More broadly, as we think about M&A, one of the unique things, I think, for Anthem, is our deep market presence and we have significant organic growth opportunities inside of our own business that we're going to leverage and take advantage of. But we also have opportunities because of our scale and local scale to do partnerships and again, more effectively leverage capital in the most efficient way. So, I think that our overall strategy, yes, we'll be opportunistic particularly around capabilities and areas that we think will help us grow our business faster, but we have a very strong view of where we believe that our growth profile can come from and the positive returns that we can have. So, with that, I'll ask John to more specifically address your question around \u2013 on overall capital. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you, Kevin, for the question. In terms of our cash flow and cash availability at our parent, we do have we believe enough dry powder available given our size and our scale. As Gail said, we want to be opportunistic about M&A, solidify our expanded footprint, enhanced (44:07) capabilities, basically what do we need to do to serve our members better and we'll look at M&A in that capacity and believe that we are not at all disadvantaged in terms of our ability to finance a potential acquisition. We don't want to do a deal for the sake of doing a deal. We want to do a deal to help serve our members better and we need to make sure that we keep that in mind as we go forward and look at these potential opportunities. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Next question, please? Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : Hi, thanks. Good morning and congrats to Chris as well. First question, I guess, my question here. You've made some comments about a month ago around the cadence of earnings this year and implied something north of $4.50 in the first quarter, did more than $0.90 above that. I heard the $0.20 of timing related to the Medicaid retro payment, so maybe it's only $0.70 of upside. I just want to juxtapose that with the guidance going up by $0.30. I didn't hear anything sort of negative or offsetting or even worrisome in the commentary. Was there a big sort of acceleration in investments or something else that we should be thinking about, a changing seasonality or something else that you noticed? And then, if I could sneak in a quick follow-up, can you use America's 1st Choice, that 5 STAR plan, can you use that to expand your footprint through plan consolidation? Is that actually a strategy you're going to use to have more 5 STAR plans or larger geographies under 5 STARs? Thanks. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Sure, Josh. I'll take your first half of your one question and then turn it over to Gail for the second half. But in terms of seasonality and guidance, you're correct, about a month or so ago, we talked about the fact that a year ago, we earned a little more than two-thirds of our earnings in the first six months of the year and the expectation here in 2018 is that it would be just over 60%, slightly greater than 60% would be earned in the first half of the year. And then, a little bit more than half of that would be earned in the first quarter. And when that was made, there were a couple of things. You've identified the $0.20 timing issue associated with the Medicaid retro premium adjustments, where that's a great thing, we got that early. That clearly just moves money from the second quarter to the first quarter in terms of our expectations, doesn't really change the overall annual structure. The other part was the flu season. We had anticipated a worse than normal flu season. It started in December and our guidance baked that in. And through the end of February, it was quite elevated and we expected it to be elevated through the end of March. And quite honestly, the month of March was a more normalized flu season, and so, that in and of itself created a benefit to the first quarter more so than we were expecting. And then really, and probably most important, is the strong underlying results, better-than-expected MLR, really strong medical management-type initiatives and success in that area and all those things I'll equate it to really a very, very strong first quarter. We still believe that for the first half of the year that our earnings expectations is that it will be slightly greater than 60% of the annual number. But as you pointed out, it is a little bit different between the first quarter and second quarter than maybe we anticipated 30 days ago. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Hi, Josh. In terms of your second question, just a couple of points. One, as I indicated earlier in my comments, we do have five 5 STAR plans and two of those 5 STAR plans are already in the Florida marketplace. So, we feel we obviously have good growth potential there. And as you probably know, CMS is also changing that rule around consolidation. So, our expectations don't include the need to engage in that strategy. It's not a strategy that we've deployed as much I think as some of the others. And then a third point, really, we are a little bit unique in that, we do grow quite a bit through the SEP process with our dual products. So, we feel that there's strong growth opportunities throughout the year in our Medicare Advantage plan. Thank you. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Gail, you talked about the loss of employer group risk membership being driven by Anthem's relative lack of introducing more affordable products to allow employers to offset the return of the health insurer fee. So, let me just apologize upfront for the longwinded question, but given all the focus on the commercial pricing environment, I want to make sure we understand what you're saying here. Can you talk to the 2018 pricing environment specifically around what types of competitive products you're talking about that are driving share shift? For instance, you're referring to like the level funding products that I hear about out there. And specifically, did you see competitors cutting price or not fully passing through the HIF on like-for-like products and thus getting cutting margins or was this mainly product-driven? And then finally, where do you expect to end the year on commercial employer group risk membership and share any color you can on the new product you're planning to introduce to the market and the timing of those products. Thanks. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Thanks, Justin, a very fulsome question there, so I'll attempt to go through the pieces of it and then, I'll also ask Pete Haytaian to comment because he's been out in the market. Well, let me start with sort of the overall environment. The fully insured market has always been competitive and I still believe and it is rational. What I shared is that we did price to the full extent, full impact of the health insurer's fee in the marketplace and we saw a greater percentage of employers converting to self-funded. That was one issue. And the second one, I think, is more of Anthem-specific where in terms of execution at the sales level, we did not offer a fulsome set of buy down opportunities for our employers. That's an area that we recognized, we're disappointed in it, but we also believe that we can offer, we have a portfolio of products, we have two things that we're doing. One is we have been investing heavily in getting product to market faster through this modularization process as well as enhancing and expanding what we have in the marketplace right now. And a lot of that is around affordable options for employers as the health insurance fee increased pricing more than it had in the past. The second is, as part of our segment strategy, getting information more quickly back, so that across our 14 markets, we can make sure that we're deploying those strategies consistently and best practices. So, that's how I would say the market evolved for us. We do think that we have an opportunity going forward to improve that execution. That scenario that Pete has been specifically focused on, I'm going to ask him to probably provide some commentary for you. Pete? Peter D. Haytaian - Anthem, Inc.: Hey, Justin. Thanks for the question. I don't want to repeat everything that Gail said. I think with respect to products and options and network configuration, we definitely have additional opportunities. I've been in the markets now for about four weeks. I'm doing pretty detailed business operating reviews for the last four weeks. I'm encouraged by the opportunity, but I'll say this very directly. I think this is really a matter of execution more than anything, quite frankly. While we can bring more products and services to the marketplace and network configurations, I think what Gail mentioned is critically important and that is the segment model, in which we're going to be sharing best practices across the organization in a consistent manner. Standing up a sales effectiveness organization, we're going to have tools and capabilities that are going to drive consistent growth right down to the account manager and rep level, underwriting being intertwined and really connected with all that, and then leveraging our market relationships and our deep understanding of the market and provider relationships. So, it's a matter of execution I'm encouraged by and I think if we line that all up effectively with some of the new products and services and network configuration that Gail mentioned we will be very successful in the marketplace. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Thanks, Justin. Next question, please? Operator : We do have a question from the line of Zach Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Thank you for the question. I just wanted to go back to the medical loss ratio coming in better than you expected for the quarter. It sounds like flu netted out to slightly better than you thought. Was there anything else in underlying utilization trends endemics to the environment that help to impact that number or was it purely medical cost management? Anything specific you can talk about the medical cost management side that seems to be working? Thank you. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Sure, Zach. Flu clearly was a contributor. Overall, it really was a good disciplined pricing with strong medical cost management across the enterprise. Yeah, I will say that our Individual business actually did a little bit better-than-expected as well. The strategy that we employed with our reduced footprint actually is playing out extremely well and that helped. But it's really it's across the board where we're actually pretty excited about the long-term prospects now. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. And I'll add to John's comments. I would not point to one specific program. We've had a very comprehensive set of initiatives across integrating care providers, enhanced personal care, additional unit costs, I mean, payment integrity, we've invested over the last few years in that and that scenario was also the alignment of our teams in this regional structure. We're now focused with our contracting clinical teams across all of our businesses. And I think that intense focus is also paying off for us. So, I would not point to one specific thing, but I think it's an ongoing focus on managing medical cost effectively for our customers and being a good steward of their dollars. Next question, please? Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Just want to go back to Commercial and sort of the shift from risk to ASO. I think you mentioned that was partly due to HIF. With HIF sort of going away next year, would you expect some of that risk business to come back or are smaller employers sort of not that nimble? And then, as it relates to sort of the business and the shift, was it sort of shifted to ASO, meaning that, you retained it or did you just lose it to a competitor certainly moving from risk to ASO? Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Ralph, thanks for the question. Let me try to kind of walk you through each of the individual pieces. In terms of the shift ASO, I am still and our team is still very optimistic quite frankly about our opportunities in the fully insured space and clearly not having the health insurers fee in 2019 will be a positive overall for our ability to provide affordable products in the marketplace. So yes, we think there's opportunities in the fully insured space. Thinking about the conversion of self-insured, essentially, we retained a portion of it. Certainly, a significant portion of that moved to our self-insured business and we were able to add additional services, our dental life and clinical programs, et cetera, in that space, but we did lose a portion, as you can see, just from the overall numbers and that's an area that Pete I think was very direct about, an area of execution that we think that there were other opportunities for us to impact our persistency and keep those clients Blue. We will, obviously, be working very hard to get those customers back. The market is competitive, it's dynamic and employers, we have a very strong brand reputation and I think very strong loyalty in the market and so that will be part of a win-back campaign that we put into the marketplace. Next question, please? Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Thank you. As you grow your Government business and you look at your competitors in that space that are more substantial in the Government business, several of them are acquiring health care service companies or providers. Is that a direction you see yourselves moving towards in the future? And compare that and contrast that, if you would, with the multidistrict Blue Cross Blue Shield litigation against the Blues plans. Does that actually help you to acquire providers if that's a direction you're going to go in? Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Peter, I'm not going to comment on ongoing litigation. But what I would say about the acquisition of plans and primary care, part of our acquisition for health fund, for example, in our Medicare Advantage assets in Florida, we do have clinics, and they are integrated. We also own CareMore, which is a large part of our strategy around not only Medicare, but also Medicaid and a wrap around Primary Care Plus, also primary care models that we're putting into the marketplace. So, we do own assets in the Government business that support that. But I think I've shared this before. We also believe that because of our market share and the tight alignment that we have with care providers, that we can build great partnerships with them through contracting, through integration, through providing them tools. And what makes it a little different for us is our market share across these markets enables us to do that. And as you saw from even the Enhanced Personal Care results, we're seeing a lot of traction in that model. So, we're very interested in wrapping around things to the home and providing them other services, which we do as part of our AIM subsidiary as well and some of the other work going on in Diversified. Next question, please? Operator : And our last question of the day comes from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of follow-ups on IngenioRx. First, you talked about the capital efficiency of setting this up, which, I think is mostly an acknowledgment that you're not spending tens of billions of dollars to acquire the capabilities. Could you just review for us what capital commitments, if any, you have in 2019 and 2020 for this? And then also on the G&A side, is there a material step up in the G&A investment in 2019 and 2020 as you set this up? And if so, does that mean 20% of the gross benefits still flowing down to earnings is the expectation? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah, hey, Gary, good morning and thank you for the questions. I'll just say at first, in terms of the capital commitments we have associated with Ingenio for setting up in 2019 and 2020, it's quite minimal. And the guidance that we've provided and the long-term growth rate that we've provided has already encompassed whatever additional spending that might need to be incurred in order to set it up successfully. So, we're pretty comfortable with that. And then, in terms of just G&A in general over the next few years, there's always moving parts every year. We have increased our investment spending quite significantly here starting in late 2017 and moving into 2018 as we really want to focus on growth opportunities and enhancements and things that can serve our members better. And we'll, obviously, reassess that on an annual basis, but there's nothing that's truly significant and meaningful that will impact your modeling of it. With that, why don't I turn your question over then to Brian Griffin, who can give you a little bit more color in terms of some of the capabilities that we're building. Brian T. Griffin - Anthem, Inc.: Thanks very much, John. So, yeah, as John indicated, I think that as we evaluated our next step in our strategy with respect to the launch of Ingenio, we were focused on optimizing the value, obviously, that we'd be in a position to create for our clients and consumers. I think importantly, just to add to John's comments, what is very important about this is that we're launching our own PBM. And with that, importantly, we have control over all of the key financial levers. So I think, as John indicated, in terms of new capabilities, we're going to be in the position to have complete control over the design of our pharmacy networks. We, today, have control over all of our formulary and clinical programs. And as we think about relationships with pharma, we'll be in the position to negotiate directly with pharma to create new business relationships. So, that puts us in a position of having a whole new set of capabilities that can, but we don't have today. Obviously, we're very excited about it. I think Gail, in her introductory comments, pointed to the integrated value proposition that we're going to market with and we see the market responding very well to that value proposition. Just two weeks ago, we had our inaugural client form, and I think that there's a lot of enthusiasm, particularly among our medical clients. So that's government labor, our National Accounts. But importantly, also within the Blue Cross Blue Shield system, there's significant interest in us being able to provide them an integrated value proposition themselves. And so I think, we'll see a lot of excitement within that part of the industry as well. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you, Brian. And thank you all for joining us this morning. We're very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead of us. We are intensely focused on improving execution throughout our company, delivering on the significant growth opportunities within our existing business and creating an agile, innovation-focused culture that can identify and capitalize on new growth opportunities in what continues to be a dynamic health care market. And I want to thank each of our more than 58,000 associates for their commitment to Anthem and for living our values each and every day to deliver on our promises to always serve. Thank you for your interest in Anthem and I look forward to speaking with you at future events.

Later, there will be a question-and-answer session; instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Please go ahead. Chris Rigg - Anthem, Inc.: Good morning, and welcome to Anthem's second quarter 2018 earnings call. This is Chris Rigg, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with us this morning are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of our Commercial and Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division. Gail will begin the call by giving an overview of our second quarter financial results, followed by commentary around our focus on execution and our enterprise-wide growth priorities. John will then discuss our key financial metrics in greater detail and go over our updated 2018 outlook. We will then be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise all listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Anthem's second quarter 2018 earnings call. Today, we reported second quarter 2018 GAAP earnings per share of $3.98 and adjusted earnings per share of $4.25, which are ahead of expectations. Our second quarter results reflect our ongoing commitment to improve execution across our enterprise. Anthem's second quarter operating revenue grew 2.3% over the prior year quarter to $22.7 billion. The increase in operating revenue was driven by growth in our Government business that more than offset the headwinds presented by the planned reduction in our Individual business. Service fee revenue was up, a direct result of our efforts to improve sales of our consumer-centric clinical engagement programs within our self-funded book. Membership declined sequentially by 129,000 lives, attributable to declines in both our Commercial and Medicaid businesses. The Commercial membership results in the second quarter remain inconsistent with our expectations and do not yet reflect the initiatives that are expected to drive improvement. The decrease in Medicaid was due to a reduction in TANF members due to an improving economy and continued redetermination of eligibility efforts by states. Our focus on managing the overall health of our members resulted in another quarter of solid medical cost performance. Anthem's medical cost ratio in the second quarter was 83.4%, better than expectations and down slightly year-to-year when normalized for the health insurer fee. Our SG&A ratio was in line with expectations at 15.1%, leading to a favorable second quarter operating margin of 6.9%. Turning to our outlook, we expect the positive momentum exhibited in the first half of 2018 to carry forward to the balance of the year. Further, we remain focused on accelerating revenue growth, while continuously providing our members with trusted caring solutions. Based on our strong first half financial performance, we are raising our full year 2018 adjusted earnings per share outlook to greater than $15.40, a 28% increase from 2017. In our Commercial business, we continued to build our segment strategy and increased our focus on sales execution. As we have previously noted, the reinstitution of the health insurer fee was a catalyst for our employer partners to shop for flexible plan designs and we did not move quickly enough to pivot to their needs. Our new strategy enables more consistent and effective product deployment, sales training and broker service across our 14 states, while allowing for flexibility and choice in the local market. Leadership and structure is now in place and we are intensely focused on building momentum for growth in 2019 and beyond by increasing our agility and speed to market. An example of this is our recently announced partnership with Samsung and American Well. Through this partnership, consumers with an Anthem affiliated health plan can use the Samsung Health app to access LiveHealth Online, which connects consumers with U.S. based board-certified health care providers for a wide variety of non-emergency medical care 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We expect to see growing momentum in membership retention and growth as we move into 2019. Although the 2019 national account selling season is still underway, we are seeing signs that Anthem's integrated clinical capabilities are resonating. Our pricing strategies in the Commercial segment remain disciplined and our pre-tax segment margin targets are unchanged. Overall, we believe the pricing environment is rational. Turning to our Government business, we recently announced that Felicia Norwood has been appointed President. Felicia has over 25 years of commercial and government health care experience and was most recently serving as the Director of the Illinois' Department of Healthcare and Family Services. In this role, Felicia will be able to apply her valuable insight and experience to drive persistent growth in our Government division. We have significantly scaled our Medicare platform over the last seven months with the acquisition of HealthSun and America's 1st Choice. As we look ahead, we will seek a balance between both membership growth and margin retention. We recently submitted our planned bids for 2019 with this in mind and we continue to believe that mid double-digit organic membership growth remains in reach over the near-term. Approximately 70% of our membership is in plans rated four stars or higher and we have five five-Star plans, the most in our industry. Acquisitions have been a key element of our Medicare Advantage growth strategy. But given our star profile, market share gains and adjacent county expansions present the most capital-efficient means to increase profitability. We are targeting growth in both the dual and non-dual Medicare population. However, we believe Anthem is uniquely positioned to serve the needs of the medically complex dual eligible population because of our industry-leading Medicaid platform and our provider collaboration initiatives like Enhanced Personal Health Care. We expect to increase our county footprint meaningfully in 2019, but in aggregate, the largest source of near-term growth resides in our ability to go deeper and get stronger in the regions where we currently operate. The group Medicare Advantage market is a significant untapped opportunity and we feel that our existing Commercial business and trusted brand give us an unmatched competitive advantage. Combined with improved Star scores and Anthem's innovative community-based programs and integrated clinical arrangements we are poised for growth in the group MA segment. Anthem has historically been uncompetitive in this area, but as we look ahead, we are certain we can increase our market share. As one of the most trusted consumer brands, we are confident that we bring an improved value proposition to the group retiree segment, a value proposition that will only improve with IngenioRx beginning in 2020. Several recent group Medicare wins support our optimism. We expect our group MA business will more than double in the back half of 2018, albeit off a base of 26,000 members at the end of the second quarter. Early indicators suggest this enrollment success can be sustained into next year. In the Medicaid segment, we continue to see a growth pipeline of $80 billion over the next five years, largely by serving the needs of higher acuity and specialty population. Of note, during the second quarter, we were awarded a statewide contract to serve Florida's HIV population. We were also proud to announce that we recently received two Case in Point Platinum Awards, which recognize the most successful and innovative case management program. Our health care solutions, Behavioral Health Homeless Case Management Program and Diabetic Clinic Days Program each won their respective categories. Our partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota is expected to go live in the fourth quarter of 2018 and serve 375,000 Medicaid and dual-eligible members. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2019, we are also encouraged by the opportunity to serve a portion of the 400,000 Virginia Medicaid expansion population. During the second quarter, we completed with the acquisition of Aspire Health, furthering our clinical capabilities through a network of interdisciplinary skilled medical professionals that provide comprehensive care in the home for patients facing a serious illness. Aspire currently serves more than 20 health plans across 25 states. Additionally, we are pleased with the progress in our integration planning ahead of the launch of IngenioRx on January 1, 2020. We feel our gross savings target of $4 billion annually is prudent and expect at least 20% of the saving to flow through to our bottom line. Before passing the call over to John, I would like to offer some high-level thoughts about our future. As I look across the competitive landscape, I'm confident that Anthem is well-positioned to gain market share in our key business segments. I am often asked what has surprised me most since joining Anthem. And my answer is that I'm extremely impressed by the depth and breadth of our clinical and network capabilities, and our ability to drive affordable solutions despite a significant pharmacy disadvantage. This is a testament to the strength of our company and the power of our deep local market engagement. Looking ahead, we're excited about the opportunities to better manage the burden of health care inflation for both our current and potential customers. The rollout of IngenioRx in 2020 is a paramount importance to our objectives. The foundation of our PBM strategy is built on bringing the most clinically effective and financially efficient pharmacy solutions to our members, an approach that is predicated on the overall cost of care and not rebate maximization. To conclude, we're excited about the growth opportunities we see in the balance of 2018 and 2019 as we bridge the gap to 2020, the inflection point for Anthem as we align our best in class medical cost position and consumer responsive solutions with a greatly improved pharmacy offering. With that, I'll pass the call over to John for a more detailed review of our second quarter financial performance and updated 2018 guidance. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you, Gail, and good morning. As Gail stated, we reported strong second quarter financial results with GAAP earnings per share of $3.98 and adjusted earnings per share of $4.25. Operating revenue in the second quarter was $22.7 billion, an increase of 2.3% versus the prior year quarter. The growth in operating revenue is a result of the acquisitions of HealthSun and America's 1st Choice, in addition to premium rate increases to cover the return of the health insurance tax in 2018. The revenue growth in the quarter comes despite our voluntary decision to reduce our individual ACA footprint, which has resulted in a 55% decline in our individual membership since the end of 2017. Enrollment declined by 129,000 members during the quarter, or 0.3%, bringing total enrollment to 39.5 million members. Fully insured membership decreased by 103,000 members sequentially, driven largely by declines in Medicaid and continued attrition in our Individual business. Fully insured declines were partially offset by organic growth in Medicare, which grew by approximately 25,000 lives. Our medical loss ratio was 83.4% for the second quarter, a decrease of 270 basis points from the prior year quarter. The decline was primarily driven by the reinstitution of the health insurance tax in 2018. However, our medical loss ratio further improved as a result of the strong medical cost performance in both our Commercial and Government businesses. This improvement is seen in our strong gross margin results across multiple lines of businesses. Our results in the quarter reflect our commitment to improve the total cost of care through various programs such as our innovative clinical and value-based care arrangements. Based on the success of our care management initiatives and our overall performance to date, we continue to expect our local group insured medical cost trend to be in the range of 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points. As Gail mentioned, our SG&A expense ratio was 15.1% in the second quarter, an increase of 130 basis points relative to the second quarter of 2017. The increase is driven by the return of the health insurance tax in 2018 in addition to increased investment spend to fund future growth, partially offset by the settlement related to the 2015 cyber attack which was recorded in the second quarter of 2017. Looking ahead, we will continue to prioritize investment spending in growth initiatives across the enterprise. Turning to the balance sheet. As has been our practice, we have included a roll forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. We experienced favorable prior year reserve development of approximately $800 million for the first six months of 2018, slightly ahead of our expectations. Our reserves continue to include a provision for average deviation in the mid to high single digit range. And we believe our reserve balances remain consistent and strong as of June 30, 2018. Days in claims payable was 38.7 days in the second quarter, decreasing by 1.6 days sequentially and in line with our high 30s target. The decrease was driven by our focus on improving our claims processing systems, ultimately leading to faster claims payment cycle times, and the impact of the timing of the acquisition of America's 1st Choice on the first quarter days in claims payable metric. Our debt to cap ratio was 40.2% as of June 30, 2018, a decrease of 220 basis points compared to the first quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by the conversion of $1.25 billion of equity units, which were originally issued in 2012 and matured in early May, as well as a modest reduction of our short-term borrowings. Our debt to cap ratio is in line with our targeted range and is at a sustainable level. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $229.75 per share, totaling approximately $400 million. In addition, we distributed $196 million during the quarter for our cash dividend. As of yesterday, our audit committee approved a third quarter dividend of $0.75 per share. Taken together, we ended the second quarter with approximately $2.2 billion in cash and investments at the parent company. Operating cash flow was $542 million in the quarter, up versus $393 million in the prior year quarter. For the first six months of 2018, operating cash flow was approximately $2.8 billion or 1.2 times net income and is in line with our expectations. Looking ahead to our outlook for the remainder of the year, we now expect fully insured enrollment to be in the range of 14.6 million to 14.7 million members by the end of the year. Our revised outlook takes into consideration the greater than projected membership decline in the second quarter and a more modest growth outlook for the remainder of 2018. In the second half of 2018, our membership outlook continues to include growth of approximately 375,000 Medicaid members in Minnesota, organic Medicare Advantage gains and recent wins in the group retiree business. Self-funded membership is expected to be in the range of 25.3 million to 25.4 million members, unchanged from prior guidance. In total, we now expect medical membership to end the year within the range of 39.9 million to 40.1 million lives, down 200,000 at the midpoint, due to the previously noted trends in our fully insured business. As Gail mentioned, heading into 2019, we remain focused on improving our sales execution through the segment strategy and building positive momentum in the Commercial business. Our medical cost ratio and SG&A guidance is unchanged as the first half results track largely in line with our expectations. Below the line, we estimate our diluted share count would be in the range of 263 million to 265 million shares, up from the 260 million to 264 million shares due to the conversion of our equity units in May, which increased our share count by 6 million shares. We narrowed our effective tax rate to a range of 26.5% to 27.5% from the 25.5% to 27.5% previously. Finally, we increased our investment income guidance by $75 million due to higher short-term interest rate yields, partially offsetting the share count and the tax rate adjustments. Taken together and reflecting our strong year-to-date medical cost performance, we now expect full year 2018 adjusted earnings per share to be greater than $15.40. And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions and answers. Operator : And our first question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yeah. Good morning. I wanted to ask a little bit on the cross-selling progress you're having and just overall getting the earnings up in kind of the self-insured block. You'd noted service fee revenues being up. But if you could talk a little bit about kind of the progress you're making thus far, but really your strategies for driving up kind of cross-selling and overall earnings per member? Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Good morning, Lance. Thank you for the question. In terms of \u2013 we are pleased with some of the progress that we're making as you saw in terms of our self-funded revenue. A couple of the areas, in particular, we have had a focus around adding some of our clinical programs as well as our specialty, so dental life. Part of what you're not seeing is in the penetration rate because a lot of our specialty products were tied to our individual business, so that overall is down, but we actually have seen a nice progress in sales of those specialty. Again, in terms of strategies, I'm going to ask Pete Haytaian who leads that business to give you a little bit of insight, but it's been an area of focus in a couple of areas. Structure, we've put some very specific structures in place around our segments. We've added additional leadership and talent to that area, and as part of that we're seeing that come through in the first quarter as well as the second and we would expect to see ongoing momentum. But let me ask Pete to give you a little bit more color on that as well. Peter D. Haytaian - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah, thanks for the question. I agree with everything that Gail said. I think we have a tremendous opportunity with respect to improving our specialty penetration rates. As we have said before, relative to the competition, we are not performing as well and there's just tremendous opportunity to improve that. I think what Gail has said is really the most important point and that is our focus on building out the infrastructure for this, so we've hired talent; we're making investment in the specialty organization. We feel very confident that we have the products and the services and the pricing in a place where it makes a lot of sense right now and it's how that then connects with our segment strategy and making sure we're driving sales down into the market. In addition to that, we're very focused on improvements from a broker perspective and providing tools and engagements for the brokers to be able to more effectively upsell. So we think there's a tremendous opportunity to continue to sell clinical programs and our specialty products into our existing book and we are seeing really good progress in that regard. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Next question, please. Operator : Next is from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe, now, having two quarters under our belt, we can start to look at first half versus second half and I'm particularly focused on the MLR outlook. While you're maintaining that, that implies a pick up in the back half versus first half MLR by about 320 basis points at the low end of the range and 400 basis points at the high end of the range. Moving back and looked at last year, you were first half to second half about 290 basis points. I guess, with the decline in the Individual business, which has a seasonal ramp in the back half of the year, we'd probably thought the ramp might be less. Is there \u2013 are we just being conservative, or are there some things to point to why that pick up in MLR in the back half of the year would look that significant? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, A.J., and thank you for the question. As you indicated in your question, you essentially answered the question associated with the seasonality issues and the fact that our Individual business, as everyone knows, we reduced our footprint in the ACA-compliant marketplace by over 55% year-over-year and that clearly is changing the trajectory of MLR on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Anyway, if you just look at the overall mix of our fully insured business, we acquired America's 1st Choice in February, we acquired HealthSun back in December, and those have a slightly different seasonality pattern from what we had a year ago in terms of adding all those Medicare Advantage lives along with all the double-digit organic Medicare advantage growth that we had. So it's all those things combined, but the single biggest factor, as you pointed out, is the Individual marketplace. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Next question, please. Operator : Line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners, please go ahead. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Hey, thanks. Good morning. The questions on the Commercial fully insured turnaround that Gail, you and Peter are leading, and you talked about growth in the fully insured market. I was curious where the market share is likely to come from. Is it that it will come from players like Cigna which have been taking share from fully insured, or is it more from the large nationals like Aetna and United or smaller players? And then also, will the margins, and they've expanded really nicely on your Commercial book and I'm not sure if it's the core underwriting or its mix of business, will the margins stay where they are in your Commercial book overall? Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Ana. There's a number of questions in there and let me start and, again, I'll ask Pete to share a little bit more color. First in terms of growth, as I shared, we have made a number of changes inside of our Commercial organization and we expect those to start taking hold, as I would say, over the next few quarters. Those take a little bit of time to implement. But each of our markets is very different. Our Commercial markets, as you know, we operate in 14 markets and I would tell you that we expect to see improvements because of the improved focus on sales execution, our value story across the board in small and large groups. In terms of which specific competitors, they are all different in each of our markets. So, I'm not going to point to a specific one because we compete differentially, for example, in small group and Individual versus different competitors in each market. We are staying very disciplined to pricing, so let me start with that in terms of your margin question. Overall, our margins, we have had also a focus on buy-ups inside of our fully insured as well as self-funded. Some of the things that I shared with you on the very first question have also helped drive our margins. But overall pricing, we've stay disciplined. I think we've always had a very consistent underwriting function and we continue to have that. But with that, let me ask Pete maybe to share some additional insight into some of the strategies that are going into the marketplace and some of the different product offerings, because that is one of the areas that we focused on and expect to see some improvement. Peter D. Haytaian - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah, Ana, thanks for the question. To be more specific about, I think your first question was on progress and how we're doing against our strategy. So, I put it in the following categories. First, with respect to the segment strategy, I think we're down a really good path and we are very much focused on ensuring that we have the right leadership in each one of the segments, and we completed that over the last 60 days. In addition to that, I call them centers of excellence, very much focused on building the infrastructure for sales execution, having the appropriate reporting and the execution downstream both in the markets, but also coordinated with our centralized organization. We've hired strong leadership in that regard that has been there and done that in other large organizations. We've also made a lot of progress with respect to products and product options. And then with respect to underwriting, building an infrastructure that's more agile, back to the point that Gail made. The point here is that we need to be more agile. We need to be able to offer products, services and connect those with the right networks in a more expeditious and agile way. And so we're seeing really good progress in building that out. I'd also say with respect to the way we're manufacturing products, we call it product modularization, but this is really the concept of how we build products internally, so being able to do that more effectively and efficiently, and then how products are chosen in the marketplace through digital capabilities and allowing brokers and employers to make choices on products and networks more effectively. And then finally, I mentioned it before, but how we're engaging with brokers. We're seeing really good progress on how we're servicing brokers. So we've taken that and really focused on centralizing that to a greater degree for better execution and then the tools and services that they're utilizing out in the marketplace and enabling them to a better degree. So, all that, we're seeing really good progress. I think we'll see momentum in the back half of the year. I think a reasonable proof point when you, sort of, look at all that is what we've done with the group retiree business. I mean, that is a segment where we started this a little bit earlier. And as you've seen, we had some nice sales in July and I think we're going to continue to see momentum in that segment. So hopefully that's representative of what we'll see in the other segments in the near-term. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you. And, Ana, I think you can see from Pete's comments, it's a pretty comprehensive focus on execution around each of the levers and so, obviously, we think we're going to see some nice momentum. Next question, please. Operator : The line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research, please go ahead. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Was hoping you could give us some color on how the company is looking at 2019 from the perspective of its footprint in the exchanges in Medicare Advantage. And then, if I could sneak in one more, John, you increased the tax rate at the midpoint by 50 bps, which is curious given the earnings upside and the core business should be driving a lower tax rate all things being equal, given with deductibility accounting, so hoping you can give us some more color there on what's driving this and whether the tax rate should revert back in 2019 to the original guidance, or is this a new run rate? Thanks. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Thanks, Justin. Let me begin and then I'll turn it over to John. I think a couple questions around footprint. I know you asked about Medicare Advantage and I think you slipped in individual exchanges too, so I'll try to address both. First on the individual exchanges, we are not looking to rescale the business, first and foremost, but we do \u2013 we are very pleased with the participation we've had this year and the results of that. And I think our team has done an excellent job of identifying the markets where it makes sense, where we think that we've got a stable presence and offering. As we go into 2019, while no decisions are final yet, we are assessing that. I think you'll see some county expansions, but I think more focused on the areas that we've been this year, so not a major rescaling, but we are pleased with the performance. And again, it is all about stability and more certainty around that marketplace. But again, this year was solid. In terms of the Medicare Advantage marketplace, as I shared in my opening comments, we have really reconstructed our MA book of business and feel going into 2019 that we have taken a very balanced approach. We think the market is strong. We feel that we can grow deeper in the market that we're in. We do have some geographic expansion. I won't go into the numbers on that, because we think that's competitive. However, we do think we will grow above industry rates. And we do feel that that growth will come from deeper penetration with the strong quality assets that we have in our markets. We feel very good about our positioning and the stability of our benefits and the flexibility that this year's guidance gave us. With that, I'll ask John to comment on your second question. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah, thank you, Gail, and, Justin, good morning. In terms of the tax rate, we did raise the guidance at the midpoint basically by taking up the lower end of the range. Our tax rate for the quarter is still within the range that we provided, in the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year, although closer to the higher end. We're certainly very proactive in terms of our approach to tax planning. Our tax rate is still low relative to our peer group. But in terms of where we are, there's multiple factors that go into the rate in terms of where do we make our money? Some municipalities are premium tax, some are income tax. So based on where the money is earned can change the tax rate. We have things, like fine-tuning the HIF, in terms of the adjustments on that, impacts primary differences and impacts the tax rate. So we've refined all these things. We think the tax rate that we have laid out there is very appropriate for 2018. And then in regards to 2019, 2019, the health insurer fee goes away. As we all know, that's a non-deductible fee which increases the effective tax rate significantly. So in 2019, our effective tax rate will be much closer to the statutory tax rate than it is now. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Next question, please. Operator : It's from the line of Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Matt Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yes. Hi. Good morning. I was hoping maybe you could just talk about the group retiree traction that you pointed to, along with the \u2013 if it relates together, the group Medicare Advantage untapped opportunity or lightly tapped opportunity that you're pursuing, and how those two might come together if they do come together? Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Sure. Well, thank you for the question. As I shared a few minutes ago, group Medicare is really a market that we identified early that we had historically under invested in both at Anthem and I think quite frankly across the Blue system. As we have improved our individual MA book of business, particularly improving our Stars performance, our operational performance, putting in a team that really understands that business over the last few years and have begun to gain traction in the individual MA business, we turned our attention to the group MA business. We obviously feel we have a very strong pipeline of commercial customers who want to stay Blue. We think that that brand resonates very well in this community. Plus having four plus Star plan that we're able to put our group retiree segment into. And then we recruited an experienced leadership team to lead that over the last year. So as you think about those elements, the scaled infrastructure, a really strong brand, our ability to use our CareMore assets to support and service that business, our ability \u2013 we found that now we're able to convert some of those memberships. We've seen some of those groups \u2013 rather, we've seen some of that traction already in 2018. And we feel very good about the pipeline and our opportunities that we'll be able to continue that growth into 2019 and beyond. So we're very bullish about group MA. And again, it's because we have known many of these customers throughout their lives. I mean, we've had them for 20, 30 years. And that's a wonderful pipeline that we just have under invested in in the past. So it's an area of focus and talent for us right now, so we would expect to see some significant traction. Next question, please. Operator : It's the line of Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Should we think about the analytics, PBM and other products that you're selling externally to other insurers as off-the-shelf Anthem solutions? Or is it more of a partnership approach to product development? And if it is a partnership, how important is Anthem's flexibility in the conversations that you've had so far? And do you lose anything in synergies or benefits at scale if you're running a portfolio of customized products? Thanks. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Well, good morning, Sarah. I think there is, again, a couple questions embedded. First and foremost, as you know, we're standing up IngenioRx for effective, 1/1/2020. And as part of that, while we are in the market now, so I guess I would say, it's not \u2013 we're not completely converted of our own business yet. But as you think about, we've talked about some of the things that we're selling in the industry to other Blues like our Medicaid partnerships. And we've been able to do that very well by customizing, but still leveraging our scale. And in the PBM business, with IngenioRx, our early conversations I think demonstrate that we can do the same thing, that we are pretty confident in that we're standing up a PBM with very, very strong economics. That we're also standing it up and we don't basically have the old model PBM. We can integrate pharmacy, behavioral, some of the social determinant issues, as well as medical. And as we've looked at some of the things that are out in the marketplace right now, we're pretty confident that we have an ability to meet \u2013 at least meet or beat many of the numbers that have been put out there because again, we see it as part of our continued strategy of whole health management. And to your specific question around scale and customization, given the flexibility of what we've been able to build, we feel pretty confident that we have the right amount of flexibility for the clients that we're talking to and be able to serve their needs. But again, this is a deep integration story as well. And we already have products that do some of that for Anthem itself, and we're looking to be able to scale those to others. Next question, please. Operator : It's the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. I just want to go back to the commercial risk. It looks like you lowered enrollment guidance for fully insured and I know that includes Medicaid and Medicare. But it sounded like there were some gross adds on the Medicaid and obviously MA and group commentary that you had. So hoping maybe you can just flesh out the commercial risk sort of ex-exchange and kind of what's going on there. And then when you talk about sort of the flexibility and the strategy as we think about next year and growth, is that just the commercial market in general, or is that specific to seeing growth in the commercial risk segment that's obviously seeing a little bit of a slowdown? Thanks. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Ralph. In terms of our overall guidance, we did lower it by 200,000 at the risk membership, but that still implies growth of 375,000 to 475,000 in the back half of the year. As John shared with you and I did in my remarks, we know that we're bringing on Minnesota in our Medicaid alliance later this year. We do expect some growth in our group Medicare. We also know that our Individual business will still have some attrition as is typical in that business in the back half of the year. As we think of the overall rest of our Commercial group business, we would expect that to be flat to fairly modest growth. So that's how we're thinking about all of those pieces. In terms of the marketplace itself, maybe, Pete can make \u2013 give you some color and commentary on the marketplace, where we kind of expect to see opportunities. Peter D. Haytaian - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I \u2013 without speaking about particular markets, I think what Gail touched upon before, every market is different. We have different competitors and markets. We believe with the strategy that we're deploying and the higher level of execution and the product options that we're talking about, we can take share. And we're beginning, like I said, to see that momentum and we feel confident that going into 2019 we can do that, Ralph. So I wouldn't talk about a particular geography or product, but feel confident that we're going to see momentum going into 2019. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Next question, please. Operator : It's the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Could you tell us more about the Medicare group lives that you're picking up? You talked about increasing that going into the back half of the year. We can see already in July from the government data that you picked up 36,000 Medicare group lives. So can you tell us are these conversions from your commercial retirees and how many commercial retirees do you have on the books right now? Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Thanks for the question. In terms of where most of those are, many of them are Blue Cross Blue Shield commercial customers. So, yes, that is the majority of them, although we are quoting on some customers that are not currently, some of those we're picking up from some of our competitors as well. So I think it's a bit of a mix. But our opportunity is clearly inside of our own commercial book. Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : The line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. You mentioned that you're looking for, I think you said, mid double-digit organic MA growth and I just wanted to \u2013 in balancing margins versus memberships, so can you just \u2013 can you provide a little more color on that? Where are you I guess in the MA margin cycle versus where your targets are? How long does it take to get to your target margins? And then thinking about that double-digit MA membership growth, how long of an opportunity is that? Is that a couple year opportunity, multi-year opportunity, how do we think about those two things? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. Hi, Kevin. Thank you for the question. In terms of our Medicare Advantage margin profile, we continue to be within our target margin range. And quite honestly, we even have some five Star plans in the marketplace that we're deploying that really is helping and allowing us to market year around. In terms of how long it takes, a lot of it depends on if it's a new member or an existing member from another carrier in terms of the management opportunities, the medical management or various other cost of care type things that we might do to ensure that the quality scores are there. If it's a new member, it certainly is going to take into the second year in order to starting to achieve target margins. But if it's an existing member, we can get there much more quickly. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you. Next question? Operator : The line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks. Good morning. Just a quick question. I know that you do not like to provide specific numbers around ACA-related risk adjusters. But last year, in the middle of the year, you did provide some helpful color on whether you're in a net receivable position or not and you also talked about the claims experience relative to your expectations. So, I guess, I was curious if you're able to provide some of that same color this year. Thanks. Peter D. Haytaian - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. In terms of \u2013 you're correct that we really don't provide some level of specificity of the questions that we get asked. But in terms of the risk adjusters, we've got the information from CMS a few weeks ago as everyone else did. It was exactly line with our expectations. We clearly understand the marketplace and have projected out what we thought the final true-ups would be, and they were very, very much in line. We are a significant risk adjuster receiver with approximately $520 million that we're entitled to now and feel very good that we're going to get that cash with what came out of CMS last night. In terms of the \u2013 and, of course, that's all based on 2017, which is significantly a larger footprint than we have in 2018. In 2018, we still expect to be a risk adjuster receiver, but when your footprint has been reduced by over 55%, obviously the magnitude and dynamics of that goes down significantly. But we're still very comfortable with our approach and think our strategy is playing out extremely well. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : It's the line of Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks, guys. Good morning. We noted, at least versus our estimates, sort of a big beat in the Commercial and Specialty segment revenue and margin rate, but lower enrollment in risk and ASO. So I'm kind of curious to know whether you got better pricing for 2Q renewals or if there are maybe any other factors you'd call out that might drive a dynamic like that. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Well, thank you for the question, Steve. I mean, I'll go back to what I said and we've been a very disciplined pricer, so I don't think anything has changed in our approach. And then secondarily, we've been able to successfully bring through a number of buy-ups. So those two factors have really had an impact on I think our overall PMPM rates inside the market. Next question, please. Operator : Line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Was wondering if you just give us some more color on the enhanced sort of medical cost performance. It sounds like that's not an industry-wide or trend impact. It seems like that's a lot more Anthem company specific driven. So what exactly are you doing? Are there new protocols in place, are you being a little bit more restrictive on pretty often, and all that sort of stuff? And then if you could just give color on the Medicaid reductions? Are there specific states that are going through re-enrollment processes, or are you seeing bigger attrition in certain markets? Thanks. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Good question, Josh. Let me start and then I'll ask Felicia Norwood to comment on Medicaid a little bit. In terms of your question on what are we doing, we have an intense focus across the company on cost of care. And I would point to pretty much everything that you mentioned. First and foremost, we do lead the industry in integrated care arrangements, so we have had a long history of incenting primary care, in particular in our local markets where we do have significant volume to basically help us manage that cost of care effectively. Secondarily, we do use AIM, in particular, to help us on radiology, oncology, all of those management of specialty services and they've done a very nice job helping us mitigate trend. Third, we look \u2013 across our network, we have had an industry leading unit cost perspective, but we're also looking to ensure things like Enhanced Personal Health Care, which I've shared before. We've seen some strong results and that's not just from the programs, we also deploy staff in our local markets to help those practices more effectively manage and integrate. And the last thing that I guess I will point to, actually two things. We have an integrated patient record and it ties to the whole health that I answered the question a little bit about on pharmacy, whereas we've been working on integrating pharmacy, behavioral, dental, vision, with an integrated patient record and I think that has helped. So, the combination of our deep market presence, we're able to deploy individuals into the marketplace and then our provider value-based arrangements are more impactful and that again goes to many of the \u2013 the reason why we don't feel we have to own primary care that we can actually drive this differential cost of care by putting those programs into the market. With that, I'm going to ask Felicia to comment a little bit on the Medicaid enrollment. Felicia F. Norwood - Anthem, Inc.: Thanks, Gail, and good morning, Josh. We are seeing, as Gail mentioned in her opening comments, a decrease in Medicaid enrollment, primarily due to a reduction in our TANF members because of an improving economy, and also the continued redetermination efforts that we're seeing in several states. We are also seeing some just general market share contraction in several markets as well. But as we've mentioned, we certainly expect to end our Medicaid membership ahead at the end of the year as to where we are with respect to Q2. We've mentioned our partnership certainly with respect to Blue Cross of Minnesota adding about 375,000 lives, and as we look ahead, we're certainly very excited about the opportunity and encouraged about the Virginia Medicaid expansion, which will put in play over 400,000 Medicaid expansion lives from 1/1/2019. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : It's the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. I had a question for John. I just wanted to come back to the days claims payable in the quarter. I think the explanation about the ACA footprint and the acquisitions really serve to address the sequential decline in days claims payable. But I'm not sure have much impact on the year-to-year. So I'm just wondering, if you look at the year-to-year decline of 1.8 days, is that \u2013 most of that these operational improvements around claims processing that you'd attribute to that? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. Hi, Gary. Thank you for the question. And some of the same explanations that I provided for the sequential decline are the exact same explanations for the year-over-year. The days in claims payable is an interesting metric. It's sometimes a metric that's impacted just by the math of the calculation, while other times it's impacted by operational or business issues. And clearly, we have both going on in the second quarter here in 2018. So I do want to just spend a moment on the timing of the America's 1st Choice acquisition and just how significant that is to the math of the calculation. So we acquired America's 1st Choice in late February and had, in the first quarter, only just over 30 days of benefit expense. We had had the entire reserves associated with 135,000 Medicare Advantage lives in our quarter end reserves. And then in the second quarter, it's 90 days of benefit expense, with a very consistent reserve level. So that in and of itself is a significant driver. It's also impacting year-over-year as well. And then the operational improvements, things like, we continue to be very focused on systems consolidation. As people know, we're improving our EDI rates, we're improving our auto adjudication rates. We're being more efficient and effective. We believe that there will be additional SG&A saves in the future associated with this. But all that provides faster throughput and then continues to lower the days in claims payable balance. So it's very operational, very strategic quite honestly in doing that. But I guess at the end of everything, what I will say is that our reserves are calculated very consistent and very strong and very conservatively year-over-year. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : It's the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning. It sounds like your interest in external growth in Medicare Advantage is slowing, so after doing those two deals. So I'm just curious, are you seeing any change in the M&A market for Medicare Advantage? Is there anything you're seeing out there? Or is this more of just wanting to kind of assimilate the two recent acquisitions you've made? Thanks. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you for the question. Actually we're quite opportunistic in terms of M&A in this space. And so I think it's more of a focus on where we think the growth can come from most immediately. As things arise, we certainly are interested in those type of opportunities. But we think given what we have right now, our footprint, again, our strong Stars ratings, our strong quality, our strong medical cost management and I think very, very good benefit offerings, that we can grow and get deeper in those markets. So we do believe that there's significant growth opportunities in the states where we already have a presence and then some geographic expansion in counties around there. The other opportunity that we have that we haven't talked quite as much about is the opportunity in the dual-eligible population. So we have an opportunity actually to do well in that. We do sell all year as you heard across our industry-leading Medicaid platform as well as Medicare. So we see growth coming from that arena as well. And then I would like to point to our Aspire acquisition, because I think that's a great example of the capability that helps us support the Medicare Advantage population, a leading capability that we think we can leverage. So as you think about where our interests lie, we're quite opportunistic. And we are looking at capabilities that help support and drive cost of care and quality in those marketplaces. Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : It's the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Hi, good morning. Gail, I'm wondering if the potential extension of the health insurer fee moratorium through 2020 would change any strategies? And if so, how soon could we see the impact of that? How might that change benefit design and product design strategies as early as 2019, if at all? Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Well, certainly having stability and certainty and understanding kind of what the marketplace \u2013 we're doing renewals for 2020 beginning obviously in February of 2019. So the sooner we have a good, clear picture of the cost structure and where the health insurers tax is going to be I think helps in terms of our pricing and passing that tax through. In terms of benefit plan and design, affordability is a dominant issue for employers. It's something that we focus on very much. So obviously, not having to pass the health insurers tax provides for greater stability and greater affordability for employers. And we think that's important overall. Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : It's the line of Zack Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. I just wanted to see if the recent drug pricing blueprint and the activity we've seen from drug manufacturers has changed how you think about implementing IngenioRx at all? And if you think it improves the value proposition of having the integrated solution? Thanks. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you for the question. Well, let me begin first and foremost that we are very focused on reducing net overall drug prices. I think that really is the goal. It's the goal of the industry and it's certainly our goal as we launch IngenioRx. In terms of the value proposition that we've laid out, the $4 billion of gross savings with 20% falling to the bottom line, we are very confident in that, feel it's a prudent number and do not see that changing. But again, we're very supportive of anything as we build this new generation, next-generation PBM of really getting to lowest net cost. And I think that's what's really important. We're not building this based on a rebate model, but we are building it based on a net lowest cost value model. And again, we are very supportive, but we want to ensure that everything that gets implemented really does result in lower cost for consumers. And so that really is our focus with IngenioRx. Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : At this time, we have no other questions. I'll now turn the conference back to company's management for closing comments. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Well, great. Thank you very much, and we're pleased that we were able to get through the questions. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. As we look ahead, Anthem remains focused on improving the quality and value of the health care solutions we bring to our members, while at the same time delivering on the commitments we make to our shareholders. I want to thank all of our Anthem associates for living our values each and every day as we endeavor to deliver on the promises that we make to our stakeholders. Thank you for your interest in Anthem and I look forward to speaking with you at future events.

Welcome to the Anthem Third Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session; instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Chris Rigg - Anthem, Inc.: Good morning, and welcome to Anthem's third quarter 2018 earnings call. This is Chris Rigg, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of our Commercial and Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division. Gail will begin the call by giving an overview of our third quarter financial results, followed by commentary around our focus on execution and our enterprise-wide growth priorities. John will then discuss our key financial metrics in greater detail and go over our updated 2018 outlook. We will then be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Anthem's third quarter 2018 earnings call. Today, we reported third quarter 2018 GAAP earnings per share of $3.62 and adjusted earnings per share of $3.81, reflecting improved execution across our enterprise and growing momentum within our businesses. Anthem's third quarter operating revenue grew 4% over the prior-year quarter to $23 billion. Strong growth in our Government Business more than offset the planned reduction in our Individual business. Administrative fees and other revenue increased more than 15% over the prior-year quarter, reflecting increased sales of our Specialty products, clinical engagement programs, and growth of fee-based membership. Third quarter membership met expectations, and we expect growth to accelerate in the fourth quarter. Our third quarter medical cost performance was strong and reflects the impact of our value-based integrated care arrangement. Anthem's Whole Health Connection, which delivers clinical integration across our medical and Specialty product is closing gaps in care and reducing costs. Over the last year alone, this program has helped identify over 30,000 diabetic through vision exams. Our 2018 adjusted earnings per share outlook is now greater than $15.60, reflecting a 30% increase from 2017. Our revised 2018 guidance is a direct result of the enterprise-wide changes we made to improve execution, including sales force automation, the introduction of new clinical programs, and further scaling of existing assets like CareMore. We believe the investments and cultural changes we've implemented in 2018 provide a solid foundation for growth in 2019 and beyond. We're focused on creating innovative, meaningful, and cost-effective healthcare solutions for consumers. Our collaboration with Walmart, launching in January of 2019, gives our Medicare Advantage member the flexibility to use their over-the-counter plan allowances to purchase medications and health-related items from Walmart's 4,700 stores and online. Today, more than 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store, and our partnership demonstrates our commitment to driving convenient, affordable access to healthcare for our seniors. Our 2019 Medicare Advantage plan design feature competitive medical and pharmacy benefits and include significant enhancements to ancillary benefits designed to address whole person care. Overall, our 2019 Medicare Advantage offering position us well for both mid-double digit growth and stable margins. As we highlighted on the second quarter earnings call, momentum in our group Medicare Advantage business is accelerating, and we now expect total membership to exceed 150,000 in the first quarter of 2019. Our success in winning business is a result of our deep penetration in the commercial market, industry-leading Blue brand, and strong consumer relationships. As the trusted brand for many of the largest commercial accounts, we benefit from a captive new business pipeline and are uniquely-positioned for multiyear growth in the group Medicare segment. We're disappointed with the Star Quality rating scores that were recently announced by CMS, which will impact payments in 2020. As part of our overall Medicare Advantage Star Strategy, we're deploying incremental capital to improve clinical quality, pharmacy and medication management, and the member experience. We believe these steps will lead to an improved Stars outcome for the 2021 payment year. In the Medicaid segment, our partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield (sic) [Blue Cross and Blue Shield] (06:04) in Minnesota is expected to go live in December and will serve approximately 365,000 Medicaid and dual eligible members. In addition, the Virginia Medicaid expansion remains on track to commence in the first quarter of 2019 and we continue to expect to serve our pro rata share of the estimated 400,000 eligible individuals. Looking ahead to 2019 and beyond our CareMore business is an important clinical differentiator as we target growth in more medically-complex patients. CareMore's Medicaid care delivery program integrates medical and behavioral with a focus on whole person care, leading to significantly improved quality and affordability of care. As a result of the CareMore model, we estimate our members in Tennessee, for example, spend at least 10% fewer days in the hospital, reported 20% fewer ER visits, and 25% fewer specialist visits. In our Commercial business, our pricing strategies remain disciplined and, overall, we believe our markets are rational. Our strategic focus is to improve the consumer experience for our members by delivering end-to-end solutions that address the physical, emotional, spiritual, social, and financial dimensions of wellbeing. We've improved sales effectiveness and strengthened how we work with our distribution partners through investments in our front-end broker portal and CRM technology. We've simplified our technology environment and added valuable digital capabilities that make it easier for our broker partners to do business with Anthem. Our new integrated digital platform equips our distribution partners with the necessary tools to seamlessly sell, renew, and monitor their medical and Specialty business with Anthem. We are focused on integrating products and services with solutions that enable ease-of-use and greater engagement. The recent launch of Anthem Act Wise is expected to accelerate growth on our consumer-directed segment. The Act Wise tool simplifies health care by allowing members to manage medical and wellbeing benefits through a single interface. We anticipate greater than 800,000 subscribers and 9,000 employer groups will utilize Act Wise by early 2019. We've also standardized our clinical and value-based programs with predefined combinations of offerings. These packages make it easier for employers to purchase the suite of products most relevant to their employee population. The packages will be priced lower than if purchased separately and will generate a strong return for employers with superior medical cost savings. And all of this will be integrated and available on our digital consumer engagement platform, Anthem Engage. Since its launch in the first quarter of this year, we've doubled the number of members using Anthem Engage. By leveraging Engage, we are able to deliver a fully-integrated suite of products, including Anthem Health Guide, Wellbeing Coach, and other healthcare solutions. LiveHealth Online, our telehealth solution, saves consumers time and drives affordability by redirecting care to the appropriate setting. Our data shows 86% of LiveHealth Online users, chose lower class health care settings, generating an average savings of $200 per health episode. The steps we've taken to improve sales execution and enhance the competitiveness of our product designs and consumer engagement tools are resonating and will drive growth in our Commercial group business in 2019. Our recently launched Digital Lifestyle Management program and Total Health Total You clinical package are distinctive offerings powered by AI and deep analytics that enable real-time referrals to disease and complex case management resources. Our new PBM, IngenioRx, remains on track to launch January 1, 2020. The launch of our PBM remains a key initiative with an experienced, dedicated transition team fully focused on delivering not just the standup of IngenioRx but also a seamless execution for our customers and members. To-date, we've built and tested thousands of our benefit plans and set up our required technology environments. The build out of our customer service center is ongoing and will be up and running by mid-2019. Overall, I am very pleased with our progress to-date. We continue to expect IngenioRx to deliver at least $4 billion of gross pharmacy savings annually once our transition has been completed. The vast majority of these savings will flow through to our customers in the form of more affordable healthcare, and at least 20% of this value will accrue to our shareholders. I will now pass the call over to John for a more detailed review of our third quarter financial performance before concluding our prepared remarks with an initial assessment of 2019. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you, Gail, and good morning. As Gail stated, we reported strong third quarter financial results with adjusted earnings per share increasing 44% year-over-year to $3.81. Adjusted net income was $1 billion in the quarter, up 43% over the prior year. Operating revenue in the third quarter of 2018 was $23 billion, an increase of 4% versus the prior year quarter. The growth in operating revenue reflects strong organic growth in our Medicare and fee-based businesses, as well as the acquisitions of HealthSun and America's 1st Choice, among other factors. The revenue growth in the quarter comes despite our voluntary decision to reduce our individual ACA footprint, which has resulted in a 56% decline in our individual membership since the end of 2017. Medical membership was stable at 39.5 million members, and we have maintained our year-end guidance range of 39.9 million to 40.1 million members. Our medical cost ratio in the third quarter was 84.8%, lower than expected and down 220 basis points from the prior-year quarter and 60 basis points year-to-year when normalized for the health insurer fee. We are reaffirming our 5.5% to 6.5% Local Group medical cost trend with an expectation of being slightly below the midpoint. Further, we have reduced our medical loss ratio guidance range by 20 basis points at the midpoint to 84.2%. Our SG&A ratio was 15.4%, striking a strategic balance between cost discipline and investments we are making in systems modernization, digital, and clinical product capabilities. Our SG&A guidance range for 2018 is unchanged at 15.4%, plus or minus 30 basis points. Our balance sheet remains strong with our debt to cap ratio at 40% at the end of the quarter, in line with our targeted range. During the third quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $259 per share, totaling approximately $397 million. Operating cash flow, which is in line with our expectations, was $607 million in the quarter resulting in operating cash flow of $3.4 billion or 1 times net income for the first nine months of the year. We continue to expect operating cash flow to exceed $4 billion for all of 2018. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 22. 9%. As anticipated, our effective tax rate decreased in the third quarter, and full year 2018 guidance range is unchanged at 26.5% to 27.5%. As a reminder, due to the nondeductible nature of the health insurer fee, higher-than-expected operating gains skews our tax rate lower. Our third quarter results reflect stronger-than-anticipated growth in operating gain and we expect to maintain our momentum for the balance of the year. As a result, we now expect our 2018 adjusted earnings per share to be greater than $15.60. I will now pass the call back over to Gail. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Thanks, John. We're entering 2019 in a position of strength. As an organization, we have made significant improvements over the last year, and we expect to sustain our enterprise-wide momentum in 2019 as a result of recent and ongoing investments. We intend to offer a much more detailed 2019 outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call, but I do want to highlight several factors which will impact our financial performance next year. Our initial view of 2019 contemplates both manageable challenges and growth opportunities. Key headwinds from this distance include ongoing regulatory uncertainty related to the health insurer fee, the expected dilution from new contracts in Medicaid and group Medicare, and ongoing investments to drive and accelerate future revenue growth. Tailwinds include growth in our Medicare Advantage, Commercial, and fee-based businesses, increased accretion from 2018 capital deployment, and the timing benefit of the health insurance fee. Taken together and, in the context of our revised 2018 adjusted earnings per share guidance, the current 2019 consensus is slightly below our core long-term high-single to low double-digit EPS growth target. And with that, operator, we'll open it up to questions. Operator : Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes, good morning. So, first question is going to be on outlook and I'm interested in both 2019 and then as you're thinking about the PBM impacts for 2020. Could you just give a little color as to what sort of the magnitude of any as of headwinds associated with the PBM in 2019; are you pricing in PBM savings in advance of achieving them in 2020? And then as you're thinking of the PBM in 2020 and beyond, should we be thinking about the 2020 being a partial year of benefit and then 2021 being a full year, or will we get all that benefit in 2020? [Technical Difficulty] (18:20-20:09) Operator : Ladies and gentlemen please standby. All right, sir, you're back on. Please go ahead. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Welcome back, and this is Gail Boudreaux, sorry. We had some technical difficulties with our call. Lance let me address your question. I wanted to \u2013 there are a number of components in there and I will first address the 2019 consensus and how we're exiting 2018. And then I'll ask John Gallina to share with you his commentary around the PBM. First, in terms of 2018, overall, we feel very positive about our business and we see a lot of momentum. As we exit 2018, we've increased our guidance by $0.20 to $15.60, and we see growth strengthening based on the initiatives that we put in place across our businesses. For 2019, we will provide much more detailed guidance at our fourth quarter call, and I think it's a bit premature at this stage to go into some of the other details. But, again, looking at the guidance from 2018, we do \u2013 have given you long-term EPS growth guidance of high-single to low double-digit, and we do see that the consensus for 2019 does appear light given that. We certainly aspire always to do more, as I shared on other calls, but overall we feel that the components within our business are strong and we see momentum growing. I'm going to ask John specifically to address your question around the PBM and how that impacts 2019. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you, Gail, and good morning, Lance. I appreciate the question. Related to the PBM, we're under contract with ESI through 12/31/2019. We'll obviously fulfill contractual commitments as we expect ESI to fulfill their contractual commitments. And then we'll convert over in 2020. We've talked about $4 billion of savings related to improved pricing and that more than 20% of that being delivered to shareholders and almost 80% going back into more affordable healthcare premiums to our members and our customers. Related to the 2020 savings, the $4 billion is a run rate number. And so we will convert our membership throughout 2020. 2020 should be viewed as a partial year, the way that you asked the question, and we expect the conversion fully completed and be 100% migrated on the new platform no later than January 1, 2021. So, partial year for 2020. Now the other part of your question was related to our 2019 pricing strategies and what headwinds we might have associated with that or other limitation or integration costs. I'll just say that, as Gail has reaffirmed the consensus outlook out there is a little bit light right now and it certainly includes all aspects of that. We've stated previously that the impact on Anthem's financial statements associated with the migration would be minimal in 2018 and 2019. There was not a significant one-time headwind that we had baked in and continue to believe that. And then in terms of future pricing, very minimally in 2019, but anything that has happened is already fully reflected in Gail's commentary associated with our 2019 expectations. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, just in the Government business you said in the press release there were some rising medical costs in Medicaid. Just curious if there's more color around what's going on there, whether you could talk about that either categorically and also do you view that as kind of more temporary? I just want to get your thoughts around that disclosure in the press release. Thanks. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Well, thank you very much for the question. Overall, we're very pleased \u2013 let me start with where I answered my last question, too. Overall, we're very pleased with the portfolio of our businesses. If you look at our performance year-to-date particularly in our Government business and Medicaid, we feel very good about our business and it's in line with our expectations for the full year. In Medicaid, as is typical with this business, there's always out-of-period adjustments, so I wouldn't read too much into the quarter-over-quarter comparisons for our Government business. On a year-to-date, again, overall Medicare and Medicaid are performing solidly within our target margins. Keep in mind too that we improved our MLR guidance by 20 basis points, which encompasses all of our businesses. So overall, we feel these businesses are performing within expectations and feel good about the full-year outlook and certainly the year-to-date performance. Thank you. Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, everybody. Maybe \u2013 I know, Gail, earlier in the year in some of the calls you've laid out some of the long-term initiatives that you were pursuing and you mentioned some of it a little bit in the prepared remarks, but I'll see if there's any further update on cross-selling opportunities in the self-funded business and what you're seeing there. Any further discussions with new collaborations with Blues? And then I think there was also discussion about investments in things like consumer facing and general data analytics capabilities. So if there's any update on those or the other initiatives you've laid out, love to hear them. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Great. Thank you A. J. Covered a number of things, as I think I've shared on each of these quarterly calls, focus on a couple of key areas. One, improving performance execution across our enterprise and I think that the changes we've made in sort of structure as well as performance and discipline across our culture, we're starting to see some of the early results of that across our businesses, so I feel really positive about that. The second major area of emphasis has been around growth. Coming to Anthem, I felt that we have some very strong assets across all of our businesses, and growth has been a particular focus. And I'm going to start on some of the places that we've invested in, then I'm going to ask Pete Haytaian who leads our Commercial business to share with you some of the more specific details. I'll start first on sort of the investments. We have been investing and you probably saw our recent announcement around digital capabilities, consolidation and migration of our systems which we think will, over the next several years, improve our operating environment. Artificial intelligence capabilities, we're building a team there that allows us to actually work both in the clinical predictive place and we've been embedding those in some of the products that I shared with you earlier that help our clients sooner identify individuals with complex conditions. We think that there's a lot of potential in that space because of the population we serve both in Commercial and the Government business, and that's an area of long-term growth. And again, we've been investing in making sure that our product capabilities are strong. We came into this year a little bit disappointed about the positioning of products. We've spent a lot of time focused on those products in our Commercial business and the cross-sell opportunities inside of our Specialty business. You saw on our uptick in revenue in the quarter that we had some nice pull-through of Specialty penetration as well as clinical bias. And that's an area of focus where we think we've got additional growth opportunity. With that, I'm going to ask Pete to just share some of the initiatives that he's in put place in the Commercial business and some of the impact that that's already having. Peter D. Haytaian - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Gail, and thanks, A.J., for the question. I think I'll just sort of tick through some of the things that I've mentioned over the last couple of quarters and talk to you about progress. But generally speaking I think we're very encouraged by the progress we're making in the Commercial business. First I'll start with talent; really encouraged by the talent that we're attracting into the company both with respect to my team as well as out in the field. Number two, we've talked a lot about our segment strategy structure. So deploying standardization across all 14 states as well as building in best practices, and we continue to see that build out and we continue to see great progress in that regard. I've also talked about Centers of Excellence and making investments in things like sales force effectiveness, centralizing underwriting so we could be a lot smarter and quicker with respect to our decision-making around underwriting, and then product development and making sure that we have the right products in the marketplace and we're being as agile as we can with respect to selling those. I've also talked about our network development \u2013 provider network development strategies and making sure that we have high-performing networks. We're launching across the company strategies like cooperative care in which we're focused on the highest-quality providers at the best costs and we're looking then to match those networks with the most effective products, and we're seeing progress with regard to that. And then as Gail talked about how we package our products, making sure that we have clinical packages and other consumer engagement tools that are really effective in the marketplace. And then finally, as we face the market in terms of how we engage with our distribution, our brokers, I'm really encouraged by the progress we're making. We are now with respect to quotes doing things on a digital basis as well as with respect to enrollment. So we're seeing electronic enrollment occur in the marketplace. And that all is happening in a much more streamlined fashion as we move forward. That is translating, as Gail said, into growth. We're encouraged by what's happening quarter-over-quarter from a membership perspective, we see nice improvement in our local market growth, and we are cautiously optimistic with respect to the momentum that's creating going into 2019 and the first quarter of 2019. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Thanks, Pete. And as you can see, we've got a lot of initiatives underway and we think that they're going to begin to build momentum and certainly are optimistic for 2019 really seeing the impact of that. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Hey, thanks. Good morning. If I could just follow-up on Commercial as far as National Accounts goes and some of the trends we're seeing like direct-to-provider contracting where GM is doing something directly with Henry Ford and the Blue Cross is more a TPA here. You talked about the Castlight platform with member engagement, it's on 800,000 members; Samsung, Amwell, and the like. What exactly can Anthem do here and is doing in partnership with the Blues more broadly to create a Blue platform, BlueCard and beyond, that can satisfy self-insured employers and moving away from health plans at this point? Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Well, thanks for the question. Very comprehensive question, Ana. I will try to hit on each of the \u2013 let me start first with the National Account marketplace which you began your question with. Overall, we feel actually quite positive about the initiatives in place in that marketplace. Pete touched on a couple of those. One, the networks that we're putting in place around more value-based care. As you know, we have a cost advantage across our Blue Cross and Blue Shield system, and we are moving strongly to make sure that we also have integrated value-based arrangements that we can share with our National Accounts. And so, that's an initiative that we've been working on across the system and it's beginning to resonate. Our overall performance for National Accounts, we're coming to the close of the season for 2019, and this year was an interesting year in that it was more about incumbency, but overall we do expect to grow in that marketplace, and we did see a number of accounts waiting for 2020 in terms of some of the larger accounts on their bid process. We will expect, and we do believe that our launch of IngenioRx there is a huge positive for us in that market. But your broader question around the Blue Cross Blue Shield partnerships and opportunity, that has been a priority of mine. We have over 107 million people across the Blue Cross and Blue Shield system that we serve, one in three Americans. One of the strongest brands. And we, I think have an opportunity to work collaboratively across the system to improve the affordability and access to healthcare. The Engage platform for us is somewhat unique in that we have fully integrated that platform into our consumer experience and our digital capabilities, as well as our clinical program. So it's not just a platform; it's a stand-alone. And I think what that offers an opportunity to others who want to join us in partnership is being able to share that kind of deep integration. It's truly an opportunity. We have worked with several Blue partners on our service model and engaging some of our clinical programs through our CareMore subsidiary as well as through some of the other work we do. So we're already doing that. We're doing it in Medicaid for example in our partnership. But back to your question, we do see a lot of opportunity and we're very focused on being a good partner in the system, and we think that the capabilities that we bring are very differentiating because of the local market share depth plus our partnership. And let me maybe ask Pete to give a couple more comments, maybe about how the National Account is playing out and specifically about the direct contracting. Peter D. Haytaian - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah, no, I would agree with everything that Gail said. We're very encouraged by what's happening. I mean, it's nice to see that year-over-year we will see growth. In a year of incumbency, we will see growth in the National business from 2018 to 2019. And just to extenuate a point that Gail made around collaboration and cooperation with the Blues; I am really encouraged by the conversations that are going on with the Blues on a national basis with respect to construction and high-performing networks. We are locking arms and making sure that we're building networks on a unified basis so that consumers can have a real, consistent experience across the board. And then in terms of our capabilities, like Gail said, our theme is really around integration and the consumer experience and making sure that there's an ease-of-use with our customers. So we're really encouraged by that. We're making a lot of investment in that regard. A lot of our peers and competitors are working in a fragmented environment. And so, bringing all these tools and capabilities together in an integrated way, I think, is a meaningful difference. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Just have a couple follow-ups here. First, there's been a lot of focus on your Medicaid comments in the press release on higher medical costs and you mentioned out-of-period adjustments, Gail, earlier in the call. So, can you give us more detail here on what occurred in the quarter? And then on guidance, appreciate the commentary, but in terms of how we should think about 2019, is it reasonable to think about 2019 as a combination of the high single-digit to low double-digit growth coupled with, I think you talked about $0.60 of HIF timing benefit previously. Is that kind of a reasonable framework? Thanks. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Thanks, Justin. First of all, in terms Medicaid, I guess, again, what I would say as you think about that, it's pretty typically in the Medicaid business to have out-of-period adjustments. So, as you look at our full year, it's really more about the timing and we expect that timing to normalize. We've got very strong nine months performance, and we expect to see continued ongoing strong performance for the full year. So, overall, that was really what I meant in comments around Medicaid. I'm going to ask John to comment a little bit more, I think, about your 2019 earnings per share guidance, but again, we're not getting into detailed guidance at this stage and I'll go back to my prepared comments, but may be John can add some commentary. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Sure. Thanks. Good morning, Justin, and thanks for the question. In terms of 2019, first, I'll address the HIF fee headwind that were in this year. It's about $0.40 this year associated with our current operations, and the other $0.20 is a bit more fungible. So, I would say that the way that you're approaching it from a modeling perspective, I think the $0.40 is a very fair and appropriate adjustment to make as a starting point. And then, yeah, we are very much looking at a high-single to low double-digit growth rate associated with that starting point. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. In Medicaid, wondered if you could talk about the adequacy of the rate increase in August in Iowa; does that kind of get your plan there in Medicaid Iowa to a more normal margin? And then in Texas, if you could talk about your confidence or comfort with your positioning relative to re-procurement in Texas? Thanks. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Well, in terms of sort of specific states, we really don't comment on overall specific state situations, and so I won't go into any state-specific situations. Overall though, again, as we think of our guidance in 2018, we feel that our Medicaid position is actually \u2013 we have a very strong Medicaid platform and it's performing within our target margin. So, overall, we feel comfortable about our portfolio. We have over 22 states, so we think about our business as a complete portfolio. In terms of procurements, maybe I'll ask Felicia Norwood, who leads our Government business, maybe just to comment a little bit about pipeline and what's happening in our various opportunities. Felicia F. Norwood - Anthem, Inc.: Good morning and thank you. Certainly with respect to Texas, as you know, the state cancelled and we issued the Texas procurement. We are an incumbent today and we certainly would expect to bid on that procurement as we move forward that's due this month. When we take a look at the overall Medicaid pipeline, it remains very robust. We have had a very strong success rate in terms of winning procurements, and we are confident of our ability to continue to maintain that trajectory as we go forward. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yes. Thank you. You touched on the health insurer fee as a key uncertainty, I supposed, looking beyond 2019. If you don't mind sharing with us, what are the key milestones that you're looking to in terms of activity, when you think that might happen in Congress in terms of a further suspension or perhaps permanent elimination of the fee? Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Matt. I'm not quite sure how to respond only in the sense that I really don't have a great crystal ball as to the timing of when those types of things are happening. Obviously, we feel very strongly that affordability in the marketplace and stability is really important. We appreciate the suspension for 2019 and feel that certainly it's good for employers and for the marketplace, and it's something that we are strongly advocating that becomes a permanent reduction in the health insurer fee, that that goes away. So I don't have any great insight into timing. It's something that we're constantly sort of sharing our views on and working on the Hill, et cetera, and with the administration on. So other than that, not a whole lot of specifics there to provide. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Still struggling, I guess, to understand why you called out Medicaid, and I guess just looking in context of the Government segment operating gain this quarter, 60% or 70% growth sort of through the first half of the year and then a 3% growth number this year. So it looks like a relatively big change or at least a decent number in there. So maybe you could just help us what exactly was this out-of-period? Why should we understand that not to be a go-forward issue? If you could just contain to a specific state or a specific program, et cetera, I think that'd be helpful. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, Josh. This is John. Thank you for the question and I appreciate the opportunity to try to clarify whatever misunderstanding is out there. The way that the Medicaid business just operates in general is there are always out-of-period adjustments, and there are always timing issues that can skew quarter-over-quarter results. Quite honestly, sometimes it can be misleading to look at just a quarter-over-quarter result without understanding all the issues, and you really have to look at out-of-period that occurred in the third quarter 2017 as well as out-of-period that occurred in 2018, and unfortunately, we're not going to go through the list of the 22 states and which ones may have had an out-of-period or which ones didn't. But what I would ask you to do is to look at the year-to-date performance as well as our annual expectations and know that our Government business in total, as Gail said, is within our targeted operating gain ranges. We believe that both Medicaid and Medicare are operating very well and within our expectations, and we're very, very satisfied with the performance and think we have some nice momentum heading into 2019. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. So just want to confirm I guess one thing and then a follow-up. So when guys look at your results this quarter from your perspective MLR is coming in better and the tax rate looks a little bit lower just because the operating income gain is higher and that just mathematically brings down the tax rate, so just want to confirm that. But then to the extent that cost trend is coming in better, can you give some color on what is coming in a little bit better and by product, is it Commercial, is it Medicare? How should we think about that? John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Sure. On the tax, you're exactly correct that as we perform better in our core operations that our tax rate will be lowered mathematically, given the fact that the health insurer fee is a fixed number in the calculation. In addition, there were a couple of small true-ups associated with the 2017 tax return filing that also benefited. But when you look at the outperformance in the quarter, the outperformance in the quarter was driven both by strong operations as well as by the small true-ups from the third quarter \u2013 I'm sorry from the 2017 tax return we did in the third quarter. So associated with that, we're very bullish, that's one of the reasons we increased our guidance by $0.20 for the year. And then the other part of your question was, we lowered our medical loss ratio by 20 basis points. It's really \u2013 it's the continued strengthen in our clinical programs, continued strong momentum in that area. Our medical cost trend which is based on our Commercial group, we built a bias to slightly below the midpoint. And all those things combined, are giving us the comfort to reduce our medical loss ratio guidance for the rest of the year. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hey. Thanks for taking the questions. Gail, you spent a bit of the time in a question here talking about your consumer-facing platform, and just a follow-up on some of your comments. You talked earlier about with Engage doubling the number of members. Can you talk about sort of penetration into the client base. You mentioned 800,000 members expected by early next year. What do you think is the realistic target part of your market to have that platform facing? And then, as you talk about the investments that you're making in the consumer experience, how far along are you, would you say, in terms of where you want to be ultimately in these regards? Thanks. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Sure. I'll start and then I'll also ask Pete to give a little bit more color. In terms of our capabilities, I think we're pretty far along. We have been investing in those capabilities the last years. We accelerated those investments this year. And when you think about Anthem Engage, that's just one component of a complete digital platform and an AI platform that we're building. We launched Anthem Engage in January; have seen some very strong uptick, mostly in our large self-insured customers and we doubled it which was our goal. So I think that there's a significant penetration opportunity there, but that's just, again, one piece. LiveHealth Online is another really interesting offering where we have several \u2013 close to several million members in that opportunity. Again, a fairly recent launch. All of those have very strong Net Promoter Scores. But I also like to look at not just our consumer engagement, but our clinical programs. Our clinical programs are also powered by digital and we're using AI to help us identify patients sooner in the process and we think significantly sooner, almost six months in some instances, to get them into our complex case management programs, as well as to integrate all of their wellbeing aspects. The last piece that I wanted to just touch on is Anthem Whole Health Connection. I shared a little bit about that in my prepared remarks, but that's a pretty interesting combination of not just technology, but also integration where we're really taking our vision, our dental, our pharmacy, our medical, and our disability and our both clinical and our claims information and connecting them with the way we work with our care providers in the community to access and understand gaps in care and coordinate care across the continuum, and we're identifying interrelationships and issues much earlier. And the reason that works for us, again, is because we have the digital capability, but also we have the deep market penetration and market share where we have significant number of patients in a physician's office, in a dentist's office, in our local markets. So overall what I would say is we are making significant investments around digital, AI. We've hired a team that's working on that, that we think will help accelerate that. We did a recent press release, I think you saw some information about that, but we also think we need to work in partnerships. So we've got a number of partners that \u2013 we're also trying things like doc.ai. We announced our relationship with them because we think that it's this interconnectedness across the system that's going to not just advance our capabilities but also leapfrog them. But maybe I'll ask Pete to just share a little bit about how the market \u2013 how this is resonating in the market because I think that was sort of the core of your question and the potential it had. Peter D. Haytaian - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. I think it's a great question, Charles. And I think Gail really covered the gamut. I would think of Engage as our consumer engagement platform and everything we're doing attempting to integrate ultimately into the user experience through Engage. Just to give you some facts; as of October, 1.6 million members today in Engage. We're finding that 30% of our users are viewing gaps in care, 60% of our users are accessing benefits and health management programs. So we're seeing really good engagement. Our NPS score associated with Engage is around a 70, so we feel really good about the use there. But let me give you a specific example of how we're trying to differentiate ourselves from an integration perspective. So you had asked question about consumer-directed health plans and how we're differentiating ourselves, we call that Anthem Applives. (49:44) And so consumer-directed health plans are not new, we know that. We have about 4.5 million customers in that today but what we're doing that's different is we're bringing together disparate services \u2013 so think about all financial services associated with a consumer-directed health plan, your FSA, your HSA, et cetera, specialty products that you may have or medical products \u2013 and we're ultimately integrating all of those into one unified consumer experience and ultimately they'll experience that through our Anthem Engage tools. So when we talked about uptake in Applives (50:22) as we talk about expecting over 800,000 subscribers and ultimately over 9,000 employers taking advantage of our new Anthem Applives (50:33) technology. But that's how we're really differentiating ourselves; creating that integrated environment versus a fragmented experience that folks may have today with a consumer-directed health plan. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you very much. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to be clear on guidance again. I'm seeing consensus EPS growth of 10.7%, so it seems sort of in line with commentary of high single, low double. So maybe just help us on the line item that you're comparing to and what consensus growth is there. And just staying on the guidance, you talked about headwinds and you specifically you called out sort of dilution on Medicare and Medicaid. Hoping you can kind of flesh that out as we think about the ramp of the margin with so much group MA coming off. Thanks. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. Sure, Ralph. Good morning. Thank you for the question. Now in terms of guidance in the high single and the low double digit growth rate that we've previously have expressed I think the real question is off of what starting point. And we raised guidance today from $15.40 to greater than $15.60. And then as a previous question had referred to is how the HIF fee is factoring into that, the fact that we have a HIF fee this year, we have about a $0.40 headwind associated with that in our 2018 results and how to factor that into the 2019 jump-off point. And I think really the math on that is to take our earnings and add the $0.40 headwind back in and then think through our long-term growth rate from that perspective. In terms of the other headwinds/tailwinds, I mean the fact that we have a headwind for growth in group MA and group Medicaid is actually a very good thing, because they both revolve around the word growth. So say we're growing those lines of business which we believe will be very profitable for us over the long-term. We don't specifically size the individual items on a line item by line item basis, but we're very bullish with the membership growth and very bullish with what the long-term aspects of that will provide for the company. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Thanks, John. And also I'll just add that those components have been factored into the outlook that we provided. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tanal from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, guys. Thanks for all the color this morning. I guess, just wanted to follow up on the commentary around the cost trend. So is it also fair to read the change to the Local Group cost trend outlook as suggestive of trend having maybe decelerated more recently? And perhaps maybe you can just give us a flavor for how much of the favorability this year is the initiatives versus sort of the natural patterns you're seeing, and maybe comment on how utilization is trending within that, that'd be great. Thank you. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah, sure. Thanks, Steve. Thank you for the question. Yeah, we are very bullish on our cost trend and as I had stated in the prepared comments that we are going slightly below the midpoint of the trend, and I think that's very meaningful associated with being able to reduce our medical loss ratio guidance for the fourth quarter by 20 basis points. In terms of utilization versus pricing, yeah, we're pretty much consistent with what most others in the industry are is that somewhere between two-thirds and 80% of the increase is price and unit cost and then the rest is utilization. We continue to work very hard on utilization ensuring that we have appropriate care and that the experience that our members have that they're getting the right care in the right place at the right time. We're seeing reductions in inpatient bed days as an example of one of the initiatives that's going very well and helping direct more care to lower cost out-patient settings. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. Let me also add to John's comment and your specific question about is this sort of natural trend or what's occurring. I mean, we have done a lot in our marketplace around value-based care; clinical program; moving, as John said, to appropriate place of service. So there's a lot of activity that goes on each and every year and so to parse that out, but clearly the biggest driver of trend historically and continues to be unit cost pressure in the system. We have seen obviously very positive trends over \u2013 inpatient utilization continues to go down and we continue to stay very focused on specialty pharma. That's an area of intense focus and we're excited about the ability actually going forward in IngenioRx to continue to manage it. So overall I don't think you really parse the pieces but we are doing a lot in our markets around value-based care moving more \u2013 and we have over 60% today under those arrangements moving to much stronger forms of risk share and risk-taking. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Two-part question, one on group MA, you talked about 150,000 enrollments for the first quarter. I think that's up from just a little under 60,000 currently, and my question was, is that being driven by one large contract win or several? And is the catalyst for that the multi-state Blue platform? And then second part of the question is just a cash flow question for John. Cash flow has been weaker. I understand some of the timing issues on CMS payments et cetera and the exit of the exchanges having an impact, but the one line that I'm a little confused by is I think premium receivables has been $700 million bad guy year-to-date on cash flow and just wanted to understand the source of that growth a little bit. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Gary, let me take the first part of your question around group MA and then I'll have John address the cash flow questions that you raised. First, thanks for the question on group MA. As you've heard, we're very bullish about the opportunity of group Medicare Advantage, and it's a business that we've gotten very serious about and brought in a dedicated team and resources. Specifically to your question, though, we have broad-based growth, so we're not looking at any single client driving this into 2018. But what is unique I think about our opportunity is we have a very attractive commercial book that is an inherently captive pipeline of members that are Medicare-eligible both through our \u2013 members that are receiving benefits today through RAP products, existing commercial accounts that are using the MA products from our competitors as well as agents, and we have a very robust pipeline. So, we feel very safe in the numbers that we shared with you this morning and we see a pretty significant pipeline going forward. The Blue Cross Blue Shield partnerships absolutely are an opportunity for us as well going forward. I think the overall system recognizes the value. These are Commercial members that we have had through their lifetime and it's important that we keep them. So I think you hit on another really important part of our strategy and why we're very bullish about group Medicare Advantage going forward. So, with that, I'll ask John to address your cash flow question. John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you and good morning, Gary. On cash flow, there are several different moving pieces as you have identified, I think you called out one of significant factors already and that is with our strategic decision to reduce our footprint in the individual ACA marketplace. We obviously had payments of run out of claims and the reserves that existed on that business at 12/31/2017, and so that would've lowered our cash flow expectations for the year. That was obviously all part of our guidance and we knew that was coming but it does actually reduce the cash flow. Even with that, we have a very strong cash flow expectation of 1 times net income. The piece on the premium receivables is really focused primarily on a lot of Medicaid and Medicaid states paying us one month in arrears and that's driving the receivable balance a little bit higher and, yeah, we think it's still obviously very collectible. They're good receivables; it's just a bit of a slowdown of the cash flow associated with having some states having us a month in arrears versus getting paid on a more timely basis. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: We have time for one for question. So next question, please. Operator : Okay. Your final question comes from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you very much for squeezing me in here at the end. My question \u2013 you covered rest of this year and 2019 pretty well, but I'd like to talk about 2020 and a couple of big changes there. First, the PBM, have you decided whether you're going to migrate the Medicare business or the Commercial business first because that matters in terms of when you get the cost savings? And then President Trump's HRA changes, how do you feel that's going to impact your Commercial business? Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Peter. First, as I shared on the call \u2013 or in my prepared remarks rather, we have a very detailed schedule. We are going through benefit testing, et cetera. We're not going to go into the specifics of which business migrates at which period of time, but I guess suffice it to say that we have kind of worked through a whole number of scenarios and want to make sure that first and foremost it's an absolutely seamless transition. And as you know, we have to go through series of approval processes, et cetera, from states and other things like that. So we're going to work through that. In terms of your second question about the HRA, I'll ask Pete Haytaian to answer that for you. Peter D. Haytaian - Anthem, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Pete. There's obviously a lot of proposals out there over the last couple of weeks. I'd say that we're obviously very focused on affordability and sustainability in the marketplace. And as it relates to the HRAs specifically, I think that you've probably read that there were appropriate safeguards put in place to sort of address that. So while it is addressing the affordability concept, it also had safeguards in there to ensure that employers don't inappropriately take that risk and push it into an individual marketplace. So we feel very good about that. That's generally how we look at these things being supportive of affordability in the marketplace, but also being very keenly focused on sustainability in the marketplace. Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.: Thank you. And thank you for all of your questions and for joining us this morning in Anthem's third quarter conference call. As you can see, we are well-positioned for 2019, and I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead of us. I want to thank each of our associates for their commitment to Anthem and all of those individuals we serve. Thank you for your interest in Anthem, and I look forward to speaking with you at future events. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session; instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company\u2019s management. Chris Rigg : Good morning, and welcome to Anthem\u2019s fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. This is Chris Rigg, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of our Commercial and Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division. Gail will begin the call by giving an overview of our fourth quarter financial results, followed by commentary around our focus on execution and our enterprise-wide growth priorities. John will then discuss our key financial metrics in greater detail and go over our 2019 outlook. We will then be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today\u2019s press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Boudreaux : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Anthem's fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. This morning, we reported strong fourth quarter results and 2019 financial guidance above the expectation we conveyed in October. Our 2018 results and 2019 expectations demonstrate accelerated top line momentum, strong medical cost performance and disciplined expense management. In 2018, we made significant progress reorienting Anthem for growth and improving the overall execution of the enterprise. We understand that we play an important societal role. Our mission improving lives and communities, simplifying health care, and expecting more drives our aspiration. Corporate responsibility is integral to our success as a company. And as such we were proud to be named to the 2018 Dow Jones Sustainability Index for our work to empower community, improve the sustainability of our business, operate with integrity and advance and inclusive workplace. In the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.61 and adjusted earnings per share of $2.44, representing growth of 89% year-over-year. For the full year, GAAP earnings per share was $14.19 and adjusted earnings per share was $15.89, up 32% compared to 2017 and approximately 6% above our initial 2018 expectation. Our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results are evidence that the actions we have taken since late 2017 to improve operational execution are gaining traction. Anthem's fourth quarter operating revenue grew 3.8% over the prior year quarter to $23.3 billion. Revenue in our Government Business increased more than 16% over the fourth quarter 2017 and more than offset the planned reduction in our Individual business. Administrative fees and other revenue increased more than 9% over the prior year quarter reflecting our focus on improving our offerings through cost effective specialty products and clinical engagement programs. Our fourth quarter medical cost performance was strong with balanced results in both our Commercial and Government businesses. Of note, performance in the Government Business normalized in the fourth quarter and tracked slightly better than we expected. Commercial results remained strong with trends consistent with recent quarters. Year-end membership adjusted for the delayed launch of the Minnesota Medicaid partnership exceeded our expectation. Looking ahead, we intend to accelerate investment and strategically important capability, AI, digital, clinical integration, and provider collaboration, simplifying health care for those we serve and strengthening the impact we have on the health care ecosystem. Last week, Anthem together with several other payers PNC and IBM announced a new collaboration to create a health utility network using block chain technology to improve transparency and interoperability in the health care industry. We view block chain as an enabler for establishing trust. Timely access to medical information has been a stumbling block for creating a seamless consumer experience. With a trusted foundation based on transparency and cryptography, we will provide a faster, safer, and more secure way to exchange medical information to transform the delivery of health care. Anthem Whole Health Connection connects medical, pharmacy, dental, vision, and disability clinical and claims data to improve member's overall health, well-being, and cost of care. This clinically integrated model is producing tangible results. During 2018, 1.2 million specialty gaps in care were communicated and closed. Through Whole Health Connection, we have been able to lower emergency room visits and inpatient hospital stays by 8%, reduced the number of dental opioid prescriptions by 40%, and identified more than 130,000 members with high-risk health conditions through routine eye exams. Our CareMore business has evolved from its Medicare Advantage root to build clinical models that support high-risk commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid patients. CareMore physicians and clinical teams provide continuity of care across contracted hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, CareMore clinical care centers, and home, intensive disease management program that incorporate consideration of social determinants [indiscernible] such as loneliness and transportation focus on prevention and better management of chronic disease. These clinical models and programs translate into lower rates of hospital admission. In Tennessee, for example, the Medicaid CareMore reduced behavioral health-related readmission from 40% in 2016 [ph] to 13% in 2018. Accelerating provider collaboration and improving value and outcomes for our members, our enhanced personal health care programs now includes 166 accountable care organizations and 67,000 providers. In our EPHC Essentials program, we have enrolled nearly 3,000 primary care providers, doubling participation since the end of 2017. The Essentials program designed for providers who have smaller membership populations, broadens the reach of our collaborative effort, and improves the customer experience for our members. Approximately 64% of our total medical spend is tied to payment innovation program, including performance-based contracts and our leading market share makes us the partner of choice for the provider community. By leveraging our technology, clinical engagement and collaborative provider model, together with the strength of the Blue brand, we expect to deliver differentiated medical costs and outcome. Today, we announced we will accelerate the implementation of IngenioRx, our pharmacy benefits provider. The launch now scheduled for the second quarter of 2019 is a key milestone in the realization of our vision and strategy. IngenioRx will improve our ability to integrate pharmacy benefits within our already strong medical and specialty platform, driving greater value for the consumer and increasing transparency. The accelerated implementation comes after significant preparation and testing. Anthem and CVS Health have been working closely to plan every detail of this transition. To date, we have completed more than 15 months to preparation against our transition goal. The results of our operational testing have been very positive, giving us confidence in our readiness to launch. And we believe an acceleration is in the best interest of Anthem's customers and members. We continue to expect IngenioRx to deliver at least $4 billion of gross pharmaceutical savings annually once our transition has been completed in 2020, with at least 20% accruing to our shareholders. Our earnings per share outlook of greater than $18 per share on a GAAP basis and greater than $19 per share on an adjusted basis reflects strong growth across all business lines and the partial year contribution from the accelerated implementation of IngenioRx. On a core basis, before the contribution from the accelerated PBM implementation, we estimate EPS growth at the high end of our upper-single digit to low-double digit, long-term EPS growth range. The core growth expected in 2019 is a testament to the overall strength of the enterprise, given the challenges we have faced with our pharmacy cost structure. Our expectations for 2019 include robust total membership growth of 1.2 million members at the midpoint of our guidance, including solid year-over-year improvement in our Commercial group fully insured segment. Our group Medicare business will achieve our January membership target of 150,000 members. Our individual Medicare Advantage business is on track to achieve our mid-double-digit growth target. In total, we estimate our Medicare Advantage growth will exceed 20% by the end of 2019. Medicaid membership is expected to grow in the upper-single-digit range including the launch of the Minnesota partnership and organic growth in existing states. Our 2019 outlook does not assume potential new business wins. As expected, the Minnesota Medicaid partnership went live on January 1. We also anticipate mid-single-digit Commercial fully insured membership growth, a substantial improvement relative to our performance in 2018. The improved sales execution reflects our investments and new products such as Act Wise are fully integrated consumer driven health plan and spending account solution. Currently, more than 800,000 subscribers and 9,000 employer groups utilize Act Wise. Anthem Health Guide, our concierge service model that integrates Anthem's telephone and digital channel, clinical program and predictive modeling is accelerating our commercial growth. In 2018 Anthem Health Guide membership grew by 1.1 million members and we successfully implemented this support model for another 90,000 clients, representing 900,000 members in the small group marketplace on January 1. With over 6.3 million members today Anthem Health Guide is enhancing the member experience by providing a seamless transition between member service and the Anthem Care team. Overall, we improved enterprise execution during 2018 and we entered 2019 with growing momentum in our key business segments. We remain committed to investing in capabilities and technologies that enhance the consumer experience and reduce the burden of health care inflation. We vary unique responsibility to society and meeting our financial commitments rest firmly in our ability to put the interest of our consumers first. I will now pass the call over to John for more detailed review of our fourth quarter financial performance and 2019 guidance. John Gallina : Thank you, Gail and good morning. As Gail mentioned, our fourth quarter 2018 results came in ahead of expectations, and we entered 2019 position for growth. Fourth quarter 2018 GAAP earnings per share was $1.61 and adjusted earnings per share was $2.44. For the full year 2018 GAAP earnings per share was $14.19 and adjusted earnings per share was $15.89 representing growth of 32% over 2017. The results were above our targeted long-term growth range due to better-than-expected core performance and the impact of tax reform. We are confident we can sustain this momentum in 2019 as we expect core earnings per share growth excluding the impact of IngenioRx to be at the upper end of our long-term EPS growth range. As disclosed in our press release this morning, we made a number of changes to our reporting in an effort to better align our reported membership and financials to the appropriate segments and funding arrangements. In order to remain as transparent as possible, we have included restated membership and financials for the past two years in this morning's press release to facilitate comparisons of our fourth quarter reporting to that of prior periods. Total medical membership ended the year at 39.9 million members reflecting an increase of 37,000 members in the fourth quarter. Compared to year-end 2017, membership declined by 361,000, primarily due to our reduced participation in certain individual ACA-compliant markets. Please note that our individual membership declined by 933,000 members, which means that our other lines of business grew a collective 572,000 members during 2018. Operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018 was $23.3 billion, an increase of $857 million or 3.8% over the fourth quarter 2017. The growth in operating revenue was driven by increases in premiums across our business to cover overall cost trends and the return of the health insurer fee in 2018. Our acquisitions with HealthSun and America\u2019s 1st Choice and strong organic growth in our Medicare and fee-based businesses. The revenue growth comes despite a 59% reduction in our individual membership. Our medical loss ratio for the fourth quarter was 86.8%, a decrease of 180 basis points from the prior year quarter, which as expected was driven primarily by the return of the health insurer fee in 2018. However, when normalizing for the impact of the health insurer fee, our medical loss ratio has improved from the prior year, highlighting our commitment to improving medical cost performance. The fourth quarter 2018 SG&A ratio is 15.5%, 40 basis points higher than the fourth quarter 2017, driven by the return of the health insurer fee in 2018, as this increases our costs. Had it not been for the impact of the health insurer fee, our SG&A ratio would have been improved in the prior year quarter reflecting our continued focus on administrative efficiency. Operating cash flow for the full year 2018 was $3.8 billion and was slightly greater than net income, but was slightly below expectations. Our fourth quarter and 2018 cash flow was negatively impacted by the timing of the payments from several state Medicaid programs, where our premium payments are now a month in arrears. Normalizing further delays, we are pleased with our 2018 cash flow performance, which included a headwind of approximately $500 million related to the claims payments on the runoff of the individual businesses we exited. Our days in claims payable was 36.2 days in the fourth quarter of 2018, a decrease of 2.5 days from the 38.7 days we recorded in the third quarter and a decrease of 3.2 days as compared to the prior year quarter. This decrease was expected and was driven by a purposeful decision to reduce claims inventory ahead of a significant January 1 systems migration by improvements in claims, auto adjudication rates and membership mix. We continued to focus on improving our claims process and systems, ultimately leading to faster claims payment cycle times. As a result, we believe our days and claims payable will continue to trend in the mid to high 30s. Now to our 2019 guidance. Before I begin, it's important to note that our 2019 outlook includes the partial year impact of the accelerated implementation of IngenioRx, which we announced today. We expect to migrate members beginning in the second quarter with migrations back-loaded into the second half of 2019 and into the first quarter of 2020. The accelerated launch positions us to transition all of our membership by the first quarter of 2020, a full year ahead of our prior schedule. The accelerated launch will produce incremental operating gain in 2019. The net benefit we expect in 2019 reflects the impact of pass-through pricing, medical loss ratio rebates and competitively appropriate pricing actions. As we have noted in the past, the net benefit to Anthem is derived on a market-by-market, product-by-product basis creating a non-linear relationship between transitioning membership and profit retention. We are pleased to have upside in 2019, but even more excited to achieve virtually a full year run rate savings beginning in 2020. In 2020, we continue to estimate the gross savings of at least $4 billion, with greater than 20% falling through the operating gain. For the full year 2019, we expect operating revenues to grow to approximately $100 billion or 9.5%, reflecting overall membership growth and mixed shift, premier rate increases to cover overall medical cost trends and the launch of IngenioRx. These will partially be offset by the impact of the health insurer fee moratorium in 2019. As Gail mentioned, in total, we are expecting membership growth of 1 million to 1.4 million members, which includes growth across all of our key business segments. In the Commercial business, we project our fully insured enrollment will grow by approximately 150,000 to 300,000 members. Most of this growth is in our fully insured group business, where we are improving our sales force effectiveness, while remaining disciplined on our pricing. We are continuing to participate strategically in the individual ACA marketplace. In our Medicaid business, we expect to add approximately 450,000 to 550,000 lives, reflecting the members we added for our newly launched Minnesota partnership as well as organic growth in our existing markets. During the year, we also expect to be active participants in various RFPs. Within our Medicare business, we're projecting growth of approximately 250,000 to 350,000 members including Medicare Advantage growth in the 200,000 to 250,000 range in both individual and group product offerings. We were pleased with our performance during the annual enrollment period. And consistent with 2018, we expect robust individual enrollment growth over the balance of 2018. Turning to the financial metrics. The one year suspension of the health insurer fee in 2019 impacts all of our major financial metrics such that comparison to 2018 on a reported basis will be distorted. We expect our 2019 consolidated medical loss ratio to be 86.2% at the midpoint, an increase of 200 basis points versus 2018, largely driven by the health insurer fee moratorium normalizing for the impact of the health insurer fee our 2019 MLR guidance is roughly flat compared to 2018 reflecting improved performance in our Medicaid business offset by margin normalization in our Individual business and strong growth in Medicare Advantage. The company expects Local Group medical cost trend will be in the range of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points in 2019. We expect our SG&A ratio in 2019 to be 13.5% at the midpoint, a decrease of 180 basis points as compared to 2018 largely due to the impact of the one year health insurer fee moratorium. Normalizing for the impact of the health insurer fee, we estimate the SG&A ratio will decline slightly due to our strong revenue growth aided in part by our launch of IngenioRx. We do expect to continue investing in our business at a similar level to 2018 as we build out our digital, clinical and consumer-facing capabilities. Below the line, we expect investment income of approximately $1 billion in interest expense of approximately $800 million. We also expect our tax rate to be in the range of 19.5% to 21.5% for the year, reflecting both our continued focus on strategic tax planning as well as the impact of the one year suspension of the non-deductible health insurer fee. Operating cash flow is expected to be greater than $5.2 billion in 2019. Our 2019 outlook assumes balanced capital deployment, as we seek to optimize return of capital with the investments necessary to drive long-term growth and margin improvement. Our 2019 guidance includes baseline share purchases of $1 billion, leading to an average fully diluted share count for the year in the range of 261 million to 263 million shares. Taken together, we see 2019 GAAP earnings per share of greater than $18 per share and adjusted earnings of a greater than $19 per share. We do not give quarterly guidance, but the launch of IngenioRx will impact our normal seasonal earnings patterns. Given the launch, we would expect slightly over half of our adjusted earnings in the first half of 2019. We intend to provide a more detailed up-to-date on the impact of IngenioRx and our longer-term growth projection at our March 7 Investor Conference. Operator, we'll now open it up to questions. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. I guess, I'll ask about the Ingenio transition. Do you have good visibility on how you're going to bring customers over? Do they have any say as to when they will be converted? And what will the impact of this be to them, will they feel this or is it designed to be transparent to them? And do they get any benefit from making the transition right away, even if they aren\u2019t currently under contract? Gail Boudreaux : Great. Good morning, A.J. and thank you for the question. First is, as you saw in our announcement in our prepared comments, we're excited to begin moving forward with our transition of the IngenioRx. I think one of the important things that we wanted to share is while we've been in intense preparation with CVS Health over the last 15 months, we really had two years to work through this transition since the original announcement and that's pretty standard. We're feeling very confident about our testing and the significant work. And as we've shared before, the team that we have is very expert [ph] in doing that. Specifically to your question about transition schedule, we will begin the migration in the second quarter of 2019. Clearly, we will be working with our customers on the appropriate schedule and have mapped out some of that schedule. But I think it's important to note that we are going to be working with our customers. And our customers will see value upon conversion to the new platform. So we think that there's a significant opportunity to drive meaningful value for them in terms of affordability as well as the member and consumer experience. That's an area that we've invested in heavily. And we also believe that that's an area that they will see some immediate impact in terms of the integration, not just of our pharmacy, but of our full health approach with our clinical and case managers as well as our pharmacies. So overall, we have a very. I think thoughtful transition filling in. We feel very confident about it. Our team has been in intense testing on that plan, but we also recognized that this is something that we will be actively working with our customers on through that process. Thank you very much for the question. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. I want to stay on the PBM, a couple of questions here. First, Gail, you mentioned that you saw the core business ex the PBM at the higher end of your typical kind of target EPS range. So I just assumed low single -- low double-digit is 12%, so the $15.90 at 12% growth gets to me to about $17.80 and the other $1.20 of EPS is about $400 million pre-tax. So just want to confirm that you're getting about half of that $800 million of savings in 2019. And then beyond that, can you just talk about what -- like do you have a timing set out in terms of which businesses shift first, can you share with us -- is it Part D first and then Medicaid, and then Commercial or reversed? And then, just talk about the EPS benefit, but how much of the $4 billion are you getting? And when are you pricing that through. Are you seeing some of the benefit there in Commercial and like does that mean the membership in Commercial is going to be back-end loaded? So, I know a bunch of questions under there, but hoping you can kind of help us with that. Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Well, thanks, Justin. There's a lot of questions there, so I'll try to get through all of them and address it. First and foremost, thank you for the question. And also for recognizing, both the strong momentum that we end 2018, but also the strong momentum that we see on our core business. As I said in my comments, this will be at the high end of our guidance range that we've given historically, and there's a couple of things driving that. One, first and foremost, we see really strong robust membership growth across every one of our businesses. I think we also feel very confident in what we've done in terms of medical cost and strong administrative expense management. As you think about the PBM and the timing of our business, there are number of questions there. And again, I'll go back to sort of the opening comments that I made and that I shared about that, this is a non-linear transition. So as you think about that we will begin in the second quarter. Certainly, there will be a different timing on business just to give you one example Medicare Advantage will not convert until 1, 1 of 2020. So that gives you some perspective on that. We're not going to go into the specific schedule for each and every business at this stage. As I shared my with my earlier comments with A.J., we have a schedule. We are also working with our clients on that schedule, so we want to make sure our first and foremost priority is a smooth transition. We do think there's significant value for customers and we also think that this additional transparency that customers will see as part of this is a strong part of our value proposition. I think I'm going to ask John to answer the remainder of your questions, if we have them all. I think I answered about two of the four. So I'll ask John maybe to comment on the other components. John Gallina : Thank you, Gail, and thank you Justin for the question. Yes, I think in terms of the guidance, we don't provide the specificity of earnings on the line of business basis or exactly how much the contribution from IngenioRx is. But let me walk through the logic that we have in terms of getting to the guidance. It's very similar to the way that you characterize your question. You know what, we did in 2018 at $15.89 and admittedly that included better tax rate than was assumed in 2018 and even slightly stronger investment income. However, that is our starting point, which does signify sustainability of those below the line items as well as a very strong core operating growth. Then as we go into 2019, we do have the tailwind from the moratorium on the health insurer fee, we disclosed 90 days ago that's about $0.40 that certainly is unchanged. And so we've now included that in our starting point as well as additive number to the $15.89. And then with the bias to the high end of the high single to low double-digit long-term growth rate that had previously been announced. And so you work through all that math, and then you take the difference between that and the $19. Well, that is a reasonable estimate of the impact of the partial year for Ingenio. But as Gail said, it\u2019s a non-linear transition. The Medicare Advantage business is all January 1 of 2020 on our current timeline. So it's really difficult to run rate something like that. But we are very bullish on the $4 billion, which is the other part of your question. The way the $4 billion is constructed today might be a little bit different than it was constructed two years ago when we made the announcement. But it's still good. And we still feel -- we will reaffirm the fact that when we go onto the new CVS contract on a run rate basis that there is greater than $4 billion worth of savings that were one more to our customers and we will reaffirm that fact that our expectations are is that greater than 20% gets return to shareholders, which means that nearly 80% goes to our customers in terms of more affordable health care costs. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte from SVP Leerink. Please go ahead. Ana Gupte : Hey, thanks. Good morning. So, again congrats on IngenioRx and following through on that line of questioning. I was asking about the $3.2 billion in savings that you're not following to the bottom line and how's that interplaying with your employer segment turned around? It sounds like this year at least 150 to 300k membership is on sales force effectiveness not on pricing, but you have all of this dry powder on medical cost. So will that start to drive share gains through more affordability in 2020? Are you seeing some of that in maybe the July second half of 2019 selling season? Gail Boudreaux : All right. Thank you for the question, Ana. First, thanks for recognizing. I think we do feel that we have a very robust membership growth guidance in 2019, and again the positive impact of the IngenioRx is embedded in that guidance. That being said, first of all, we are very pleased with the early January results that we are seeing in the sales cycle. And I'll ask Pete to comment a little bit about works that he\u2019s done -- it's been done in our Commercial sector, because we are seeing our Commercial risk business both in large and small group grow in January of 2019. And as John shared, our pricing has reflected ESI contract but also stayed very disciplined in that pricing. So we see this contract certainly adding value to our consumers, but we also see it solidifying and giving us even greater confidence in the 2019 goals that we've laid out as well as I think some momentum going into 2020. Maybe Pete, can comment a little bit about the work that he's done in Commercial, because I think he started to see the momentum at the end of 2018 and clearly in the 2019 guidance. Pete Haytaian : Yeah. Sure. Thanks very much, Gail. Thanks for the question and I appreciate you recognizing our growth in the quarter and the improvements we're making. And I'll be a little bit more specific, I'm personally very pleased with respect to where we are on the journey. As you know, we've talked about that number one infusing much greater talent into the organization and I think we've gotten a lot of that behind us. We certainly are putting great talent at the executive levels as well as on the field. I am very pleased with that. We went through a reorganization as we've talked about in terms of our segment strategy as well as our centers of excellence made great progress there. Our centers of excellence again remember focused on product, on pricing, on organization like stop-loss, on our Group Retiree business. And we really pivoted quite frankly now focusing much more on execution and growth. And very pleased as Gail said, with the progress that we've made in the fourth quarter, you can see from the results and from our remarks we're very focused on growing the groups fully insured business. We saw that play through in the fourth quarter. In fact, we saw growth while modest occur across all our lines of business. And we're seeing that momentum play through into January as a Gail said. With a keen focus on our group fully insured business, we are very pleased with the progress there as well as across of the lines of business. In addition to that remained focus on expanding our margins for example in the ASO business and seeing progress there. So I'm very pleased across the board to see positive momentum. I think, think will play through into 2019 and as Gail noted, certainly with now the addition of IngenioRx it just creates further momentum into the future. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks, Pete. And I think as Pete as said, performance execution and growth are two areas that we have been very focusing on across Anthem and we're starting to see the results of that, feel that we still have opportunity to continue to refine that, but I feel very good about our early start to 2019. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel from Stevens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to drill in a bit to group MA and just get an update from you on how the strategy there is developing, looking out to 2020 and in terms of the sales pipeline that you're building. And then also just, how the initiatives are progressing around, partnering with other Blues around further capitalizing on the group MA opportunity? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Great. Thanks, Scott. I'm going to ask Pete to comment on that. Thank you. Pete Haytaian : Yeah. Thanks for that question. I think you know from our prior comments that we started 2018 quite frankly with at or around 25,000 members. And again, on a journey to improve that, obviously the great work that Felicia and Marc Russo have done in establishing a very small foundation for the Medicare Advantage business was number one. Then, we were focused on talent and building the infrastructure around Group Retiree. And that is played out through the year, where coming into 2019, we talked about starting the year with approximately 150,000 members. So, a nice leap from the 125,000 members that we started at. With respect to your specific question on the pipeline, we're encouraged by what we're seeing. I think we've talked about this in the past, what's really I think differentiating about Anthem quite frankly is our embedded pipeline. And I'll be more specific, we sort of look at it in a few buckets. Bucket number one are those Commercial members and clients that we have today that have a Commercial Medicare relationship with us i.e. a Commercial Medicare warp benefit. Bucket number two are those clients we have a commercial relationship with the Commercial only. They are currently with our competitors on the Group Retiree side, so that obviously lends an opportunity. And then, not directly associated with the Group Retiree opportunity, but our agent opportunity which is sizable. Those three buckets are in the several millions in terms of prospects and that's why we're encouraged by our pipeline. And then, finally with respect to your question on partnerships. Obviously, we've proven ourselves with respect to partnerships in the Medicaid side and that continues to evolve. It is an opportunity on the Medicare side, while we continue to work on that. It evolve, but preliminarily, we actually are working on one relationship in fact. I think we'll build upon that as our Group Retiree business builds. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thank you, Pete. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Lance Wilkes : Yeah. Good morning. Can you talk a little bit about cross-sell progress in the self-insured business? And I was interested in how was looking for your one-one in 2019. And in addition, on the PBM side of this given the earlier migration, is that something where you're going to be focusing on cross-sells of PBM in 2019 or are you going to wait till you migrate and really that's 2020 and beyond sort of opportunity? Gail Boudreaux : Great. Thanks again for the question, Lance. And again, I\u2019ll have Pete respond as part of the Commercial business. Pete Haytaian : Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much. I think it's a great question. Yeah, we are making good progress as it relates to the cross-sell opportunity in expanding our ASO margins. I think a proof point quite frankly is if you look at our quarter-over-quarter earnings, you see our administrative fees and revenue rising. So that\u2019s a good proof point I think about by 9%. And importantly, our local markets and then our specialty organization as it relates to our specialty products are deeply connected. And I continue to see very good progress with respect to the upsell and cross-sell opportunity. So all the metrics that we are looking at are moving in the right direction. In addition to that, as it relates to January 1 and the progress we're making, obviously not going to talk about numbers at this point, but I think you'll see that flow through in our Q1 result in terms of great progress. On the specialty side and growth on the specialty side, specifically, in up-selling, cross-selling. But in addition to that, and again, it's not only limited to specialty products, we really excited about the up-sell opportunity of things like stop-loss. Our clinical packages which were making progress on as well as some of our shared savings and incentive programs. And then, finally, to your point Lance, yes, pharmacy does play an integral role and ultimately us going from the 5 to 1 to 3 to 1. And so in the future that will be a component of our strategy in terms of delivering greater margin in the ASO business. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Pete and Lance. Just to clarify one thing, as you think about our 2019 guidance, our focus on the PBM has really been on the transition and ensuring that that goes smoothly for our customers and driving maximum value. So we did not include a lot of new PBM business in our guidance. So, anything there would be additive as we've announced the new contract we would be putting new business on that. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dave Windley : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So in your guidance you mentioned that the $19 includes or absorbs any transition costs for the IngenioRx transition. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how much of that is. And maybe on the other side, are there are some CVS credits that are subsidizing that? Just curious how much costs you're absorbing there? And then just a clarification on an earlier comment. John talked about disciplined pricing in Commercial group, but I also thought there were some reference to maybe invoking some of the PBM savings into that pricing paradigm for 2019, did I understand that correctly or not? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : John, have your response please. John Gallina : Yes. Sure. No, thanks, Dave. In terms of the \u2013 if I get your questions appropriately here. But in terms of the costs associated with transition and the CVS credits, the contract we have with CVS is confidential and I\u2019m really not at liberty to disclose the contractual provisions there. And associated with our cost or our additional costs, we're incurring associated with the transition. We've netted those out as part of the $19. It's really not a run rate issue because the benefits we get are going to be non-linear associated with when the business is being transitioned. So it's really not anything that's all that meaningful from a year-over-year perspective. It's a one-time cost structure and then the benefits here in 2019 are really one-time, just given the timing of the transition. Associated with the pricing, so just to be clear, every member that migrates to the new contract will see value. And all see value in slightly different ways, but certainly groups that are renewing will be on the new contract and so the pricing that we have associated with the renewals will be reflected based on our better PBM contract. And we do want to be opportunistic associated with new business as well to ensure that we're reflecting the most appropriate price point in terms of our growth trajectory. So hopefully that addresses your questions. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Zack Sopcak from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Zack Sopcak : Hey, thanks for the question. I just want to ask about operating cash flow in 2019 guidance. It looks like you're implying about a 1.1 times net income which is an improvement over this year. Is that being driven by IngenioRx coming in-house? Or is there anything else? And then, as you look forward 2020 would you expect that to continue to trend upward? Thank you. John Gallina : Thanks Zach. I appreciate the question. And actually the opportunity to clarify although \u2013 there is one item in our numbers that are a little messy for 2018, it is the cash flow and some of the related metrics. So you have to actually go back to 12/31/17 when we made the cognizant decision to exit 60% of the individual ACA marketplace and we paid up to $0.5 billion of claims of run out on the business that we walked away from in 2018. So that certainly artificially lowered the metrics associated with cash flow, even with that $0.5 billion of payments that we made our cash flow from operations still 1.0 times our net income, it was just slightly higher than net income. So underlying results were very positive cash flow, then we had a couple of other things occur, we do have some Medicaid states that were now a month in arrears on payments and that \u2013 it certainly impacting our cash flow. And then, even most importantly, in December, to help prepare for a system migration we made a conscious decision to accelerate claims payment in December related to those migrating members. Yeah, the acceleration helped reduce the risk of migration, but also negatively impacted cash flow and reduced our days in claims payable metrics simultaneously. Yeah. So when you take all that together actually $3.8 billion and 1.0 times net income is actually very strong, once you take all the other impact in simultaneously. And we feel very good about the fact that our cash flow of $5.2 billion for 2019 is strong and it's really not driven specifically by Ingenio as much as is just strong core operating growth. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Sarah James : Thank you. You've talked about expanding Commercial product offerings to include more low-cost and narrow network options. Can you talk about the traction you're seeing on these new offerings for 2019? And how we should think about the price point variation from historical PMPM? Gail Boudreaux : Sure. I shared a few of my comments in my opening remarks, but I'll ask Pete to give a \u2013 go into a little bit more detail about the portfolio products that we've added to the market over the last year and the continuing work that we're doing there. Pete? Pete Haytaian : Yeah. No. I think it's a great question. It's one of those areas that the segment \u2013 in the segment strategy and in our centers of excellence around product really focused on. And that's \u2013 that's make sure you have a portfolio of products to meet the affordability needs of all clients and so very much focused on crafting those products from Association health plans, to level funded products, to chamber-based products that we're working on. We began to roll those out in a much more robust way at the end of the year and we are seeing that play through into 2019. We're seeing decent progress with respect to that. And we think we'll continue to see that evolve further. Some of these product offerings, obviously to your point are connected to higher performing networks. As it relates to a price differential, it varies. I'm not going to give you a specific number but it's a big part of the equation, right, providing choice and affordability to our client base. And so I think it's a great question. I think you'll see that continue to progress in 2019 and 2020. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks, Pete. The only thing I'd add to Pete's comments, I think in addition sort of to the product design elements, we are very intentional in how we are managing our strong network relationships. I talked a little bit about our enhanced personal health care, our movement to value-based payment. So I think our preferred relationships with care providers in the market given our market share the Commercial team specifically has been really integrating that with our clinical programs. So I think you're seeing -- you're starting to see some early traction from that and our commitment to really aligning a whole host of affordability choices, because our goal coming into 2019 was to give employers option. And I think that was one of the areas that I shared early in 2018. We felt that we didn't have enough choices for employers to make that decision. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask a question just about cost trends. So you finished the year at 5.9, you're guiding Commercial Local Group pretty stable into 2019 despite what we've heard is a more aggressive approach to provide a rate negotiation, progress on hospital claims and medical management as you talked about Gail and then presumably some pharmacy trend savings from the PBM initiatives. So is there a reason why we shouldn't be optimistic that trend could actually play out better in 2019? Is that a source of potential upside? Do you think you've been conservative with that guidance or have I missed anything as I'm thinking about it? John Gallina : No. Thank you, Gary. Great question. I'll just try to clarify for everyone that we have not yet reflected the benefit of the lower drug pricing costs from our new PBM contract into that trend. So that is a variation from maybe what your commentary would be. Hopefully, we'll see a significant drop in our trend number as we get into 2019 and then again in 2020 as we fully rollout the IngenioRx platform in the better drug pricing. Associated with the other comments that you've made, we always want to be respectful in terms of the trend. We're really trying to be on the conservative, but prudent side of the assessments, ensuring that our pricing is done very thoughtfully. And obviously, we always aspire to do better. We will always aspire to create very -- various cost of care initiatives or other items that can help mitigate trend and help bend the curve. But we feel very good about reaffirming the 6% plus or minus 50 basis points at this time. Gail Boudreaux : Yeah. The only thing I'd add to John's comment is that as you think about it, clearly, we are very much working in integration of care and value-based payment. But I will remind everyone as we think about trend, two-third is unit cost, the third is utilization. And so, moving more of these relationships into value-based care and it really getting sort of accountable care up and running in our markets and integrating our individual primary care practice is a big part of this. So, again, respectful of underlying dynamics of trends and we will not -- because the timing of the PBM migration is towards the back half of the year, again not incorporated yet and that will be coming over the course of the year. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tanal from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Steve Tanal : Good morning guys. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to confirm what I thought I heard just around sort of the approach to the 2019 selling season just in Commercial. So if I heard this right, the new businesses maybe not fully priced at the Ingenio cost structure, but probably the renewals were and that maybe help retention. And then sort of relatedly thinking about the at least 20% of the $4 billion in terms of what drops to the bottom line. How much room is there around that 20% without sort of jeopardizing the value prop of the growth plan that you guys outlined? And then last one on this, John I think you mentioned a slightly different sort of composition to the $4 billion number today. I was hoping maybe for a little bit more color on that. Thank you. John Gallina : Yes. Sure, Steve. Thank you. Why don't I start out with a clarification on the comment then maybe turn it over to Pete to talk more about the other part of your questions. So, in terms of January 1 renewals \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, January 1 business. It doesn't matter if those renewals if those new business, that was done under the existing contract with Express Scripts and the pricing on the existing contract with Express Scripts. What I was talking about was in terms of how new business or renewals would reflect the better pricing, it was after our transition began. Our transition isn\u2019t going to start until later in the second quarter. And so any business that then renews or is new business at that time will then reflect the better pricing that we're getting from the CVS contract. So hopefully that clarifies the distinction of the time frame. And then in terms of the $4 billion, certainly, there's any number of moving parts that can occur over a couple year period of time from a such a high level estimate. But in terms of the tweaks, it was relieved that the pharmacy trend has been a bit lower the last couple years then it was assumed back when the statement was first made. So we've obviously taken that into consideration. We continue to refine our formulary, our decisions on formulary based on total member health and total cost of care, and things that we believe are in the best interest of the member and the patient. And so that has been reflected in our estimates. Our membership mix is different today than it was back in 2016 when we first made the announcement as well. And so we've updated that. But the $4 billion, it's obviously, it\u2019s improved pricing. It's more competitive savings offer higher baseline cost. And as I said we've already taken the expected manufacturing inflation into consideration. So thank you Steve for the question. And Pete, do you have a follow-up comment? Pete Haytaian : No. I thought your answer with respect to renewals and new business was right on point, I have nothing to add to that. John Gallina : Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Great. Next question. Operator : Your final question today comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple quick ones here. Just to clarify, John, the question earlier from Justin. The $15.89 I think you said 12 plus, plus $0.40 for half, and then the difference of that to the $19 would kind of roughly be the Ingenio contribution? Is that sort of the right framework? And then the second piece is just does this change your contract terms with CVS? Because I thought that contract actually kicked in January 1, 2020, so it seemed obvious that that would just get pulled forward. And just help us in terms of is that sort of a lower drug pricing that kicks in and there's not a lot more than it needs to be sort of done? Obviously, you have to transition the client, but just in terms of obviously they're working through their own integration with Aetna. So if you could help there that would be great? Thanks. John Gallina : Yeah. So, well, first of all on the guidance number, yeah the way that you've characterize it is appropriate, I did not use any percentages, you used percentages, I talked about the buyers near the higher end of the range. But other than that, yes, I agree with the way that you've characterized it. And of course, we all inspire to do more. In terms of the CVS transition, I just want to remind people that we do have a dedicated team from CVS, who is 100% focused on a smooth Anthem migration. Anthem has a dedicated team CVS has a dedicated team. So whatever is going on with their acquisition and other things really are not relevant to our transition. So we actually feel very good. We've been working so closely with them and going through all the timelines and all the issues and all the testing. And it's been going extremely well, which is why we're so confident with this accelerated transition that can be pulled-off with the minimal member disruption. Because at the end of the day, as Gail said, our primary focus is to move our members with minimal disruption and make sure everybody get the drugs, that they need when they need them, and then move forward and quite honestly we will have essentially a full year benefit of this contract in 2020, which is a whole year earlier. Of all the things we're talking about him, I think that's one of the most exciting elements of this is that the full year benefit of the CVS contract and IngenioRx rollout started January 1, 2020. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you very much for joining us for this call this morning in \u2013 on Anthem's fourth quarter earnings conference call. As you can see, we are well-positioned for 2019 and beyond. And I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. I want to thank all of our associates for their commitment to Anthem and for everyone we serve. Thank you for your interest in Anthem. And I look forward to speaking with you at future events.

Later, there will be a question-and-answer session; instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I now like to turn the conference over to the company\u2019s management. Chris Rigg : Good morning, and welcome to Anthem\u2019s first quarter 2019 earnings call. This is Chris Rigg, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of our Commercial and Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division. Gail will begin the call by giving an overview of our first quarter financial results, followed by comments on our key business initiatives and enterprise-wide growth priorities. John will then discuss our key financial metrics in greater detail and go over our updated 2019 outlook. We will then be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today\u2019s press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Boudreaux : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Anthem's first quarter earnings call. Today, we reported a strong start to 2019 with first quarter GAAP earnings per share of $5.91 and adjusted earnings per share of $6.03, driven by our strongest risk-based membership growth in nearly a decade. With confidence in growing momentum, we are increasing our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to greater than $19.20 per share. During the first quarter, we grew total medical membership by 905,000 consumers across all business lines, with more than 75% of that growth coming from risk-based membership. At Investor Day, we committed to growing our commercial business in-part by developing a broad suite of new consumer products and making it easier for our customers and brokers to do business with us. We\u2019ve redesigned our business processes, streamlined our service offerings, and enhanced our online employer shopping portal and digital broker tools. During the quarter, our commercial business added nearly 400,000 members. Of note, risk-based group membership increased in the quarter reflecting a substantial improvement over the mid-single digit decline in the first quarter of 2018. Administrative fees and other revenue increased by more than 7% over the prior year quarter. Outpacing fee-based membership growth demonstrating that our sales of our specialty products and clinical wellness solutions are gaining traction in the market. Our Medicare Advantage enrollment grew by nearly 14% in the first quarter, above the market and driven by our unique supplemental benefits. As part of our Medicare offering, we launched a social determinants of health benefits package in which members can expand coverage for benefits such as healthy meals, transportation, adult day care, and in-home personal care. Our focus on caring for the whole person is designed to deliver better care and outcome, reduce cost, and ultimately accelerate growth. We are on track to deliver on our full-year Medicare advantage growth target of greater than 20% and we continue to expect year-end group Medicare Advantage enrollment of nearly 200,000 members. As a result of our strong product and service offerings for dual special needs members, we\u2019ve historically seen approximately 60% of our individual Medicare Advantage growth coming from outside of the annual enrolment period. Currently, over 20% of our individual Medicare Advantage members are enrolled in dual special needs plans. Over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve added nearly 600,000 members in Medicaid, including approximately 330,000 members through the successful launch of our alliance with Blue Cross, Blue Shield, and Minnesota in January. We expect our partnership model will continue to accelerate growth. Over the near-term with Blue Cross, Blue Shield, and North Carolina and through a recently expanded agreement with Blue Cross, Blue Shield, and Louisiana for the dual eligible population. As we look ahead, chronic care and value-based solutions like CareMore and Aspire are clear differentiators as states move medically complex populations into managed care. These offerings not only position us for long-term growth in our own states, but allow us to be the partner of choice for our Blue peers. Beyond the capabilities of CareMore and Aspire, we are also developing unique public private partnerships such as our Blue Triangle Program. The program seeks to improve the quality of life and faster independence for Indiana\u2019s Medicaid members. Launched in 2017, Blue Triangle targets homeless individuals with a variety of unmet physical and mental health needs and provides them with additional health care, housing, and social support. Since inception, the program has reduced inpatient behavioral health cost by 55% and emergency room spending by 32%, while at the same time moving 59% of program participants into permanent housing. We are pleased with the results of our Blue Triangle program and recognize the impact our partnerships can bring to our members and our communities. Medical cost performance in the first quarter was in-line with expectations and reflected our relentless focus on managing the overall cost of care. The relationships we have built with care providers is driven by our unmatched local market presence. We continue to strengthen those relationships through programs like enhanced personal healthcare enabling Anthem to lead the industry and value-based payment penetration. The growth of our value-based care model has been substantial. By the end of 2019, we expect to have 58% of medical spend tied to value-based care, up from 49% in 2017. Further in 2019, we expect 30% of our value-based care will be tied to shared savings programs, up from 24% in 2018. And we are well-positioned to achieve our 2023 target of 50%. All-in, we expect enhanced personal healthcare to generate nearly $600 million of savings for our customers and consumers during 2019. Our efforts in value-based care are supported through our artificial intelligence programs like predictive service, which allow us to determine when members or care providers might call us. And rather than waiting for them to call, we reach out to them proactively via phone, text, or email. AI enables this program by understanding patterns and reasons that trigger cost. Based on these patterns we can link AI to events that happen on a regular basis such as claims adjustments, referrals, and prior authorization requests improving both the care provider and consumer experience, as well as the cost of care. Turning to our pharmacy business, earlier this month, IngenioRx hosted its second annual client conference. Attendance more than doubled this year and was well attended by consultants, brokers, and current and prospective employer and Blue plan clients. In its role is a true thought leader. IngenioRx leaders discussed topics ranging from how we approach pharmacy networks to planning for the specialty pipeline. Interest in IngenioRx is continuing to build as our value proposition becomes increasingly evident to the market. IngenioRx is built to drive the lowest absolute cost for our consumers. In 2020, we will move to providing point of sale rebates and our commercial risk-based business and we are prepared to do the same in our Medicare business. In our fee-based business, our benefit designs provide flexibility as we believe employers should have a say as part of the broader discussion and value-based care and total health, and therefore we\u2019re prepared to support the desired approach regarding their health benefits strategy. Looking ahead, we are in the final stages of preparing for the launch of IngenioRx and we will begin migrating some of our members on May 1. We have 2,500 individuals solely focused on this transition. We've conducted endless testing and are focused on creating a positive experience for our members. We are confident in our ability to execute this transition for our clients and members who will begin to realize the benefits of IngenioRx as they are migrated. We are ready and we are on track to meet our financial commitments. At Investor Day, we noted that this is a new era on Anthem. Our business results share today and our strategic plans moving forward are driven by a strong and intentional focus on our culture. Our vision, mission and values are our foundation. They are clear, purposeful, and bold and they guide our more than 60,000 associates in this time of growth at Anthem. Our focus on culture is enabling our team to expect more of themselves and create real change for those we are fortunate to serve. And now, I will turn the call over to John to discuss the first quarter financial results and our revised 2019 outlook. John Gallina : Thank you, Gail, and good morning. Once again, we reported a strong start to the year with first quarter GAAP earnings per share of $5.91, and adjusted earnings per share of $6.03 growth of more than 11% over the prior year quarter. Our first quarter performance was driven by solid membership growth across all lines of business, medical membership grew by more than 1.2 million lives year-over-year, driven by significant growth in our risk-based businesses. During the quarter, government membership increased by 511,000 members, followed by our commercial business, which added 394,000 members and is reflective of our focus on execution. First quarter operating revenue was up 9% over the prior year quarter to $24.4 billion, absent the impact of the health insurer fee on 2018 revenue, core-operating revenue in the first quarter of 2019 grew in excess of 11% year-over-year, driven by higher enrollment in all lines of business and premium increases to cover overall cost trends. The medical loss ratio was 84.4% in the first quarter, an increase of 290 basis points over the prior year period. The increase was largely driven by the one-year waiver of the health insurer fee and significantly lower out of period revenue in the Medicaid business. Operating margins in both our Medicare and Medicaid businesses are within our long-term target range even with the dilution from our growth in group Medicare and entering a new Medicaid state.  Additionally, in the first quarter of last year, we disclosed several out of period retroactive rate adjustments in our Medicaid business. The non-recurrence of these retro rate adjustments was contemplated in our guidance and is a significant factor in the quarter-over-quarter profitability comparison within our government business division. There are routinely out of period adjustments within the Medicaid portfolio as large and diverse as ours. We expect more normalized year-over-year growth in the government segment over the latter three quarters of the year. The SG&A ratio was 13%, an improvement of 230 basis points relative to the first quarter of 2018. The improvement reflects the absence of the health insurer fee, growth in operating revenue, and expense management. We do expect the SG&A ratio to increase the rest of 2019, due to additional investment spending, including additional cost to support the launch of IngenioRx. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 40% consistent with our targeted range. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $275.23 per share, totaling $294 million. Operating cash flow was $1.6 billion or 1.1 times net income and in line with expectations. While this is a very strong result, the metric declined since we received an extra payment from CMS in the first quarter of 2018. As expected, Days in Claims payable increased by 2.3 days sequentially to 38.5 days. Overall, we were pleased with our first quarter performance and we are increasing our full-year 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance to at least $19.20. Our updated earnings guidance reflects our solid first quarter results and slightly better than previously anticipated revenue growth. Further, we now expect the percentage of full year 2019 earnings in the first half of the year to approach the mid 50% range, slightly higher than we expected when we reported fourth quarter results. And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question is from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody. Congrats on these results. And I guess for us, the question is going to be just around the Medicaid cost trends you had that bought up in the press release that in certain states maybe still little bit elevated and I thought you want to talk about which states, maybe just give a little more color on what you're doing as far as some of the initiatives to improve some of that Medicaid cost trend. John Gallina : Yes, thanks, Steve. This is [Technical Difficulty] some of the conversations she is having with their state partners. In terms of the government business division in total, just to provide clarity even with the elevated cost structure. That business is operating well within targeted margin ranges and we're very comfortable with that. And as you do look at the government business because we don't spike out Medicaid separately in the press release or in our script.  The government business has declined slightly year-over-year with the Group retiree growth that we had is slightly dilutive, which has obviously positioned us very well for the future. And then as you noted, we have a few select states where we\u2019re not performing at target margins. And we're working with the states on the daily basis to ensure the rates that we receive are actuarially sound and accurately reflect the acuity of the membership. Felicia, maybe if you'd like to talk a little bit about medical management initiatives or some of the other conversations, you're having with state partners. Felicia Norwood : Thank you, John and thank you, Steve. As John said, our Medicaid business is a portfolio of businesses. And when you take a look at a portfolio as large and diverse as ours, you will always see performance variability across our state. As you said, we are not going to get into the details, specifically on a state by state basis, but our team works every day, our state partners to make sure that we are securing actuarially sound rates that really represent the acuity of the population in profile that we're serving. We have in place in our business, solid foundational ways of managing members, particularly members that are complex and have high cost trends. The addition of our Aspire and CareMore capabilities give us very strong capabilities around managing members who are medically complex. So, we feel very good about our medical management capabilities and we certainly feel very good about our ability to work collaboratively with our state partners around securing actuarially soundly. Gail Boudreaux : Well, thank you. Thanks for the question, Steve, I'll just sort of wrap up. I think our perspective. We see the government business both Medicare and Medicaid as a very strong growth platform for us and feel good about the overall portfolio. And certainly, the Medicare Group business is an area that we've targeted for significant growth. And as John said, we\u2019re fully expected to see that to be somewhat dilutive in the beginning of a contract. Next question please. Thank you. Operator : Now to the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : Hi, can you hear me. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Gary Taylor : Hi, thanks. I just wanted to check on when we look at the government margin performance, it looks like if we exclude the retroactive adjustments from a year ago that would explain after three quarters of the deterioration align in the government business and I wanted to make sure I was roughly in the ballpark on that. And then related to that when we look at the prior year development in the first quarter of 2018, which was pretty evenly split between commercial and government, I presume when the K comes out without those retroactive adjustments the government PYD would be one of the places where the overall prior year development is lower, just wanted to make sure we're directionally on track with that thinking? John Gallina : Hi, Gary, thanks for the questions. In terms of the year-over-year profitability, I hate to use the same answers over and over again and clearly the out-of-period is an issue as you pointed out. The dilution associated with the Group retiree is an issue. We did just launch a new state in terms of Minnesota. Our partnership with Minnesota Blue Cross and Blue Shield Medicaid that's obviously impacting some of our metrics on a year-over-year basis. So, there's a whole list of things, but yes, directionally, I think you're in the right ballpark. And associated with the prior year development, I guess the only comment that I would make is, without disclosing the specificity of line of business is that 12/31/2017 we had the individual business 1.6 million individual members and had the reserves associated with that.  And so then the roll forward footnote, a year ago had the run out associated with individual in it and we only have about 30% of that number of members today and so the run out in here in the current period is obviously based on a much smaller base and that will be a reconciling item on top of the commentary that you made. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Next to the line of Ana Gupte with SVP Leerink. Please go ahead. Ana Gupte : Thanks, good morning. Yes. So, congrats on the commercial fully insured growth. I was asking about the pricing, I think you said you've been going to market and total cost of care bundled, I wanted to get a sense for how much of a discount that represents relative to others that are either doing this integrated strategy or not and if the share gain coming from other fully insured players or from self-insured stop loss or new growth? Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Thank you for the question Ana. There\u2019s a couple of pieces in there. Let me try to address then and I'll ask Pete to comment on what's been sort of our strategies in the commercial business. First and foremost, thank you for recognizing we feel very good about our commercial growth this quarter and quite frankly our projections for the full-year. We had made a commitment to grow our risk-based business and we did deliver [Technical Difficulty] at the full year numbers. I think more than anything, it's a combination, pricing, it's a competitive market. We have stayed very disciplined in our pricing. So, it's less driven just by pricing than a full portfolio of products. We've also invested in tools, as I mentioned in my opening comments around our brokers and trying to simplify our business processes, and also make sure that all of our 14 commercial states are really operating under a single, what I call, operating sales infrastructure, sales discipline, and sales execution. So overall, yes, we are doing a couple of things around product. We are moving heavily to value-based reimbursements. I think that's also been a positive in terms of the alignment of our clinical programs with our value-based reimbursement network structure and then our products, those have combined. And then maybe I'll ask Pete to comment a little broadly because it's not just our risk base, you saw our revenue grew in the quarter, which is also a very specific strategy about bundling. So, Pete, do you want to add some? Pete Haytaian : Yes, thank Gail and thanks Ana. And yes, I'd say that it's a competitive marketplace, it's not necessarily we only, but it continues to be competitive rational marketplace. We've talked over the last several quarters about our \u2013 about our segment structure about our centers of excellence. We do see all those things playing through and as Gail noted, we're bringing much better products to market and options we're meeting our customers where they are. We're providing greater services to our distributors and engaging with providers in a differentiated way creating choice in the marketplace. So, overall, we're very pleased with respect to our growth. As Gail said, we focused on a couple of major things going our fully insured business. We saw that play through and our group fully insured business, we've had seven consecutive quarters of sequential growth. And number 2, we talked about and Gail referenced this, our margin expansion in our ASO business and that continues to improve, month-over-month and quarter-over-quarter. There are many things that are contained therein. Obviously, we look forward to the onset of IngenioRx and the value that that would create in our ASO margin profile. But importantly as it relates to the other things that we talked about selling specialty products, you see as a very strong proof point, our specialty product growth, growing over 550,000 members sequentially in the quarter as a strong proof point. We're selling more stop loss into our accounts. We continue to bundle our clinical packages effectively and we are on a path to this from 5 to 1 to 3 to 1 [a week]. So, overall, we feel very good about that, I feel very good about the team and the execution. We think the momentum will continue as you know, we'll probably see things lighten up in the second quarter, but the momentum of growth will continue in [the third]. Thanks Ana. Gail Boudreaux : Great, thank you very much for the question. Next question please. Operator : Next to the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks, good morning. Wanted to go to Iowa specifically and if you could maybe just give us a sense of what's embedded in guidance and maybe how the lives are also sort of dived up as initially. I'm assuming you expected maybe to see some share to [2017] initially and now that you noted down, is that still the case or will you essentially keep your existing book and just take on the incremental U&H lives. I'm just trying to get a sense of the churn to that membership base and what's assumed in your guidance? Thank you. John Gallina : Sure. Thanks, Ralph. And in terms of the guidance, I'll provide a little clarity on what's included and then ask Felicia to talk a little bit about the conversations with the state and the fact that a lot of this is still not yet completely finalized. But our guidance is that we have a little bit more than [30 about a percent], about a third of the members within the state right now and our guidance assumes at least for purposes of what we've just provided that we would retain that level of membership. Our guidance also assumes that we will get actuarially justified rates beginning July 1, 2019. And so, I will turn it over to Felicia to talk little bit about the dynamics of what's going on based on that. Felicia Norwood : Yes, good morning and thank you, Ralph. If you can imagine, we're working very closely with our state partner in Iowa right now and those conversations include a range of discussions, including what happens with respect to membership allocation, as well as what happens with respect to rates. Certainly, out of respect for the conversations that are going on right now, it wouldn't be appropriate to comment on the specifics of those conversations. And as John indicated to the extent things change, we will certainly update any guidance. I will say that our goal and our focus is making sure that we have actuarially sound rates that will allow a sustainable program in Iowa and allow us to continue to serve the Medicaid beneficiaries there and improving [Technical Difficulty]. Ralph Giacobbe : Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Alright, thank you very much. Next question. Operator : Next the line of Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Sarah James : Thank you. Can you give us some context for the $14 billion DBG and IngenioRx build out by sizing the addressable market for Anthem? And can you update us on your progress on discussions you're having for selling technology or PBM externally and if there is a difference in the response, you're getting from Blue versus non-Blue? Thanks. John Gallina : Sure. Thank you for the questions and the numbers that you give you just itemized are 2023 targets. So clearly, it will take several years to get to that point. We had disclosed that we expect the combination of both diversified business [Technical Difficulty] to achieve about 8% to 10% of the total revenue of the company on a consolidated basis, which is where the $14 billion came from in 2023 and then \u2013 in about 10% to 11% margins diversified business group being a bit higher than that and IngenioRx being in the single-digit margin range. Quite honestly, we're working very closely with many, many folks. But we don\u2019t expect to see a significant ramp in a lot of these sales process, specifically in IngenioRx until 2021. We are wholly focused on getting the transition completed here in 2019 and delivering the full run-rate value that we promised in 2020 and then have a lot of proof points then associated with the sales activity. And then on the diversified business group, we continue to be opportunistic in terms of building out the portfolio. We've had several very positive conversations with other Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in terms of being able to provide the services. We actually have several Blues who are our customers today. We want to continue and expand those relationships. So, we feel very good about the 2023 expectations that have been provided, but it will take a few years to ramp up to that point. Gail Boudreaux : And, Sarah, just a few additional comments I think to John's very thorough response. I think as John said, our primary focus in 2019 going into 2020 is the successful migration of our existing book of business. But we are seeing some early traction. As I mentioned in my comments, we did have our second client conference and had very strong attendance. Our integrated guarantees where we're focused on 4% health are resonating, plus we are looking to pull through pharmacy, certainly in the partnerships that we're doing with other Blues and that's the case certainly in our new North Carolina been and I think we have an opportunity to continue to do that across the partnerships that we're forming. So, I think it's a fairly broad-based strategy. But again, intense focus on the migration of IngenioRx in 2019 and we're beginning obviously the selling season, you'll see more of that into 2020 and 2021, and DBG as well, but we see it as a real opportunity to package our products in a very integrated way and look at overall total cost of care. Thank you very much. Next question please. Operator : Next from the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks, good morning. I guess a question more sort of just on the Blue strategy, longer term, Gail as you think about Anthem's three to five years from now, what does success look like, what would you be pleased with in terms of products and JVs and other connections to the other Blues? Gail Boudreaux : Thank you for the question Josh. It's a great question and I mean, I think we outlined much of that at our Investor Day in terms of \u2013 each of our Blue partners is unique and each of them has unique set of circumstances, I think a success for us obviously is to consider \u2013 is to continue to be able to package our IngenioRx solutions to continue to do partnerships in Medicaid. We're really pleased with the partnership we just announced expanding our Louisiana venture into the dual eligible market, we think that's another great opportunity. So, we're going to be very opportunistic and we have an opportunity I think through our DBG as, as CareMore is expanding with several of our Blue partners as, as Aspire, aim has been a longstanding partner to the Blues. I think as we mature in this space, we look at an opportunity to really package, a series of our off [Technical Difficulty] versus single one-offs and we are going to risk arrangements as well with them, particularly in our CareMore organization.  So, I think that's the maturity of our business. Once we complete our own conversion of IngenioRx, I think that's another opportunity for us to offer. I think a very strong integrated platform in a very different way, because, again, we're partners not competitors with our fellow Blues plans. Thank you very much for the question. Next one please. Operator : Next the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Yes, thanks for taking the question. John, obviously we raised the guidance here for the full-year 2019, if I recall, at the Analyst Day, you guys had pointed out in our expectations for about 20% EPS growth this year and also for next year, when we think about next year, should we think about 20% on top of the revised guidance or is something going to think of this sort of \u2013 not going to pull forward, but we shouldn't build on top of this revised number and I guess related to that as we think about the SG&A improvement this year, is there anything in there we should think about one-time in nature or is just a good run rate as we think about our model going forward and maybe factoring how Ingenio cost ramp into that as well? Thanks. John Gallina : Thank you, Charles. And in terms of the guidance we're very bullish about how we started the year and we really did raise the guidance because of our strong revenue growth. We grew membership across all lines of business, risk membership at some of the best growth we've seen in quite some within the company, and very, very bullish. Most of the metrics we didn't have to change the guidance on, but very, very strong top line growth. So, I would say, from that perspective. While we are not yet providing 2020 guidance. There is nothing that this guidance raise that does that impacts our long-term growth strategy and the percentages that we laid out at Investor Day at this point in time. And then associated with the SG&A ratio, it is very, very good here in the first quarter. We do expect SG&A ratio to go back up in the latter half of this year as we finalize the accelerated rollout and implementation of IngenioRx and migrate all of our members from now through January 1, 2020 onto the new CVS platform. So, the SG&A ratios and guidance that we provided, we\u2019re going to maintain, because we expect our SG&A ratio to be a little higher the last part of the year than it is here in the first quarter. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : The line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. I thought maybe I'd ask you about capital deployment, obviously in the last 3 or 4 months, there's sort of a shifting landscape of opportunities on the one hand with the Washington backdrop, you know stock has come in, so there is an opportunity perhaps on the buyback side and on the flip side and M&A I know traditionally looked at Medicare Advantage and care management capabilities, but there is also potential opportunities in around Medicaid and in pharmacy benefit. Would \u2013 just seeing whether you'd comment on whether you have any interest in those areas, I know you've got a lot on your plate bringing Ingenio, but would there be capability should be interested in picking up on the PBM side and perhaps? John Gallina : Yes, so thanks A.J. and I think just based on the way you phrase the question, I think our answer, very appropriately as to say that we're going to maintain a balanced approach to capital deployment. At Investor Day, I laid out that we expect to utilize 50% of our free cash flow for either reinvesting in the business or M&A about 30% over the long term on share buyback and 20% for dividends. However, that 50% and 30% could actually shifted at any point in time, based on current market conditions and opportunities that are out there. In terms of M&A opportunities -- absolutely we're very focused on the MA tuck-ins that either provide us a footprint or solidify our footprint in the market that we don't have by enhancing capabilities, specifically associated with our diversified business group and various other things, but we're not taking anything off the table at this point in time, but we do want to be opportunistic, we want to make sure it provides the best long-term shareholder value and we will react to market conditions accordingly. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. A.J. Next question please. Operator : Next line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks, good morning. My question is on your earnings seasonality. First off, appreciate the update John, by my math using 55% of EPS in the first half implies 2Q would be about $4.53, which is up about 6%, 7% year-over-year. So just curious whether you can lay us out some of the puts and takes to consider in Q2 from an earnings perspective and maybe touch on the PBM specifically, if you can in terms of whether any of the PBM earnings power that you've talked about will benefit 2Q or perhaps it's actually a drag in Q2, due to start-up costs? Thanks. John Gallina : Yes. Thank you, Justin. Great question. And as always, I am always very impressed with your modeling capabilities. But in terms of 2Q, there is a lot of things impacting the 2Q seasonality as much as your things impacting the seasonality of the other quarters. So, you specifically called out that IngenioRx, we're going to start the IngenioRx implementation on May 1, but the vast, vast majority of the membership that transition in 2019 is in the second half of the year and just [half way] that does not even include all of our Medicare business, our individual ACA business that\u2019s slated to migrate on January 1, 2020, which still gives us a full-year of 2020 benefit but zero in 2019. So, virtually the entirety of the benefit of IngenioRx that was described at Investor Day, the $0.70 to $0.90 increase in our guidance, is all in the third and fourth quarter. And then here in the first quarter, we had the year-over-year issues associated with the Medicaid out of period from 12 months ago. So, the second quarter is normalized, I think it could be, it's the other quarters that are impacting. The only other thing I will say is that the second quarter could be a slight drag from Ingenio given the investment that we're going to make in terms of ensuring that the transition is done very, very well. But at 55%, yes, your math is certainly very credible. Gail Boudreaux : Next question please. Operator : Next the line of Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Matt Borsch : Yes, I was hoping you could just talk about 2020, in terms of the Medicare Advantage product now that you have the final rates and as you consider the impact of the health insurer fee coming back in the competition, so forth understanding you can't reveal your strategy per se, but can you touch on some of the factors that you're thinking about? Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, Matt, I'll ask Felicia to provide some more commentary, as you know and I think you said in your question, we're still in the bid process now. So, we will from competitive reasons not go into too much detail, but maybe Felicia will give you a little bit of color on how we're thinking about 2020. Felicia Norwood : Yes, thank you for the questions and when we think about 2020. Obviously, we always take a balanced approach as we think about our bid process. This past year, as you know we [Technical Difficulty] we believe that they help to drive growth for us from an overall business perspective and we appreciate the flexibility that CMS has provided in terms of expanding those benefits as we had in 2020. So, when we take a look at where we are, we've obviously been pleased with the growth that we've seen this year and look forward to continuing to accelerate our growth above the industry average as we move into 2020. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Next Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Peter Costa : Thanks. I wanted to ask you about the JVs you are doing with the other Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans and how that\u2019s impacted by the ongoing MDL litigation against the Blue Cross, Blue Shield Association. If you look at the Cigna litigation, it seems like you guys thought that the MDL litigation might actually settle with them a couple of years and that seems to have not happened. So, what's your thought process on that and is that can actually help to get more JVs done or does it hurt you if it gets resolved in some way? Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question. Peter. We won't comment on ongoing litigation. But in terms of the joint ventures. I mean those are really born opportunity for us to take \u2013 just like we would quite frankly other partners in the marketplace that we're doing joint venture [Technical Difficulty] and really as we've shared before these joint ventures are all very unique and they're all very much driven by the market conditions in that state and really strong platform that we have as part of our Medicaid business, and we see that as a really strong opportunity for us to expand that platform. So, I think it's really, it's that part of our strategy has been very clear that we wanted to work more collaboratively with our Blue partners because we do think many of them have not had the depth of expertise in government programs. And we think that's a huge opportunity for growth we've included that in our outlook. And again, each of these partnerships is very unique and very different. But I would also tell you that we have many of these, for example, the main health ACO and our joint venture in Colorado and behavioral health. So, they're a very broad footprint, broader than just, but again, we do see some significant opportunity with Blue partner again leveraging the strengths that we bring to the market and we think we'll have opportunities in pharmacy and across as well. Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Next Zachary Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Zachary Sopcak : Hi, good morning, thanks for the question. In the opening comments, Gail, you talked about point of sale rebates for the commercial risk book for 1/1/2020. I just wanted to clarify is that the entire risk book? And then for the fee-based book. I appreciate your comments on flexibility, going forward if point-of-sale rebates become mandated by the government through legislation, how would you expect the in players to react to that, do you think they will tighten formularies or take other action? Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question. I think first and foremost, what's really important in this discussion around pharmacy rebates and pricing etcetera is getting to the absolute lowest cost in that, as I shared at Investor Day is really what we're building in IngenioRx on. We start in a very unique position, because we're building a farm PBM, new generation PBM and as you might recall our PBM rates were not competitive. And so, our ability to offer extremely competitive rates in the numbers that we've shared with you really stem from that. From the point of service you on the commercial [Technical Difficulty] once we get through our conversion, we build [Technical Difficulty] for our consumers across our book of business and we think that certainly makes sense for the marketplace and again in the self-funded business our view there is to match what our customers want, we're fully prepared to offer point-of-sale rebates, but again we want to be aligned to what customers want. Your specific question about if rebates were to go away \u2013 rebates are affected tool in terms of negotiation. So, I think that's important to remember in this. But again, understanding that we want to be very transparent. On the side of rebates as you think about this, certainly in the government program, HHS has said it will create an alternative discounting arrangement, we need to understand the details of that and work with that. We believe there are other ways to create value through \u2013 for example our integrated guarantee and looking at our whole health strategy, which is gaining some traction in the market and there are also other opportunities around product expansion fees, admin fees etcetera. So, it doesn't all rely on those and again I know a lot of focus is spent on rebates, it's less than 10% of the drugs and all drugs, most of the drugs, I would say almost all of the drugs that are rebatable have competition. So, our view on that is that, we think it's a very prudent strategy and we feel very good about being able to launch a PBM that starts in a very different place than trying to retool an existing model. Thanks for the question. Next please. Operator : Next Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, thanks. Just want to go into the guidance a little bit more, you mentioned I guess revenue coming in a little bit better as one of the drivers, but as you mentioned, didn't really change any of the components behind the guidance. So, just wondering where within those ranges maybe you actually feel at the higher-end more likely at that membership as a specialty flow through MLR, G&A, I guess maybe a little bit more color on where in those ranges you're looking at. John Gallina : Yes, thanks, Kevin. Great question. One of the areas that really wasn't part of the specific guidance and we are just very, very pleased with the results are in the administrative fee revenue for the quarter and which is the greater upselling of value-added services, as well as the specialty membership and both of those have outpaced our core medical membership quite nicely and really helped contribute to the top line and help contribute to the bottom line.  As said, we did raise our earnings per share by $0.20 this quarter without changing the core metrics. So, we\u2019re still within the balance of our guidance range and are comfortable with our revised guidance. Our growth has been in all lines of business, but we did not provide specific guidance on administrative fee revenue and specialty membership and those did exceptionally well. So, thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Next question please. Operator : Now to Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dave Windley : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to come back follow-up on Justin's question as he pointed out, your 2Q implied guidance here would be kind of mid-single-digit year-over-year growth compared to \u2013 if I look at XPBM growth is in the mid-teens. So, it does appear that there's some seasonal cadence differences year-over-year in something MLR, SG&A and I guess I wanted to understand a little bit better what that might be. I presume that it's not just the spending on IngenioRx because my assumption there is that you're spending a lot of money in the first quarter as well. But maybe, correct me where I'm wrong. John Gallina : You know, Dave, we obviously are spending a lot of money in the first quarter, as well as second quarter with very minimal benefit from IngenioRx in the second quarter, offsetting a bit of it with IngenioRx benefits really being back loaded to the second half of the year, but we have a lot of things going on like, for instance, the dilution of our Group retiree business. I mean that obviously extends throughout the entirety of the majority of 2019. It's going to take us a good year to get the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, so that in 2020 we\u2019re going to be more profitable and then even later in 2022, we have target margins on that. All those things are going into the consideration in terms of the year-over-year comparability. So, it's actually, it's a lot of positive things that are having a short-term negative impact associated with the quarter-over-quarter reviews. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Next the line of Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Steve Tanal : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on the benefits ratio, and just get some more color there if we can. So, I guess up to 90 basis points year-on-year, if I think was guided to about 200 bips for the year and then the retroactive revenue adjustments in Medicaid, it's $0.20 last year. I think that's about 35 bips. So, there's sort of a balance of uptick about 55 basis points and clearly if PYD was down year-on-year, but I think you noted in the release that development was better than you expected. So any comments on kind of the quarter itself, as well as maybe just following up on sort of the seasonality discussion kind of pursuant to this point, is it sort of fair to say that maybe some of the value of the forthcoming PBM savings are sort of shared with some of the customers upfront or any sort of thought process on that. Just thinking about the seasonality of MLR Q1 versus the full year obviously a much tighter range should now this year than in years past? That's it, thanks. John Gallina : Sure. Thanks, Steve. And I'll just say, just to take it off the table, the IngenioRx and whatever structure savings benefits that does not impact the first quarter of 2019 in the MLR at all, but I will say, first, I'd like to reaffirm our medical loss ratio guidance of 86.2% plus or minus 30 basis points. As I said, we've held that constant, as you mentioned, is obviously a big driver, basically 2% of the change. And yeah, but we also have the Group Retiree business, which is again it's dilutive, which means that it's increasing the MLR on a temporary basis. The mix of business we have now versus a year ago is a little bit more skewed to the higher MLR business, especially with the significant growth we've had in our Medicaid lines of business over the past 12 months. And the out-of-period adjustments you mentioned them, yes, it's clearly a driver. So, our cost trends are consistent at 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points. We feel very comfortable with our guidance and in the quality of our earnings. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question. Operator : Next Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Hi, thanks. I just want to ask a modeling question just to make sure that I've got this right, because it's a new line for all of us, just in terms of cost of products sold and you're guiding for the $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. I guess, John, can you sort of maybe walk us through just the cadence of how we should be thinking about that with the IngenioRx rollout in terms of 2Q and then sort of relative to 3Q, 4Q on that? John Gallina : Sure. The cost of products as you mentioned there's is going to be a new line item. And that is going to relate from an accounting perspective, when we provide PBM services to our ASO clients or independent third-party clients, we would recognize cost of products expense associated with the fulfillment of their pharmacy benefit. And then the revenue, that would be associated with that would obviously be the reimbursement, we would get associated with those cost in our products, those all the value-added services that Ingenio is making and providing and the profit margin associated with that.  As said, that will be relatively small again in the second quarter and then ramp up in the third quarter and obviously be a little bit more in the fourth quarter associated with the $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion of cost. Ingenio, the revenue, I would say or the benefit should reconcile back to that $0.70 to $0.90 improvement in guidance that we provided associated with Ingenio, which would be the revenue aspect of the cost of product, which is the expense number. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Now to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Frank Morgan : Good morning, Gail. In your prepared remarks, I think you mentioned, when you were discussing social determinants of health. I think you mentioned a personal care services benefit that you'd added to some of your plans, I'm just curious about the extent that benefit is all for today? How many states it's in, any plans to expand that and have you really identified that yet as an opportunity for helping or control overall cost? Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Well, thank you very much for the question. Frank. As I noted in my opening comments, we have a bundle of social determines in addition to some over the counter items that we've also added to our Medicare Advantage beneficiaries across our states and really, which benefit selected is really based [Technical Difficulty] that we have probably the most comprehensive offering and we're really pleased with that. We're very pleased that CMS has also expanded the level of opportunity that can be offered going into this, the next year's Medicare Advantage selling season. What we do know about those, the reason's that they allow for us to help manage the whole person care again going back to our original strategy and that's \u2013 while it's still early [Technical Difficulty] our Medicaid population that these benefits will ultimately help us manage overall total cost to care and outcomes for our members and also improve our Star ratings. Our quality outcomes are better. I shared with you just the demonstration program that we did here in the Indiana market around Blue Triangle and that's a great example of embedding things beyond just the physical health benefits, but also social issues that impact the people's ability to get care. So, we did include that bundle broadly and again, which of those specific benefits are taken advantage really depends on [Technical Difficulty]. Thank you very much for the question. Next question please. Operator : Now to the last question from Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Lance Wilkes : Yes, morning. And just a quick cleanup question or two. First one will be just related to medical cost trend, if you could talk a little bit about where you\u2019re seeing maybe pressure versus opportunities, obviously very early in the year and the other aspect was just in Medicaid, you've always had some wins, some Medicaid expansion going forward. Can you just kind of give us a little more color on what you see coming in the year that you already know about as far as certain state expansions, wins, and expected implementation dates? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : I\u2019ll ask John first to address your question on medical costs, and then Felicia to share some perspective on Medicaid. John Gallina : Sure. Yes, thanks, good morning. Lance. In terms of medical cost trend as I think I stated in a previous question. So, we are reaffirming our 6% medical cost trend guidance plus or minus 50 basis points. it really is aligning quite nicely with our expectations. I will take this opportunity to clarify that the 6% plus or minus 50 basis points, does not include any aspect of the implementation of IngenioRx in the second half of the year. Yes, that's a that will obviously benefit our drug costs later in the year and provide benefits associated with a lower pharmacy cost structure.  However, in order to provide what we think is better clarity, better information and make it easier to understand and model our business, we are going to provide cost trend guidance in 2019 without the IngenioRx implementation, because it's a partial year for just some clients and provide a result that really isn't all that meaningful and then in 2020 we will \u2013 when we provide our cost stream guide to 2020 we will have a full year of IngenioRx baked in. So, it will actually be, I believe far more transparent meaningful the way that we're doing it, but in terms of other issues and trends or areas of concern, after the first quarter, Medical cost trend is very consistent with expectations. Gail Boudreaux : Felicia? Felicia Norwood : Yes. Thank you, Lance for the question. As you know, the Medicaid pipeline continues to be very robust. We have three bids that are before us in Louisiana, as well as Minnesota. That will be submitted over the next couple of months, but most recently we're certainly pleased with our win in Washington DC, which was a rebid for us, but having the ability to continue to serve Medicaid beneficiaries in that state is very, very positive for us. So, we look forward to continuing a strong track record, which is over 83% of our wins. When we go out to bid and look forward to continuing to working with our state partners to serve Medicaid beneficiaries. Gail Boudreaux : Great, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the conference back to company management for closing comments. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you all for joining us today. We very much appreciate your questions for our team. As you can see, we started off this year in a position [Technical Difficulty] growing pipeline of opportunity ahead of us. Our first quarter performance confirms our confidence in our ability to deliver sustainable real growth on behalf of our members and shareholders. Our success is made possible by the dedication of our 60,000 associates who are committed to living Anthem\u2019s mission, vision and values each and every day. Thank you for your interest and I look forward to speaking with you again soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be made available for replay after 11 :00 AM today through May 8.

Later, there will be a question-and-answer session; instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Chris Rigg : Good morning, and welcome to Anthem's second quarter 2019 earnings call. This is Chris Rigg, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of our Commercial and Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division. Gail will begin the call by giving an overview of our second quarter financial results, followed by comments on our key business initiatives and enterprise-wide growth priorities. John will then discuss our key financial metrics in greater detail and go over our updated 2019 outlook. We will then be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our Web site, Antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Boudreaux : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Anthem's second quarter earnings call. Today, we reported second quarter results that were ahead of expectations. During the quarter, we generated GAAP earnings per share of $4.36, and adjusted earnings per share of $4.64. Our second quarter performance reflects improved execution across the enterprise and the strength of our diversified platform. Based on the strong first-half 2019 results and confidence in the remainder of the year, we have increased our full-year GAAP net income guidance to greater than $18.34 per share, and adjusted earnings per share guidance to greater than $19.30 per share, an increase of $0.10 from our prior guidance. Our total medical membership at the end of the quarter was 40.9 million, an increase of 1.3 million consumers served compared to the second quarter of 2018. Membership growth was broad-based, with continued strong performance in our Government Business and substantial improvement in our risk-based group Commercial Business. Overall risk-based membership represents more than 85% of our total growth. At investor day, we committed to multiyear growth across all business segments, driven in part by our improved pharmacy cost position through IngenioRx. As you know, we accelerated the launch of Ingenio and successfully began migrating members on May 1st. At this time, we've received transition approvals from all 14 commercial states and a majority of our Medicaid states. As a result of our accelerated progress, we now see the 2019 earnings contribution from IngenioRx trending toward the upper end of our $0.70 to $0.90 guidance. As part of our build out of IngenioRx we've recently opened our state of the art 24/7 pharmacy care center in Las Vegas providing both member support and eventually dedicated specialty patient care. The multidisciplinary teams of nurses, pharmacists, and technicians are working together, supported by our digital engagement tools to provide personalized support to improve the experience and health outcomes for consumers. The benefits of the move to IngenioRx are immediate for our clients and members, and we are on track to have all of our members on the IngenioRx platform by January 1st of 2020. While there is still work ahead of us, the dedication of the 2,500 individuals focused on this transition has been extraordinary and a key driver of our success. The strong value proposition of IngenioRx is resonating in the marketplace. And we are pleased that we were selected by Blue Cross of Idaho to provide pharmacy services, effective January 1st, 2020. Our partners at Blue Cross of Idaho see the value of our best-in-class capabilities, and appreciate our commitment to deliver more affordable care and a simplified consumer experience. While our focus remains primarily on existing client transitions for 2020, we are increasingly confident in our ability to capitalize on opportunities across the marketplace for us to bring innovative pharmacy services back for our medical clients. Across Anthem we've been investing in digital innovation to create more personalized and integrated experiences for employers, state partners, consumer, and care providers. One of the areas where we see an opportunity to directly improve the health of the people we serve is with the launch of Anthem's electronic personal health record. Our electronic personal health record gives consumers access to their own electronic health record containing claims history, lab data, and CMS' Blue Button data through a secure and easy-to-use mobile application. We believe the easier access to this information for consumers and their families will empower them to be more engaged in healthcare decisions and support greater alignment and communication with care providers. The electronic personal health record will be available to our commercial and Medicare members in the fourth quarter, and will roll out to all members by early 2020. Another area where we are focused is helping consumers manage their health and benefits in a simpler, more personal and integrated way. By leveraging our engagement capabilities with solutions, like Anthem Amplified, we are able to deliver a consumer experience that brings together account-specific plan benefits, personal medical records, and care provider selection tools to best meet individual needs. With Anthem Amplified, consumers have access to four key capabilities, a health checker that works to identify symptoms using voice and digital interactions, a transparent marketplace that provides customers with upfront information around cost before they even go to the doctor, a scheduler that helps find nearby care providers and set up appointments, and finally, a retail-like experience to pay for services directly from a laptop or mobile device. Our investments in technology are designed to create more personalized, transparent, and convenient solutions for our consumers and customers. We are also leveraging digital solutions for our care provider partners by embedding these tools in our value based program, like enhanced personal healthcare, which is driving more appropriate use of services, strong adherence to clinical treatment protocols, and significant cost efficiencies. Our ongoing approach across our local markets is focused on helping consumers make informed decisions, driving sustainable outcomes across all aspects of wellbeing and reducing overall costs. The growth of our value-based care model is accelerating. Through the second quarter, approximately 59% of medical spend is tied to value-based care, ahead of our full-year target of 58%. In addition, 36% of value-based care is now tied to shared savings programs, which is also tracking ahead of our full-year target. I'm excited about the impact of the investments we're making in our digital programs and value-based care models to help us to achieve our mission to improve lives and simplify healthcare. We will continue to develop innovative solutions that benefit our stakeholders across the continuum of care. Our Commercial business performed well in the quarter with total margins solidly above 10% due to higher penetration of value added services and specialty offerings in our fee-based business. Sales of specialty and clinical programs helped drive a strong upper single-digit increase in core administrative fees and other revenue. The robust growth was despite the expected seasonal decline in fee-based membership proving that our cross-selling efforts are yielding results. In our risk-based business, we remain on track to achieve our 2019 membership growth of 150 to 300,000 members. Medicare Advantage is performing well and our strong capability in this area is positioning us for solid multi-year growth. More than 50% of our growth in individual MA this year has been driven by market share gains. It's clear that seniors value our supplemental benefit offerings like our unique over-the-counter solution that improved overall affordability and the retail experience for our consumers. We expect continued growth in our individual business over the balance of the year. And we expect to achieve our full-year mid double digit growth target. Further, our dual special need membership has increased nearly 300% since the end of 2015. And we now have the number one or two market share position in our states today. In the group Medicare segment, the pipeline is robust and several recent contract wins give us confidence in our ability to deliver another year of strong growth in 2020 and bring us closer to our goal of serving 800,000 members by 2023. Over the last 12 months, we have added nearly 700,000 members in Medicaid including approximately 65,000 members in the quarter. We were pleased to recently be awarded the statewide contract for Florida Healthy Kids effective January 21st 2020, taking our strong Simply brand from four regions in the state to all 11 regions in support of children's health and wellness. The Medicaid pipeline remains robust. And our outlook for future growth is aligned to our ability to provide innovative solutions to our state partners and drive better value for our members. Importantly, our pending acquisition of Beacon will further enable us to capitalize on opportunities to serve complex and specialized populations in Medicaid as well as the overall behavioral health needs of more than 60 million consumers. This acquisition is a significant milestone for growth in the diversified business growth and will meaningfully expand our footprint in the growing behavioral health market. Our success today in behavioral health has been due to our highly coordinated whole person approach to managing care. Beacon's proven ability to manage chronic care population and specialized expertise will strengthen us in this space as we continue to pursue growth both organically and through alliance partnerships. At Anthem, we recognize that we play an important societal role regarding some of the most critical issues facing Americans today. For many of the nation's most vulnerable population, we have a unique opportunity to remove social barriers. With that in mind, we recently launched the Food is Medicine program with Feeding America, the nation's largest domestic hunger relief organization. The partnership will work hospital outpatient clinics to indentify and assist people facing food and security, a problem that affects almost 12% of all households in a given year. By improving access to food, we can better manage the high cost of care for our state partners while empowering consumers to better manage their health and well being. We are also taking a strong stand related to the environment. As a healthcare company, Anthem recognizes the link between environmental health and the health of our consumers and communities. And we are committed to continually improving the environmental sustainability of our operation. To that end, we recently joined RE100 which is a global initiative bringing together influential businesses focused on renewable energy. As after of this effort, we are committed to sourcing 100% of the electricity used in our offices with wind and solar energy by the year 2025. We are proud to be the first health benefits company to join the RE100 alongside other leading brands in our push from more sustainable planet. As we have noted before, this is a new era in Anthem. Our business results shared today and our strategic plan moving forward are driven by our continued focus on our culture with our mission, vision and values. By doing so, we are enabling our 60,000 plus associates to expect more of themselves and create real change for those we are fortunate to serve. And now I will turn the call over to John to discuss the second quarter financial results and our revised 2019 outlook. John? John Gallina : Thank you, Gail, and good morning. As evidenced by our earnings release, the strength of our businesses drove balanced growth for the quarter. Today, we reported second quarter GAAP earnings per share of $4.36 and adjusted earnings per share of $4.64 exceeding expectations and positioning us to deliver on our commitments. Second quarter operating revenue was strong and outperformed expectations reaching $25.2 billion an increase of nearly 11% or $2.5 billion over the prior year quarter. On adjusted basis, growth and operating revenue was approximately 13% and ahead of our projected long- term revenue growth of 10% to 12%. The increase is attributable to premium increases to cover overall trend, robust membership growth across both our government and commercial segments and yet another quarter of strong growth in administrative fee revenue driven by increased sales of clinical and value added services across our businesses. Medical membership ended the quarter at approximately 40.9 million members representing growth of 1.3 million members over the prior-year quarter. The growth was driven predominantly by our risk based business which increased by 1.1 million members or growth of nearly 8%. The medical loss ratio was 86.7% for the quarter, an increase of 330 basis points from the second quarter of 2018. The increase was largely driven by the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2019 and a continuation of elevated medical costs in our Medicaid business. The SG&A ratio was unchanged sequentially at 13%, an improvement of 210 basis points over the prior-year quarter, the improvement was driven almost equally by the absence of the health insurer tax and solid growth in operating revenue attributable to membership gains in Medicaid and Medicare. Our results illustrate the strength of our diversified platform as challenges in our Medicaid business were more than offset by our other business areas. Our Medicaid business continues to be within our target margins albeit at the low end of the range but we remain confident and fully expect our margins to improve as we continue to work with our states on a daily basis to ensure the rates we receive appropriately reflect the acuity of our membership. It is important to note that the challenges we are facing in our Medicaid business remain isolated to a handful of states and are very manageable given the size and breadth of our overall portfolio. Our medical management capabilities and operating platform are unmatched. Core competencies that are widely recognized by our state partners is evidenced by our industry leading RFP win rate compared to both our diversified and pure play competitors alike. We are pleased with our continued growth in Medicare. Year-to-date, our total Medicare Advantage membership is up 16% and a significant driver of the impressive top line growth I mentioned earlier. Moving to commercial, membership has grown nearly 300,000 members compared to the prior-year quarter. It is important to keep in mind that our second quarter 2018 commercial segment results benefited from a favorable risk adjusted associated with 2017 ACA business. With that said, our second quarter 2019 commercial operating margin was a solid 10.4% reflecting the team's progress towards increasing the penetration of clinical and other value added services. Consistent with last quarter, we continue to expect our local group medical cost trend in the range of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points. Turning to the balance sheet, our debt-to-cap ratio was 39.4% at the end of the quarter. We repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $272.95, totally approximately $458 million. In total, we have repurchased 2.8 million shares of common stock year-to-date. Operating cash flow was $1.4 billion in the quarter, up $895 million from the prior year, and represent 1.1 times net income for the first six months of 2019. Days in claims payable was 39.1 days, an increase of 0.6 days sequentially and in line with expectations. Looking ahead, we now expect full-year 2019 total operating revenue of approximately $102 billion, with premium revenue increasing by $2 billion at the midpoint driven by our outlook for higher-than-expected growth in fully insured membership. Fully insured enrollment is now expected to be in the range of 15.6 to 15.8 million lives, and self-funded enrollment is now expected to be between 25.4 and 25.5 million lives. All together, full-year medical membership is now expected to be in the range of 41 to 41.3 million members. The medical loss ratio is now expected to be in the range of 86.2% to 86.5% due to the aforementioned trends in Medicaid. The SG&A ratio is now expected to be in the range of 13.2% to 13.5% due to the greater than expected revenue growth and administrative expense efficiencies. Taken together, we now expect full-year adjusted net income to be greater than $19.30 per share. And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sarah James from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Sarah James : Thank you. So, cost trends have been a pretty big topic recently, and some of your peers have been talking about thinking about long-term trend in terms of CPI or national health expenditure plus or minus, how do you think about the right framework for long-term cost trend discussions? And then thinking through the levers there, one that's been coming up recently is outcomes-based pricing for gene therapy or medical devices. So is Anthem doing anything on that front, and is it meaningful to your long-term cost trend management? Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Sarah, and thanks very much for the question. I think it's actually a really important question because this issue of overall challenge of affordability I think poses one of most significant issues [ph] to our members, and we're committed to ultimately driving the lowest cost. One of the most important levers is this ability to move to more value-based care. And as I shared in my opening comments, enhanced personal healthcare is an area that we've been focused and have made a significant commitment to move up to 60% of our spend in value-based care arrangements, thinking about the alignment of consumer spending to care provider alignment, I think that's really the best opportunity for long-term management of the trend issues. Specifically to pharmacy, we recently reported -- you probably saw in our 2018 drug trend report that we have been successful at keeping drug trends relatively flat and focusing on total cost to care. And again, I think our best opportunity to rein in overall escalation in cost is to think about whole person health, which is managing the alignment of incentives at the care provider lever with the incentives around pharmacy, and so that total costs are ultimately managed. And we have seen that in specific areas like inflammatory disease such as Crohn's and ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis, for example, where members have seen anywhere from an 8% to 12%, if not more, savings per month and average lower inpatient hospitalizations, et cetera. So that overall contributes to our overall quality. So in terms of your broader question, I think it's absolutely the right one that we should be asking. And I think we should be looking for all of our value-based care, both for pharmacy, the integration of social, as well as the integration of behavioral health. And that's one of the reasons we're excited about bringing Beacon into the fold for Anthem, that our best chance to manage sole [ph] trend is going to be aligned with managing those components in value-based arrangements. Thank you very much for the question. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Matt Borsch : Yes, I just wanted to ask about the group commercial pricing environment, and the context is as investors and us analysts are looking at your results, the mix of metrics here we see somewhat elevated medical cost ratio offset by other items in the results is what in fact we saw at two of your peer companies that have reported so far. And so maybe it's all just Medicaid, but people are looking at that and trying to understand if there's more competitive pressure that we need to be concerned about. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, Matt. Let me start, and then I'm going to ask Pete to give some additional commentary on sort of the marketplace dynamics. But I think first to your specific question about trend. As you saw, we reiterated our 6% plus or minus 50 basis points trend. So our trend in commercial has been extremely consistent. And we do not feel that there's -- that issue in commercial, it's lived up to expectations. In terms of the overall marketplace, it's always been a competitive marketplace, the pricing has remained very rational in the markets, and we have not see that kind of scenario over the course of this year or even last year. But I'm going to ask Pete maybe to give a little bit more dynamic input about the market specifically. Pete Haytaian : Yes, thank you, Gail. And to be specific about our MLR and operating gain, as we talked about in the prepared comments, the one-time issue associated with risk adjustment that we experienced in 2018 versus this quarter, and 2019 was really the major difference is it relates to medical cost trend, as Gail said, it remains pretty steady. We feel pretty good about where we are relative to that 6%. And then more importantly, as Gail noted, the marketplace remains very competitive but rational. We are not seeing anything unusual occurring in the marketplace. We feel very good about our position, as we've talked about on prior calls; we're very focused on being disciplined but also growing. We're continuing to see that growth. In our large group fully insured business we've had nine out of 11 months of sequential net growth, and we continue to see improvements in that regard. So overall a competitive market but rational, nothing irregular at this point. Gail Boudreaux : So I guess in summary, very consistent with our expectations, and nothing really has changed. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes, hi, good morning, and thank you for your comments on the BR, so, just trying to dig a little bit deeper into that, could you just help us quantify some of these moving parts? You point to the Medicaid book of business. Can you give us some more sense on what specific states you're seeing the higher cost, and how do you think is that going to progress in the second-half of the year given that you've upped your guidance there? John Gallina : Yes, thank you, Ricky. This is John. And unfortunately we really don't talk about state-by-state specific situations in Medicaid. We're in 23 states right now, going on 24 by the end of the year, and really review and discuss our Medicaid as a portfolio of assets and a portfolio of businesses. With that being said, yes there are a few things that maybe I'll point to specifically that can help you with your modeling. We continue to work with our state partners on a regular basis to get the rates that are appropriate for the risk and the acuity of the populations that we're serving. Many states have gone through a fairly significant re-verification effort ensuring that only those Americans who are eligible to receive Medicaid benefits are actually receiving Medicaid benefits. When the rates were first set they were set on a slightly different population and a mix of members than what we are serving today. And so as I said, we continue to work with the states to ensure that we're getting appropriate adjustments associated with the mix of membership as it works through. And there are several states that we actually have received increases in our rates in the second half of the year and we expect that that will help improve the MLR and improve the profitability of the Medicaid business in the second half of the year. So thank you for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Thanks. Just on a similar topic on the last one, I know you don't want to talk about individual states but again we're thinking about Medicaid. You mentioned popping up in a few states as far as the higher costs just curious to be able to comment on whether you're seeing the costs occurring maybe in some of your newer Medicaid markets where you still may be assessing where the cost trends could normalize within the membership and relative to your provider network or are you seeing it maybe in more some of your older more mature Medicaid markets, just curious if there is any clear trend when thinking about it that way? Thanks. John Gallina : Thank you, Steve for the question and I do want to have a clarification. We have not stated that we have seen an increase in medical cost. We have said we've seen an increase in benefit expense ratio and that increase in benefit expense ratio is because the premium reimbursements that we're getting have not fully compensated us for the risk that we're taking on an overall portfolio. Back to the point that I made on Ricky's question that if states are going to re-verification there is an incidence of the mix of the membership that we're serving is different than what the pricing and the rates would have been based on. So yes, there's clearly there's a mismatch between the risk of the members that we are serving today and the rates that we're receiving today. And Felicia Norwood and her team are visiting with our state partners on a regular basis if not a daily basis in some cases to ensure that the rates are appropriately reflected. And that's one of the unfortunate parts about the Medicaid businesses is that the amount of the premium that you receive and the risks that you are incurring do not always exactly align on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We've seen that typically over the course of a year that they'll be normalized, that rates will be adjusted appropriately. But when you're looking at any one specific quarter or any quarter-over-quarter comparison, it's always apt to be skewed a bit because of the mismatch that I discussed. So thank you for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks I'll just on the MLR train here for a second. My question is more is that your MLR was 90 basis points above consensus. I was hoping you could tell us how the MLR looked versus your internal expectations and maybe split out the driver of first the negative TYD in the quarter and you raised guidance by 30 bps, was that to reflect what you saw in the quarter or your point like is that the back half of the year should be higher even despite these better Medicaid rates? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks Justin and I would let John continue with the answers. Thanks John. John Gallina : Yes, thank you. Thank you, Justin for the question. In terms of the MLR and how it compared our internal expectations. The MLR was slightly higher than our internal expectations here for the first half of the year in the second quarter which is why we are raising our guidance, which is why we have spiked it out as is a reason for the fact that our MLR is above the analyst consensus in total. So I think that all really does align in terms of the PPIA that you stated, the PPIA is one metric. It's obviously a metric that a lot of folks really do like to focus on but it is only one metric. I would say our reserves are very consistent and conservative the way that we've approached it. We continue to have a margin in the mid to high single digit range for average deviation. But we are investing quite a bit of money in informatics and data, in systems and it is actually providing us better information and better insights into our inventory data. And so not only is that being utilized to help serve the members, it is also being utilized to help set reserves and I think we should see maybe a bit less volatility in reserves in the future associated with the fact that we have better information and we've even discussed in the past, some of the claims processing speeds have improved as well, 97% of our claims are submitted via EDI and 88% of our auto adjudicated, so the speed and accuracy is actually very, very good. And so then as you look at that one metric associated with PPIA, you have to look at other metrics in conjunction with that and the fact that our days and claims payable has increased a bit. Our cash flow as a percent of net income was 1.3 times for the quarter, 1.1 for the entire year-to-date. And I think we're very comfortable that the reserves are stated appropriately and quite nice, I go through all this just to let you know that it's really not impacting the MLR guidance per se, the MLR guidance is based on the Medicaid MLR being higher than expected which really has much to do with the revenue that we're getting is not exactly matching the risks that we're taking right here in the second quarter. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A. J. Rice: Thanks. Hi everybody. I just if I could slip in a clarification, Pete had mentioned the risk adjuster headwind this year versus last. Is that any way to quantify the year-to-year impact of that on the MLR or the dollar change, and then my bigger question was around your comments on Ingenio. You said that you're going to be toward the high end of your expectation. Is there any way to talk about where you're trending ahead of what you thought and obviously nice to win with BCBS Idaho. Any background on that opportunity, does that give you any learnings for next year's selling season as you think about moving forward? Gail Boudreaux : Okay. Quite a few questions there A.J. we'll try to take them sequentially. Let me have John address the risk adjuster question broadly and then I will take the others. John Gallina : Great. Thank you, Gail. So yes, so A.J., on the risk adjuster and I just want to make sure that this is being characterized appropriately and we're asking and answering the proper question. So risk adjuster in 2018 in the second quarter we had a very nice positive true up and that was predicated on our 2017 individual ACA membership. And as you recall that was before we had made the decision to reduce our footprint due to the instability and uncertainty of that marketplace. And so we had approximately 1.6 million individual ACA members in 12/31/17 and then the true up we received in June was predicated on that block of business. And then fast forward 12 months and we received a true up in June of 2019 associated with our 2018 membership. That true up was positive. It was relatively small and it was extremely consistent with our expectations. And so the headwind is not a negative true up, the headwind is that the value of the true up in 2018 was significant and the value of the positive true up in 2019 was relatively small, but as I said in accordance with our guidance and our expectations. Gail Boudreaux : Right and again that's the comp quarter-over-quarter, I think is what John's trying to really point out there. And overall as I said in the opening comments, we feel very, very strongly about the performance of our commercial business which perform extremely well in the quarter as well as year-to-date. In terms of IngenioRx, a couple of things one first we're extremely pleased with the way, the transition has gone as I shared again in my opening comments. In terms of us raising our guidance, when we originally gave our guidance I think what is important to recognize this was a very accelerated transition. We felt confident about it but we also realized that we needed to get state approvals both at the commercial and Medicaid level. So we didn't have exact clarity on when those would come in. What we see now is that we converted several million members in the quarter. And then again beginning in July several million more those have gone well. We have received most of the regulatory approvals on the Medicaid side and all of them on the commercial side. And so now given our growing confidence in this conversion, we feel much better about the high end of the range and that's really the driver for what we're seeing in terms of raising the guidance, and again very strong execution by our pharmacy team. So overall that's really the driver and we feel very confident about kind of where IngenioRx is delivering value particularly the significantly improved G&A costs. In terms of Idaho, we're thrilled with the sale to Blue Cross Blue Cross of Idaho and again our focus as we've shared has been on transitioning our current clients, so we are in the sales cycle. We're pleased that Blue Cross of Idaho was one of our first customers to come on board and I said as I shared with you again I think it's strong sign of the value that we're bringing to the marketplace and also the improved service model. We do have a very strong pipeline going into 2021 as you realize many of these sales are very long tail two, three years based on the contracts in the PBM and the large account business, but we think a real big opportunity for us is the opportunity to bring back pharmacy into our Integrated Medical clients. That's an area that over the last several years that we have lost quite a bit of that integrated business and our value proposition is very strong, so we're optimistic about that but we see that going really more into the latter half of 2020 and into 2021. Thank you very much for the question. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Lance Wilkes : Yes, just a quick clarification on Medicaid and just trying to understanding this re-verification issue predominantly. Are you taking any actions to try to further impact medical costs beyond what you ordinarily would be doing just in recognition of that sort of issue? And then my broader question is really great, great win with Blue Cross of Idaho as you're looking at the different services and partnerships, you have with the Blues. What are the areas that we should be thinking of is like the more immediate meaning 2021 sort of opportunities as Medicaid, is it AIM or what would it be PBM? Gail Boudreaux : Great. Thank you very much for the question Lance, I'm going to have Felicia address what's happening in our Medicaid business, I think she can talk broadly about the initiatives. Felicia Norwood : Thank you, Lance, and good morning. As John said earlier, the Medicaid challenges that we're facing are really isolated to a handful of states and given the breadth and size of our portfolio and the ongoing work that we do on a daily basis with our states we felt very confident about being able to manage through that. In terms of our medical management capabilities, we really have industry leading capabilities. Our operating platform is unmatched. Our core competencies are certainly widely recognized by our state partners as really recognized by the industry leading win rate that we've had. We've always had a focus on whole person health particularly in our Medicaid business and the ability to be able to manage not just, it's you know the medical conditions and pharmacy conditions but also those social barriers have been a driver for us. So we feel good about the capabilities we have on the Medicaid side in terms of managing our members effectively. And I think as we work through these issues in the handful of states, we'll continue to see improvements both respect to our overall Medicaid performance. Gail Boudreaux : Great, well, thanks Felicia. In terms of the second part of your question Lance, I would say almost to all of those we see opportunities across a very wide range of partnerships with different Blue plans but also outside of Blue plans care provider partners are also areas that we have done a number of different things. So, on the specifics, so clearly our Medicaid partnerships we're very pleased with that, we'll be bringing North Carolina live in the fourth quarter hopefully as that goes by. We've got additional partnerships there with our care more business as well to offer care delivery services more broadly to that population. As I think about Ingenio, we clearly see opportunities for Ingenio to partner with other Blue plans across either their entire population even subsets of that population. Beacon does quite a bit of work with other Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans and we see that is an opportunity to further expand and Aspire has also strong relationships. So as you can see we see a breadth of potential opportunities both inside of the Blue Cross system but also with care provider partners. And today even just to give you one quick example in the Medicaid space, we have eight partnerships fiber with Sister Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans and three are with care provider relationships. On Medicare because of our strength in the dual eligible population, we're going to be expanding our partnership in Louisiana to dual eligibles beginning in January as well. So again a pretty broad based operation for us. And so we're not just focused on growing one specific business or line but really kind of meeting the needs of each of those plans and where they have potential gaps and potentially how we can put together very unique situations. The last thing I would add is as you saw probably recently some of the announcements around our digital capabilities. We also believe that those will be very strong offerings for us to work with other Blue plans around consumer engagement and care provider integration and those things we think will resonate very strongly in the market and actually support the other businesses that I shared with you at the beginning. So thanks. Thank you very much for the question. And next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great, maybe one clarification before the question, just to make sure the Ingenio number that you're talking about is more about kind of pulling for the aggregate savings, if you're not changing your kind of two-year aggregate savings number, just want to make sure you have that right, but my real question is really about MLR unfortunately. So just wanted to see you are saying that the issues on the Medicaid side, would love to hear some comments about on the commercial business and on the Medicare business, how the MLR is trending there. I just want to make sure it's line because you are showing pretty good growth in both of those businesses. Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Let me answer your first question. Yes, you are right. Your assessment on Ingenio is in line. And then John I will ask you to respond to the MLR question. John Gallina : Yes, thank you Kevin for the question. And as I think Pete had referenced earlier, the MLR in commercial is actually very much aligned with what our expectations have been. As we review and evaluate the cost trend, we have reaffirmed today the 6% plus or minus 50 basis points cost trend in commercial that is something that has been consistent for the entire year. And then we continued to reaffirm that guidance. Medicare has been certainly consistent with our expectations as well. We are really quite pleased with our growth in Medicare, having 16% growth rate already through six months and expect to continue to improve. The group retiree business within Medicare which you didn't ask about specifically but just for clarity purposes that business typically dilutive when it first sold. And it takes awhile to get the care management programs to get risk scores, get the information accumulated so that we can get appropriate reimbursement based on risk adjustors and various other aspects like that. But, it's actually performing in line with our expectations. We did expect it to be dilutive in the first half of the year and it was. But it's very much in line with the expectations. So I would say we feel very comfortable with the performance, and the growth both in our commercial business as well as our Medicare business. And that the MLR pressures that we are seeing as a consolidated company really relate to the lack of appropriate premium and reimbursement rates on the Medicaid businesses. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks, morning. You have mentioned a couple times now that Medicaid rates aren't sufficient I guess in a handful of states. I am assuming you have some visibility on the kind of the year ahead. We obviously recently got the Iowa rate. So are you comfortable looking ahead that you'll get the better rates? Or, are we at a point of potentially exiting states? Thanks. John Gallina : Hi. No, thank you for the question, Ralph, and clearly that is a very appropriate question. Something that we need to be looking at and evaluating on a state by state basis, however, we are very comfortable with the future state aspect of Medicaid. Medicaid does have the $80 billion pipeline that we have been talking about for a while over the next five years, and we do believe that we can garner our fair share of that. The acuity of that pipeline is skewed more to the higher premium type businesses whether it's the aged, blind, disabled, long term support services or others. And we will be very disciplined in terms of how we approach that, how we price for that to ensure that we are being appropriately reimbursed. But no, we are not at the point now that we are talking about exiting states. We want to be a partner with the state. We believe the states like us. As a partner, we have provided a significant amount of value and savings to these states over time. And it all boils down just getting the reimbursement correct. So we feel very good about the both the short term and the long term trajectory of the Medicaid business. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tanal from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Steve Tanal : Good morning, guys. Unfortunately, I also wanted to just ask about MLR and then I don't fully just get this one thing sort of like the way the claims payable table which suggests there is about 40 million of unfavorable prior year development in the quarter. And it was favorable about 160 last year. So, sort of a 200 million swing there in isolation would have pressured MBR by about 85 bps year on year, but then in the release you sort of note that claims reserves establish that yearend and developed moderately better. So, first just trying to understanding what was actually built into guidance on that point and also where the negative development kind of emanated from by business. And finally on this whole thing, just hoping you might comment on how MLR trended year-on-year and commercial and [technical difficulty] side of Medicaid. John Gallina : Sure, Steve. Thank you very much. The PPA metric that you stated was consistent with the how I answered Justin Lake's question a few minutes ago associated with that are reverses are very consistent and that we do have explicit conservatives inbuilt into those. The better information we have, the better insights has certainly provided us clarity in terms of our loss reserves. And it's just one metric. Days and claims payable has increased, cash flows has been very positive 1.3 times net income. And so, we feel very good about the situation. One other thing just to really clarify when you are looking at the prior year number, that's based on the 12/31/17 run off. And the 12/31/17 run off had 1.6 million individual ACA members in it. And we had announced a few months earlier that we are going to exit 65% of the footprint associated with the individual ACA. And so, we are a very conservative in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with our reserve picks on the ACA -- individual ACA business, and that turned out to be redundant which you are seeing in the go-forward footnote from a year ago. So all in, we actually feel very comfortable with the business. There is no surprises here. There is no new news. Medicaid has been performing under our expectations. Commercial and Medicare have both been performing consistent with our expectations. And we actually feel very good about the revenue adjustments and the revenue enhancements that we are expecting in Medicaid in the second half of the year. And then, we will continue on with the strong performance in the commercial and Medicare. Gail Boudreaux : The only thing I would like to add to John's comment is Medicaid is performing within our range although at the low end of the range so that is little bit more clarity on that. So overall we still believe that the Medicaid is very good business, but again you see this in the Medicaid business where trying to align the mix of the business against the payments that you receive and that's why we often see outer period payments in Medicaid. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : Hi, just one clarification for Gail and a question for John. Gail, just wondering on Ingenios as we think about it, you mentioned the strong 2021 pipeline and a big Priority is moving Anthem's own book to Ingenio by January 2020. So I guess you really hadn't thought much about the opportunities for large external client wins for 2020 such as Idaho. So this is sort an anomaly or is there really more opportunity there than perhaps we have considered? Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, Gary. First, we are really pleased with the win. So I don't know that I would call it an anomaly. We are out in the marketplace. This is more just about the timing of contract renewals. And I think our -- in fact we have been -- we have not being aggressively selling, just given the amounts of conversion that we wanted to make sure that went really well for our clients. But we are clearly out there talking to clients and sharing our value proposition. So I wouldn't call it an anomaly, but I would also say that we really do believe that it will be more in '21 and beyond just because of the timing. And it is hard for many clients to move off of the cycle that they currently have. And that would be more in line with expectations, but we would like to see certainly the integration of our medical and pharmacy story is really strong. And that we think that there is opportunities to do more in 20. Thank you. And the second part of the question again, please? Gary Taylor : When you cite few of the different factors impacting the MLR year on year including Medicaid and RRR et cetera, one thing you don't talk about is the possibility of pretty significant ramp and the ESI contract cost that Cigna has talked about in the closing years here. So is a reason that's not pressuring MLR year-over-year, just that that was well known by you in advance and would have been reflected in pricing? John Gallina : Yes, thank you, Gary. That's an excellent question. And as we have stated, we believe that we are being overcharged by an excess of $3 billion by Express Scripts based on our contractual provisions. But that was known and it was baked into our numbers. The trend that we are experienced pharmacy, while it's higher than we would like, it's consistent with what we planned for at the beginning of the year. So, thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Peter Costa : Back to the Blue Cross of Idaho question, congratulations on that, Blue Cross of Idaho I believe used CVS as their PBM previously and uses CVS for Ingenio as the backend. How much easier did that make it to win that client because of the CVS? Because most of the other Blue Cross Blue Shield plans use either Express or Prime. How much harder will it be for you to win business away form Express and Prime rather than from CBS customer? Gail Boudreaux : Yes. So thanks for the question. I think overall, the opportunity win is really because of the strong value proposition that we bring to the marketplace. So, I really focus on the Ingenio we built a brand new service center. I think we have got the state-of-the-art capabilities that are far superior to many in this space right now. And honestly, we have the experience working as a Blue plan ourselves and understand how to serve that marketplace very very well. And this gives us an opportunity. It's part of our whole person health to integrate those type of concepts in terms of our analytics, our digital platform, the integrated teams that we put in our Las Vegas center. So we are starting really with kind of a blank sheet of paper which makes this the next generation PBM. And I guess I was focused more on that because I think that's the value proposition that we bring to the marketplace versus targeting any individual competitor and trying to beat them. I mean we are trying to create a brand new value proposition. Thank you very much. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I had the question regarding the senate finance committee drug pricing bill that was introduced yesterday, and then wanted information particularly in -- first, Medicaid eliminating spread pricing for PBM. And I believe the senate health committee is also looking to eliminate that perhaps in the commercial market. Can you talk about sort of the privilege at this point of spread pricing and PBM contracting maybe in general or particularly with Ingenio? And our estimate -- we are estimating maybe is less than 2%. But can you talk about sort of how you see that impacting your business here? And then obviously, there was a redesign in the Part D program or proposed redesign the Part D program should be more cost put in catastrophic to the plan. How do you see that maybe impacting how premiums are set or any impact to the part D plan sponsors? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks, Charles. Quite a few questions there, and I think first and foremost where we are all aligned is on the affordability of pharmacy and that we need to ensure that we have strong programs in place quite frankly on total cost, total net cost meaning total cost of premium as well as what consumers pay ultimately. In terms of -- you mentioned a number of things that are happening right now. And there are a number of things going on in the house and the senate around pricing whether it's spread pricing or some of the other issues that you brought up on Part D. I think first and foremost we are in the midst of providing comments on that and actively engaged in that. And I think given that these have been recently released and a lot of it depends on the details. I think it's immature for us to comment publically on where we think these are going to end up. Again, we are committed to ensuring that we get sort of the best lowest net cost. And we clearly align sort of the states -- and if you asked about Medicaid where our states are, we clearly align with the rules of our states and same thing with the federal government on Medicare. So, overall, I think there is going to be a lot more discussion, debate, and input where you need to get to a lot more other details on specifically how these programs are going to work. But at this stage, I think the ultimate judge needs to be the lowest net cost both from cost to consumers but also premium cost ultimately, so all parties involved. So, I can't really provide much more guidance on that because at this stage I think that there is still lot more details around these proposals and how they would work. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dave Styblo : Hi, good morning. It's Dave Styblo in for Dave Windley. Just had a question about the Medicaid, I think management has done a great job of explaining how it's isolated to the handful states. Curious about the risk that this could bleed into other states, that there might be a second wave that could come at some point and how debate discussions are evolving just not beyond the shortlist that you guys have talked about. And then as a follow-up would management care to comment about the EPS cadence in the back half of the year since there are still many moving parts with Ingenio coming on and some of the earlier wins that were dilutive in the first half becoming more breakeven or positive in the second half. Gail Boudreaux : I think John will answer the second part of your question and then I will ask Felicia to comment a little bit about just sort of the environment in Medicaid. But I do commend everyone for getting multiple questions and quite a few, so there is quite a few, then we'll try to adjust all of them, John please. John Gallina : There is a lot of multi part one questions, but thank you for the question and the cadence of our EPS seasonality, because you know, our seasonality certainly has changed, and it's changed over the years. A few years ago, it changed when the elimination of the reinsurance program occurred throughout the ACA. It changed again when we exited the ACA, and now it's changing again with the launch of Ingenio, and it will change next year due to a full-year impact of Ingenio. So, thank you for clarifying or allowing me to clarify that the earnings seasonality has and will continue to change on a quarter-over-quarter basis. in 2019, there are a couple of other things very specifically that are driving our year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter seasonality. I talked about the commercial risk adjustment for the ACA was fairly significant in the second quarter of 2018, and it was a positive adjustment in the second quarter 2019, but relatively small. And that clearly is impacting our year-over-year seasonality. Our mix of business continues to change, and I'm not sure that everyone is truly reflected just how much our mix of business has changed over the past several years. You go back 10 years ago, we were a commercial company. We had over 70% of our revenues was generated from our commercial business area, and look at the second quarter results today, over 60% of our revenue was from our Government Business Division. And the Government Business Division has a bit flatter seasonality typically than Commercial does. And so, clearly that's continually changing. And I have talked about some of the auto period adjustments on Medicaid, and the fact that they don't always align. As we look at the second-half of 2019, we do see some revenue enhancements in Medicaid, given some of the recent rate actions and some of the other common conversations we've had with our state partners. But also thinks like -- when we went live with our partnership with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota from Medicaid, in the fourth quarter of last year, we encouraged significant administrative expense to be prepared to have a very clean and flawless one-one '19 transition to that membership. And that trend went relatively well, and now we expect the second-half of '19 for it to be accretive, working its way towards our target margin range for a new line of business, or a new state. And so, when you're looking at the second-half of 2019, you have the cost of implementation, and you look at the second-half of '18, the cost of implementation in the second-half of 2019 you have the accretion. And the same thing is going on with the group retiree business. My reference is that was diluted at the beginning, and it is dilutive but it's improving throughout the year. So, a lot of moving parts, but we are very comfortable with the overall aspect of our numbers. Gail Boudreaux : Great. May be Felicia give a little commentary about the state? Felicia Norwood : Sure. And thanks for the question, Dave. As we said, that was -- there were elevated cost pressures in a handful of states, but the discipline around working with states for perspective rates happens in all of our states. So, our teams are engaged in almost a daily basis, and working with our states around understanding what's happening with the emerging experience of our Medicaid membership, and the mix issues that we discussed before. So, the other thing you should understand too is all the state's rating periods are different. So they are not on a calendar year. They happen at different times of the year, and in addition to that there are also opportunities from mid-year rate adjustments. So, the rate process in states is very complex, dynamic, and very iterative in terms of the work that we have to do on a daily basis. So, while the pressure is certainly isolated in a handful of states, the discipline around the work that we do with our states on a day-to-day basis happens consistently across all 22 or so of our markets. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Great, thanks. I appreciate you guys fit me in. I'll be brief I guess. Just on Idaho, if you could just walk us through the process of that, was there a formal RFP, and if so, when did that happen, and maybe just let us know what resonated -- what were the big takeaways that they weren't getting from their previous administrator that they're looking forward to you guys? Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Well, thanks, Josh. Obviously we don't get into detail about specific customer RFP situations, and that kind of detail. It's confidential and it's obviously competitive in nature, but I guess what I would say is, our new platform, our transparent approach, focus that we put on digital integration and consumer services I think are resonated, and our ability to really understand, quite frankly, how that business is managed and try to help them improve their overall affordability and cost would be the key winners, and we have a very compelling value proposition. Overall we believe we have best-in-class rates in contracting and that combined with really solid integration I think are really kind of -- were part of the reasons for the win. So, thanks for the question. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Thanks for fitting me in. Actually just wanted to shift back over to group MA and was hoping maybe to get some numbers just around the membership pipeline opportunity for 2020, maybe just first if you could dive in terms of the number of lives of the contracts that you have already secured that you mentioned? And then overall how large the membership opportunity is on the group MA pipelines of 2020? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Great. I will let Pete comment on that. Pete Haytaian : Yes, sure, Scott, thanks for the question. Yes, we feel good about the group MA business as you know, last year we started off at around 20,000 members, we have grown that into the year at 150,000 approaching around 160,000 members. And as we have talked about, we are going to end the year this year approaching 200,000. We still feel good about that. A lot of our opportunities we talked about before comes from our conversion opportunities, which means that we have a captive pipeline of self-funded clients that see the value proposition here, and we continue to see that escalating, and our value proposition resonating, and we feel good about the future year growth of the Group Retiree business. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Newshel from Evercore. Please go ahead. Michael Newshel : Thanks. Can you comment on some of the recent policy proposals related to negotiated commercial rates? So we have the Trump executiv0e order on transparency and also surprised billing bills that would payout in network at the local median rate, do you think either of these could have any effect on relative cost advantage, does it help competitors with higher unit cost at all? Gail Boudreaux : So, couple of different things going on, and let me first talk about price billing. We very much support that consumers do not have surprises, and part of our contracting strategy is to bring in all of those care providers into our networks. So, when an individual consumer goes to somebody in network, they should not have to deal with something that's outside of the network, and that's something that we have long advocated with our care providers, and so we are obviously very supportive of that. We want to ensure that there are the appropriate protections for consumers and that they balance the incentive to providers, but we don't replace that obviously with costly bureaucratic processes. So that would be one thing on surprised billing, but overall we are very supportive of helping consumers have the fine cost and really understand that. In terms of the second one around transparency of cost, again, we have been a long supporter of enabling consumers to really understand what the costs are. We think it's less valuable to have individual unit costs by procedure, and that's one of reasons our engaged platform allows people to really truly understand how much something costs against their benefit plan and what their true out-of-pocket costs will become. A great example of -- you know, think about a member who needs an MRI, the average cost maybe $1,200, which is great to know if you look at the individual components. But actually it may only cost $50 out-of-pocket, because they have already met their deductible, and that's way more helpful, and then they can also compare different facilities and look at not just cost, but also quality. As I think of that though the price transparency issue is -- the other issue in terms of competitiveness for us is our move to value-based care I think really changes sort of that one's focus on just unit costs. So I believe our movements of value-based care will drive cost down to a much more reasonable level, and that's where our strategy is. And so, I don't see just the unit cost issue being the dominant issue, and I think that we have to think about transparency around total cost here again for the entire procedure and how it affects consumers directly and that they can make decisions based on what they're paying out-of-pocket. Thank you very much for the question. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan from RBC Capital. Please go ahead. Frank Morgan : Good morning. A lot of my questions are answered, but maybe go back to Beacon acquisition, just the timing there on that closing of that acquisition, the possibility of additional deals, cross-sell opportunities, and would that be affected by this transition of Express Scripts, or would that be totally unrelated? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : In terms of Beacon, what we've shared is that we are planning on working towards the fourth quarter close, and we are working through obviously all the approvals that are required there. In terms of your second question, it really doesn't have any relationship to that. Completely separate issue; what it means for us in the future, we are excited about Beacon, because again, it gives us part of our whole person care strategy, our movement towards -- you know, very much focused on value-based care, which I just spoke about, areas that we are focused on social issues and now the behavioral issues, those three combined I think allow us to much more effectively manage total cost of care. So, we are excited about Beacon. It gives us the scale solution in growing area, and a very important area for us. It focuses on the special aid populations in Medicaid. So we've seen them in many of our markets, and feel that this would be a very, very strong offering for us. So, again thank you for the question. And next question, please? Operator : Your final question today comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Rob Cottrell : Hi, good morning. This is actually Rob Cottrell on for Steve. Just wanted to stay on individual Medicare for 2020, now that bids have been submitted, just wondering if you can provide any commentary on outlook as well as what if any change you expect in the Medicare business now that you have Ingenio cost position? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Great, I will ask Felicia Norwood to answer, please. Felicia Norwood : Thank you very much Rob for that question. As we think about 2020, we take a real balanced approach in structuring our offerings [ph]. We evaluate both our benefit designs as well as the competitive landscape. We certainly appreciate the increased flexibility that's come from our federal partner around the 2019 benefit offerings when we made some changes with respect to social determinants of health benefits, and frankly I think we were leaders out there in trends of that space. We will be making some modest improvements with respect to those offerings, because we believe that they certainly can be differentiators with respect to our products in the various markets. Going forward, the story hasn't changed very much. We've been delivering very strong growth in the individual MA space, and certainly our approach is to make sure that we have competitive benefit designs out there, while also making sure that we are maintaining our pricing discipline with respect to this business as we go forward. So, thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Felicia. And thank you to everyone for allowing our call to go little longer than normal. We felt it was important to respond to everyone's question. We appreciate your questions for our team. Our performance in the first-half of this year gives us confidence in our ability to capitalize on future growth prospects and deliver better outcomes and better value on behalf of our members and shareholders. Our success is made possible by our 60,000 associates who are committed to carrying out the Anthem's mission, vision, and values each and every day. Again, thank you for your interest, and I look forward to speaking with you in the future.

Later, there will be a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Chris Rigg : Good morning. And welcome to Anthem's third quarter 2019 earnings call. This is Chris Rigg, Vice President of Investor Relations. With us this morning are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of our Commercial and Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division. Gail will begin the call by giving an overview of our third quarter financial results, followed by comments on our key business initiatives and enterprise-wide growth priorities. John will then discuss our key financial metrics in greater detail, and go over our updated 2019 outlook. We will then be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our Web site, antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Chris and good morning. Today we reported third quarter 2019 GAAP earnings per share of $4.55 and adjusted earnings per share of $4.87, reflecting strong revenue and earnings growth across our businesses. Operating margin was 5.8% for the quarter, a substantial improvement, both sequentially and year-over-year. Over the last several quarters, our enterprise-wide financial results have been strong and in 2019, we will exceed our long-term revenue and earnings growth targets. Anthem's third quarter operating revenue increased a robust 15% over the prior year quarter to $26.4 billion. Medical membership across all of our businesses increasing by 1.1 million consumers served with our risk businesses accounting for nearly 90% of total growth. Anthem Specialty businesses also delivered solid growth, adding nearly 150,000 new consumers in the quarter and nearly 800,000 to the first months of this year, first nine months. Anthem Full Health Connection has been a key enabler of our strategy to increase specialty product sale, by integrating information across our packaged medical and specialty offering, driving more effective innovations to close gaps in care and reduce costs. As part of Anthem Whole Health connection, we identified that dentist account for nearly 10% of opioid prescriptions. By leveraging this insight and mobilizing our local provider network and clinical teams, we initiated a multiyear effort to broadly educate Anthem dentist on effective non-narcotic alternative. As a result, opioids prescribed by our dental providers decreased by more than 50% and the number of opioid prescriptions exceeding 7 day supply were cut by more than 90%. Our clinical focus is designed to support care providers by giving them data, tools and capabilities to effectively manage performance. This example illustrates the power of our focus on whole person health to deliver improved outcomes and reduced costs, while impacting one of the most pressing healthcare issues facing society today. The migration of our pharmacy business to IngenioRx continues to go extremely well, and we remain on track to have all of our members on the IngenioRx platform by January 1, 2020. We're confident in our ability to execute on the remaining aspects of the transition, and now expect to be in a position to provide value added services at much more competitive pricing. IngenioRx is a key example of the strategic end-to-end execution that we're driving across all aspects of our business. With each successful wave of our migration, we've implemented a command center model bringing together hundreds of associates, representing critical operational areas to work side-by-side 24/7. Through this model, we've been able to monitor performance in real time and deploy cross functional [SWAT] teams to quickly and effectively resolve any issues or concerns. Medicaid results improved this quarter, but at a slower rate than previously anticipated, as we had better alignment of revenue relative to the risk profile of the populations served. We added nearly 200,000 members and see continued strong growth through 2020. We remain confident we'll continue to improve our performance, while delivering even greater value for our state partners and the individuals that we serve in our Medicaid programs. Our previously announced acquisition of Beacon Health remains on track to close late in the fourth quarter. This strategic addition to the Anthem portfolio will strengthen our market position in behavioral health and help further our efforts around whole person care. Improving performance execution around Anthem remains a key priority and focus. We've made progress in many areas but there is still more work needed in order to unlock the full potential of our enterprise. We're very disappointed with the recently announced star rating scores for payment year 2021, which did not improve at the rate we had targeted. Unfortunately, these ratings were largely impacted by our Clinical Pharmacy results. However, with the successful transition to IngenioRx, we have refocused our organization with clear accountability and line of sight to deliver dramatically improved results going forward. We are absolutely committed to improving the percentage of our members in four star plans. Across the Anthem, we remain intensely focused on creating innovative, meaningful and affordable products and services for our customers, consumers and care provider partners. We continue to invest in digital capabilities and AI in order to create the kind of healthcare experience our consumers demand today. Our recently launched electronic personal health record is gaining traction. This unique tool is empowering consumers to be more engaged in healthcare decisions by supporting greater alignment and communication with their own care providers. We're excited about the launch of Sydney, our next generation consumer engagement platform. Sydney is delivering on our promise of a simpler, more personalized experience, giving consumers control over where and how they engage with us regarding their care, benefit coverage, their health and wellness goals and more. By leveraging data and AI, Sydney is providing a personalized healthcare experience tailored to each individual's unique needs, resulting and improved engagement and ultimately a lower total cost. Turning to 2020. In Commercial, we anticipate another solid year of both risk and fee based membership growth. In addition to the benefit of IngenioRx, we've deployed a broad portfolio of innovative products to meet our customers where they are. These include Anthem's recently announced chamber based association product along with the newly launched HealthSync high performing provider network, giving employers more affordable choices. We anticipate another strong year of national account growth. National account customers represent our most sophisticated buyers and our success is determined by our ability to deliver better quality at the lowest net cost with improved member satisfaction. Clinical programs, such as Total Health Total You, our integrated end-to-end digital-first clinical model, are exceeding expectations on this front. Since launching in January of this year, we've added one million members and expect to have approximately 2 million consumers in 2020. In Medicare Advantage, we're pleased to have grown enrollments by nearly 20% in 2019, and remain confident that we will continue to outpace the market for the fourth consecutive year, based on the value we deliver to seniors through our highly attractive plan design and supplemental benefits. We also anticipate continued growth in our group retiree business. For 2020, we're enhancing our supplemental benefit choices, which are highly valued by seniors and include areas such as transportation, caregiver support and nutritional education, to name just a few. These services are an addition to our already successful over the counter benefit in partnership with Walmart. Our efforts in this area are proving that Anthem's unique focus on whole person care is truly resonating with this important population. As you know, our Medicaid business is well positioned for robust membership and revenue growth in the year ahead. Our partnership in North Carolina is expected to go live in the first quarter, and will add approximately 400,000 members. Supplementing our strong organic growth, we look forward to working with our state partners to serve members in Missouri and Nebraska upon completion of the Centene WellCare transaction. Our commitment to sustainability also remains a key focus for our organization. With that, I'm pleased to share that Anthem was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the second year in a row during this quarter. This recognition acknowledges our commitment to responsibly address the challenges facing today's dynamic and ever evolving healthcare environment. At Anthem, our focus on culture and talent continues to serve as our foundation for success. We are enhancing talent across the organization to support our focus on growth and improve our performance execution. We're not satisfied and know we can and will do more to improve Anthem's impact across the healthcare system for those we serve. I will now pass the call over to John for a more detailed review of our third quarter financial performance before concluding our prepared remarks with our initial assessment of 2020. John? John Gallina : Thank you, Gail and good morning. As Gail stated, we reported solid third quarter financial results with adjusted earnings per share increasing 28% year-over-year to $4.87. Adjusted net income was $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 25% over the prior year. In total, our consolidated operating gain grew by more than 22% over the prior year quarter. During the second quarter we shared with our outlook for improved segment performance in the second half of the year. The government business grew operating gain by 35% in the quarter, while the commercial business grew by more 11% compared to the third quarter of 2018. As you can see, not only that we deliver on our commitments, we generated substantial double-digit growth in doing so. Operating revenue in the third quarter of 2019 was $26.4 billion, an increase of 15% versus the prior year quarter and 17% on a HIF-adjusted basis. With our updated outlook, we now expect full year operating revenue of approximately $103 billion with premium revenue now in the range of $94 billion to $95 billion. We are firmly on track to deliver our strongest year of organic operating revenue growth in over a decade. The increase in operating revenue during the quarter reflects strong enrollment growth in our risk-based businesses, as well as premium increases to cover overall cost trends. In addition, our results benefitted from revenue related to the launch of IngenioRx and the growth in our specialty and integrated clinical offerings. The medical loss ratio in the third quarter was 87.2%, representing an increase of 240 basis points over the prior year quarter. The increase was predominantly driven by the one year waver of the health insurer fee. In the quarter, reserves developed somewhat unfavorably, including favorable prior year development and unfavorable current your development. The unfavorable development totaled $50 million and was isolated to the commercial segment. This included a few large groups that we'll be terminating later this year. The magnitude of the impact is immaterial, representing only 0.5% of our full year benefit expense, but it did impact the medical loss ratio in the quarter. Overall, third quarter medical costs were well contained, and our local group medical costs trend is reaffirmed at our 6% plus or minus 50 basis points range. It is important to note that the Medicaid MLR improved on a sequential in year-over-year HIF-adjusted basis despite ongoing disenrollment. We continue to expect further margin stabilization. But given the magnitude of the Medicaid re-verification challenge we faced in 2019, our full year MLR is trending in the range of 86.5% to 86.8%. Our SG&A ratio was 12.9%, a decrease of 250 basis points compared to the prior quarter. The decrease reflects our historically strong top line growth, coupled with a one year waiver of the health insurer fee. For the full year, we now expect our SG&A ratio to be in the range of 13% to 13.3%. Turning to the balance sheet. Our debt-to-cap ratio was 40% at the end of the third quarter, which is consistent with our target range. During the third quarter, we successfully completed a debt offering to $2.5 billion at a weighted average coupon of 2.98% and a weighted average life of 15 years. I am especially pleased that our 10 and 30 year notes were issued at all time record lows. Efficient capital deployment and cost discipline remain top priority. Earlier this year at our Investor Day conference, we committed to an opportunistic capital deployment strategy focused on sustainable long term total shareholder return. So far this year, we have announced plans for two strategic acquisitions. One of which expands our footprint in Medicaid, while the other deepens our clinical expertise and managing specialized populations. Simply put, we're building our business and investing strategically. We also committed to a capital deployment plan that would be both flexible and balanced. After careful consideration of the market environment, we made the decision to accelerate our pace of share repurchases in the quarter, and take advantage of the broader market conditions. As a result, we repurchased 2.4 million shares during the third quarter at a weighted average price of $266.52, and we now expect the 2018 share count to be in the range of 260 million to 261 million shares. Total share buyback for the year is expected to be between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion subject to market conditions. Operating cash flow was $1.7 billion in the quarter or 1.4 times net income, signifying high earnings quality for the quarter and representing an increase of $1.1 billion compared to the third quarter of 2018. The increase was primarily driven by membership growth in our Medicaid and Medicare businesses. For the first nine months of the year, operating cash flow was $4.7 billion or a solid 1.2 times net income. As a result of our strong growth year-to-date and proactive efforts to better manage our cash and the timing of collections, we now expect operating cash flow for the full year to be greater than $5.5 billion. 2019 has been a productive year at Anthem. Despite the challenges we faced early on, we have made substantial progress, including the launch of IngenioRx, which is now expected to contribute at least $1 to full year adjusted earnings per share. As a result, we're raising our full year guidance and now expect our 2019 adjusted earnings per share to be greater than $19.40. We are fully committed to driving the lowest net cost of care for our members, while achieving greater diversification across our businesses. Both of which are reflected in our double digit top and bottom line growth targets. There is still one quarter left in 2019 and our focus is on driving sustainable long-term value and completing 2019 on our growth trajectory, enabling us to enter 2020 with positive momentum. And with that, I will now pass the call back over to Gail. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks, John. As you've heard throughout this morning, we are growing on all fronts. Our revenue growth is strong and we have made substantial progress in advancing our mission of driving higher quality care at the lowest net cost. As we begin to shift our focus to 2020, the headwinds that we faced are manageable with tailwinds that lay the foundation for compelling long-term growth, and far outweigh the impact from short term challenges. Our growth heading into 2020 is fueled by our commitment to precision and execution with an emphasis on sustainable value for our stakeholders. As is customary, we will provide more detailed outlook for 2020 on our fourth quarter earnings call, but our initial view of 2020 contemplates the following tailwinds; the full year impact from IngenioRx, margin improvement in Medicaid, overall 2019 and 2020 membership growth, increased penetration of specialty and clinical programs in our fee based businesses and accretion from capital deployment. These will be partially offset by margin normalization in the individual business, dilution from government contracts in Medicaid and growth in our group Medicare and the return of the health insurance fee. At this early stage, our view on 2020 would point to core adjusted earnings per share growth near the low end of our 12% to 15% target growth rate relative to our original 2019 guidance. We continue to expect IngenioRx will produce total operating gain of at least $800 million, or roughly $2.30 per share in 2020. We're on track for another year of historically strong revenue and earnings growth, and we look forward to building on our momentum in the year ahead. As I approach my second anniversary here at Anthem, I mean incredibly proud of them more than 60,000 associates who are living our mission, vision and values every day in service to those who trust us with their care. And with that, operator, we will open it up to questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe : Just hoping you could start with providing a little more details on the unfavorable reserve development within commercial. And I know you quantified the impact in the quarter. How much of that sort of fee reflects the higher MLR outlook for the year as well and any details around that? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks, Ralph. I'm going to ask Pete Haytaian to talk about our commercial business, which we feel very strongly about and then maybe John to tie up the overall MLR question. Pete Haytaian : As it relates to our Commercial fully insured business, earlier this year, we set out to do a couple things. Number one, to grow our membership and we want to improve our year-over-year operating performance. And I'd say with confidence that we've done both. Our year-over-year operating margins and performance has shown strong improvement. And you can see that through the release. In addition to that, we've seen solid membership growth. In fact, in our large group fully insured business, we've seen in nine of the last 12 months net sequential growth, so we feel really good about that. The in-year unfavorable development is really immaterial. We had a few large groups and being a blue. We have some large fully insured groups but we didn't have a meeting of the minds with, quite frankly. And so those groups are going to be moving on. And as it relates to our outlook Q4 and into 2020, we feel very comfortable with our fully insured business. John Gallina : And Ralph, this is John, thank you for the question. And I really appreciate the opportunity to provide a little bit of clarity. To be clear, Medicaid and more specifically the Medicaid verification process, is driving the entire increase in the increasing MLR guidance. And I'll just give you a couple proof points if you'd like them for your modeling and your information. In some states, re-verification efforts have minimal impact. But in others, we've seen disenrollment on the average of 2% with states going as high as 4% disenrollment. In those same states, if you review the statutory filings from the first six months of the year for us and our peers, you'll see that the MLRs associated with those remaining populations are up on average 3% year-over-year with some states being up as high as 5% year-over-year. And as we have told you in the prior quarter call, the re-verification has impacted a little over half of our states at this point in time. And if you just take that 3% times half our Medicaid block and apply it to our consolidated medical loss ratio, you'll see that the consolidated medical loss ratio will go up 50 basis points. And then just another quick proof point for your modeling purposes is we've made commentary that we're at the low end of our target margin ranges associated with Medicaid for the year associated with the lack of revenue on the re-verification, the time with the lack of revenue on re-verification. And the difference between the midpoint of our operating margin and the low end of our operating margin, if you apply those dollars again to the medical loss ratio, you'll see that it would drive the consolidated medical loss ratio by about 50 basis points. So both of these things are just proof points to show that the entire increase is associated with Medicaid and that the commercial issue, which was only 0.5% of annual benefit expense really didn't drive that guidance change. So thank you for the question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Just one numbers question here, and then I'll ask my actual. Obviously, a lot of focus on 2020. Just want to make sure I got the math right here. We start with around $18.20 of core EPS, that's the guide of $19 minus Ingenio coming into the year. And then add 12% to that and grow that by 12% gets us in the low 20s. And then we add back the entire Ingenio of $22.30, and you get somewhere between $22.50 and $22.60. So I know the range is going to be wider than that. But is that about the right math? Gail Boudreaux : In terms of -- we're not giving exact guidance. As you know, we're giving headwinds and tailwinds. But as you think about your math, I'd say you're in the ballpark clearly to what we articulated at our Investor Day this past spring, so yes. Justin Lake : And then my question was just a follow up on Medicaid. Specifically, I know you said things got better. So in the first half, you were running at the low end of your range, so let's say 2%. Can you give us an idea of what you are expecting to do in the back half of the year in Medicaid, back half of this year? And then how we should think about Medicaid into next year. What's in that 2020 number for a Medicaid margin just so we can kind of have a have a starting point. Thanks. John Gallina : The low end of the target margin range for Medicaid is where we actually expect us to be relatively close to for the entire year. But the second half is definitely going to be better than the first half in terms of 2019. And then in terms of 2020, we do expect ultimately to be in the target margin range associated with Medicaid. Unfortunately, the timing doesn't always work out perfectly and sometimes it can take 12 to 18 months to get the appropriate rates associated with our negotiations and sharing of information with our state partners. And so we clearly have expectation of improvement associated with Medicaid in 2020. But it's really premature to provide an exact percentage, or where we are exactly in the range at this point until we get to the point that we'll provide a lot more guidance metrics on the fourth quarter call. Gail Boudreaux : And let me just add to John's comments. I think, overall, in terms of Medicaid, we feel quite good about the conversations we're having. As he shared with you in terms of the re-verification and the data that we have, we're working very proactively with our states. And again, a lot of this comes down to timing and their cycles. But we feel quite good about what we've been able to achieve to date and also what we feel for 2020. So we're very positive about the overall Medicaid environment business going forward. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Just maybe to continue to trying to think about the 2020, what's in what's not. It sounds like you guys were assuming again the public exchange business normalizes margin. I know you had an assumption of a declining margin for three years in a row and continue to outperform it. Is that just conservatives or do you know something that would suggest that that's going to moderate? And then in Ingenio, it sounds like you're assuming that you got the same upside that you had originally forecast in terms of gain. It sounds like things have gone at least as well if not a little better. Is there any chance of upside there? And then finally, the Medicaid just to follow-on on that question, are you -- when you talk about what\u2019s the margin for next year and what's assumed in that number. Is that only what you have realized so far in terms of true ups, or are there more true ups that are potentially on the table that you haven't yet realized that would be potential upside? Gail Boudreaux : So thanks for the multitude and multi-faceted question, A. J., I think you hit most of our businesses. So let me start with John and have him address the first part of it and we'll see if we can get through it. Thank you. John Gallina : So yes, we do expect normalization of individual margins in 2020. And just as a frame of reference, in 2016 and 2017, we performed essentially at a breakeven basis in that line of business. We never really lost money on the exchanges but it was essentially breakeven. And then we reduced our footprint quite dramatically in 2018 by some 65% and walked away from almost a million members and had extremely successful 2018, and are having a very good 2019. We expect the margins to moderate in 2019 and they have, but not quite as quickly as we had assumed. And then you get into 2020, while the way that the MLR rebate rules work is it's based on a three year rolling average. And so the 2017, and '18, '19 rebates would have had the prior information in them with when we were much larger. And then you get to 2020 and we've got three fairly good years assuming that we hit our target margin ranges for 2020. And so that\u2019s going to actually limit the ability to have incremental upside. Gail Boudreaux : In terms of IngenioRx, first of all, we were really pleased with the way the transition has gone and the migration of our members. As you saw, we up our guidance and that's really a result of both strong operational execution, but also greater certainty now when we first gave it. We didn't know exactly when our state approvals would occur in Medicaid and commercial and now obviously, that we have certainty on. And again as I shared in my opening remarks really strong execution of the migration, probably one of the most complex migrations that has happened in the space, so we're really pleased about that. And we feel very good going into 2020 that all of our businesses will now be on that platform. And we can use our integrated capabilities and the digital things that we advanced over the last year. So thank you very much for the question. And next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ricky Goldwasser : A couple of questions here, so just first a follow up on the unfavorable reserve development that you saw in the commercial business, I understand that that\u2019s immaterial to the bottom line and not going to have an impact in the fourth quarter. But can you talk little bit about what you're seeing in terms of the competitive marketplace and how competitors are responding to the fact that you now have just better economics and ability to provide more affordable offerings? So that is question one. And second of all, if you can give us any early read now that the Medicare for 2020 plans are out there, how do you see the landscape and opportunities compared to before and anything that surprised you? Gail Boudreaux : We are going to try to limit to one question. I know we're getting multiple, but we'd ask that we would just wanted to one question. And let me ask, Pete, first to comment on the commercial marketplace competitive. Pete Haytaian : Yes, I think as it relates to our fully insured business, it remains a competitive marketplace, it remains a rational marketplace. We're real excited about our positioning. We've talked before about our segment positioning and our product portfolio, and the options that we're creating in the marketplace. And we are seeing an uptick there in terms of performance. And we continue to see growth, as I mentioned before, nine out of the last 12 months, we've seen net positive growth. One thing that we are seeing in the marketplace today and that is with the addition of Ingenio and other capabilities that we have. We are seeing in other markets have a bit of inertia little bit more than we expected. And what I mean by that is retention rates are really, really strong for us and for our competitors. Our sales close ratios are improving, and that has to do with our sales effectiveness, and we feel really good about all that. But we are seeing a little bit less movement in the marketplace, a little bit more stickiness with the membership. And so little bit slower rates of uptake. But other than that, we feel really good about our positioning in the fully insured marketplace going into 2020. Gail Boudreaux : And I guess what I would just add to Pete's comments. I mean, we've had really solid growth. We think it's a disciplined market. It's always been competitive. We were very happy with the solid retention rates we're seeing. And we've invested quite heavily in that business, both in product offerings. So we feel well positioned for 2020 with a variety of affordable options, particularly in our small business area. And as I shared, we're seeing great traction in our largest clients who are really our most sophisticated and are really valuing the innovation that we brought to the market. So overall, as Pete said, it's a very, very -- we feel very strongly about the commercial business right now. And maybe Felicia Norwood can address the Medicare question you had as well. Felicia Norwood : Sure Gail, thank you. And Ricky, thank you for the question. We feel very good about our positioning in terms of our portfolio on the Medicare side as we head into AEP. As you know, we're about what day nine into this, but the feedback has been incredibly positive from our distribution channel and our brokers. In 2019, as you know, we were one of the first plans carriers to really make a strong investment and supplemental benefits. We believe that these are some of the most differentiating characteristics in the market with respect to our seniors. And we've seen great receptivity to the benefits that we have out there. This is particularly true with respect to our over the counter benefits with Walmart, which has brought great cost advantage and affordability to seniors. So as we head out into AEP, the competitive positioning is strong. We've enhanced our supplemental benefits offering this year as well. So we are very bullish about our expectations with respect to the 2020 selling season in Medicare. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbck : Maybe just following up on that Ingenio and the Commercial market, but maybe a broader question across all of the products, with the savings that you got for 2020. How much of that benefit did you flow through immediately into 2020? Just trying to get a sense of, was 2020 your fully updated view on pharmacy costs, and the growth that you guys or will get in 2020 is kind of reflective of what that new base is or did you -- because of the transition or for whatever reason you kind of slowly build that into the pricing so that we should expect a multiyear benefit from your membership? And did you treat Medicare or Medicaid -- or Commercial any differently, as you thought about pricing and that benefit through to the customers and the pace of that timing? John Gallina : Sure. Thanks, Kevin. This is John. And if I understand your question properly, the benefit in 2020 is we know that the value that we're obtaining from Ingenio is approximately $4 billion, actually slightly greater than $4 billion versus what we have would have paid on with our prior carrier. And that we're going to take 20% of that and drop to the bottom line, which is the $800 million that was part of Gail's prepared comments, which is $2.30 of EPS. And then the $3.2 billion is being baked into either benefit design or more affordable pricing, or other options that flow straight to the customer. In terms of the timing of all that, we really did not let any of that assumptions go through in 2019. 2019 for the majority of the year, we're still under the ESI contract and the pricing that we have with our book really did represent the pricing of the pharmacy costs that we're employing. So don't over read into or overanalyze the 2019 versus 2020. The Ingenio is providing about $1 in '19 and it's going to provide about $2.30 in benefit in 2020, and that $2.30 is now run rate. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tanal from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Steve Tanal : I think unfavorable development sort of situation seems like an isolated issue. But it sounds like you wouldn't have had a favorable development on the commercial business, excluding the large group you mentioned. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but that's sort of the message that I feel like we're hearing. And so I guess typically, we'd expect some favorable development. So just looking for any color you could provide and the balance of the business. And is your view of sort of local group trend at this point that has sort of accelerated through the first nine months of the year, realizing you reiterated your outlook. But any color maybe and where you might land in the range? So that could be helpful as well. John Gallina : In terms of the development, we did have favorable prior development. The development that we referenced was current year in-year we usually don't talk about that. But since it was -- it did impact the MLR slightly and it certainly had impacted the commercial operating gains where Commercial grew 11% quarter-over-quarter, Commercial expanded their margins by three tenth of a percent quarter-over-quarter and that was in spite of this negative development. So really what it points to is the fact that the commercial business is even stronger than it may appear initially. But we did have favorable prior year development. We certainly have a consistent conservative reserving methodology that we will expect to employ. Gail Boudreaux : I guess, I would add to John's comments that our commercial growth is very solid, and we have very healthy margins. And I think as you look at our margins overall, we feel very good about commercial business. And again, the amount of reserve development is fairly minor but we felt that we would point it out. And I think exactly as Pete addressed that that's really the driver. So we wanted to give you some clarity on that. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Matt Borsch : I was hoping you could maybe give us a sense of how things look as you're going into January 1 in terms of -- I'm not looking for guidance for the year, just start a sense on the January 1 national account changes and how you think you did it in that process, and whether the very strong retention rates that you referenced earlier. Is that playing out in that market as well? Gail Boudreaux : I'll let Pete address that question. Pete Haytaian : We're obviously in the late innings. We're sort of in the ninth inning of the selling season. As it relates to 2020, there's some minor puts and takes but it's almost complete. And we feel very good about our positioning and our results. We had a good year this year. And going into 2020, we think we're going to have a very strong year as well from a growth perspective and a retention perspective. Most importantly, and as Gail pointed out in her prepared remarks, we feel really good about our value proposition and how that's playing out in the marketplace. Things like our total value story and clinical programs and advocacy programs like Total Health Total You, which we've just recently launched with differentiated AI capabilities and care management capabilities, already have over 1.2 million members in that program. We feel really good about our consumer engagement platform and the work that we've done historically through Engage and now we've launched and rolled out the new Sydney digital platform and ecosystem. And our Anthem Health Guide from an advocacy perspective really, really performing well and resonating in the marketplace with over 8 million members in that with MPS scores that continuing to improve. So our value proposition is playing out in the market. We will have a strong Q1 with respect to growth in our national business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Peter Costa :  [Technical Difficulty] on the commercial development -- unfavorable development. What exactly caused the unfavorable development? Was it a provider specifically that was higher cost? Was it a product type higher cost? Was it some geography? I'd love to drill down and understand what exactly caused that. I know you said its couple of accounts, but I want to understand more. John Gallina : That's not the type of information for competitive reasons that we're really going to go into on this call, especially given the fact that those accounts have terminated once we determine what actuarially justified rate increases would be. I'd just say that we understand what the causes were. We priced the forward trend. We feel very comfortable that this issue has been taken care of. And we feel very bullish about our aspects. But we really can't get into the level of granularity for competitive reasons that you're talking about. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : I just want to go back to the really strong government operating income growth, which is up 35% year-over-year. And when we initially saw that number this morning, we presumed some of the retro price increases for the acuity mix really had come through and driven that. But it's not what you cited in the release. You said still costs primarily things like cost performance and on the call you\u2019d said still what you're getting from states in terms of rates was not quite as good, or as you had anticipated. So I just wanted to understand that were there not material benefits from some of this acuity true ups happening in the quarter, and if it's not what was really the sources of cost performance? Gail Boudreaux : Well, thank you very much for the question. I think there's certainly a couple of things embedded in that question. The first is that 2018 was well, as you think about the comparative from 2018 to 2019 and as you go back to our call in that quarter. So you're comparing, I think, quite frankly, a below baseline 2018. So there isn't anything unusual in this quarter for 2019 in our government business. We have made a lot of progress on getting the rates that match the population. So we feel really good about that. But as you know, this is a complex business with geographies and a population mix. And so we still feel that there's a lot of runway and we're having those conversations in our states. And we are making progress and we are seeing it flow through, but we didn't have a giant retro payment or anything of that sort to point to in this quarter, but we did see improvement in rates and we are seeing improvement in the overall management of the business. So I guess the summary answer to the question is the comparison. We like where we're heading but we also believe we have a lot more runway and the conversations are quite productive with our states. And we do feel confident. But again, we can't absolutely predict timing. Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : So just on the topic of Medicaid membership, over and above the shifting of Medicaid enrollees into commercial plans that's been talked about previously. I guess, I'm just curious if you can comment on the public charge rule that could create some extra volatility around Medicaid enrollment. And in light of some federal courts and joining the rules, do you think beyond just the notion this could still be material for Anthem either in late '19 and into 2020? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : I'll ask Felicia to comment. Felicia Norwood : In terms of the public charged rule, we haven't seen a material impact on our business year-to-date. However, the rule is still pending. We will continue to monitor this with our state partners. And certainly because of the unknowns, we are cautiously optimistic that we're going to be able to work closely with our partners as individuals are going through this process. This in some respect is akin to some of the things you see with respect to re-verification. And one of the things that we've been able to do with our state partners is to try to understand early on individuals who have been impacted or maybe impacted, and have an opportunity to work with individuals to maintain their eligibility. So thus far we haven't seen a material impact in our business. But as I said, it's still early. So we will continue to monitor this and work closely with our state partners throughout this process. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Lance Wilkes : Could you talk a little bit about the partnership strategy with the other blues that are out there? And what you're seeing as far as progress in Medicaid joint ventures, Medicare Advantage, cross sales and specialty? And do the other blues have any sort of changed perspective or greater sense of urgency in any of this given the political dialog and concepts like public option, et cetera? Gail Boudreaux : As you know, we shared that we are working quite closely with our blue partners across a variety of opportunities. And we're very pleased with partnerships that we have in Medicaid. We have eight alliances today. Five are with our fellow Blue Cross Blue Shield partners. We're also adding additional partnerships. We're adding a Medicare partnership in Louisiana. And we're adding a partnership in Maine with the Maine Health System. So it's broader than just the blues. I know your question was more specific to the blues. As you saw, we announced that Blue Cross of Idaho will be an IngenioRx customers. So there's another great example. So more broadly, I think we have a broad array of capabilities, both through Medicaid but also through our diversified business group. Our AIMS business and our CareMore businesses work across the spectrum. North Carolina is a great example where we are doing a partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina for Medicaid. Our CareMore business will be building clinics in that environment as well and then IngenioRx will be the PBM. So to me that offers a really great glimpse of the ability to package things across the Blue. In terms of overall I think as a system, we're intensely focused on affordability and cost and access for the one in three Americans that we serve across Blue Cross Blue Shield plans. And I think you saw hopefully many of the Medicare focus and advertising that the Blue Cross Blue Shield brand this past year. So I think what you're seeing is that we recognize the rule we have in the American healthcare system. And by working together, we can do a lot more to have an impact on the system. So thanks very much for the question, but we're very -- quite frankly bullish and excited about the opportunities that as a Blue system, the impact that we can have across America. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Just to piggyback on the one that Gary asked earlier, if we think about the expected Medicaid margin improvements in 2020, how much of that is dependent upon the risk for acuity adjustments coming through? And John, I think you talked a little bit about the timing of those tending normally 12 to 18 months, so that would kind of coincide with it kind of seeing the issue in Q2 of next year and it's starting to roll through into 2020. And I'd say just, am I thinking about that right? John Gallina : In terms of exactly how much is related to the re-verification, well it's certainly a piece of it. But just to be clear, every year, we go through with actuarially justified rates and have rate renewals like rate renewals and negotiations with our states. And so obviously, hitting our target margins requires getting from our portfolio of states that we have of getting the right rates on an overall basis. Clearly, part of that conversation is around re-verification, but that's not the entirety of the conversation. The conversation is really about actuarially justified rates based on the acuity of the population regardless what the starting point is. So in one regard, getting the right rates is the entire issue but it's not just re-verification. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : A question around the Medicare advantage starts, I know you mentioned in your prepared remarks that there's a focus on improvement, et cetera. And as we kind of look through the metrics, it looked like drug experience, drug safety categories like that were the ones that show the biggest decline. So I know there's a huge delay and so as Ingenio kind of ramps up in '19 and into '20. Is there an opportunity you think to improve things for next year, or is this going to be a multiyear sort of fix? And as you guys dug in, are there certain metrics that you think you can control shorter term around the MA starts? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : As you can -- you've clearly identified some of the areas that we've focused on as well. In terms of your question, as I said, we are disappointed in the results. And we've dug in very deeply to figure out where we can have an impact. Last year, we did make an impact in moving one of our largest contracts, our four-star with that intention and focus. But we know this year part of the issue was just the timeliness of data and our ability to have an impact on some of members in those clinical pharmacy plans now that we remove, we will be moving our entire Medicare advantage business on one-one. We're already very engaged and having an impact. So yes, we do believe we can have an impact, not only on clinical but we also believe in some of the other metrics where we did make improvements on HEDIS, for example, in many of our markets we still have opportunities there with better data and the integration of the data that I shared with you earlier. And then certainly in some of the consumer metrics, we feel that as part of our end-to-end focus on execution across our businesses that there is opportunity there. So yes, we absolutely believe we can have an impact. On pharmacy, now owning pharmacy 100% under our own control, we really do believe that will be a multiyear opportunity for us to dramatically expand that. So you hit the core. But as we look at our results this year, the biggest disappointment was in those clinical pharmacy results, which declined. So thank you very much for the question. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Thanks. Question just is on group Medicare Advantage. And if you can just update us on margins on the class of 2019 business are progressing relative to plan. And then relative to 2020, I know that you've talked about expected continued growth in group MA essentially. But if you can maybe help sort of size that, or just sort of how that's trending relative to the long-term trajectory that you provided for us at Investor Day? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : I'll have, Pete, share some perspective on the group Medicare market. Pete Haytaian : Thanks, Scott. Appreciate the question. As you know, we saw some really nice growth in 2019 in the group retiree business, and we do expect growth to continue into 2020. As we said before and we're seeing this come through, our greatest opportunity continues to be with respect to our inherent pipeline of existing commercial clients that have Medicare wrapped product. And so we're seeing really strong sales there. As it relates to new store sales and RFPs, the market continues to be really competitive. And we do win some business there as well. But we're also looking at creating new opportunities. So the question was asked before about Blue partnerships, and we see this as another wonderful opportunity for Blue partnerships and we're actually exploring those. And then finally I'd say having a competitive pharmacy benefit will certainly help in 2020 and beyond as it relates to upcoming bids and group retirees. So overall, we feel good that we'll continue to see growth in that space. John Gallina : And that business is dilutive when we first say it takes 12 to 18 months of dilution. And so it continues to be a headwind until we get the block of business to an appropriate level. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dave Windley : Josh asked my earlier question, I'm going to ask a follow on to that. I'm thinking about this MA starts and improving net investments and quality. As you think about the $3.2 billion that you have to essentially reinvest in the business. How would you, if you'd be so kind as to tell us. How would you think about allocating that between the benefit design and price point references that I think John gave earlier and then how much would quality investments like stars consume of the $3.2 billion? Gail Boudreaux : Well, we haven't broken it down in that way. And I guess as we think about this, we're investing heavily in pharmacy, just so you know. I mean, it's not just the benefit of the impact of the earnings that we get because of the lower cost of goods sold, which is really driving that 4 billion that is fundamentally a lower cost of goods sold. But as part of bringing IngenioRx up to speed and the migration, we've built a new integrated specialty clinical service center, which has areas of excellence around these areas that I think will absolutely help our clinical performance and pharmacy. And again, we know what we need to do. And we have a very clear line of sight around what the opportunities are in pharmacy. And we feel very confident in our ability to have an impact on those. As you think more broadly about pharmacy, I think John has shared with you how we're approaching the $3.2 billion, and it's very different based on each of our lines of business and where we were competitively and how that aligns with plan designs, et cetera. So it's not a straight line formula. But clearly, pharmacy gives us a tailwind as our opportunity in Medicare Advantage and helps us offset some of this impact from stars. Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Sarah James : Thank you. I was hoping you could talk about the DBG selling process beyond Ingenio. Just wondering how long the selling process is to better understand how strong the line of sight is into near term sales and some conversations so far. Do you have a sense of what the near term product mix could look like over the next couple of years? Gail Boudreaux : I think broadly as you think about any group of services businesses, the selling cycles very much vary. Our end AIMS business has been in the market for a very long period of time. Aspire has a very mature sales cycle. And CareMore also is working as part of very much, not just the integrations that we mentioned and the partnerships we have but they've been actively talking to our Blue partners about areas where they can help. So it isn't a definite. But I'd say generally, as you think about pharmacy, it's 12 to 18 months at least lead time. As you think about large scale projects bringing up a new CareMore sites, you're usually talking nine months plus in terms of the procurement and the discussion. AIM is a shorter sale off, because we can deal with closer capabilities and we're really excited about bring Beacon into the family in the fourth quarter, because we also believe that provide some really unique capabilities. So overall as we've shared our diversified service business is a growing business. It's something over the next three to four years you're going to see much more significant traction. But quite frankly, we are seeing progress in sales already and we feel really good about that. But I would say at least 12 to 18 months is a lead time in terms of the conversations and the procurement just given these are fairly large sale that we're talking to people about. But thank you very much for the question, and we're very much looking forward to sharing more about DBG as we go forward. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Newshel from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Michael Newshel : For exchanges in 2020, can you frame the magnitude of any geographic re-expansion of your planning, and whether that kind of revenue growth could be any meaningful offset to the margin normalization you talked about? Gail Boudreaux : Pete, please? Pete Haytaian : We're pleased with our individual performance and progress. And I think our strategy really remains the same with respect to expansion where we're disciplined and we're targeted in terms of where we play. We've talked about this before but it's been largely based upon geographies where we can partner with key providers at the right economics and in partnership on delivering really strong cost of care, partnering with providers and being aligned on risk adjustment. And in many instances, we're focused on obviously leveraging our value based care relationships. And of course then importantly, we have to be positioned well with respect to our product and being number one and number two as it relates to the right product. And this has translated into good results for us as we talked about earlier, bit better than expected. As we continue down this path in 2020, we're continuing to target expansions. We do see pockets where competitively some of our competitors are little bit better positioned. And if that's the case, we're going to remain disciplined and we're not going to participate in those markets in which we can't do what I said before, and that is partner with providers and have the most competitive product. So we feel like we're continuing down the path of being very methodical and thoughtful about that business, and we'll continue to grow that business in the right way. Operator : And your final question today comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Just to clarify earlier some of your comments, John, around -- and Gail around the commercial business, these few accounts I know you didn't want to get too much into it. But the reason for termination, it sounds like you're saying is because when you re-price the business for them, those rates were just didn't match up with what I guess clients had wanted. But did that factor in also what expect to say that you would have been able to generate for them through Ingenio? And just to be clear that this shouldn't have any impact on how your commercial book is pricing for next year? Gail Boudreaux : Well, let me start and then I'll ask John to follow up. First, in terms of the last part of your question, no, we feel really strongly. I mean, we reaffirmed our trend. We feel very strongly about our book of business. And the commercial business is performing. Our margins are good. They're improving. And honestly outside of even just risk, we're adding a lot more specialty products and bringing through revenue in our clinical products. So overall, no, you shouldn't read into anything about our commercial business. In terms of your second question, maybe I'll have John answer that one, because I don't think that there is much more to add. John Gallina : In terms of the impact on the overall commercial book, really there is not any. Our prior guidance did assume that these members would stay with us for the rest of the year. So it was a difficult decision. So there'll be a slight impact on our year end membership. However, associated with our pricing, with our growth outlooks, with our competitive position and each of our markets, there is really no change. We feel very good about our commercial business strategy and the ability for Pete and the team to execute that. And think that 2020 is going to be another growth year for us. So thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you very much for all of your questions. And I'd like to thank everyone for hanging in there this morning while we dealt with the phone issues, but we're happy that we were able to address all of your questions and still get everyone through the line. As you can see, we remain committed to delivering a simple, more affordable and personalized experience for those we serve. And I look forward to building on our momentum in 2020. I want to thank our associates for their ongoing commitment to serving our nearly 41 million members. And I look forward to speaking with all of you again soon. Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Please, go ahead. Chris Rigg : Good morning and welcome to Anthem's fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. This is Chris Rigg, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of our Commercial & Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division. Gail will begin the call by giving an overview of our fourth quarter financial results, followed by comments on our key business initiatives and enterprise-wide growth priorities. John will then discuss our key financial metrics in greater detail and review our 2020 financial guidance. We will then be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Boudreaux : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Anthem's fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. In 2019, Anthem delivered strong top and bottom line growth across the enterprise. We achieved record organic top line growth of 13% and we had our best year of organic risk-based membership growth in over a decade. At our Investor Day last March, we talked about this being a new era for Anthem, one focused on growth, innovation and the transformation of healthcare, as we know it. We also committed to long-term revenue growth of 10% to 12% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% to 15%. 10 months later, we delivered on our commitments and we are poised for another year of success in 2020. In the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP earnings per share of $3.62 and adjusted earnings per share of $3.88. For the full year, we delivered GAAP earnings per share of $18.47 and adjusted earnings per share of $19.44, up 22% versus the prior year. Our 2020 adjusted earnings per share guidance of greater than $22.30 represents core growth near the upper end of our long-term guidance range when normalized to the impact of the health insurer fee beginning in 2021. We also expect another strong year of revenue growth over 13% on a reported basis and nearly 12% on a HIF-adjusted basis. On January 1st of this year, we successfully completed the IngenioRx migration, transitioning more than 15 million people over the past eight months. The launch of IngenioRx is a key milestone in the realization of our strategy to integrate pharmacy with medical and behavioral health as part of whole person care. The success of our accelerated migration will allow us to deliver greater health care value and increased transparency to the people we serve. At Investor Day, we also shared our goal of reducing our number of technology platforms from six to two by the end of 2022. Today, I am pleased to share that we are well on our way and expect to have 80% of our consumers on their destination platform by the end of this year. By reengineering our business processes and simplifying our technology infrastructure, we are driving greater operating performance and we're making it easier to do business with Anthem. We remain committed to keeping health care affordable and slowing health care spending growth. By partnering with care providers through value-based care arrangements and by empowering consumers with the information they need to take an active role in their own health and wellness. Today, Anthem has more than 60% of medical spend tied to value-based care arrangements with 32% in upside downside risk arrangements, creating greater alignment of cost quality, while delivering improved health outcomes. Total Health, Total You, our integrated end-to-end digital first clinical model now serves more than two million consumers since its introduction in 2018. Using both AI and machine learning to engage members with emerging risks, Total Health, Total You had delivered a nearly 12% reduction in hospital admissions and a reduction in emergency room visits of more than 10% to date. In our Commercial business, we improved sales effectiveness and strengthened how we work with our distribution partners through investments in our front-end broker portal and sales management technology. We added valuable digital capabilities that make it easier for our broker partners to do business with us. Our integrated tools are helping to ensure that our distribution partners can seamlessly sell and renew Anthem's medical and specialty businesses. Our focus on upgrading talent and improving sales execution helped us deliver one of our strongest overall commercial membership growth performances in more than a decade while maintaining our pricing discipline. Sales of specialty benefits, pharmacy solutions and clinical programs exceeded expectations in 2019 with specialty products growing by more than one million members and at a rate faster than our medical membership. Overall, fee based profitability is increasing and we are well on our way to narrowing the profit gap between risk based and fee based members from five to one to three to one. Shifting to our Government Business, we recognize that social and environmental factors are intrinsically tied to a person's health. Among all social barriers, food and security is the most pervasive, affecting one in eight Americans. Since its inception 20 years ago, the Anthem Foundation has been fighting food and security and our impact is being felt across the country. Because of our efforts, Anthem is one of only 50 companies and the only national healthcare company to be deemed a leadership partner by Feeding America, the nation's largest domestic hunger relief organization. Our focus on service and positively impacting our local communities continues to be a hallmark of our culture at Anthem. In Medicaid, despite facing challenges with changing risk pool, as a result of enrollment reverification throughout the first half of 2019, the second half of the year was strong and our state business ended the year in line with expectations. We continued our strong track record of winning more than 80% of Medicaid procurements in 2019. And we continue to see an $80 billion pipeline of opportunity over the long term. And as we announced last week, we were pleased to welcome two new Medicaid health plans into Anthem. The new plans in Missouri and Nebraska allow us to expand our industry-leading specialized care to more than 300,000 new consumers bringing our full Medicaid reach to a total of 23 states in the District of Columbia. During the year, Medicare Advantage enrollment grew by more than 20%, outpacing the market and in line with our guidance. As of year-end, we are now the fourth largest individual Medicare Advantage plan in the nation. Our steady momentum is carrying over into 2020, as we saw solid growth during the annual enrollment period and we expect our membership growth rate to continue to lead the industry for the fourth year in a row. Similar to 2019, our growth is tied to our strong brand recognition among seniors along with our robust supplemental offerings which are unmatched in the industry. Our essential extras benefit is highly valued by seniors, as it provides coverage for services such as healthy food delivery, transportation, home assistance, alternative medicine and more. Additionally, our over-the-counter benefit continues to be valued by this important population. Sales of Medicare Part D also accelerated during the recent annual enrollment period, reflecting our improved pharmacy cost structure enabling us to compete more effectively. We are entering 2020 with confidence in our ability to drive growth, reduce costs and create meaningful change within the overall health care system. Our business expectations include robust membership growth of 1.1 million members at the midpoint of our guidance, driven by growth in both risk and fee-based membership. Despite the return of the health insurer fee in 2020, we anticipate stable commercial risk-based membership a significant improvement compared to the decline experienced in 2018, the last time the HIF returned. We expect growth to continue in our specialty businesses at a pace similar to 2019, in addition to delivering strong clinical program and pharmacy benefit sales. Medicaid membership is expected to grow in the 400,000 member range, excluding the implementation of the North Carolina contract, which is likely to be delayed until 2021. Once again, we expect Medicare Advantage membership to surpass the industry growth rate and increase by 150,000 to 200,000 in both individual and group Medicare Advantage. We will also continue to invest in digital technologies and innovations to enhance engagement with the people we serve and to achieve our goal of making healthcare simpler, more affordable and more effective. Our innovative Sydney application provides wellness incentive packages, health and wellness content, telehealth services and full integration with our electronic health record. Interest in this new digital tool has been strong, with more than 625,000 downloads since its launch last October. In addition, LiveHealth Online, our easy-to-use telehealth solution, grew by nearly 40% over the prior year, giving people greater flexibility over where and how they receive care. And finally, Anthem's focus on social responsibility and sustainability continues to gain national attention. We were pleased to be included on Fortune's List of Most Admired Companies again this year and recognized by Bloomberg on their list of companies exemplifying gender equality. And now, I'll turn it over to John Gallina for a detailed look at our performance numbers. John? John Gallina : Thank you, Gail, and good morning. As Gail stated, we are pleased to report strong fourth quarter and full year financial results and are well positioned for robust growth in 2020. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $3.88, up 59% year-over-year. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share was $19.44, representing growth of 22% over 2018. 2019 was a year of major milestones at Anthem. As Gale mentioned earlier, we successfully launched IngenioRx on an accelerated and compressed time line with minimal customer abrasion. After adjusting for the benefit from IngenioRx, which contributed a little more than $1 to our full year results, earnings grew at the upper end of our 12% to 15% target range. Simply put, our core business is solid and we are delivering real growth across each of our segments. Total operating revenue in the fourth quarter was $27.1 billion, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter. This increase in operating revenue was driven by membership growth in our risk-based businesses, premium increases to cover overall trends, revenue related to the launch of IngenioRx and increased penetration of our specialty and integrated clinical offerings. For the full year, operating revenue grew nearly 13% or 15% on a HIF-adjusted basis, coming in solidly above our 10% to 12% target range. Overall, the fourth quarter medical loss ratio was 89%, representing an increase of 220 basis points over the prior year, which, as expected was primarily driven by the one-year waiver of the health insurer fee. The remaining drivers of the medical loss ratio coming in at the high end of our expectations included the fact that with our excellent results in the individual business, we reduced our risk adjuster position by $50 million and the flu season started earlier than normal, resulting in more flu costs than expected in the fourth quarter. Medical costs continued to be well-maintained and in line with our expectations. And our Local Group medical cost trend approximated 6% for the year. The SG&A expense ratio in the fourth quarter was 12. 9%, a decline of 260 basis points over the prior year, driven by a robust double-digit top line growth combined with the one-year waiver of the health insurer fee along with our continued focus on operational efficiency. Turning to the balance sheet. The debt-to-cap ratio was 39.5% at the end of 2019 consistent with our target range. During the quarter, we took advantage of weakness in our stock price and repurchased 1.2 million shares at a weighted average price of $260.87. In total, we repurchased approximately $1.7 billion of stock in 2019 or 6.3 million shares consistent with our guidance provided last quarter. Full year operating cash flow was $6.1 billion, reflecting 58% growth over 2018. Operating cash flow exceeded expectation through the year coming in well above our previous outlook of greater than $5.5 billion and was primarily driven by growth in our government businesses. Our full year operating cash flow at 1.3 time\u2019s net income illustrates the high quality of earnings in 2019. Now to our 2020 guidance. Before I begin, it is important to note that our 2020 guidance includes the acquisitions of the Missouri and Nebraska Medicaid plans that closed last week, but does not include the pending acquisition of Beacon, which we now expect to close later in the first quarter. We are also closing on the TPA acquisition that will enhance Anthem's already strong capabilities in the large group segment. Anthem is already the largest customer of this TPA but that acquisition will increase our self-funded membership by 200,000 and is already included in our membership guidance. As Gail stated earlier, total medical membership is expected to reach 42.1 million members at the guidance midpoint or a growth of 1.1 million members. In 2020, we expect operating revenue to grow over 13% to approximately $117 billion, reflecting premium rate increases to cover overall cost trends and the return of the health insurer fee, as well as membership growth and the full year impact from the launch of IngenioRx. The consolidated medical loss ratio is expected to be 85.8% plus or minus 50 basis points, a decrease of 100 basis points at the midpoint and largely driven by the return of the health insurer fee. The MLR is further impacted by changing business mix, where the Government Business continues to be the faster-growing portion of our business, including the Missouri and Nebraska Medicaid acquisitions and margin normalization in the individual business. These headwinds are partially offset by improved Medicaid performance. As a result of our improved pharmacy cost structure with the launch of IngenioRx, coupled with medical cost management initiatives, we expect our local group medical cost trend to be in the range of 4% plus or minus 50 basis points. The SG&A expense ratio is expected to be 12.8%, plus or minus 30 basis points, primarily due to growth in operating revenue and reduced spending related to the IngenioRx migration. Looking to below the line, we project investment income of $970 million and interest expense of $815 million. The tax rate is expected to be in the range of 24% to 26%, with the increase primarily driven by the return of the non-deductible health insurer fee in 2020. Full year operating cash flow is expected to be greater than $6.4 billion, contributing to another year of quality earnings. Our long-term capital deployment targets are unchanged and we remain committed to delivering sustainable long-term shareholder returns. Anthem has increased its dividend every year since it began paying dividends and we have done so again in 2020, increasing our dividend by nearly 19%. We expect full year share repurchases of at least $1.5 billion and our weighted average share count to end the year in the range of 255 million to 257 million shares outstanding. The permanent repeal of the health insurer fee beginning in 2021 represents a significant step forward in improving the affordability of healthcare and is consistent with our commitment to driving the lowest net cost of care for our members. With that said, our full year 2020 outlook now incorporates a total health insurer fee-related headwind of approximately $0.80, of which approximately $0.50 have been included in our prior commentary. We now expect full year adjusted earnings per share of greater than $22.30, which includes a benefit of $2.30 related to the full year contribution from IngenioRx and the incremental headwind from the repeal of the health insured tax beginning in 2021. This level of earnings represents growth of over 40% since 2018. Finally, it is important to keep in mind that the seasonality of earnings and key financial metrics will be impacted by a number of factors this year. The first half of 2020 will benefit from the IngenioRx contribution, which was immaterial to the financial results in the first half of 2019. In addition, leap day and the number of workdays in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019 will increase the HIF-adjusted MLR by nearly 100 basis points with the impact reversing the rest of the year. Further, majority of the margin normalization in the individual business will occur in the first half of the year, whereas, the improvement in Medicaid will be more evenly distributed throughout the year. Taken together, we expect first half earnings will approximate 55% of the full year total with a little more than half of that coming in the first quarter. In total, 2020 will be another strong year. And with that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go to Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks. Good morning. I just want to go to back to the MLR and the commentary there. You came in obviously at the higher end of the range that you had raised in 3Q. I know you mentioned the risk adjuster maybe visibility on what you got details there. And then the medical cost growth for 2020, obviously, the 4% plus or minus 50 basis points, obviously, aided by the Ingenio savings. But maybe if you can exclude that and maybe help how you see core trends for comparability in 2020 versus the 6% that you cited for 2019? John Gallina : Yeah. Hi, good morning Ralph and this is John. Thank you for the question. In terms of the 2019 medical loss ratio, we did end the year at 86.8%, which was within the guidance range that had been previously provided. We certainly would have been below the high end of the range had it not been for a couple of non-recurring issues that serve to increase the ratio at the end of the year. First, with the exceptional performance we've had in our individual business and after reviewing the weekly information and doing our own analysis, we did reduce our risk adjusted position by $50 million. That goes through as a negative to the MLR. It increases MLR when you do things like that. And then the flu season, it began earlier than anticipated. And so there's more flu cost in 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2019 that had been anticipated. So, obviously, we covered both of those with all of our earnings information. But without those two really non-recurring issues, we would have been below the high end of the range and we still ended up within the range. Associated with 2020, obviously, a lot of moving parts. We're very, very excited to have a 4% cost trend. We are pricing for that. And our pricing remains very disciplined, but we think that will really help us in terms of future growth potential. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please? Operator : And we'll go to Justin Lake with Wolf Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. Before I get to my question, I just want to follow-up on Ralph's quickly. In terms of being at the higher end of the range ex that $50 million you still would have been around $86 million to $88 million [ph]. I don't know what the flu costs are. But it's been a trend of two to three quarters now where it's been pushing towards the high end rather than the midpoint. And if you guys understand that from our viewpoint, it's hard to understand what's driving that? So is there anything you can tell us that would give us comfort that there's not some trend inside the business that maybe hasn't been fully taken account, might be a headwind to the 2020? And then my question is around membership growth for next year, specifically around Medicare Advantage. Gail, I think, you said 150,000 to 200,000. Is that 150,000 to 200,000 total? Or is that 150,000 to 200,000 in each of individual and group? And if it's 150,000 to 200,000 in total, can you tell us how that breaks down? Gail Boudreaux : Let me ask John to first discuss the medical cost and MLR issues and then I'll come back to membership. John? John Gallina : Yes. Justin, I certainly understand your perspective, but there really isn't anything that's working beneath the surface that causes an issue for 2020. And just to level set the 2020, maybe, I'll talk about that for a moment. We did end 2019 at 86.8. Our guidance for next year is 85.8. So that's an improvement of 100 basis points. But given the fact that the HIF is out, the HIF is in and the dynamics of that and pricing for the tax non-deductibility, on an apples-to-apples basis, you could expect that our MLR would go down by 150 basis points in 2020 and it's going down 100. So that's actually a 50 basis point increase. And it's really -- it's largely the result of business mix. And I really can't emphasize enough how much the mix does change the MLR. Our government business continues to be growing -- a growing portion of our premium revenue, very strong growth. We've had some of the best organic growth in the sector over the last several years. And the fully insured growth has been driven primarily by the Government Business division. And the government's MLR is higher than the company's average. And so, then that causes the overall MLR increase. I will say that our pricing does remain disciplined and we cover cost trends. So we feel very comfortable with our guidance and expectations and that the numbers for 2020 are very solid. Gail Boudreaux : Justin, in terms of your second question around Medicare Advantage membership. Yes, that is a total number. As you think about the breakdown, it's roughly 75% individual MA and about 25% group. In terms of the overall numbers, we feel very strongly about our -- as I mentioned our individual MA growth. And actually, we're coming off of strong growth in the group market in 2019. And as we think about 2020, we're expecting additional growth in group. But again, just the time line of the procurement has been a little bit longer, but we still feel very strongly about our group offering. The brand is resonating extremely well and we're really pleased, again, with the individual MA open enrollment season that we just had and that we will grow at a pace faster than the industry once again. So, thanks for the question and next question please. Operator : And we'll go to A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Just one quick point of clarification to John's comment and then a question about margin trends for 2020. It sounds like, on the third quarter call you guys were sort of implying in your broad comments that it would be at least 22.50 or at least 22.60. Based on John's comments, the fact that it's now at least 22.30. It sounds like that's 100% due to the HIF repeal, which was not expected. I just want to confirm that. And then just more of the margin trends for 2020. Is there any way to flesh out a little bit how much of a headwind normalization the individual margin is? How much of a tailwind, the comments about Medicaid or next year versus this year? And how those will impact the margin? And I'm assuming you're assuming relative stability of Medicare but maybe that's not true. Can you comment on that? John Gallina : No, thank you for that one question A.J. I\u2019ll do my best to see if I can answer it. But on the 2020 guidance you're exactly correct. Our core assumptions from the third quarter are unchanged. The growth rates that we had that we laid out in terms of Ingenio adding $2.30 for the year contributed a little bit more than $1 to 2019, increasing our earnings by the low end of the 12% to 15% growth rate that we had promised at Investor Day. And that included covering a $0.50 HIF headwinds that we knew about. But what we didn't know about was that there will be a permanent repeal of the HIF starting in 2021. And when you look at how that impact our 2020 mid-year renewals that the 2020 midyear renewals no longer need to charge and price for that incremental cost structure. And so the impact on 2020 is incremental $0.30 headwind on top of what had been communicated in the third quarter. And so that is entirely the differential between today's guidance and the expectations that we had from 90 days ago. The -- that was the first question. Actually could you repeat the other part of the question? A.J. Rice: In your guidance in terms of headwinds tailwinds\u2026 John Gallina : Yeah. Thank you, A.J. That was the individual margin normalization versus Medicaid. We have been talking all along about how those two mitigated each other. As we finalized our plans for 2020 and we've been working very, very hard with the states and everything else, we expect that the margin normalization from individual will probably be about 10 basis points worse in terms of margin than the incremental benefit that we expect to achieve from improvement in the Medicaid business. So that's about a 10 basis point impact on overall margins. And also that 10 basis points works its way through the MLR calculation as well. I didn't really talk about that as part of the 50 basis point increase in MLR but that's part of the reconciling item as well is that the individual headwind is about 10 basis points more than the Medicaid tailwind. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, John. And just a quick comment, sort of, reaffirming what John said. Overall our guidance is very consistent with what we said. And also we view, obviously, the repeal of the health insurer fee as a big positive for affordability and are very pleased that that happened. Next question, please. Operator : And we'll go to Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Steve Tanal : Good morning guys. I guess, I just wanted to dig into a little bit the fully insured enrollment outlook as well as the MBR guidance and trying to square this all with the $4 billion of pharmacy cost savings. I guess, it seems like growth could have been a little bit better or MBR maybe a little lower. If I'm doing the math right, it looks like commercial fully insured enrollment is implied down about 130,000 to up 120,000 when I take the 2020 fully insured aggregate growth outlook and net out Medicaid and MA. So first I wanted to confirm if we're thinking about commercial risk right that way? And I guess maybe Pete, any commentary on how you've been able to use those savings to drive enrollment gains or attention? And John any thoughts on the MBR, and whether you could add lower than the range or somewhere towards the lower end, if you end up burning more than at least 20% that you guys have committed to in the past that would be helpful. Gail Boudreaux : Great. Thank you for the many questions. We'll try to hit them each, but just in terms of fully insured and I'll have Pete give some commentary on that. If you look at the midpoint of our guidance, essentially we're guiding to flat commercial risk membership. And remember, if you think about the return of the health insurer fee, when this occurred a few years ago, the market overall was down pretty significantly, as were we. So our growth is actually inside of that, when you think about flat quite good, given the market dynamics. But I'll ask Pete to give some additional commentary about what's really happening inside of there. Pete Haytaian : Yes, that's it. Thanks Steve and thanks Gail. It's exactly, right. We're very pleased with our fully insured growth. You saw that play through in 2019. We've experienced growth in the large group and four out of the last five quarters. And as Gail said, the flat nature of our growth in 2020 is really this one large account, which is not really that unusual in light of the fact that the HIF coming back and a very large account moving from fully insured to ASO. And as Gail said, the last time this happened was in 2018 and we saw a mid-single-digit progression in membership. So a really nice improvement from that perspective. But longer term outside of that one large client, our fully insured growth would have been positive in 2020. And now with the value of Ingenio coming through, you'd asked about that, and yes, we are seeing that play through in our value. It's very nice to have that play through in a year when the HIF was coming back. So that was definitely an offset. And then, all the things that we've talked about in the past, our product portfolio, our sub-segment strategy, what we're doing around brokers and broker engagement, are all really playing through. So, again, longer term outside of this one large account, we see positive growth in the large fully insured and fully insured business in general. John Gallina : Yes. And thank you Steve for the following up on the other part of your question, on the $4 billion savings from a full year implementation of IngenioRx. We're actually very excited about that, because at the end of the day, that $4 billion in savings makes healthcare more affordable. And group trend is just one aspect of that business and a very important aspect. But as we've stated in the past, the impact of the savings and the $3.2 billion that we're returning to the customers, it's really based on a market-by-market, line-of-business by line-of-business assessment. And each marketplace is a little bit different. Our competitive advantage differs in certain marketplaces, in the extent that we're close to an MLR rebate. We obviously would include it all into the pricing. In the extent that we have really good market share and really good competitive positioning, we may let a little bit more drop to the bottom line. And then, you have to go back through line of business by line of business. In our ASO, some of our customers have passed through pricing. They actually receive 100% of the benefit of the better pricing. In Medicare Advantage, we are utilizing the benefit to offset some of the 4-star headwinds that we have. All-in, we continue to reaffirm that at least 20% is going to hit the bottom line and the rest will be returned to the customers. Yes, we always do aspire to do more, aspire to do better. But right now, our guidance is pretty solid. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : We will go to Stephen Valiquette with Barclays. Please, go ahead. Steve Valiquette : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So even though the $50 million risk-adjuster reduction only impacted MLR by 20 bps in the quarter, just curious to be able to provide just a little more color around the decision tree and when it makes sense for you guys to alter that position? Really just trying to understand, if this is something that could occur really at any given time in any quarter going forward, how should we think about the volatility around this in future periods? Thanks. John Gallina : Yeah, sure. No great question Steve. And in terms of our risk adjuster position, obviously, we evaluate it and monitor it on a regular basis. Many of the things in the individual marketplace or a zero-sum game, we don't have the appropriate transparency into everyone else's risk pools and everyone else's risk adjuster scores. We utilize a third-party service called Wakely that many of the companies in our industry utilize to do estimates. We take that along with our own competitive intelligence and our own knowledge and analysis and we make adjustments as appropriate. There was a weekly report that was provided to the entire industry in mid-December that was utilized by us as part of our overall assessment. Wakely does a report multiple times a year. So -- but we've been very accurate over the past several years. And our estimates have been very, very good. So we feel good about the estimate. And quite honestly it occurred for a really good reason. And that's because we were over performing on that block of business. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : And we'll go to Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. I just have one question, but I thought maybe I'd ask 15 since that's going to be the trend. The one question I have, I just want to ask about Ingenio and if there's any possibility we're going to have any increased segment disclosure for 2020? The PBM revenue and fees are all rolled up in that single line. So even though you've given us a cost of good dollar amount, we can't really see the gross margin. And to some degree I think that's a bit of a bridge and some of your guidance versus our model. So, I guess the question is would we consider any additional disclosure? And are you willing to give us a little help just on the gross margin as opposed to just the dollar COGS for 2020? John Gallina : Sure. No, thank you Gary and I appreciate you asking one question. But the answer to the segment reporting question is, we will follow the rules and requirements as promulgated by the SEC and certainly adhere to their guidelines for segment reporting. There is a very good chance that at some point here in 2020 if Ingenio has the growth that we expected to have that it will require us to break out and have a third segment. And at that point in time, we will provide that information as well as comparative information. But until we're required by the SEC to provide that additional segment, we're going to maintain our current segment reporting structure. Just maybe a little bit of help to give you. As you can see in the press release, our cost of products sold is $7.1 billion at the midpoint. In order to get Ingenio revenue, really have to add the $2.30 or approximately $800 million back to that because that's the area where it's going to be reported. And then there's a G&A load associated with the administrative staffing of Ingenio. And you have to have both of those to get to what the impact of the Ingenio revenue is, which is a little bit more than $8 billion. So hopefully that's helpful to your modeling. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : And we'll go to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ricky Goldwasser : Yeah. Hi, good morning. So I know it's too early to talk about 2021. But just a couple of questions on how you think about that. So, first of all, when we think about Ingenio, any early thoughts about the 2021 selling season, what you are seeing? And do you think that you are ready to start actively competing for external PBM business? And then secondly, when we think about the HIF gone for 2021, any preliminary thoughts on how you're going to apply the tailwind between reinvesting in the business to improve benefit design, versus savings that are flowing through to the bottom line? Gail Boudreaux : Thank you for the question, Ricky. A couple of things. One, you're right. We're not going to be giving guidance yet on 2021. But in terms of a little color on IngenioRx, a couple of big opportunities. First, we're really pleased with the way that the migration of the 15 million members went. And I think it really demonstrated the operational capability that we have inside of this business is quite mature and that has been a real positive. The big opportunity we have in 2020, and I mentioned this in some of my prepared remarks, and in 2021, is to increase the penetration in our own self-funded book of business. Right now, we're in the range of only about 20%, well below all of our competitors and others in the space. That's really been driven heavily by the non-competitiveness of our prior arrangement and we're seeing real big opportunities for us, as we, both in 2020 as well as in 2021. So that, first and foremost, is our primary. In terms of external operations, as you know, those are long-term procurements. We do feel that we're ready to compete in that. We were really pleased to bring on Blue Cross of Idaho this year for January and that has gone well. But again, in terms of the exact timing these are three-year cycles, generally. We will be competing for them. In terms of when those procurements come through, will be a little bit more lumpy than exactly in 2021, but we feel really well prepared. And again, our big opportunities are within our own existing book of business. And then again, we're really pleased with what we saw in the Part D growth this year. It's really the first year that we've been competitive in the Medicare Part D. Ingenio gives us an opportunity to also be more competitive in Medicare Advantage, our individual and group membership. So across the board, we see it as a nice growth accelerator for both commercial and government. Thanks very much for the question. Next question, please. Operator : And that will be Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Peter Costa : Good morning. The other side of the mix issue relative to MLR is SG&A. And it seems like your SG&A has come in better than expected all this year. You'd originally -- at your Investor Day, you had a target for 2023 of 11% to 12% and then for 2019 of 13.5% for SG&A and you came in below 13%. Can you talk about whether the target for 2023 is now further improved? And then also, just in terms of, as we think about the progression to that, have we -- are we still linearly progressing to that? Or is it something that we should be thinking about, we just got an acceleration this year because of the mix? John Gallina : Thank you, Pete. Great question. And in terms of the improvement, we are very, very happy with some of the operational efficiencies and just some of the better processes that we now have, things that really make the experience better and easier for the customer. And at the end of the day, that's the most important part. The systems migration is going to be 80% complete by the end of this year. And then, we can continue on from there. Gail talked about a six to two. So I would say that, just given some of those issues the improvement is not going to be linear through 2023. It will be a little bit better here in the first few years, as we get through the systems migration as we're investing heavily in digital right now and as we get those capabilities up and running, for instance, that maybe there's a bit of a heavier load. 2019 was negatively impacted by the early acceleration and implementation of Ingenio and so that's not part of our 2020. And quite honestly, we do have the best organic growth in the entire sector over the last several years and that organic growth is helping our SG&A ratio maybe a little bit faster than we had anticipated, so a lot of positives there really. I think the short answer to your question is the improvement is going to be a little bit faster in the first couple of years of the five-year period versus the last couple of years. Gail Boudreaux : Yeah. And I would just add, sort of, to reiterate what John has said, we have been intensely focused on operational execution across Anthem. And you're starting to see that. Clearly system migrations have been successful being at 80% by the end of this year. And our destination platform allows us a few things. One, leverage on our SG&A, but more importantly improving our business process, making it easier to do business with Anthem. The investments that we are making in digital, our investment levels have been very consistent. And so as you think about our SG&A ratio, we're getting leverage from our growth but we're really getting leverage from reengineering our business processes from an end-to-end, simplifying our technology infrastructure. And I think that's a huge opportunity for us as we continue to make it easier to do business with Anthem as well as for consumers to have the tools at their fingertips. And that's really where we're heading on this. Thank you. Next question. Operator : We will go to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. I want to go back to the MLR commentary because -- I mean, I guess I appreciate the concept of growing the Government Business faster and creating a mix issue, but you are coming in at the higher end of your MLR this year. And usually we think about the business being repriced. And if you're coming at the higher end of MLR this year there's an opportunity to improve that going into the following year. So just trying to understand why we're not seeing more of that? And I guess maybe two questions related to that. First, talk about margin normalization in the bigger business. Are we going to be at that normal margin in 2020? Or is this something that's also going to be a headwind in future years? And second, just to understand how Ingenio works with MLR. It sounds like you're saying Ingenio lower cost trend but you price to that cost trend. So it's not impacting one way or the other the MLR in the quarter? And if you could just break out how much Ingenio did lower trend, what would the trend have been without Ingenio? John Gallina : Thank you, Kevin, again for that question. In terms of the MLR for 2020 in your commentary, mix is extremely important. And yes we do reprice our business each year. The -- we do price very discipline. Our pricing includes overall cost trend and we feel very good about the target margins that we have associated with the various lines of business. And Medicaid is going to improve in 2020 as we have talked about. So that's going to be a tailwind. But there are several headwinds to that metric. And again mix being -- and this is on an after HIF basis, because HIF really makes all of the metrics confusing on a reported basis and mix is the single biggest issue. I had referenced in a different question about the individual normalization. That is going to impact our MLR as that comes through, and to answer your side question on individual normalization. Given the way the MLR rebate rules work in the three-year averaging associated with the profitability of that, we do expect that 2020 we'll have individual margins that are within our sustainable range here for the future. Another data point, just on the MLR, that -- I don't know that people have really considered, again, is the elimination of the HIF in 2021. And the fact that our 2020 renewal pricing will not include the gross up for the HIF, or the tax non-deductibility to HIF, for the period that the contract years go into 2021, reduces premium and increases MLR. All those things combined are what really drives the increase year-over-year. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please? Operator : We'll go to Josh Raskin with Nephron. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Thanks. Good morning. Just my question on the opportunity that you guys had potential to work with Prime and their decision to go another round. I'm just curious, sort of, how that unfolded and why you think they decided to sort of do something else? Was there something missing on the Ingenio side? Do you think it was just sort of financial? Or I'm just curious to get your feedback. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, Josh. In terms of Prime, first, let me talk a little more broadly about our partnership with the Blues. We're not going to comment on specific decisions that are made or deals that are done. I mean, that really, I think, is a broader question that we won't comment on. But, I think, it's the bigger issue you're asking is, how do we partner with the Blues? And I think, that's been -- it's absolutely been an important part of our strategy. And looking at that we feel really good about where we've been with our partnerships with the Blues. First, in our core business, which is the Medicaid partnerships and the growing Medicare Advantage partnerships that we have, that we most recently launched, those are going very well. And we continue to add more. Our diversified business group, which is a growing part of our portfolio today, works with two-thirds of the Blue. We're obviously not going to sell everyone every single product we have. But, again, we see the Blues as a very strong partnership with us. And actually most recently Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey just added one of our core products Health Guide to their largest customer, the state of New Jersey. So we've got -- we see strong and growing opportunities in terms of that. And we also think that Ingenio will be a very strong opportunity in the pharmacy space. So, we think, there's plenty of room across the Blues for us to do partnerships, as well as to work with each other. So from that perspective, we're still very bullish on our opportunities across the system. Thanks very much. Next question? Operator : We'll go to Sarah James with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Sarah James : Thank you. The deceleration to the 4% Local Group trend, it's the lowest that trend has been for Anthem. Can you unpack that for us? How much is Ingenio versus any other buckets decelerating in there? And then, just to clarify, you said that you're pricing to trend. So I want to confirm, does that mean there's no conservative buffer baked into spread in the event that the deceleration from 6% to 4% doesn't come to fruition? Thanks. John Gallina : Sarah, thank you, for the question. And just to clarify, there are many, many things that go into trend. There's the -- obviously, the changing population, the acuity of the business, the mix. We have cost of care initiatives that we have implemented in prior years. We have cost of care initiatives that we will implement in 2020, all the impact trend. And then, we also have the impact of Ingenio. Just for clarity, we are not going to itemize each one of those and what they are each worth individually. In aggregate, it takes our trend down to 4%. And that compares to the fact that we ended 2019 squarely at the midpoint of our prior trend of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points. And now we have a 4%. In terms of pricing methodology, the pricing methodology does have a bit of conservatism baked into it but it's not a percent or a number that we're going to talk about here, but we feel very good about our ability to deliver on the pricing discipline that we've laid out. Gail Boudreaux : Yeah. And I'll just reiterate what John said. We have not changed anything around our pricing discipline. We've remained exactly consistent on that to our forward view of costs and that's how we're pricing. And then in terms of just a couple of factors because I think everyone is focusing on just IngenioRx and the impact on trend. We have also been working very diligently around how do we change overall costs. And right now 60% of our spend is in risk-based arrangements. We expect to see greater pull-through of that because more an upside downside risk where we think there is the best alignment of cost quality and health care outcomes. We are very focused on bundled payments and incentives for site of care, working around orthopedics, cardiac, women's health services. Our site of service where we work with our DBG counterparts around, particularly our aim around moving to the appropriate site of service I think is another really important area around GI, great area that we're focused on right now. And then finally specialty RX, where we're targeted for redirection in that area. So those are all large dollar areas and big areas of trend in spend. And we have been intensely focused on that as part of our overall medical cost management and alignment of those services as well as what Ingenio brings to us on just a unit cost perspective. Thanks very much for the question. Next question, please. Operator : That will be Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Lance Wilkes : Yeah. Could you talk a little bit about the improvements in Medicaid in 4Q and the second half and in particular you point to, kind of, specific actions you've taken? And then how much of that improvement is coming on the medical cost side versus operating expenses? Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question Lance. I'm going to have Felicia Norwood respond. Felicia Norwood : Good morning Lance and thanks for the question. As you know we have spent the -- a big part of 2019, focused on working with our state partners to make sure that we were getting rates that were aligned with the acuity and mix of our membership. We saw acceleration of re-verifications during 2019, and as you know that provided some headwinds for us. We are pleased to say that as we head into 2020, we have spent a lot of time with our state partners to get the rates that we believe are appropriate for the mix and acuity of the population that we're serving. At the end of the day it's all about a combination of rates, but also the medical management programs that we have in place as well to support our members. We say all the time and it's true we're very focused on whole person care. We have worked very closely with complex and specialized populations and making sure that our members are getting care in the most appropriate setting. So when we think about the opportunity we have for us on the Medicaid side around improving, our overall cost as we go forward is certainly a combination of having in place the right medical management programs and being very disciplined and vigilant with our state partners around getting the rates that we need to support the changing mix of our population as we go forward. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : We'll go to Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Matthew Borsch : Yeah. Could you just talk a little bit about the outlook on the commercial side? I mean, I heard your broad comments, but how do you expect to start this year in terms of your commercial enrollment, particularly on the risk side, when we think about group versus individual, given the trends that you're seeing? Pete Haytaian : Yeah. Thanks, Matt. Now as we talked about, we talked about a large client transitioning from fully insured to ASO. So at the beginning of the year, you will see that play through. But as we talked about, through the remaining portion of the year, you'll see our fully insured business continues to improve and grow, for all the reasons that we stated before. And as it relates to the individual business and, I think, that we saw a modest growth this year. We believe in our strategy around individual. We remain disciplined with respect to that business. We're targeting markets where we can achieve the appropriate economics and establish the right networks, have the right collaborative relationship with providers and partners. And we're seeing that play through, but it's a very methodical and thoughtful approach. And so, I think, you'll see, as it relates to 2020, our individual business play out in a very similar fashion than it did in 2019. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please? Operator : We'll go to Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dave Windley : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to come back to MLR, I apologize. But on MLR, looking at, kind of, if I extend out maybe one more decimal point. It looks like MLR really was kind of outside \u2013 barely, but outside of your range for the year. And the risk adjustment, if I take that out, would really bring you back down to still at the very high end of your MLR range for the year. So you've, I think, said that the trends were basically in line with expectations but for flu. So I'm wondering if you could quantify flu, so we could have a better sense of the magnitude of that in the fourth quarter and for the fourth quarter of next year, understand what the year-over-year compare would be on that. John Gallina : Dave, thank you for the question. And, quite honestly, I'm not going to comment on decimal points that go out further and further and further. I really don't think that it's a productive conversation. However, I will say that, the flu was more significant in the month of December, specifically, in November, but in the fourth quarter in total, than we had anticipated. There's obviously a lot of factors that go into MLR and premium and everything else. And we're going to talk about the things that are material and significant, not the ones that change things by 100 basis points -- 100th of a basis point or something like that. So our answer's stand, that we believe we have provided the information that's needed. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please? Operator : That will be Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Yeah. Thanks. Hey. Just, thanks for taking questions. Just want to clarify a couple of things. First, going back to MLR, not so much about the guidance range itself. The 50 basis points range is a little bit wider than normal. Is that just simply, as you kind of take on Missouri and Nebraska? Or is there anything else in sort of the variation that you're kind of expecting? And then secondly, I think, to an earlier question, you're obviously going to a 4% cost trend from 6%. You talked about largely being Ingenio and a few other things. But without Ingenio, what would that 6 -- how would we compare that 6% compared to 2019? Thanks. John Gallina : No. Thank you, Charles. And in terms of the guidance range and expanding the MLR by 50 basis points, it's really to be more consistent with how others players in the industry have expressed trend over the last several years, as well as the fact that we continue to be a growing company with some really good top-line growth and want to provide guidance that we don\u2019t have to revise and change maybe as much as we had on the MLR basis for the future. And then in terms of the Ingenio is as in response to Sarah's question, we're not going to provide the specific itemization of each item and trend and how much medical management worth? How much site of care is worth? How much bundled payments are worth? Or how much Ingenio's is worth for that matter on the trend on a percentage basis. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question. Operator : We'll go to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Frank Morgan : Good morning. A lot of questions of the impact of the mix shift on your overall MLR. I'm just curious, could you give us a high-level thought around what's the differential in that target market -- margin in those two businesses the Government, the Commercial? And then in terms of your assumptions around the Nebraska Missouri contracts, where are they relative to your government contract margins to our targeted margins? And have those states been through these reverification cycles? Thanks. John Gallina : Yeah, Frank this is John. I'll start out on the question and then turn it over to Felicia to provide some final thoughts. But if you look at the Government Business division in terms of how it has contributed to the revenue of Anthem for 2018 and 2019, it's been slightly more than 60% for each year. But now when you look into 2020 and you look at our Medicaid growth including Missouri and Nebraska, you look at our sustained double-digit growth in Medicare Advantage, which on a percentage basis has led the industry for several years in a row, the fact that the return of the HIF is muting the fully insured commercial growth. You take it all in, we expect that Government revenue to increase as a percentage of total revenue by several percentage points. And just the dynamic on that ends up being the leading factor associated with the increase in the MLR year-over-year. Felicia if you'd like to talk about Missouri and Nebraska? Felicia Norwood : Yeah. First of all let me say that, we're very excited for the opportunity to be able to serve Medicaid beneficiaries and working with state partners in Missouri and Nebraska. Just to level set again, reverifications and eligibility determinations are a part of a normal course of business and Medicaid programs and states are required to verify eligibility at least annually. We have not -- certainly we just closed last week, but we certainly haven't seen anything yet with respect to this population around accelerated reverifications, but we will work closely with our state partners there as we take on this business and bring the value of Anthem to beneficiaries in the state. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : We'll go to Whit Mayo with UBS. Please go ahead. Whit Mayo : Hey, thanks. Just a quick one on Medicare Advantage. You picked up about 90,000 lives in open enrollment and at the midpoint of your guidance range of 150,000 to 200,000 implies half of the growth coming this year from open enrollment alone. But historically you've earned perhaps one-third given the year-round net growth and group wins. So what's different this year as we think about the seasonality of your expected growth since history makes us look pretty low as a starting point? Gail Boudreaux : Thank you for the question. Yes we're very, very pleased about what we saw during the AEP season. Frankly, it was some of the strongest growth we've ever seen. And we look forward to being able to continue to grow our business over the course of the year. As you know, we are focused very much, not just on our MA population, but also duals as well and we are consistently bringing in business with respect to that over the course of the year. The fourth year in a row of exceeding industry growth rates with respect to MA has been very significant for us. We spent a lot of time focused with our partners and also focused on our product portfolio. And when we think about the competitive product portfolio we have and the supplemental benefit offerings, we feel that we are well positioned for growth as we go forward. So if you think about it, we are very much committed to being able to deliver on the commitment we've made, which is to deliver mid-double-digit growth again in 2020. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please? Operator : That will be George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. John, I just want to delve into a comment you made in the prepared commentary. It sounded like you were talking about in the -- from the risk-based business to the fee-based business, you're seeing kind of the profit ratio go from 5 :1 to 3 :1. I guess, can you unpack that a little bit? I'm assuming, it's the growth in the profit of the fee-based business, as opposed to a shrinkage in the profit of the risk-based business? And I guess, can you talk about what's driving the incremental profitability of the fee-based business and kind of allowing you to generate that margin? Gail Boudreaux : Sure. This is Gail. I think, that was in my commentary. I will -- I'll ask Pete to comment. That's a strategy that we've shared pretty broadly as part of Investor Day, in terms of improving the profitability of our fee-based business relative to the industry. So we feel very good about the profitability of our fully insured. So it's not a decline there. It's more of an improvement. But I'll let Pete talk about the specific actions underneath that. Pete Haytaian : Yes, exactly. So this is a -- it's a -- as we talked about at Investor Day, it's a major component in our growth strategy in terms of expanding and -- expanding our margins and improving our ASO business, overall. And to unpack how we achieve that. It's through a series of upselling in terms of capabilities and programs. So, specifically, as Gail noted, our specialty business this year performed exceptionally well, growing by over 1 million members. That's a component of selling our specialty products into our ASO business. Stop losses included as well. Clinical programs, where we're seeing very significant uptick. And Gail mentioned in the prepared comments, programs like Total Health Total You. All these things are playing into success with respect to this. And then, longer term, and into 2020, we look really forward to including IngenioRx. In that context, that will be a significant driver of taking us to the 3 :1 as we committed to and even forward-looking thinking about future assets like Beacon will continue to create improvements as well. So we remain really bullish with respect to this story and on a path to success to meet our commitments by 2023. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please? Operator : We'll go to Scott Fidel of Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Hi. Just had a follow-up question, just on the commentary around North Carolina. And you had mentioned that, you expect that will now be a 2021 event in terms of implementation. Just interested, because a couple of your peers have talked more to -- one had talked to a 3Q start, another had talked to a 4Q start. So just interested, whether you've actually gotten some recent feedback from the state, telling you it's going to be more like 2021? Or whether you're just being -- trying to be a little conservative around that assumption. Just remind us in terms of what your pick was in terms of what you're expecting on North Carolina membership, whenever that actually does get implemented? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Good morning and thank you for the question. First and foremost, let me say that we are very much looking forward to working with our state partner and Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina in order to serve Medicaid beneficiaries in the state. When we were here in the last quarter, we expected the business to go live on February 1st. Based on everything we know today and I will say we have not had a definitive answer from the state, we are assuming that in order to be able to deliver on the business, it would take until possibly 2021 before you would be able to go live with respect to the contract. With that said, I will say that we have been very much working closely with our partner in the state of North Carolina and we are ready today. Operational readiness is critical for us and we have gone through numerous iterations with the state around testing and preparedness for the go-live. But based on where we are sitting today, it's our expectation that the business won't be going live until 2021. Gail Boudreaux : Next question please. Operator : And our final question will be from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Steve Willoughby : Hi. Thanks f or squeezing me in here again. Gail, just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on two different items. One, just as it relates to the acquisition. It sounds like its dependent of the TPA you mentioned. Just why that interests you in actually acquiring that business? And then also if you could provide any color as it relates to something you mentioned back at the analyst meeting as it relates to the Blue's high-performing network for 2021. And maybe just an update on how you are thinking about that for Anthem and maybe the Blues network overall? Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Great. Thank you for the two questions. And first in terms of the TPA acquisition, it's a capability acquisition predominantly for us. The reason we're interested where the majority of the membership today it is a sub-segment of the business that requires a different type of flexibility, we've been very focused obviously on converting our systems to having a destination platform in our commercial business. This gives us a little more flexibility around sub-segments of the market that we do business in hospital labor, et cetera that historically has different operating requirements. So we felt that this was -- this added to our portfolio. It's an area that the Blues have always been strong in. And this specific TPA again is the majority of ours and works closely with the Blue partners. So we feel good about that. In terms of the second question, the high performing network. Sorry, I was just catching up there a little bit on it. But we're actually making great progress. We're really excited about it. It's part of our overall affordability. We're working with our other Blue partners. I think it's actually a very strong statement around what we're trying to do with high performing networks and 55 MSAs, 22 of which are in Anthem states. We believe that this will provide us with leverage our deep provider relationships and allow us to seamlessly and simplify how our customers get a significant cost structure advantage and much higher outcomes. Overall it's progressing. We've had great interest from our largest client\u2019s particularly national clients. As you know we've always had a very strong unit cost advantage inside of the Blue Cross system. This is I think builds upon that also to have a very strong performance orientation and the network again is built based on both cost and quality. And so we have selected those care providers within our networks who are delivering truly superior outcomes. And I think it aligns very well with our value-based initiatives. And what I also like about this as Blues across the country, we're building a very consistent set of outcome metrics for our clients. And that again is resonating very strongly. So, thank you very much for that question. We're, obviously, very excited about the partnership and the opportunity there. Let me now thank you very much for joining our call this morning. As you can see, 2019 has been a strong year for Anthem across our enterprise. I'm pleased with our performance, but we have much more work to do as we move into the New Year. We'll continue to focus on our performance execution in order to drive growth and create a better healthcare experience for everyone we serve. We'll also continue to evolve our culture and further build our talent and capabilities to create positive change across our organization and in the communities where we live and work. I look forward to delivering another strong performance in the year ahead and want to thank all of our associates for their very good work. Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Please, go ahead. Chris Rigg : Good morning and welcome to Anthem's first quarter 2020 earnings call. This is Chris Rigg, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of our Commercial & Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Boudreaux : Good morning and thank you for joining us. Across the globe and right here at home we're facing a critical humanitarian crisis. All of us are impacted and our hearts go out to those struggling. I will focus my comments this morning on the impact of the COVID-19 global health crisis on our business along with the actions we've taken to provide support and relief. I will direct you to the earnings released for the financial results for the first quarter. Let me begin by saying how incredibly grateful I am to the men and women including many of Anthem's own clinical associates fighting in the frontlines of this healthcare crisis from small rural communities to the heart of New York City. I am also incredibly proud of the more than 77,000 Anthem associates who have been providing compassionate and tireless support for our customers, members, care providers and communities each day as we battle this pandemic together to ensure the safety and health of our associates and support the nationwide efforts to contain the virus. In March, we began transitioning our employees away from offices and now have nearly 99% working safely at home. In recognition of these unprecedented times, we are offering our associates up to 80 hours of additional paid leave providing online workouts, expanding mental health support and have increased our Anthem Cares Emergency Relief Fund to help associates manage through this crisis. Anthem has long served and met the unique needs of our local communities. Our commitment to improving lives and communities is core to our mission and we have approached our response to the COVID-19 pandemic with a local and personal lens. Anthem along with our association of 35 other independent and locally operated Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies have committed nearly $3 billion to ensure that more than a 100 million Americans along with care providers and hospitals have access to the resources and support they need to help improve the health of America. Because of our strong blue brand and deep local roots we were well-positioned to work quickly and seamlessly with local, state and federal officials, local care providers, key customers and community partners from day one of the pandemic. And our associates are at the forefront of our comprehensive efforts. Our Anthem culture and values serve as our foundation for giving back in our local communities. Our deeply committed associates have been giving back in various ways such as online teaching, outreach via phone or mail to those isolated at home, making masks for non-healthcare industry workers, helping to provide personal care supplies and providing meal delivery to those homebound by the crisis across the country with partners like the American Red Cross, Boys & Girls Club, Feeding America and Americares. Anthem is on the forefront of delivering relief and support to those most impacted. We know there is great fear and uncertainty among consumers right now, particularly when it comes to safe and affordable access to care. We've removed barriers to care by waiving caution for treatment of COVID-19 including coverage for testing, treatment and inpatient hospital stays. We've waived prior authorizations for COVID-19 diagnostic tests and related covered services as well as ensured continuity of care by waiving early prescription refill limits on 30-day maintenance medications and encouraging the use of 90-day mail-order benefits if applicable. We've also expanded access to Telehealth & nurselines for both medical and emotional health to meet the growing needs for 24 by 7 information, support and care. For our most vulnerable consumers in Medicare and Medicaid we've also reinforced our long-standing focus on social drivers of health to provide support with food, housing, transportation and more. From outreach to isolated seniors and families to donating meals and other needed personal care items, we are working to ensure our members needs are being met, that they realize they are not alone in this fight against the virus. Our associates working with these populations are demonstrating their endless compassion and care during this time as well. We've seen examples of our team members personally delivering boxes of food and much needed supplies safely to our members and dire need. Their commitment is inspiring but not surprising this is how Anthem shows up every day to serve others. At the core of the crisis there's been tremendous focus on the need for testing and no bigger push for that testing than in the crisis epicenter of New York City. There we've partnered with the coalition of Asian American IPA to provide free mobile testing in the five boroughs across the city. We also established the Anthem Medical Associate Volunteer Program for associates with professional medical training and licensure, the volunteers at hospitals and other clinical settings in a variety of states including New York where the needs are so great. Our clinical associates are demonstrating Anthem's strong values and commitment to service as they stand fearlessly on the frontlines to deliver critical care. As Anthem's care provider partners continue their important work in local markets across the country we have simplified policies designed to help them deliver care to patients more quickly and effectively. Unless otherwise required under specific state and federal mandates, we have suspended prior authorization requirements for patient transfers and use some medical equipment critical to COVID-19 treatment. Additionally, Anthem is covering respiratory services for acute treatment of COVID-19 along with in-network and out-of-network coverage for COVID-19 laboratory testing. The actions we've taken are ensuring that healthcare providers are focused where they need to be with their patients. Partnerships are foundational to our work in Anthem. Today we're partnering with XPRIZE and other industry leaders to form a global pandemic alliance to combat COVID-19 and leverage learning to help prepare for future pandemics. Across the digital landscape, Anthem has been collaborating extensively with various state and federal partners as well as other private sector partners to innovate and help simplify the entire healthcare system experience through the use of technology. Anthem's digital first capabilities are proactively addressing issues with COVID-19 to simplify healthcare for consumers. Our Sydney Care mobile app and the new Corona virus assessment tool are helping people safely and conveniently assess their risk of having COVID-19, locate testing sites as may be needed and connect directly with a doctor via our virtual care solution. To date, we've seen more than 170,000 downloads of the app and a witness to 250% surge in virtual care engagements via text and video. This crisis has made clear the Telehealth and virtual care will continue to be a key component of how and where care is delivered going forward. Our employer partners are certainly feeling the impacts of the crisis. Anthem is working closely with our customers to ensure not only the safety and well-being of their employees but to also provide affordable, flexible payment terms as they work through the financial implications of COVID-19. We recognize this action may add payment risk to our business. We also know it's the right thing to do. The economic impacts of the crisis may also drive an unprecedented shift in consumers from the employer market into our Medicaid and ACA segments. We are quickly reallocating resources as may be needed to meet these potential challenges. In the small group market a segment especially vulnerable to disruption, we are proactively identifying groups at risk and providing more affordable product offerings. We're helping displace members find coverage in the individual marketplace or in Medicaid. Anthem entered 2020 in a position of strength, ready to achieve our financial objectives and serve as a trusted partner in health. Our first quarter performance was in line with our expectations and while we know COVID-19 is likely to produce unforeseen challenges both short and long term. We also see tremendous opportunities to reimagine what's possible for our company and healthcare more broadly. Well, there is much uncertainty as you saw in our press release, we are maintaining our 2020 EPS guidance. We view this as the most reasonable posture given the multitude of offsetting factors across our diversified business. In a moment, John will discuss the financial scenarios underlying our guidance decision in greater detail. As we look ahead, I am confident that our organization will grow stronger based on the learnings from the current crisis, more effective and better prepared to deliver on what we are entrusted to do. As this crisis evolve we are unwavering in our efforts to support the medical and social needs of our consumers, improve total health and well-being and we'll be ready to execute on the momentum we had prior to the onset of the pandemic. I'll now turn it over to John to discuss our financial position. John? John Gallina : Thank you Gail and good morning. My objective today is to share with you the actions that we've taken to enhance our liquidity and strengthen our already solid capital position as well as sharing some of the scenarios that form the basis of our outlook, but first I'll briefly review our first quarter results which were both strong and largely unaffected by the current crisis. This morning we reported first quarter GAAP earnings per share of $5.94 and adjusted earnings per share of $6.48. Medical membership totaled 42.1 million members as of the end of the quarter an increase of 1.3 million lives year-over-year and 1.1 million lives sequentially in part through the acquisitions of [indiscernible] and the Missouri and Nebraska Medicaid plans but also aided by our strong organic growth. Medical cost in the quarter were well controlled and slightly better than expectations. As anticipated our individual business margin began to normalize to more sustainable levels where our Medicaid business was on track to achieve the midpoint of our 2% to 4% target margin range by year-end. Our MLR for the quarter was 84.2% exceeding expectations. We had strong cash flow of 1.7 times earnings or 1.3 times earnings normalized for the health insurance fee while simultaneously seeing an increase of almost four days in the days and claims payable metric sequentially. Of note, IngenioRx is now a standalone reportable segment. In the quarter operating gain in the segment was $349 million which includes approximately $75 million to $100 million that under prior segment reporting would have resided in the commercial and specialty business division. That said IngenioRx's core performance is running slightly ahead of prior expectations. As the threat of COVID-19 began to accelerate in mid-March we felt it was prudent to enhance our liquidity by drawing down a total of $600 million from our various credit facilities and an incremental $900 million through the commercial paper market. We are well positioned with total undrawn borrowing capacity of an additional $2.1 billion. Our total debt to capital at the end of the first quarter was 41.7% slightly more than 150 basis points higher than if we had not taken these proactive steps in March to enhance liquidity. We will continue to closely monitor our capital position and evaluate ways to optimize our debt structure including access in capital markets. We also temporarily suspended our share repurchases beginning in the second half of March. It is clear that COVID-19 is having a profound impact on the global economy and there remains significant uncertainty around the shape and timing of an eventual recovery. We have spent considerable time evaluating various scenarios on how COVID-19 and rapidly rising unemployment will impact our financial results. Key factors we evaluated include the anticipated infection rate and hospitalization rate associated with members that contract Corona virus as well as estimating the number that need a ventilator or ECMO machine. The intensity and duration of the infection and the impacts on the healthcare system, unemployment rates, membership mix changes. Thus far we have seen a slight uptick in the Medicaid enrollment as a result of state temporarily suspending reverification efforts and limited changes in our commercial business. As time goes on we expect a more significant shift of commercial group members in the Medicaid and the ACA marketplace. Deferred non-emergent or elective procedures in the eventual timing of a rebound including assessing the capacity of the system and the ability to address pent-up demand. Extended payment terms and the likelihood of higher than normal bad debt expense, lower interest rates and overall capital market conditions. Higher interest expense with the increase borrowing to enhance liquidity and the impact of our decision to temporarily suspend share repurchases. Overall, we estimate that approximately 30% to 40% of our annual medical expense is related to deferrable elective procedures. As a result of deferrals we currently expect the second quarter MLR to be well below of historical levels but expect an elevated MLR in the second half of the year as elective procedures return. We recognize many of your requesting details on our expected business mix changes and the broader impact that COVID-19 on our business. Unfortunately, the rapidly changing environment prevents us today from sharing the level of specificity you would normally expect from us as a management team. We intend to regularly update the investment community as conditions evolve and visibility improves on key operating metrics. We are in uncharted territory and the future may look markedly different from what anyone expects. That said we recognize our business is more diverse and resilient today than in past periods of economic disruption. In 2008, at the time of the Great Recession, commercial and individual customers comprise nearly 75% of our risk-based membership versus less than 30% today. We currently operate Medicaid plans in 23 states and DC and in most of our markets we are first or second in terms of market share. This compares to operating in only 14 states in 2008. At the same time our Medicare Advantage business is expanding and we expect strong growth for the foreseeable future. The diversity of our business today positions Anthem well to mitigate the challenges we see ahead. While the details and metrics underlying our EPS guidance will undoubtedly look different from previous expectations based on our balanced business mix coupled with extensive modeling factoring various scenarios we are maintaining our original full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance of greater than $22.30. Operator we will now open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go to the line of Stephen Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead. Stephen Valiquette : Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone. Let me commend you and everyone at Anthem on the work you're doing around the pandemic that you highlighted earlier and question is just around the medical reserves. I guess I'm curious if you're able to provide a little more color on the actuarial process around medical reserving for all the puts and takes related to COVID-19 and then did any extraordinary reserving impact that reported 1Q, \u201820 MLR at all? Wanted to confirm that one way or the other. Thanks. John Gallina : Thank you, Steve. This is John. I'll just start out by stating that our reserving philosophy is consistent which is both prudent and reasonably conservative. The reserves are estimated based on the immediate view of how claims are developing. Under GAAP accounting we cannot reserve now for claims that will be incurred later in the year which might include accruals for pent-up demand and utilization of elective or discretionary services. So we've been very consistent and conservative with our view -- the impact of COVID-19 actually is rather minimal on the first quarter results and on our March 31 reserve balances is a GAAP accounting does require to only look at what's been incurred through the end of the reporting period. We do have conservatism factors in to ensure that they're all actually justified but really COVID-19 has minimal impact on the March 31 reserve balances. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you for the question Stephen. Again appreciate your comments. We're really proud of the work that all of our associates in Anthem have done to help respond to this incredible humanitarian crisis and as John said I just want to reiterate we've been very consistent in our reserving practices and process. Next question please. Operator : We will go at the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate all the details. If the recovery is slower and costs do remain suppressed can you give us a sense of how close you are to MLR floors and potential for MLR rebates and then how that impacts or influences your thoughts around pricing into 2021 just given the timing of all this? Thanks. John Gallina : Thank you Ralph. Great questions. First of all in terms of some of the MLR rebates as you know in our individual line of business we have earned above target margins in both 2018 and 2019 and we expected a normalization of that to occur of our margins to occur here in 2020. So obviously regardless of the length or the recovery of the COVID-19 situation, I think individuals kind to have more rebates in any circumstance. In terms of some of the other lines of business well clearly that does play a role in our modeling and in impacting really how the imbalance, inequities in the system might be handled by us throughout the year in terms of the forward view of trend, we will clearly price to the forward view of trend but we'll also have to understand the impacts on the providers, on the members, on the customers here in 2020 and make decisions accordingly. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks Ralph. I'll just follow up a little bit on John's comments because I think he hit the high points. I mean we're closely monitoring the situation and as you know this is emerging information for us around how the Corona virus will translate over the course of this year. At this stage we're really in the early, I would say stages of understanding the cost of treating our patients and including -- we're covering the co-pays and deductibles, etc. but as we think about that fundamentally we believe that as John said, we will put that into, we\u2019ll think about that, think about the entire cost structure for all of our customers and at this stage, the majority of our business is one-one and that as we get into the course of the year we'll have much better information be able to share more of that. Thank you. Next question please. Operator : We'll go to the line of Matthew Borsch. Please go ahead. Matthew Borsch : Yes. Thank you. I'm just wondering could you just comment on how you think about the trade-off between the commercial and Medicaid membership and/or the Obamacare Exchange members in terms of well, revenues maybe more clear but in terms of the earnings mix and obviously that's going to be pretty different or I would assume for fully insured versus self-funded commercial members. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question Matt. Let me, there's a number of things inside of that. So let me sort of give you a perspective. First and foremost, as we think about what's going on, our priority right now has been really to work with our customers to help them navigate this crisis. In terms of our commercial membership let me sort of break it into each of the individual pieces. Now it's pretty early in this process right now. We do expect that we will see because of the potential high unemployment some impact, certainly impact on our commercial enrollment. The early stages have been muted because of what's happening with furloughs. So thinking about that we have, as John mentioned in his comments we have a much more diversified business than we historically had. Thinking about where that membership would go versus what happened in 2008 in terms of the economic recession then we've had Medicaid expansion. So we would expect 40% to 50% of those members to potentially go into the Medicaid markets and -- in that sense we're fairly well diversified. All 14 of our markets today have both Medicare, I'm sorry Medicaid commercial and the individual exchanges plus there are 10 additional markets and the 24 we covered for Medicaid, where we don't have commercial and obviously have an opportunity to have an impact in those states as well. So again about we think 40% to 50% potentially go into the Medicaid pools. Another probably 30% or so have an opportunity to go into the individual exchanges where we also have a footprint and so that's kind of the break out as we see in terms of enrollment going forward. Another opportunity is we work with our commercial clients, I think they're really trying to understand this impact to their overall business and we have a number of affordable options for them as they think about buy downs in different products and we are seeing an increase in those opportunities but again it's really early for them and our focus has been on them keeping their employees safe and helping them to manage through this but that's roughly how we see the breakdown going forward and we'll know a lot more as we get through this over the next several months because we're pretty early into that process. Thank you. Next question please. Operator : We will go to line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes. Hi good morning. In the prepared remarks you talked about IngenioRx and outperformance that the core is performing ahead of your expectations. Can you just kind of like detail what the sources of the out performance and what's looking better and also the trends in Ingenio as a result of COVID [indiscernible] 90 day has seen an increase. Do you think that this is sustainable and how do you think that the business evolves throughout the year? John Gallina : Thank you Ricky for that question. I appreciate the opportunity to provide a little clarification on the IngenioRx first quarter results. As you know they're a separate SEC reporting segment effective this quarter and of the operating gain earnings associated with Ingenio over $349 million. That probably differs from what some folks were thinking about the $4 billion of savings that we got from moving to the CBS contract with at least 20% of that dropping to the bottom line and just very simplistic math would say that divided by four quarters that would be about $200 million per quarter. First of all it's very important to note that we had transferred ASO PBM business that our commercial lock had been administering for the last few years into IngenioRx effective January 1 of this year and that added about $75 million to $100 million through the Ingenio performance which obviously took away $75 million to $100 million from the commercial performance on a year-over-year basis. And then the rest of it was really just stronger performance. There was an impact from COVID-19. We did relax the refill too soon requirement in mid-March and we saw really a spike in scripts being filled during March that actually helped the Ingenio performance as well. So the 349 is not run rate because as we look at the rest of the year we do expect that business mix to change with some of the impacts from the economy, Medicaid to grow and then the run rate of scripts is obviously different. We have seen a slight drop in new scripts here in April over historical patterns and so the 349 you cannot just multiply by 4 but those are really the key factors and we're very, very happy with how Ingenio is performing and as you know this is a full year ahead of schedule that we're getting this $800 million dropping to the bottom line effective in for the entirety of 2020. So very happy with the Ingenio performance. Thank you for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Next question please. Operator : We'll go to the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Hi everybody and best wishes to the entire Anthem team obviously in the midst of this as well but you made the comments in the prepared remarks scale about obviously telemedicine and Telehealth and virtual care is a change that probably persist. I wonder as you guys are seeing this situation evolved, what -- any other areas or maybe even expand on that a little bit but other areas where you think there's changes that are happening that will persist long term and how this crisis is going to impact long-term healthcare delivery in the U.S.? Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question A.J. and also thanks for your kind remarks. Now as we think about this again it is an unprecedented time. We did, our first focus was really to ensure that our consumers and members had access to care and we pivoted fairly quickly to virtual care. We've always had capabilities but what we've seen is a real acceleration both through the use of our Sydney app online where people can go, check symptoms, understand where testing sites are and we've seen a dramatic increase of people using those digital capabilities. In addition, our care providers have been able to go online and use virtual care. So it's not only just virtual console but it's also texting and communication. So as we think about this there has certainly been an increase. We do think that as we re-enter the economy obviously and restart it, we have to be incredibly thoughtful, understand what the testing is and the confidence in the economy. So I do think we're going to continue to see use of a virtual care and it will continue to be an important part. It is something we started well before the pandemic but I think it also has accelerated the opportunity and people become more comfortable with it. In addition, sort of physical health the other area that we think there\u2019s significant opportunity is behavioral health and we've seen a big increase in the use of behavioral Telehealth. Again a capability we had Beacon has always had this and we've expanded it as a result of the acquisition of Beacon Healthcare. One in three visits right now we're being used through virtual opportunity and we actually do see that continuing for behavioral and mental health support. So overall, I think that's one of the most interesting. The other opportunity I have is we've been working with our care providers trying to ensure that they are able to support their patients we've seen our own teams through care more and aspire reaching out to those patients and ensuring one of our concerns is that they do get the appropriate care that they need. So our teams have been working with them both on the social supports. So I think that's another area that's really growing and as part of our Medicare Advantage plans today we do offer supplemental benefits that include many of those things. So as I think about this I think we're going to see much more virtual care. I think the social supports are going to continue to be really important behavioral health aspects not only because of loneliness which we've always known but also the use of virtual care is very important. So those are the areas that I think right now we're going to see an uptick and I think we'll see a continued one as people become much more confident in that usage. Next question please. Operator : We will go to the line of Justin Lake with Wolf Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple of quick numbers questions for me. First can you give us an update on your Medicaid margin trajectory towards that 3% target by year end and then would appreciate any comments on your employer customers in terms of what you're seeing in April around premium collectability given what's going on in the economy? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Great. Thanks Justin. I'm going to ask Felicia maybe to comment on Medicaid and then I'll go to Pete Haytaian to talk a little bit more about the commercial marketplace. Felicia? Felicia Norwood : Good morning and thank you for the question Justin. When you set aside COVID our Medicaid business was on track to end the year around 3% which is consistent with our original outlook. Our rate actions came in as expected during the quarter and our out of period adjustments were actually negligible. So we really had a clean quarter with respect to Medicaid. When you think about our Medicaid business over 50% of our Medicaid markets have rate actions that occur in the first half of the year. So we have very good visibility around that performance and if we look to the end of 2020 we may remain confident around ending the year at the midpoint of our target margin range of 2% to 4% for Medicaid. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks Felicia. Pete? Pete Haytaian : Yes. Thanks Justin. I hope you're well and the family is well. As Gail said we recognized that this is obviously a really, really challenging time for our employers and for brokers and we're very focused on creating value for them. We've been in frequent communications with them on providing solutions as it relates to premium collections. This has been a topic of conversation. First on March, March was really in line with normal months as you'd expect COVID-19 didn't really hit until the second or third week. So our premium collections as related to March was generally in line and as it relates to April we are seeing a slight uptick in the month for clients that are utilizing grace periods. In a typical month the percentage of premiums for groups that are basically taking advantage of this is basically 0.5% to 1% versus April we've seen it be around 3%. So a slight uptick but as Gail said we continue to work with our clients on options around affordability and certainly providing solutions around premium payments as a part of that. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks Pete. And just another piece of information Justin, as you think about our overall premium of 70% of our total insured premiums is part of the government business and that has been collected in time and we expect that to continue. Next question please. Operator : We will go to the line of Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Lance Wilkes : First, I certainly appreciate everything you guys are doing during the crisis. My question is really related to a number of the actions you're taking and was interested in what you think the impacts are going to be from a cash flow and investment income standpoint given acceleration of payables may be offset by slower claim submissions and then looking over on the receivable side, kind of a point of maybe some delays in premium collection. Also just had a quick clarification on your dental ASO business membership and maybe what occurred there as well. Thanks a lot. John Gallina : Sure Lance. This is John. Thank you for the question. The investment income and interest expense it's probably going to be most instructive to view these on a combined basis. So let's just maybe started to beginning of the year and what has happened in the meantime is that the markets experienced a 150 basis point Fed rate cut that we did not anticipate and then we say what's the impact of that, well about 90% of our portfolio is in fixed maturities and they're all very high quality with the duration of over four. And which means that clearly any reinvested earnings are going to be down from what our original expectations would have been. The other 10% of our portfolio certainly has been subjected to a lot of volatility and subject the same way that the overall markets been subject to a lot of volatility and it's sort of difficult to predict where that's going to end up by the end of the year at this point in time. On the debt side we do have some variable rate there. So we have a natural hedge against interest rate dropping and so we'll have a benefit on that side but maybe more importantly in order to optimize liquidity we've accessed more debt and we're carrying really higher levels of short-term cash than normal. And additionally, we do have some bonds that are going to mature in August and November under normal circumstances would have refinance those later in the year but we're going to certainly be opportunistic in terms of timing associated with that and the impacts of carrying net debt. So all in, I would say that we're really looking at the net of investment income and interest expense to be a tailwind, I'm sorry a headwind against us for the rest of the year. So we had a slight tailwind with our first quarter actual results but for the rest of the year we think it will be headwind and we've obviously taken all that in considerations as part of the $22.30 reaffirmation guidance. Gail Boudreaux : And Lance, in terms of your question on the specialty dental that really is as a result of one large client that we knew we were going to lose. It came to us as the results of our acquisition of DeCare under contract roughly 10 years ago and that contract expired in 2019. So overall our specialty business when you take that out actually had a strong quarter but that was a known loss coming out of this contract expiration as part of an acquisition. Next question please. Operator : We will come to the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : Hi good morning. I wanted to just ask a little bit for a little more detail on what you're doing with providers both hospitals health systems and your medical groups? I know you alluded to the $3 billion you've made available to providers. I think that's the broader Blue Cross system but just wanted a little more detail on is that just extending liquidity? I'd seen something from Blue Shield's those being done in conjunction with a bank taking the credit risk. I also know you made the $50 million donation to the foundation. So just wondering a little bit, what are you doing with these fee-for-service physician groups who are seeing really dramatic reductions in revenue and income in the near term? Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for your question Gary and you're right first of all the $3 billion is part of the entire Blue Cross and Blue Shield system that we have been working really close with. I think part of what makes our affiliation unique here is that just our local and deep roots and we've been sharing best practices and really trying to make sure that we can respond to the needs that we're seeing in our local community. So as part of your direct question on care providers we've been working really closely with them and I've taken several steps to help support them during these challenging times. We've obviously talked a little bit about just the co-pays and things like that but more importantly one of our immediate efforts is to work with them and ensure that payments are made to them on a timely basis. So first and foremost we've been working with each of our provider groups to ensure that their receivables, etc. are important. They're reducing our administrative burden as well taking off pre-authorizations and really our focus has been to help them do what they need to do best which is serve patients in this environment. Proactively, as we think about our focus has also been on working closely in our communities. You mentioned in our fee-for-service providers in our local markets. That's an area that we have worked on each of our communities a little different in terms of their needs but our care provider teams are working with them to try to understand how we ensure that we're a good partner to them as part of our value-based care many of them are in, our value-based care arrangements. So we've been again working with them to support their needs so that they can stay viable during this time as well as enhance their ability to do Telehealth and other things to make sure that they can serve their patients. And on the government side of our business, particularly in Medicaid, we've been working very closely with our state partners to understand those critical providers and that we can provide them the right resources and support across their patient base. So I think as we look at that now one of the things that we also -- I think it is important to point out is that pre-COVID Anthem and the Blues across the system had some of the lowest days and claim payable in the industry. So we were already a fairly quick payer for these providers but even in addition of that we wanted to make sure that any of their receivables we're working to clean that up and ensure that they had separate cash. So those have been the areas that we have been predominantly focused on but again across the system we're sharing best practices and really trying to understand how we help and support providers as they really focus on direct delivery of patient care. Next question please. Operator : We'll go to the line of Sarah James with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, this is Chris [indiscernible] on for Sarah. Just a quick question on the commercial book and how are you pricing for the June 1 renewals? So that can you share kind of around the conversation you're having for those and I guess specifically assuming that if we do have a fall COVID-19 peak that will drive some delayed surgeries in \u201921, so you just -- any commentary on pricing for that cost [trend] assumption. Gail Boudreaux : Sure. I'm going to ask Pete Haytaian. I think it's pretty consistent with the previous question as well, Pete maybe to give a little bit more color just to better our commercial business. Pete? Pete Haytaian : Yes, sure Gail and I think it is consistent. Most of our book as Gail said renews on January 1 and this is such an unprecedented event there are so many moving pieces and parts and so getting our arms around it, this is something that we're very focused on but things will evolve over the next few weeks and months. It will give us t better visibility into rates and what we do with increases in the back half of the year and towards January 1. We feel like we still have time in that regard as it relates to the near term rate increases, we don't have a lot of our book really renewing in the near term and since COVID wasn\u2019t apparent at that time, it was not as greatly considered but as Gail said most of our book renewing in January 1 we have plenty of time once we see how medical costs and deferred electives occur in the back half of the year. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you Pete and also just I think to reiterate, we said this in the earlier commentary but I think it's part we always and we're going to keep saying consistent and disciplined pricing to our forward view of costs but we also recognize that this is a unique situation in terms of what's happening and we will work with our consumers and our customers to ensure that inequities that occur along the way that we are taking that into consideration as we understand the cost patterns of exactly what's happening. Next question please. Operator : We will go to the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi good morning. It's Dave [indiscernible] for Windley. First question was just on, I was curious about the use of the $3.2 billion of PBM savings that's not going to shareholders. Is that something which is obviously in your control that you might use to support some of the EPS headwinds that you guys have disclosed and then just a quick second one, I'm wondering if you could provide an apples to apples commercial operating margin comparison than the commercial ASO pharmacies now out of that for the first quarter of this year? John Gallina : Thank you Dave for the question. So first of all on the $3.2 billion that you're referencing which is the amount that's been provided back to members and consumers to help control healthcare costs associated with our better PBM deal. The way that we approach that is we really looked at each line of business and looked at it from a competitive marketplace, looked at it from a geographic marketplace where we were versus the competitors how close were we to MLR rebate MLR floors and went through and like a Medicare Advantage look that the benefit designs and how we could include our enhanced benefit designs and still ensure we achieve target margins. And we went through a very painstaking process as I said with every line of business geography by geography by geography we end up going a little bit better than the 20% as you can tell by our first quarter operating results. But it's not a lever in and of itself that we could just pull and take a large chunk that down to the bottom line. We are in a very competitive environment and we are trying to deliver the appropriate value to our members at the appropriate pricing. So we've always aspired to do a bit better but it's not just a short-term lever that we can pull. It's something that is part of a larger overall strategy in terms of price points, product designs and all the other types of things. And then the second part of your question associated with just year-over-year comparison. Really the most significant issue is to take the commercial operating gain that's shown in the press release and just go ahead and subtract $75 million to $100 million out of the [op gain] from the first quarter of 2019 and then what you'll have is something that's much closer to an apples to apples comparison of how that commercial segments actually performed year-over-year. Gail Boudreaux : Next question please. Operator : We will go the line of Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I had a question just on how you're thinking about the exchange strategy in terms of the footprint in participation for next year. I know that you've taken a pretty disciplined approach towards market selection over the last couple of years but clearly just given the significant market shifts that will likely occur on how aggressively you're thinking about ramping that up and then maybe if you could just remind us at this point across your 14 Blue states just in terms of what your current footprint is on the exchange market? Gail Boudreaux : Great. Thank you for the question, Scott. I'll start and then I'll maybe ask Pete to give a little bit more color on it but I think appreciate your comments because I think you're right on that. We have been -- I think taken an active involvement in the individual market and state in the exchanges but have been prudent in terms of where we think we have the best opportunities to have an impact and we've been balanced. So we modestly expanded our footprint within our 14 states in 2020 but as we shared with you on previous calls we weren't rescaling it. We're really taking a measured balanced approach. We actually feel that we have a really good footprint going into this and an opportunity to offer some really compelling products to our members in those 14 states as part of the individual exchange. So with that maybe I will ask Pete to give some commentary just on the thinking because his team has been really involved in, how we think about the exchanges and our opportunities. Pete? Pete Haytaian : Yes. Sure. Thanks Gail and thanks Scott for the question. Yes, I am really proud of the team and the approach we've been very thoughtful over the last couple of years with regard to how we expand. We have been expanding our focal point in almost every instance is ensuring that we can partner with the right providers. We look very closely at value-based relationships. We look at where we can partner on critical clinical programs as well as programs like risk adjustment and then obviously where we can have the most viable and affordable product and choice for membership and that strategy's really played through over the last couple of years. We haven't fundamentally changed that and so as we think about what's happening with COVID and the potential recession we still are following those principles but as Gail said with respect to coverage we have pretty decent coverage across our 14 states. It certainly does vary and in some states we are very competitive across most of the counties in the state. In other states we are much more targeted and I don't think we're going to fundamentally change that approach if we can be competitive in many counties in the state we will be, but if we don't feel like we can we're going to be disciplined and not necessarily re-enter. Gail Boudreaux : Next question please. Operator : We'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. I wanted to follow up on the comments that John made earlier about thinking that about 30% or 40% of the cost that you guys cover are deferrable in some way. I am just wondering is that based upon kind of real-time data? I think most of the providers that we've talked to have said that there is going to be much bigger drop in [indiscernible] would have thought was possible. So just wanted to understand this for your historical view on costs are kind of informed by the real term real time drop in utilization that seems more perverse than average and then just try to get a sense of when you do see drops like this in the past, what percentage goes away versus ultimately gets rescheduled and whether you think that percentage might change this time around? John Gallina : Thank you Kevin for the question. In terms of the 30% to 40% that was based more on a historical view and it may be closer to the higher end of the range in terms of what we're seeing right now and with real time utilization but that's our historical view and we call it not emergent care and the things you can pick up the phone and schedule but it's been pretty consistent for us over the last couple years when we've done the study and the analysis. In terms of the percent that gets deferred and the pent-up demand is comes back as increased utilization versus what gets canceled all together. We've certainly looked into that and we've studied things like when there were snow days, or when there were hurricanes or natural disasters but those are all helpful, I don't know that they're really going to provide us the exact information we need from a modeling perspective because this is such an unprecedented time and it's just different. The scope and duration of the entire COVID-19 issue is going to be different than anything we've seen and so while we do expect a small amount to not come back it's really too early to provide an estimate or a percentage of what we think will be pent-up demand and the increased utilization in the future but we know that there will be increased utilization in the future once people are more comfortable going back to the hospital and to the doctor. Gail Boudreaux : And I would also add that we also know and appreciate the patients are avoiding seeking some care in the interim and so that's an area with underlying medical conditions that we are concerned about and that could worsen. So we are closely trying to monitor and help those patients and make sure that they have the right access. So again as John shared this is unlike any of the historical models that we've had. We have certainly done a lot of modeling but at this stage I think it's really hard to give any point estimates about where this will end up and really appreciate your understanding of that. Next question please. Operator : Charles Rhyee, your line is open. Charles Rhyee : Hi, can you hear me? Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Please. Charles Rhyee : Okay. Great. Thanks for taking the question. First a clarification, I think to an earlier question. I think the question on virtual care. Gail, did you mention on sort of what percent of your ASO clients are currently signed up for LiveHealth Online and is that something that's easily turned on so if clients wanted to access Telehealth, is that something they can get onto for this current period or is that something they'd have to look at for next year? And then secondly, John you were talking about -- we've been talking a lot about sort of deferred cost and one area where we're looking at it seems like investment income came in higher than were expected and I think if you were to annualized the amount in the first quarter will be probably above sort of the guidance range for the full year, yes we've seen rates fall. Is there something in the 1Q number that we're missing here and so if we think that number normalizes for where interest rates have kind of fallen to? We have less share repo as well. We have higher incremental interest expense. Are you kind of implying that the amount of elective procedures? You do expect to come back still, we're going to set the big drop in second quarter, it's going to come back a little bit in third and fourth but net, net we're still going to be down fairly significantly for the full year or do you think at the end of the day we might net out roughly close as we kind of exceed normal capacity let's say in the fourth quarter? Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Well, thank you for that very thorough question. Now I know we had a gap in the timing. You were accumulating all of those but appreciate the question. We will try to address them. Let me start with first your question about LiveHealth Online. First and foremost Sydney Care which is the app that LiveHealth Online is using as well as our engaged, we've seen more than a 39% increase since 2019 well ahead of our expectations and by the way Sydney Care is part of COVID-19. We have offered to anyone who wants to use it, so this is not a subscription service. You can essentially sign on, download the application, do the Corona virus symptom checking as well as the testing and that's been very strongly used. So we think it's obviously a capability more broadly. But if you think about LiveHealth Online it's one of the aspects of virtual care and again very strong usage but also -- I also think we're going to see more virtual care within our -- sort of traditional care providers because they have also pivoted to that. So not only are we seeing an increased usage in the virtual part of it but also texting back and forth in terms of symptom checking and other things. So a lot of strength their continued. We've seen continued growth. We saw an initial surge certainly when the shelter-in-place orders were given but we're continuing to see that week over week. So I think it's going to continue to grow and again 39% increase so far and I\u2019d expect it to continue to grow through the course of the year. With that I'll ask John maybe address your other questions. John Gallina : Thank you Charles. So in terms of the investment income and interest expense it's consistent with the question that Lance asked earlier and that is that, we did have a very strong first quarter in that perspective but given all the comments that made before about the 150% basis or a 150 basis points Fed rate cut the fact that 10% of our portfolio has been subject to some extreme volatility. The fact that we're accumulating cash to really address our liquidity issues and to ensure that we have enough cash and assets to maintain and pay all of our claims and accessing the debt markets maybe a little bit earlier than normal on a net basis that will be a headwind for the rest of the year and we just haven't quantified that at this point but it's all part of the $22.30 [indiscernible]. And then the last question on the deferrable procedures in the 30% to 40%. Right now we're expecting that the second quarter medical loss ratio and the second quarter earnings per share will be very favorable to historical numbers and a very low MLR on a comparable basis here in the second quarter and then we do expect the pent-up demand to come in. The real question is what's the duration of the COVID-19 situation before the deferrable procedures really kick back up and there's a very good chance that many of those deferral procedures will work away into 2021. And so when you're looking at 2020 in a vacuum there's a good chance that we'll be in that positive but over the course of a couple of years people will get to care and we will have the cost structure associated. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you John. Next question please. Operator : We will go to the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Mr. Hill you have taken yourself out of queue. [Operator Instructions] George Hill : Hello? Operator : Mr. Hill your line is open. George Hill : Okay. Sorry. I don't know what happened there team. I guess just we would probably be in the beginning of the PBM and managed care selling season for 2021 right now and I guess I was focused on Ingenio with the market traction it had shown recently. I guess can you say whether or not you started to see the PBM selling season for 2021 start to move as normal with people working remotely and benefits consultants working remotely or you kind of expected selling season to be a push until the \u201821 selling season starter? I guess any comments around the selling season as it relates to the virus would be helpful. Gail Boudreaux : Sure. Thank you for the question. I think we are operating in an incredibly rapidly changing environment. I think it's still early to really understand the full implications. With that the way our sales cycle work a lot of activity for the beginning of next year really does occur now and we are seeing a slowdown in decisions. I mean, I think employers are particularly focused on ensuring the safety and health of their employees first and foremost and also trying to understand the implications to their own businesses. With that said we had a really strong pipeline and what we expect across many of these procurement opportunities that they'll just, they'll move out further into next year. And so I think we still have really during opportunities but I do think we are going to see some deferred decisions just because of what's happening across this environment and need for employers really to focus on their own business right now and the health and safety of their employees. With that said I think we've had a very compelling offering and still feel really strongly about the value proposition particularly the opportunities inside of our fee based business and in the commercial business. Thank you. Next question. Operator : We will go to the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Can you hear me, okay? Gail Boudreaux : We can. Thanks Josh. Josh Raskin : Excellent. I wanted to follow up on the commercial membership and understand that March was \u201cnormal\u201d month from an enrollment perspective but sort of curious on early membership trends in April and do you get information on furloughs that where people actually maintain their benefits? Are you just getting benefit roles or are you actually getting employment roles? And then sort of the last part of that is just ancillary benefit cross-sell you guys have talked a lot about that trying to increase your ASO fee on a PMPM basis and do you think that sort of slows down the process, you sort of mentioned that the last question that employers are kind of just making sure everybody is okay first. So a couple of questions there just on commercial membership? Gail Boudreaux : Sure. Thanks Josh. I'm going to have Pete Haytaian to answer your questions. Pete? Pete Haytaian : Yes. Thanks. Josh. Yes with respect to April it hasn't been fundamentally different than March. As Gail said in her commentary we are seeing furloughs accelerate. We obviously had the PPP, the federal relief and folks taking advantage of that. We've been working closely with our employers and brokers on affordable options. We've been working closely with them on creating relief around premium payments. So all that activity as it relates to April, we really haven't, we haven't seen an acceleration yet in disenrollment. We are beginning to see signs of that in the last couple of weeks of April. We did see in group change start to accelerate, so employees beginning to fall off the rolls but not to a very [Technical Difficulty] numbers more broadly we are expecting that to accelerate in the next month or so. And again our focal point has been creating solutions for employers and brokers, buy downs alternative to products, etc. As it relates to furloughs, yes we do get information from clients. We are very closely connected with our brokers and our employers. We've had multiple webinars. We've had multiple outreaches. We're staying close to them. They're actually asking us for a lot of advice around things like that. So for example, if they have, if they're furloughing employees and/or if they're reducing hours of employees what kind of options exist for them. So I think that is part of the reason why you're not seeing as much activity in April out of the gate and then as it relates to our ancillary benefit strategy and our margin improvement in the ASO business, we had a really strong \u201819 in that regard. We had a strong first quarter in that regard. To Gail's point earlier with respect to RFPs slowing down that will inevitably affect us in 2020 as it relates to performing around the 5 to 1 to 3 to 1, but I think the other important part to point out around that is we're selling a lot of incremental value as it relates to going from 5 to 1 to 3 to 1 and it actually translates into affordability. So when you think about critical clinical programs and packaging of those programs, when you think of stop-loss, when you think of pharmacy and the integrated value proposition of pharmacy to the extent that we can sell through on that and have Anthem be a single source solution. I think we're enabling more affordability but that's with eyes wide open and the understanding that some of that may slow down in 2020. We are though once we get out of this we feel very good about continuing on our path to 3 to 1 and if not for COVID, Josh we would stick with what we had said and that is that we were on a path to definitely get to 4 to 1 in 2020. So we might see a slight slowdown in that but it'll pick up again. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks Pete and Josh just a little bit more color on Pete's commentary and your specifics about how do we know what's happening as we do the deep analytics on our business, we are looking at SIC code obviously and just a little bit of color on that, our book does skew a little more towards large municipalities which are a little more stable as well as essential workers right now. So that's why you wouldn't see as much of that kind of furlough activity early on in our book of business. And we're going to take the last question please. Operator : And that question comes from the Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Steve Willoughby : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Just a quick follow up on a comment that John was discussing earlier as it relates to utilization coming back in the back half of the year, John in your prepared remarks you made a comment about assessing the healthcare systems capacity and I was just wondering if you could provide any more color or how you're thinking about that once we get any other side of this virus? How are you guys thinking in terms of the healthcare system being able to absorb capacity or utilization above normal? Thank you. John Gallina : Thank you Steve. That's a great question and certainly if there's a couple of thousand \u2013 thousands of providers out there, there's probably thousands of answers to that question but there's only so many surgeons, there's only so many beds, there's only so many access or availability to appropriate points of care and it's really difficult to give an exact percentage or difficult to provide something that's really specific from a modeling perspective but as you look at the various facilities that are out there and the information that many of us have -- have available to us from the public marketplace and you look at some of the productivity and capacity percentages at these large public hospitals, you can then make assumptions from there in terms of just how much they can even do. And quite honestly given the duration of this virus in this situation, once the pent-up demand comes through, I don't think it's possible that it'll be able to be handled in a short period of time. I think it's an elongated period of time for the pent-up demand to work its way through the system. And that assumes that everyone is comfortable scheduling their procedures and going back to the hospital and going back to the doctor's offices as well which is another variable on that. So it's just one of many-many-many variables but it's a very important variable. Thank you for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you John and thank you to everyone who joined us this morning. Despite the challenges facing this country with COVID-19, Anthem is well-positioned to fulfill our promises to those we serve in this new era for healthcare. As we move through this pandemic we'll continue to lead and lend our voices and perspectives across the healthcare system to support our members and customers as well as our care provider and other partners. The lives of those we serve we now changed and in that spirit Anthem is also evolving to create a simpler more affordable and more effective healthcare experience in this new context. I'm confident we will emerge on the other side of this current pandemic even stronger and more nimble as the healthcare partner of choice demonstrating the strength of our brand where Blue Cross and Blue Shield currently serves nearly 1 in 3 people in the United States today. We hope you all stay safe and well and thank you again for joining us. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen this conference is available for replay starting at 10 :30 A.M.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Please, go ahead. Chris Rigg : Good morning and welcome to Anthem's second quarter 2020 earnings call. This is Chris Rigg, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of our Commercial & Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Boudreaux : Good morning and thank you for joining us for Anthem\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings call. Since our last earnings review, our business has continued to evolve and respond to the ongoing health crisis and social justice issues facing society. The impacts of these events are profound for associates, local communities, and all those we serve. Over the past several months, Anthem has continued to take bold steps to directly support those who need our help.  Last quarter, we took action to commit $2.5 billion in financial assistance, to ease the burden of COVID-19 among our members, employer, customers, air providers and non-profit partners. The needs are ongoing, and I'm proud of the way Anthem has responded quickly to provide needed support. We remain committed to creating a more affordable healthcare experience for our valued members and customers. To that end, we remove barriers to care by waiving cost sharing for treatment of COVID-19, including coverage for testing, treatment, and in-patient hospital stays. We also waive prior authorizations for COVID-19 diagnostic tests and related covered services. To date, we've paid approximately $500 million associated with COVID-19 related diagnoses. In addition, we provided our associates, individual and employer group customers with a one-month premium credit ranging from 10% to 15% while individuals on our standalone and group dental plans received a 50% credit. We continue to deliver value to our customers by providing them with flexible payment terms, as well as affordable buy down options as they navigate the crisis. Our unwavering commitment to our local communities is an integral part of our strategy and legacy at Anthem. For more than 75 years, we've understood the privilege and responsibility. We have to make positive change in the communities where we live and work. This commitment reflects our mission and all that we stand for. And it was at the heart of our recent $50 million pledge over the next five years to focus directly on health disparities, racial inequities, and the key drivers of health such as food and security, mental health, housing, and economic recovery. We know that food security is one of the most profound needs in the wake of the pandemic. A recent study showed that nearly 40% of households today report moderate to high levels of food insecurity, with children being impacted the most. To combat this trend, we are increasing our support as a leading national partner with Feeding America. Here in our home state of Indiana, we were pleased to recently announce a partnership with Gleaners Food Bank to provide more than 10 million meals as part of our $1 million matching grant to expand access to nutritious food. Our associates are doing their part to give back as well and it's inspiring. They're deeply committed to fulfilling our purpose, and have donated more than 27,000 hours of virtual volunteering with online mentoring, teaching, community outreach, along with donating much needed resources to local organizations, and today, our social responsibility efforts take a bold new step, as I am pleased to announce we are signing on to the UN Global Compact.  Now, more than ever, we recognize the important societal role we play to help shape a stronger, more inclusive, and more sustainable world. As we reflect on our performance, the quarter clearly demonstrates the strength of our diverse portfolio and trust in the Anthem brand. Despite declines in our commercial business, losses were less than expected, particularly in our local group, risk-based business where in-group attrition was partially offset by new sales exceeding lapses. Medical enrollment increased by 1.6 million lives or nearly 4%, compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting growth in our commercial, Medicare and Medicaid businesses. Putting that growth in perspective, Medicaid enrollment grew sequentially by nearly 10 times the decline in our risk-based employer group enrollment. The pandemic has impacted our Medicaid and Medicare populations particularly hard, and we have moved quickly to deliver true whole person care. Our customer care associates have been doing one-on-one outreach to our vulnerable members, ensuring access to food, safe housing, as well as guiding new members through on-boarding and helping them enroll in support programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. To date, we've reached out to 80% of our high-risk Medicaid and Medicare members, and this work continues. I remain grateful to our care provider partners for their ongoing work on the frontlines of care delivery. As part of our support to those partners, we've simplified policies and procedures, including temporarily suspending prior authorization requirements for patient transfers, oxygen supplies, respiratory devices, and multifunction ventilators, enabling them to focus on delivering exceptional care. In addition, we're extending financial support to targeted primary care physicians who are facing undue pressures during this period, as utilization slowly returns to normal levels. Our compassionate and committed care providers in CareMore, Aspire and HealthSun are beginning to return to direct care for our most vulnerable members. These touch points include the use of remote patient monitoring for a variety of chronic conditions, such as congestive heart failure and COPD, along with in-home and online care and support. If we think about innovation, Anthem is helping shape our industry for the digital future. We are pioneering technologies to deliver personalized care designed to improve total health to help consumers manage their health and wellness at every stage of life. Digital first is the cornerstone of the future of healthcare. And our experiences with COVID-19 have only accelerated our efforts in this space. For employer customers and government partners, we recently launched the C19 Navigator and C19 Explorer tools to aggregate real time COVID-19 data to help inform and guide return to workplace decisions and resource planning. And for consumers, our Sydney Care solution is using data and AI to help individuals triage their own symptoms and seek care directly from their phone. To date, we've facilitated more than 475,000 telehealth visits in 82,000 COVID-19 assessments. As one of the first managed care companies to partner with Amazon Alexa, Anthem members can now use our new Anthem Skill, personal voice assistant to check their health plan details, schedule calls with customer representatives and renew prescriptions directly through their Alexa enabled devices. At its recent peak, virtual health visits by our members were up 300% relative to pre-COVID levels. Live health online, our on demand telehealth solution surpassed 1 million visits in early April and demand continues. Demand for telemedicine in the behavioral health space is also increasing with the usage at 56 times pre-COVID levels. Our Beacon behavioral health team has responded to this growing need and pivoted quickly to help transition care providers to a digital interface, enhance online supports and services for consumers and conduct outreach for our most at risk members to address special care needs. Collaborative partnerships continue to be a strategic focus in Anthem. We were pleased to join \u201cThe Fight Is In Us\u201d campaign, a results driven public private partnership focused on the promising use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma to help improve outcomes and treatments for those with active infection. We're also pleased to serve as a founding partner of the XPRIZE pandemic alliance, working to help develop scalable tests that are rapid, accurate, and low cost. The alliance is a global coalition leveraging the power of collaboration, competition, and shared innovation to accelerate solutions that can be applied to COVID-19 and future pandemics. Looking ahead, we recognize there is much unknown regarding the magnitude and duration of this pandemic given the recent resurgence in COVID-19 cases across the country. Despite this uncertainty, Anthem is well-positioned to achieve our 2020 EPS guidance and deliver on our longer-term financial goal. And with that, I will now turn the call over to John Gallina to discuss our financial results. John? John Gallina : Thank you, Gail, and good morning. Since the inception of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have worked diligently to serve as a trusted partner for our members and care providers. We proactively committed $2.5 billion in financial support, including extended cost share waivers, premium credits, provided grants, and community support. And this is all while rolling out new and innovative solutions to maximize the health and well-being of our members. While much remains uncertain, we're guided by our values and are firmly committed to rectifying further imbalances for the benefit of our consumers. COVID-19 significantly impacted the normal seasonality inherent in our business as a result of the broad based deferral of healthcare utilization in the second quarter. We achieved adjusted earnings per share of $9.20 in the second quarter, bringing year to date adjusted earnings per share to $15.68. The seasonality of our earnings will differ from our historic patterns. And as we have previously announced, we expect to earn approximately 70% of our annual total in the first six months of the year. Relative to our baseline financial expectations, aggregate utilization was 40% below expectations in April and 20% in May, as people nationwide adhered to shelter in place orders. Our June experience, while still early, suggests a utilization recovery to roughly 90% of baseline. Looking ahead, our guidance assumes the recent recovery in utilization persists and second half utilization comes in slightly ahead of our pre-COVID-19 baseline expectations. All in, we expect this dynamic to increase our second half medical loss ratio by a couple hundred basis points relative to what normal seasonality would have suggested. Medical membership totaled 42.5 million members at the end of the second quarter, reflecting an increase of 1.6 million members, representing nearly 4% growth over the prior year quarter. Even more impressive is that we grew during the second quarter, organically adding 309,000 net new members during these uncertain times. Government business enrollment grew by nearly 600,000 lives in the quarter, more than double the decline in commercial enrollment. Attrition in our commercial business has been less than expected today. However, we believe attrition is likely to accelerate when federal assistance expires. Nonetheless, we expect to mitigate declines in commercial enrollment through growth in our Medicaid and individual ACA businesses. We believe we have the most balanced and resilient membership mix in the sector. In periods of strong economic success, such as the company enjoyed in 2019, we grew our membership. In 2020, during more economically challenging times, we again have been able to grow our membership. Our strategy and business mix allows us to perform well in both positive and negative economic conditions. Overall, we're pleased with how our membership is trending. Results through the second quarter reflect our deliberate efforts to build a more diversified Anthem over the last decade, maintaining our strong commercial franchise, while establishing an industry leading Medicaid platform in a rapidly growing Medicare business. Operating revenue was $29.2 billion in the quarter, growth of nearly 16% over the prior year, and 14% on a HIF-adjusted basis. Growth and operating revenue was driven by the launch of IngenioRx and the related increase in product revenue, membership gains in Medicaid and Medicare, as well as the return of the health insurer fee in 2020. Days and claims payable was 46 days, an increase of 4.1 days from the first quarter, and a 6.9 day increase from the second quarter of 2019. Given the uncertainty, we have taken a conservative posture related to our claims reserves. We expect [DCP] to decline to levels more in-line with historical norms as utilization rebounds in the second half of the year. Operating cash flow was very strong at 2.4 times net income. Cash flow in the quarter benefited from several timing related items, including the delay of certain federal and payroll tax payments in accordance with the CARES Act. In the third quarter, we'll be making three federal tax payments and the $1.6 billion health insurer fee payment.  As a reminder, we took a number of immediate actions in the first quarter to enhance our financial flexibility. We ended the second quarter with approximately $4.1 billion of cash and investments at the parent company. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 39.5%, a decrease of 220 basis points, compared to the 41.7% in the first quarter reflecting our enhanced liquidity position. With liquidity concerns not as prevalent as they were earlier in the year, we have resumed our share repurchase program and continue to expect to repurchase greater than $1.5 billion of shares for the year. To conclude, our performance in the quarter clearly demonstrates that the value of our diversified model is real. As we look ahead, we expect additional commercial enrollment attrition and strong growth in our Medicaid business. Thus far, COVID-19 is not significantly impacting our individual Medicare Advantage growth, which continues to enjoy a mid-double digit growth trajectory. Although much remains uncertain about the impact and ramifications of the pandemic, our rigorous scenario analyses continue to support our original full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance of greater than $22.30. While we have reconfirmed our earnings per share guidance, we continue to withhold guidance on all other metrics. And with that, we will now open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] For our first question we'll go to the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ricky Goldwasser : Yeah. Hi. Thank you. Good morning. So, you've maintained guidance as you assume some return to normalization in the back half of the year, can you give us some more color on what you're seeing in specific regions where COVID cases are coming back? Obviously, there have been some reports that some of the places are deferring [indiscernible] again, how should we think about the [net deferred] [ph] coming back from being deferred in second Q versus second half? John Gallina : Thank you, Ricky. Appreciate the question. You know, and it's certainly an understatement to say that there's a lot of uncertainty associated with the situation, but you know, we still have a lot of pent-up demand from the second quarter, and you know, we have extended payment of covering co-pays and deductibles for COVID-19 treatment. And in addition, we're providing reimbursement for PPE for dental providers, as well as other benefits we're providing to the provider community. And while an increase in the COVID and the recent spike we have certainly may cause more deferred procedures, right now, we're not expecting a full shutdown of the system similar to what we experienced in April. And so given all the variables, we still do believe that a reasonable estimate will be that our second half medical loss ratio will be about 200 basis points higher in the last part of the year versus what would be expected under normal circumstances. And I guess the only other comment is to note that we did provide the $2.5 billion of value to the system as a result of what's going on. And if non-emergent utilization drops significantly again, you know, we'll certainly take appropriate actions to help address whatever imbalance exist associated with that. So, appreciate the question, but we really do think that the $22.30 EPS guidance is really the best guess right now. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, Ricky. Next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake with Wolf Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple questions on Medicaid. Can you talk about your \u2013 what you saw in membership in the second quarter in terms of lack of churn versus new membership? How you think about that\u2019s going to progress into the back half of the year? And then any comments on rate pressure and what we've built in for the assumption there into the 2020 guide would be helpful as well? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, Justin. I'tm going to have Felicia comment, but I think, as you noted, we feel very strongly about the membership gains we saw, and specific to your question, the vast majority were due to the stopping of re-verification versus unemployment and other things that would have occurred during that time. But as we look at our overall membership growth, again, we feel we also gained share during this time as strong brand resonated. But I'll have Felicia maybe give you a little bit more color in terms of the discussions with the states. Felicia? Felicia Norwood : Thank you, Gail. And thank you for the question. Our Medicaid enrollment in the second quarter ended at approximately 8.2 million members. This was up 566,000 compared to the first quarter. And as Gail mentioned, that was primarily due to the temporary suspension of re-verifications. Our early indications for July as well indicates continued growth in the Medicaid program. We feel very good about our brand and we continue to grow share in the Medicaid space. You know, looking ahead, we believe we're well-positioned to be able to navigate whatever happens in this emerging environment. And the expectation is that we will continue to see Medicaid growth during this time. Roughly 13% to 15% of our members reside in states where Medicaid has [been standard] [ph]. So, while it's too early to quantify the potential impact, certainly if the unemployment rate increases, we would expect growth in our government business to certainly continue to offset any membership declines that might happen on the commercial side. In terms of your question with respect to rate, you know, we certainly won't disclose the amount of any of the experience rated refunds or rate actions, but as John mentioned earlier, our guidance reflects a reasonable view of both our known and expected rate actions and the experience rated refunds. You know, rates are required to be actuarially sound and we work with our state partners on a daily basis on developing rates that are going to be appropriate. You know, the performance across our 24 markets varies even under normal circumstances, but as you know, some states are reopening and other states are seeing a resurgence in COVID cases. Roughly 15 of our states today have risk [quarters] [ph] or [callers] [ph] in place that effectively already limit managed care profitability within certain defined ranges and we are in discussions with other states that are also considering these kind of mechanisms, which really provides some predictability for both the states in our own business and really tries to ensure that risk is really properly balanced. We have a long history with our state partners, and we're going to continue to work through this with them, and make sure we are able to provide access to care to our members. And that really remains our foremost concern during this time. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, Justin. And just sort of reiterating, I think what Felicia said, we feel that it's been very constructive dialogue with the states and you know, it's part of our model, that it's a continuous conversation that we're in with them, but overall from a growth perspective, and where we are from a share we feel quite good about our Medicaid performance. Next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Stephen Tanal with SVB Leerink. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Stephen Tanal : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to ask on the segments, it looked like the government business, profit dollars, margin rate, you know, kind of maybe benefited more from COVID in the quarter anyway then the commercial side. I don't know if I'm reading too much into that, but just wanted to understand how the pandemic affected the two lines of business? And really separately, just following up on Felicia\u2019s comment just now, I think she said that you guys expect government enrollment to offset any changes on the commercial side going forward? So, wanted to clarify that, maybe get a little bit of context on just the mix shift between commercial and Medicaid and how you guys think about the profit dollars and the revenue associated with those two businesses and what is one commercial life worth on the Medicaid side, for example, that would be helpful? Thank you. John Gallina : Yeah, thank you for the question, Steve. First of all, in the segment reporting and in the benefit of the deferred utilization, it would be \u2013 the deferred utilization actually was a little bit more significant in the commercial market than it was in Medicaid, and then it was the least amount in Medicare in terms of the impact of the non-emergent procedures and the decreased cost structure. However, in the commercial segment, we provided the premium credits to the membership to all of our customers, you know, 10% to 15% on the local business and up to 50% on the specialty business, and the entirety of that was recorded in the second quarter for that entire premium credit. And so that's what is probably the reconciling item in your analysis when you're looking at the quarter-over-quarter is that the premium credits are in the commercial market. And then the commercial market also has the premium cost share waivers for COVID testing and treatment that are part of the commercial results. Associated with the ongoing business and the profitability, we certainly have target margins on all of our businesses. And in the commercial marketplace, you know, the target margins on a fully insured business could easily be 5%, even high single digits, and that could easily work out based on average premium, the $25 to $30 PMPM operating game. However, on the ASO side, the fee revenue is obviously much, much less and a target profit on the fee side could be just $5 PMPM. And then you look over at the Medicaid, well Medicaid you have TANF and you have the higher acuity. There's a lot of variations there, but you know, even at a 2% to 4% op margin, which is our stated op margin for Medicaid, if you utilize the midpoint being 3%, based on the various premium volumes, you have maybe a $12 to an $18 target margin on a PMPM basis. So, as you can see when we lose a commercial member, depending on that if it's fully insured or ASO and it goes over to government, it could actually balance out quite nicely. That's one of the reasons that we continue to talk about how diversified our business mix is and how resilient our membership is, is because the profit margins on the various lines of business really help offset each other when there's a shift between the various areas. Thank you for that question. Stephen Tanal : Helpful, thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Stephen, just a little clarification on the membership comment you said about the offset, I just want to clarify a couple things. One, as we look at our overall commercial enrollment, as we shared in our prepared remarks, we were down 290,000 lives, but as you think about unemployed appointment that was fairly muted and particularly so as our risk based lives. So, that was, we do expect, we think that furloughs have dampened that impact over the course of your day, but we feel are very resilient, quite frankly in our commercial business, and we're really pleased that our sales offset our lapses, actually, in the quarter as we look at our risk group business, so another sign that I think our teams have really put out some affordable products and have been doing a nice job of managing through this. But on overall basis, you know, we've often talked about having this large catcher's mitt of opportunity. I think clarifying what Felicia was saying a little more specifically, as you look at the quarter, and I shared in my remarks, are Medicaid outpaced our risk lives by 10 times, so clearly offset much of that. And also it's quite compelling when you're trading risk lives for fee based lives. So, a lot of our losses came in our self-funded ASO customers and we were able to generate much more in our risk life. So overall, we do expect as unemployment continues to lose more commercial lives. So, I don't want to leave you with the impression that we won't, but overall, we feel we had a very resilient catcher's mitt across our book of business. So thanks for the question. And next question please. Stephen Tanal : Thank you. Operator : For our next question we\u2019ll go to A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Yeah, I guess the first thing is a tough one there, but anyway, good to hear from everyone. Maybe I'll just ask about Ingenio, obviously the ramp up and profitability was a big part of the story this year, how are you doing relative to your expectations there? How's the COVID situation impacting trends that you would have otherwise expected to see in a normal year and any comment on the selling season for the PBM as we get toward the end of that for 2021? John Gallina : Good morning, A.J. and thank you for the question. You know, IngenioRx is actually doing quite well and has really done a nice job of meeting our expectations. As you know, we really are in the Ingenio swing of things a full-year earlier than we had expected to, you know based on the original timeline of the ESI contract and being able to get out of that a year ahead. And so 2020 is actually a run rate year, as opposed to an implementation year. And, you know, in terms of the profitability itself, we made about 350 million in first quarter, 304 million here this quarter. And, you know, there's really a few key things going into that. You know the $4 billion in savings that we got from the better contract with CVS, and we've always talked about returning 20% of that to the shareholders, and \u2013 which would be $800 million. Well as we've gone through the first half of the year, and really tried to optimize and maximize the situation, and we believe that we're going to actually return closer to 900 million of that value throughout the course of 2020, and be part of our run rate on a go forward basis. Also Ingenio includes the shift of 75 million to 100 million of operating gain related to existing self-funded pharmacy customers that was previously recorded in the commercial segment, and is now being recorded in the Ingenio segment. And so that's all part of the situation. And then, you know, certainly any revenues or profits from third party business are included in Ingenio as well as that\u2019s helping with the overall profitability of the segment. And you know, the first quarter was benefited by the refill too soon relaxation of that edit. And we had an impact there that helped the first quarter to be, maybe higher than a run rate type basis, but you know, we really do believe that the second quarter is a good indication of what the run rate could be, maybe even a little bit better because as scripts, while maintenance scripts work consistent in the second quarter versus historical patterns, new scripts were down 10% to 15% in April. And so, actually the second quarter is probably the low end of a sustainable level for engineer for the future. Thank you for the question. Gail Boudreaux : In terms of the selling season, A.J., you know, it's been an interesting operating environment given all the change and I think we shared this in the last quarter, things are, I would say at least slightly delayed as customers try to work through their own stability across their business. While I think it's still early, I would say that our pipeline is still quite good. We are seeing some delays and overall decisions to move from 2021 to 2022, but overall, the sales cycle has been pretty active. We've seen, you know an increase year-over-year in that pipeline. We feel that one of our best opportunities is to embed IngenioRx in our own fee-based business and that's been going well. We're also pleased that we'll be adding Blue Cross of Idaho as part of our Medicare base in [1/1/2021]. So that's a nice add as well, as you know, we brought on the commercial business this year as part of the transition. So overall, I think we're probably going to expect some delays in the overall decision making for our largest customers, but we still feel very compelling sales proposition, particularly as we added to our self-funded business this year.  Thanks for the question. Next one please. Operator : Next question comes from Sara James with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Sara James : Thank you. Could you talk a little bit more about the change in assumptions impacting DCP? Did the completion factor assumption move? Are you are you getting those a little bit slower and was there any impact on [indiscernible] that assumption change? John Gallina : Thank you, Sara. Great question on days and claims payable, and as we said that, days and claims payable is up 4.1 days, sequentially as well as 6.9 days year-over-year. And, you know, the days and claims payable is a function of many things and at time some of those changes can impact DCP without impacting the income statement, and we certainly have part of that going on with the way the math works. But we have seen an elongation of the amount of time it is has taken providers from the point of service to actually submitting the claims to us. So, you know, the cycle time of date of service to claim submission has gone up a couple days across our entire book of business during this pandemic, and you know, a lot of reasons for that, but really that would impact the days in claims calculation, all else being equal. Then also, given the fact that that occurred, I mentioned the conservatism in the prepared comments. We have then further made the completion factors a bit slower, given the uncertainty associated with the billing patterns that we wanted to ensure that we were totally covered. And, and so that would have caused our medical loss ratio to be a bit higher and our DCP to be a bit higher, and if it turns out that we need that we are fully covered. And if it turns out that there's a bit of conservatism, then that would be great. And we'll have some releases later in the year in the next year when we have more transparency into the situation. So, all those things taken, you know, then we also were able to have very, very solid cash flow as a percent of earnings as a result. So, I think they all point to very high quality of earnings. Thank you for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Next question please. Operator : Next question comes from Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open. Joshua Raskin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Question around the commercial membership, I don't know if it's easy to answer, but do you have a sense of how many of your members at June quarter-end were unemployed or furloughed, but still receiving benefits? And I'm curious if there's any difference in your view, the ISO book versus the risk book? And then my real question is more around in that commercial book and the current environment, is it impacting your ability to \u2013 that strategic initiative to sell more services to existing members? Gail Boudreaux : Thanks. Josh. I\u2019m going to ask Pete Haytaian to answer. Please, Pete. Pete Haytaian : Yeah. Thanks Josh, for the question. And as Gail said, the membership in the quarter ended up a lot better than we had originally expected with the broad unemployment. And as you refer to a big, you know cause of that was furloughs in terms of, you know, having deep insights to with respect to the exact amount of folks that are furloughed, I don't have that, you know, information at a precise level. So, I don't want to sort of make an assumption associated with that, but it definitely has been a big factor. The other thing that I had mentioned that's noteworthy is the makeup of our commercial book, which is really disproportionately in less risky segments. So, we have as you know a lot of state and government business accounts, as well as providing services for a lot of folks and essential services. So, we feel really good, you know about that. In terms of up-selling and selling more value into our ASO accounts, we have seen a bit of a slowdown when we talk about on the ASO side, improving our margins and going from 5 to 1 to 3 to 1, and you hear us talk a lot about us up-selling those services. And prior to COVID occurring, we were on a very strong path. I could say with great confidence that we would have likely, you know, been at around the 4 to 1 level. So, slightly ahead of, you know where we wanted to be, but as Gail noted, you know, when you think about things like pharmacy and you think about other, you know, value-added services that we provide, and that we're up-selling there has been a bit of a slow down because of COVID and a hesitation and folks deferring some of those decisions into 2021 and 2022. So, we have seen a little bit of a bump in the road, but as it relates to moving forward, we are very confident as we \u2013 on our path to the 3 to 1 and the value proposition is really selling. And as we are in COVID, we continue to innovate and deploy new programs. For example, you know, when we acquire a new asset like beacon, it creates a lot of additional opportunity for us to sell, for example, behavioral health services. So we feel very good about long-term. Gail Boudreaux : And Josh the only other thing I'd add is, we've seen really strong retention of our accounts. So, the in-group attrition is obviously driving that, and that gets your question around furloughs versus you know, downsizing, and then the second thing and I'll just reiterate it, and I think the commercial team has really done an incredible job coming out of 2019, but also into this year, that our sales are outpacing labs. So, despite the environment, particularly in our risk-based business, we're continuing to see traction of the new product offerings and the segment focus that we put in under piece leadership. So, I think those are all contributing as well as I think just the makeup of our book is helpful there too. Next question please. Operator : For our next question we'll go to Stephen Valiquette of Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Stephen Valiquette : Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody. Stephen Valiquette : So, as we think ahead to the upcoming Medicare advantage annual enrollment period starting in October of this year for 2021, which is now really not that far away, just curious if you have any preliminary thoughts on whether you expect the overall MA market to see any disruption in enrollment growth due to COVID? Or do you think with greater technology and other factors, the industry can still overcome the risk of fewer face-to-face meetings with brokers, salespeople, etcetera, and still see MA growth in-line with historical averages? And can you talk about what Anthem is changing to combat this risk for your own Medicare growth outlook for next year? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks for the question, Steve. Let me offer a few comments, and I'll ask Felicia, who leads that business to provide more detail. You know, we did, when the pandemic originally hit, we did see a slowdown in sales just because historically it has been face-to-face, but we've actually she recovered very nicely since over the last few months and I think, working with our brokers and others, we've been able to really put in much more direct selling and channels where there isn't as much face-to-face. So we've been working very diligently and as you look at our growth, you know, we've had very strong growth last year over 20%, and this year, quarter-over-quarter up 17% over prior year and 13% year-to-date and expect to continue to see the alternative methodologies we put in place. I\u2019ll ask Felicia to comment particularly about how we're ensuring the safety as well as how we're engaging with our Medicare Advantage members in particular. Felicia? Felicia Norwood : Yes, thank you, Gail. And Steve, thank you for the question. As Gail reference, we've seen strong performance in our business. We certainly had to pivot in-light of COVID and we saw a brief slowdown in our sales soon after COVID. But, you know, sales have actually picked up since that time and our early read on July membership indicates that performance is certainly improving as well. You know, the safety of our associates is certainly a paramount concern, and so, it's the safety of the seniors that we serve. So, we are fully prepared to adjust our sales processes accordingly in-light of this pandemic. You know, in fact, we are expecting that more than 50% of our sales activity will probably be virtual for this year's AEP. Similarly, I would think that more of our agent engagement and training activities are going to be held virtually as well. So, you know, much of AEP activity is going to depend on CMS guidance as the future of COVID remains uncertain for all of us and that guidance is changing every day and we're closely monitoring that guidance as well. So, we are fully prepared and proactively investing so that we can make sure we are prepared to support agent engagement and our sales activity through any channel that the member wants to buy being very mindful of the changes that are ahead of us, but feel very prepared to be able to continue to deliver the strong sales performance in this new environment, including the virtual environment, which will be in our AEP as we head into 01/01 of 2021. Gail Boudreaux : Next question please? Operator : Next, we'll go to Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks, good morning. You know you talked about DCP up and reserves building, but, you know, the expectation that costs essentially come back in the second half and obviously lots of uncertainty out there. You know, unfortunately, you can't really take a wait and see approach to pricing for 2021, so I guess at this point, what can you tell us about your approach to pricing for the commercial book next year and maybe assumption of pent-up demand and perhaps acuity that timing wise may push into 2021? And then, along those lines, how have conversations gone with employers? And do you expect movement or switching next year? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Pete? Pete Haytaian : Yes, thanks, Ralph. Thanks for the question. I appreciate it. I think, you know a majority of \u2013 we talked about this last quarter, but a majority of our book renews in January, so we certainly do have the luxury of some additional time before we finalize rates. That said, we are obviously closely monitoring the situation. We're considering all factors, many of which you mentioned, from our expectation on deferred utilization to electives to the cost of treatment and the cost of testing, and we're really, you know, using the best information we have before us at this time. I think another important factor; we all know that the HIF will be going away in 2021, so that is certainly a factor that serves as a buffer. Overall, we're going to remain really balanced, and most importantly, we are not going to be short sighted. We're going to remain disciplined with respect to pricing and we're going to price to our view of normalized forward trend. As it relates to our conversations with commercial clients and growth, it's going really well. Our value proposition is selling through. You know, obviously, as Gail alluded to when she was talking about Ingenio, and other parts of our business, as it relates to growth in the back half of 2020, and as it relates to some decisions for 2021, as you'd expect, there were some deferrals.  So for national accounts, for example, we had some expectations of some pretty big accounts that we thought would come through in 2021 that were deferred to the 2022 cycle, but importantly, you know, as it relates to just our sales cycle currently, and that which we feel good about into 2021, we do feel good about growing groups. I think the most significant factor and unknown right now is the impacts of in-group change, that has been the biggest driver of our membership attrition, and so obviously, there's a lot of factors associated with this and we can't be precise about it. But we do feel good about growing groups going into 2021. And then importantly, believe it or not, even though we're in the last 30 or so days of our selling cycle for national, already having conversations about 2022, and the pipeline for 2022, you know looks very good as well. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. Just one last question about the exchanges, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there as far as membership trends now and if there's any data on the, you know, acuity of those [debt members]? And then, how you're thinking about next year? It does seem like more competitors are getting onto the exchanges, any view on preliminary rates and whether pricing looks rational for next year? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Yes, thanks for the question, Kevin. You know, I think as we look at the individual market today and the overall individual exchange, it's been pretty consistent. And as we shared, most of our membership growth has come from the re-verification and we haven\u2019t seen \u2013 we've seen some small pickup in individual around the ACA-compliant plans, but overall, we have not seen dramatic increases across the book of business and we think a lot of that is because there's sort of a delay between when people either they're on furloughs or then they go off [employer] coverage and there's a delay in the timing. In terms of our strategy, we've stayed really consistent. We expanded in certain geographies where we felt it made sense. We've stayed in our footprint overall. I think it's too early to plan on acuity because again, the book hasn't really significantly changed very much. We haven't seen significant growth because of unemployment. So, I think those factors are important. As we think about the future, we've been really disciplined in our individual exchange strategy and we feel good about that. We're going to continue it and we'll look to expand in areas where it makes sense where our footprint is strong and where we think that we obviously have a strong Blue advantage given our brand and the network configuration that we have. So overall, you know, I think we'll look for modest expansion. Our strategy has played very well over the last few years and we'll continue with it. We've got teams focused on that business and deep analytics. So, thanks for the question. Next one please? Operator : Next question comes from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan. Your line is open, go ahead. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. Just want to ask a little bit more about, Gail, your thoughts on commercial market? You know, I heard and appreciate all the comments about, you know, how well the catcher's mitt is performing so far. It definitely is and the fact that your book of business is a bit differentiated, better positioned, but, you know, we still sit here in an environment where national unemployment is up 750 basis points. There are expectations that that moves higher and I don't think any of us would have guessed that, you know, you'd only have, you know, local group enrollment down, you know, 1.5%, you know, sequentially and another large payer, you know, down 1% and change sequentially. So, I know you're contemplating that that, you know, logically will deteriorate further, but I guess, big picture, you know, is this all just federal stimulus dollars supporting these temporary furloughs? Do you see a quarter where there's an inflection point where the stimulus dollar\u2019s fall off and this really accelerate? And could you just give us a little more color on how the last few months have developed? Has the commercial risk enrollment just slowly deteriorated and July was down even a little more than June? Or has there been relative stability in those declines of June and July? Gail Boudreaux : Yes, well, thanks for the question, Gary. There's a lot in there and I think \u2013 you know let me start with as it relates to the remainder of the year, we do \u2013 and I want to be clear, we do expect further declines, you know, assuming the economy continues to operate at less than full capacity. In terms of the dynamics of very unusual set of circumstances, and it's hard to really predict, so as we think about 2008 and the deep recession that we faced then and, you know, we've obviously done a lot of modeling, and, you know, trying to understand where our unemployment rate is. And at this stage, you know, part of the reason we don't have full year guidance on enrollment is because of that very factor. There are so many things that are puts and takes in it. But as I think more broadly about our business and what's different and \u2013 you know, I'll go back to a couple of key things. One is, the mix of our business is different, that we are much more resilient in terms of the type of groups that we have. Two, I do think that, you know, our focus on affordable product offerings and what we\u2019ve done to really work with our local sales teams to reach out to our brokers to provide solutions, whether it's the premium credits or some of the opportunities to help them make sure that they can find the right products that meet their price point. Our retention is really strong. You asked about sort of, are we seeing, you know, acceleration or changes into July again early, but early signals are really strong. There's \u2013 we're not seeing any real changes at this stage. So, I think that resilience is showing up, but again, you know, people are still under furloughs. We can't predict exactly what's going to happen when they come off. It will depend on the strengthening of the economy and what happens there and what employers decide to do. So again, while we are predicting further declines in the commercial business, I do think, overall that our team has \u2013 I give our team a lot of credit. They've done a really nice job of finding solutions to keep employers with their employees insured under our programs and give them options, and I think, we didn't have that years ago and that's really one of the big differences, a real broad portfolio of offerings. So hopefully that answers your question, but it gives you a little sense that we feel that we have \u2013 you know we've provided solutions to employers and that's been one of the reasons that \u2013 and we also expect retention has stayed very strong and that's been a help. But again, in group attrition it\u2019s the one thing that's very hard to predict through the rest of this year. Next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Whit Mayo of UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Whit Mayo : Hey, thanks. I'm just curious if you're seeing any changes in the stop loss market for 2021, not sure how employers are approaching, you know, any coverage changes? What the reinsurance market looks like? Whether or not employers are looking for, you know, more or less protection? Just not sure I have a really good grasp on what this means through the renewal cycle. Gail Boudreaux : Yes, thanks for the question. In terms of trends and things that we're seeing, we really haven't seen a whole lot of difference in that marketplace. It's been pretty consistent. You know, we have a dedicated team that works on stop loss and focus on that both across our business and also offering to our, you know, self-funded clients. So at this stage, no, no real significant changes or trends. Next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead. George Hill : Yes. Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the questions. And John, I guess first, I have kind of a clarification, did you say that you guys took the entire $2.5 billion in premium credits and other subsidies during the quarter? And I guess should we effectively \u2013 should we think of seeing, you know, this kind of a contra revenue account from how the revenue was reported? And then, kind of my follow-up question to that is that when you think about the utilization growth expectations you outlined for the back half, I was thinking that you guys were going to spread the $2.5 billion out over the year. If that's not the case, I guess you guys should have been expecting a couple hundred basis points of what I would call net utilization growth as opposed to kind of gross utilization gross trying to net it up \u2013 trying to understand the interplay between the numerator and the denominator, if you can see where I'm going here? John Gallina : George, thank you for the question. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify anything that maybe could have been stated a little bit more clearly earlier. So, you know, the $2.5 billion is comprised of many different aspects. There's certainly things that we're providing to our customers, certainly things we're providing to members, things we\u2019re providing to providers and support we're writing to the community. And they all are different timing and associated with when they're being incurred, not all of which will hit the income statement as some of them are various grants and loans to providers in terms of providing liquidity and value to the system. My comment earlier was related specifically to the premium credits in the commercial marketplace that entirety of the premium credits were recorded in the second quarter. However, part of the $2.5 billion also encompasses paying for all of the waivers and deductibles and various other out-of-pocket costs that would have been incurred associated with COVID testing and COVID treatment, and obviously, that will be incurred throughout the rest of 2020. Obviously, anyone that has COVID diagnoses for the last six months of the year, there's an incremental cost to us associated with that that is in the $2.5 billion. And then, also we're providing, for example, a $10 PPE credit to every dental provider for every dental visit that occurs for the next few months. So obviously, that will be recorded in the third quarter as well when that's incurred. So, you know, the \u2013 you know a lot of the things that we've done for the community, including the $50 million foundation funding associated with the social issues, that was all recorded in the second quarter. So a lot of moving parts there, but there is a significant amount that's going to be incurred in the latter half of the year. It's just that the premium credits on commercial were all recorded in the second quarter. And hopefully that clarifies your question. Gail Boudreaux : Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Robert Jones : Great, great. Thanks for the question. Just two quick clarifications at this point. One back on Ingenio, you know, I know the scripts that you guys noted into your quarter were down, you know, pretty meaningfully. I think people will understand the dynamic there, but, you know, revenue in Ingenio was actually up sequentially. So just want to make sure I understand the dynamic at play there and how we should think about that for the balance of the year. And then, I guess just in a similar vein, you know, net investment income took a decent step down the quarter, just was curious if there was anything one-time in nature there? Thanks so much. John Gallina : Yes, thank you for the question. And yes, there are some one-time issues going on. Related to IngenioRx and I had made comments earlier about the profitability and just how well it's performing, I just want to make sure that everyone has some context to this question and the answer that within the PBM industry, that PBMs are able to recognize as product revenue, as well as cost of goods sold, the cost of drugs that are incurred by non-risk business, so that would be all of our ASO customers and the script volume that those customers are incurring we are grossing up our income statement in accordance with appropriate PBM accounting for the cost of goods sold and the product revenue. And, you know, one of our overall strategies on our 5-to-1 to 3-to-1 is to increase the penetration rate of ASO for how many of them utilize PBM services. And yes, we certainly expect to see continued growth in product revenue as a result of increasing penetration and \u2013 or even in these uncertain times. So, you know, that's really a key factor, a key element of that line item. Not much \u2013 no income statement effect in terms of bottom line as those items offset each other, but we should continue to see growth in revenue. Associated with investment income, you know, very clearly there's some one-time issues that have occurred in the marketplace, but first of all, I just want to make sure everybody's clear that about 90% of our portfolio is invested in high-quality fixed maturities. And, you know, back in March and April, you know, we made the decision as part of trying to enhance our liquidity position to not reinvest our positive cash flow and to build that up so that we could have access to the liquidity immediately. And so that actually put a drag on the investment income we would have earned otherwise. And then, the Fed, you know, dropped rates a couple times early in the year, 150 basis points in total. And so, obviously, that impacted the new money rate associated with investments. But the most significant difference is really the third one and that's the fact that we're also invested in alternative investments. You know, it's a nice diversified strategy that includes investments in private equity, core real estate, our diversified credit and in energy. And any changes in market value in that on mark-to-market [indiscernible] through the income statement immediately, and the alternatives did fairly well versus the broader markets, but, you know, energy was the worst performer. And what you're seeing on the income statement in terms of net investment income is the mark-to-market impact of the alternative investments changing our second quarter trajectory. I think you should expect that for the rest of the year that our investment income will exceed a couple hundred million dollars per quarter more in line with historical results, but thanks for the opportunity to clarify that. Gail Boudreaux : Next question please. Operator : Next question comes from Lance Wilkes of Bernstein. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Lance Wilkes : Yes, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the Medicaid pricing outlook as you're looking out into 2021 or kind of the rates involvement there. And if you could tell us a little bit about discussions you've had to date with states and maybe just help us to, kind of scale understand the magnitude of rate cut proposals at a state level and maybe the process there? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Felicia? Felicia Norwood : Sure. So, when you think about our Medicare pricing outlook for 2021\u2026 Lance Wilkes : Medicaid please. Felicia Norwood : Oh, Medicaid. Oh, you know, Lance, we are certainly in the middle of our rate discussions with our state. About 50% of our states have rate discussions for January. So, half of our state is for January state. In-light of everything that's going on right now, you can imagine there's quite a lot of fluidity in the conversations we're having with our state partners. Now, when you take a look at where we are, the bottom line and foundationally rates are always require to be actually sound. And as you think about our portfolio, which is 24 states across the country, we are engaged in ongoing discussions with many of our state partners. Many of those partners, Lance have asked us to provide regular updates with respect to what's going on a month-to-month basis, and some of those states have essentially said they want to continue to see what's going on with respect to our populations as we head between now and the end of the year. So, we will continue to engage in dialogue, which really is almost on a weekly basis with our state partners around what's going on with respect to performance. And we certainly would expect that utilization will pick up in the back half of the year. When it's all said and done, this is a long game. And certainly performance in any one quarter won't reflect what we expect to see in our population over the course of the year. And our state partners right now [as we are], are very focused on what's going on with respect to access to care with our members, and trying to make sure that members are taken care of during this time with respect to all kinds of needs, but particularly behavior health. So, as we continue these discussions between now and the back half of the year, we are engaged in our ongoing processes with our state partners. We are regularly exchanging information from our perspective with respect to performance, what we are seeing with respect to those new 566,000 members that I reference, what the performance and acuity of that membership looks like, and what expectations should be between now and the back half of the year. So, this is going to be an iterative process with our state partners and as we continue to learn more about the virus and the impact on our business, we will make updates with our state partners and they will do likewise with us. So, thank you very much. Gail Boudreaux : Next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Borsch of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Matthew Borsch : Thank you. I was hoping you could just talk about what as you, you know, had said that I think the healthcare spending you're seeing was at about 90% of normal during the month of June. Can you give us a sense, I imagine Medicare is lower as a lower percentage offset by commercial and Medicaid, but you know, within that, is it more commercial, more Medicaid, just any additional detail that would be really interesting? John Gallina : Yeah, thanks, Matt, for the question. And just to reiterate a comment that I made a little earlier is that the most significant impact of deferral of procedures occurred in the commercial marketplace, and then Medicaid was in the middle and then Medicare had much, much less impact on the deferral. And we, as we said that there is another spike in COVID here in July, we're actually monitoring it very closely, trying to understand what the impact of the deferrals are and how the pent-up demand is impacting as well. And so, you know, but like we've seen an increase in procedures such as, joint replacement surgeries, and other procedures, some things can only be delayed so long until the pain or the severity is so significant that the person is going to go in and actually get the procedure. So, a lot of moving parts there, but, you know commercial has the most significant impact and Medicare actually has minimal impact here as we head into the third quarter. Matthew Borsch : Okay, thank you. John Gallina : Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question. Operator : Next question comes from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Dave Windley : Hi, thanks for taking my questions and squeezing me in. I was wondering if the COVID crisis has brought to light any cost structure changes that might be of a more permanent nature. So, for example, things like real estate in the SG&A line, or perhaps co-pay structures or payment of virtual visits at parody, things like that in the medical cost structure, just looking for things that endure beyond the crisis? John Gallina : You know, Dave, those are great questions. And certainly, it's probably premature to declare specifically what things are going to look like, but I do agree with you that we are looking very closely at our real estate footprint and the virtual environment that our associates are in, and just how proud we are of our associates that we've been able to maintain productive and efficient workforce during this timeframe and really take a closer look at that for the future. Telehealth clearly is here to stay. And it's really helping us find the right setting. And it's really all about getting the right care, at the right time, in the right place for our members, and how we're utilizing the various virtual engagements in the digital type capabilities that we've been \u2013 we've been creating as well. It's very clear that those are here to stay. And so it's going to be a lot about optimizing those things. You know, ER volume is down. I think we've seen about 50% of commercial ER utilization is actually non-emergent, and so that can actually be a positive to the healthcare trends in the future as we really get that right. And find the sweet spot of that. So, great questions and things that we're talking about on a daily basis here. Gail Boudreaux : Yeah. Thanks, Dave. And just to reiterate what John said, we're obviously looking at our entire enterprise, and we always take a look at our admin expenses and where we are, but importantly, digital health is here to stay, and we've seen a real acceleration in that scenario. We put quite a bit of investment and so we feel very well-positioned. Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from, excuse me, Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Steve Willoughby : Hi, yes. Two questions for you. Thanks for taking my call. You know, first, John I was just wondering if you could follow-up briefly on Ingenio, you made a comment about the additional $100 million of flow through to shareholders, just wanted to confirm that that approximately means roughly $500 million of earnings upside from Ingenio or cost savings from Ingenio relative to your initial expectations. John Gallina : I'm not \u2013 so, I didn't quite follow the 500. Just let me let me clarify the Ingenio numbers. You know, back 90 days ago when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year, we talked about the $4 billion savings on the contract and that at least 20% of that would [in order to shareholders]. So that would be your 800 million. We've raised that today to approximately 900 million. In addition, the Ingenio reporting segment includes business that has been Anthem business historically that has been recorded in the commercial business division. And that's where we had the PBM services for our ASO customers that actually we had contracted with historically to provide PBM services. And that $75 million to $100 million per quarter of op gain that had previously been in the commercial segment that starting in 2020, starting in January of 2020 is from reclassified, those members have been reclassified and are now reflected in the IngenioRx segment. And so those two things are the vast, vast majority of the earnings in the Ingenio segment. And the other things in the [IngenioRx] segment would include third party business, we're the PBM for another company or other business that we have with third parties, but that is a very small and the overall profitability of the segment. Hopefully that clarifies your question. Gail Boudreaux : Next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Your line is open. Charles Rhyee : Yeah, thanks. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up from earlier on talking about the membership and I think as I've mentioned that about the attrition and commercial being less than expected because of sort of the enhanced benefits, which I think you were referring to, but \u2013 that you expected to pick up in the back half of the year. You know, related to that, are you seeing this membership shifting around into areas like the exchanges or an uptick in COBRA? And what would you expect to see if enhanced benefits are extended? Because it seems like your guides assumes that they end here in July. So, and if those aren't extended, do you see them \u2013 then the membership, you know, shifting more into Medicaid? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Yeah, thanks for the question. There's a lot in there. And you know, just given that we're not giving guidance, part of this is there's so many moving parts, but I'll give you a little bit of color. First on COBRA, we really haven't seen any increase in COBRA. It's very, very low, just given the cost structure of Cobra. So, that hasn't changed at all very different from 2018 or 2008 rather. In terms of your other questions, as I mentioned earlier on a response, the exchanges have not seen a significant impact because of unemployment. So it's been sort of the normal growth pattern that we expected and the exchanges and again, we do think there's just some delays. I really can't comment on, you know, furloughing and what employers are going to do relative to unemployment. Clearly, we've made some commentary that we do think that we'll see attrition increases in group increases over the course of the back half of the year. You know, our expectation is that the unemployment rate improves at the end of the year to roughly, you know, a little over 10%, but that makes it challenging to reasonably project the impact of enrollment at this time. But again, you know, I think really what we're seeing in our current results is the result of our existing business segments executing strategies to keep retention high and give employers options to keep people enrolled. So our group retention numbers are high and we're seeing the attrition is inside of groups and those are based on the employment decisions that are occurring. Thanks for the question.  Next question please. Operator : Next question comes from Frank Morgan of RBC Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Frank Morgan : Yes, a real quick one. I was curious if you could give an update on the grace periods granted in your commercial segment? I think last quarter, you mentioned it was about between [one half to 1%] in the quarter and maybe ended at around 3%. Any updates on the second quarter or maybe how you're doing in June or July? Thanks, Gail Boudreaux : Sure. I\u2019ll have Pete answer. Pete Haytaian : Yeah, thanks for the question, Frank. We obviously, you know, recognize these are unprecedented times and ever since COVID started, we've been focused on partnering with our employer and broker partners to really see this through together. And as you alluded to, we instituted a variety of approaches, including grace periods, but also other payment options. All that said, we're very encouraged with where we are with collections. You mentioned that last call, I mentioned that about 1% of premium as representative of groups that typically utilize grace periods. And at that time, our expectation was, with COVID, we could see that, you know, creep to 3%, but our collection rates actually local a lot more like a normalized environment pre-COVID. And in fact, in the last couple of months, we've seen an improvement. When you look at, for example, the small group segment, which is indicative of a lot, it's really, really held up well with premium payments, really following normal patterns. And then with the overall book \u2013 overall makeup of our book being skewed to essential services, we're also seeing, you know good payment patterns there. So, overall, that's been a real positive development. Gail Boudreaux : Great, thank you. I think we have time for one last question. Operator : And our final question comes from Mike Newshel of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Mike Newshel : Thanks. Since the Medicaid enrollment growth you're seeing is being driven primarily by the suspended re-verification, I was just wondering if you could confirm whether that would be a margin tailwind, as well since those enrollees would otherwise turn, you know, tend to be relatively healthier. So, essentially the reversal of the margin pressure, when re-verification push enrollment down and when re-verification does resume at some point, you know would you expect to see that margin pressure again or now that there's some data and a track record, is there potential to work with states to mitigate the effect and rates faster the next time? Thanks. John Gallina : Yeah, no, thank you for the question. And, you know, one of the things that we've always said about the Medicaid business is that it is typically that the acuity and the risks that we have in a particular quarter, and the revenue that's recognized associated with that risk almost never match. Just having out of period adjustments and true-ups and retroactive rate increases and decreases etcetera is just a way of business within Medicaid, especially when you have such a large and vast portfolio of states which we have. But your point is very well made, that the overall acuity \u2013 you would perceive the overall acuity of those who members to be a little bit better because when we lost them a year ago, it did change the remaining acuity. So clearly, we will continue to work with the states and ensure that we have actual or early sound rates. We are in a risk corridor position with the majority of our rates, or majority of our states, I'm sorry, that will, you know, help provide downside risk protection, as well as, you know, limit the upside associated with that. It really does balance it very well for both sides of the equation, but you know, your point is well made that you know, that it should change the acuity a bit, but I really do think that the risk corridors that we've been advocating for quite some time, really help address the issue pretty significantly. So, appreciate the question. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. And I'd like to thank everyone for joining us for the call today. As we shared, Anthem has shown resiliency and agility in times of great change in our industry. Despite these societal headwinds, I remain confident in our dedicated associates, our strong Anthem brand, and our ability to serve as the trusted healthcare partner of choice for those who need us now more than ever. As we move forward in 2020, we\u2019ll continue to lend our voice and our leadership to shaping a safer, more affordable, and more effective healthcare experience for all we serve. Thank you.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session where participants are encouraged to present a single question. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Please go ahead. Chris Rigg : Good morning and welcome to Anthem's third quarter 2020 earnings call. This is Chris Rigg, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of our Commercial & Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division.  During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Boudreaux : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Anthem\u2019s third quarter 2020 earnings call. Today, we will discuss our third quarter results and expectations for the remainder of the year against the backdrop of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We will also provide a preliminary view of the headwinds and tailwinds we project heading into 2021.  This morning, Anthem reported third quarter 2020 GAAP earnings per share of $0.87 and adjusted earnings per share of $4.20, down 14% over the prior year quarter. Our results in the quarter reflects the impacts of ongoing COVID-19 treatment costs, the continued return of a more traditional utilization environment, as well as our ongoing commitment to address financial imbalances to our customers and members.  Since the onset of the health crisis, I\u2019ve been incredibly proud of the way Anthem has continued to respond as a trusted health partner. Beginning with the earlier days of the crisis, we pivoted quickly and look for opportunities to serve in new ways to address the evolving needs of our customers and members and to make a positive difference in the lives we serve.  Armed with our purpose of improving the health of humanity, Anthem has continued to leverage our insights, innovation and partnership to improve lives and deliver a simpler, more affordable and more effective healthcare experience. The heart of Anthem is our local legacy and longstanding focus on the communities where we live and work. Today, those communities are struggling with issues around food and security and health disparity, social unrest and economic challenges. Our focus on community health fueled by our $50 million commitment seeks to eliminate health disparities and racial inequity. Our passion for this work is driven by our strong track record of addressing true, whole person care, is a social drivers of health.  Throughout the pandemic, we have been connecting with our high risk members, screening for key health factors around housing, food and transportation, as well as ensuring that they have access to basic necessities such as face masks, hand sanitizers and cleaning supplies.  Food and security is not a new issue in America, but the pandemic has only intensified the problems. We know food and security is directly linked to the whole health of individuals, families, communities and businesses. Together with our partner Feeding America, we are calling on leaders across the country to join together to fight hunger and improve the health of our nation.  Here in Indianapolis, we\u2019ve committed with our partners to provide 10 million meals to local residents in need through mobile food banks and program outreach. Anthem has also partnered with Aunt Bertha, a leading social care network help connect individuals and families for free and reduced cost social services in their communities.  These programs include COVID-19 specific assistance with food, transportation, job training and more in every zip code across the country. Supporting efforts to create a more just society is an ongoing priority at Anthem. In light of the health disparities and racial inequities laid there by the pandemic, our work in this area has only accelerated.  For our associates, we continue to reinforce our strong culture and drive an inclusive environment for everyone. And in the City of Indianapolis, we are lending our voice and commitment, the INDY Racial Equity Pledge. This pledge spotlights our joint commitment with the local business and civic community to take meaningful actions to address the issues of health and racial equity towards the goal of a more just community for everyone. We were also pleased to recently be named to Forbes Annual List Of The Most Just Companies ranking number one in the healthcare sector the second year in a row.  We know this year\u2019s flu season is going to be particularly challenging for our communities in combination with the rising spread of COVID-19. In response, Anthem has launched our Fall Flu Campaign, partnering with over 100 community-based organizations across our markets to stand up more than 500 pop-up and drive-thru clinics providing free flu shots in underserved neighborhoods.  Anthem is continuing to lead and shape our industry for the digital future and our experiences with COVID-19 have only accelerated our innovative efforts in this space. Our Sydney Health Application has more than 2 million unique downloads is helping ensure our members get the care they need where and when they need it. Sydney is delivering personalized engagement, and real-time access to health information, telehealth services and AI symptom-based triage.  Psych Hub is providing a range of mental health resources designed to help consumers and their families cope with the pandemic-related stress brought on by social isolation, job loss, and other challenges. This resource hub is a collaboration among several national leaders in the mental health community. Telehealth usage has been strong and we see that trend continuing, particularly for behavioral health services.  Since the onset of the health crisis, telehealth now comprises 40% to 50% of all behavioral health services compared to low-single-digit utilization pre-COVID. At Investor Day last year, we shared our vision for modernizing our business by consolidating our systems platforms, automating and reimagining processes and embedding digital and AIs across the enterprise to simplify and improve the customer experience.  The charge this quarter enables us to enhance our speed to market as an enterprise to streamline our operations, accelerate our digital journey and ultimately deliver a better experience for those we serve.  Our experience in the last several months of the pandemic saw the pivot quickly to operate virtually and challenge our ways of working. With the insights from this experience, we are reimagining our workplace to the reduced real estate footprint, more selectable work practices and evolving our offices to serve as collaboration spaces when safely able to do so.  Membership trends in the quarter were strong despite the challenging economic environment. Medical membership totaled 42.6 million members, an increase of 172,000 lives sequentially, driven by continued robust organic growth and market share gains in Medicaid and Medicare. This was partially offset by attrition in our commercial business, as a result of the prevailing economic environment.  The risk of a more significant deterioration in our membership is real. But thus far, our overall membership trends are outperforming internal expectations. Our commercial membership declined 0.9% sequentially, which beat expectations in both our risk and fee-based businesses. New account sales supported by new virtual strategies and tools outpaced lapses for the second consecutive quarter despite the challenging environment.  In the Large Group segment, net new Large Group risk sales have exceeded lapses in the 11 of the last 13 months. Importantly, we remain discipline in our pricing and go to market strategy keeping an eye on long-term customer retention.  While we expect to see some headwinds from in group changes over the next several quarters, our focus on sales effectiveness, affordability, and offering a portfolio of product options to meet customers where they are continues to pay-off.  While the 2021 selling season looks different than most, our results year-to-date increase our confidence through sustained momentum in new sales growth, powered by our focus on whole person health. Our Medicaid membership grew by nearly 390,000 lives in the quarter and is up nearly 18% year-to-date due primarily to the pause on re-verification.  The financial performance of our Medicaid business in the quarter was significantly impacted by retroactive, prior period rate adjustments, that totaled nearly $300 million.  As we previously shared, our second quarter results were impacted by the broad based deferral of normal healthcare utilization, while the experience in the third quarter reflects a considerable increase in COVID-related costs, which we expect persists through the balance of the year more than offsetting the impacts of deferred utilization.  We continue to work with our state partners to achieve reimbursement levels that are actuarially found while earning a reasonable return on capital and margins in the 2% to 4% range.  Turning to the Medicare business, our growth of more than 16% year-to-date is outperforming the market average and we expect another year of mid-double-digit growth in 2021. The recently released star scores for payment year 2022 however are disappointing. Our pharmacy scores remain the single largest driver of our underperformance.  As a reminder, our Medicare Advantage members transitioned to IngenioRx on January 1, 2020, which limited our ability to improve our pharmacy scores in the latest measurement period. We are intensely focused on our star ratings with significant improvement expected over the next year. We are seeing a strong start to the annual enrollment period demonstrating that our multi-channel approach is delivering results. Digital platforms have long been an area of focus even prior to the pandemic and this year, we expect to gain a significant percentage of our sales through digital channels. The development of our Medicare Care Guide is just one way we are enhancing our members\u2019 onboarding experience with proactive outreach to help them understand their benefits and enhance the onboarding process and overall new member experience.  Our 2021 offering reflects our industry-leading supplemental benefits, which include the popular over-the-counter offering, transportation, dental and vision benefits, as well as benefits to address social drivers of health such as food delivery and service animal care, positioning us for another year of above market growth Medicare Advantage.  Importantly, we expect to see nearly 90% of our members in $0 premium plans for 2021 as we continue to the fourth quarter, our compassionate commitment to making a positive difference for all of our stakeholders will continue.  With that, I will now turn the call over to John for a more detailed review of our third quarter financial performance and our preliminary review of the headwinds and tailwinds we project heading into 2021. John? John Gallina : Thank you, Gail, and good morning. As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $4.20, a decline of 14% year-over-year. While our GAAP quarterly results included a few significant charges, our adjusted earnings were otherwise relatively consistent with our overall expectations.  Our results reflect the departure from normal seasonality trends due to the continued impact of COVID-19 utilization, as well as the actions we voluntarily took to support our members, customers, communities, and care providers.  We continue to offer expanded benefit policy changes to adjust cost share waivers for COVID-19 treatment has access to 24/7 telehealth at no cost, provided grants and support for our communities to name a few. Our adjusted third quarter results exclude our expected share of the impending Blue Cross, Blue Shield Litigation settlement, as well as the charges related to the business optimization efforts that Gail referenced earlier.  The impending Blue Cross and Blue Shield litigation settlement removes an uncertain while the business optimization charges are the latest milestone in our journey of delivering on our commitment to achieving an SG&A ratio of 11% to 12% by 2023.  These initiatives are aligned with our enterprise strategy and represent a reallocation of resources in high growth and high impact areas such as AI and digital. After transitioning the majority of our associates to work from home in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able to reassess and further optimize our real estate footprint as we gained a better understanding of our organization\u2019s capacity to work from home.  Anthem\u2019s third quarter operating gain was $201 million, a decline of $1.3 billion from the prior year. Absent the aforementioned major adjustment items, operating gain in the quarter declined 8% or $126 million. Our underlying results reflect elevated COVID-19-related cost across our commercial and government lines of business and retroactive Medicaid rate adjustment, partially offset by deferred healthcare utilization and strong performance in IngenioRx.  Medical membership was 42.6 million members at the end of September, growth of more than 1.6 million lives year-to-date. This growth is further evidence that Anthem has the most balanced and resilient membership mix in the sector. Time and time again, we have shown the ability to grow at stronger comps which was illustrated by industry-leading organic membership growth in 2019, as well as during periods of economic uncertainty, as we have continue to grow membership throughout 2020. Since the end of the first quarter, enrollment in Medicaid has grown by more than double, a decline in our employer group businesses, excluding Blue Card.  As a matter of fact, our Medicaid membership growth is approximately ten times the decline in our commercial risk-based members. And of course, this is going on while we continue to exhibit double-digit growth year-over-year in our Medicare Advantage.  Operating revenue in the third quarter of 2020 was $30.6 billion, an increase of approximately 16% versus the prior year quarter, and nearly 15% on a HIF-adjusted basis. The increase was primarily driven by higher premium revenue from solid growth in our Medicare and Medicaid businesses. Pharmacy revenue related to the launch of IngenioRx and the return of the health insurer fee. The increase was partially offset by risk-based enrollment declines in our commercial and specialty business driven by higher unemployment rates. The medical loss ratio in the third quarter was 86.8%, a decrease of 40 basis points year-over-year.  On a HIF-adjusted basis, MOR in the quarter increased 80 basis points, primarily driven by increased cost related to COVID-19 including actions to support our members, customers and providers in addition to the retroactive Medicaid rate adjustments.  Non-COVID utilization in the third quarter largely returned to normal levels or roughly 95% of historical baseline. And when coupled with the cost of COVID-19 care, overall utilization was above baseline. As discussed on our second quarter call, we continue to expect the second half mix adjusted MOR to come in a couple hundred basis points higher than normal seasonality trends would suggest, driven by COVID-19 cost and the continued recovery in non-COVID utilization throughout the remainder of the year.  Our third quarter SG&A ratio was 17.3%, an increase of 440 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. However, excluding major adjustment items, SG&A in the quarter was 13.4%, reflecting an increase of 50 basis points. The increase was primarily due to expenses associated with return of the health insurer fee, and increased spend to support growth, partially offset by growth of operating companies. We experienced an operating cash outflow of $1.2 billion in the quarter, a decrease of $2.8 billion year-over-year. The decrease was primarily driven by the payment of the health insurers fee for the full year, as well as the timing of two additional federal tax payments that were previously deferred as permitted by the IRS.  For the first nine months of the year, operating cash flow was $6.9 billion, or 1.7 times to net income. Excluding the impacts, net income from the major adjustment items in the quarter are multiple of cash flow to net income year-to-date would have been 1.4 times.  Turning to the balance sheet, our debt-to-cap ratio was 39.2% at the end of the third quarter, which is consistent with our target range. Days and claims payable was 41.1 days, down from 46 days at the end of the second quarter, but up 1.3 days year-over-year with the medical claims liability increasing 14% versus growth in premium revenue of 11% over the same period, evidence of our solid reserve.  In the quarter, we\u2019ve repurchased 2.9 million shares at a weighted average price of $265.73 for a total cost of $759 million. Year-to-date, we have purchased 5 million shares at an average price of $269.15 or $1.3 billion in total cost. 2020 has been unprecedented in many ways with much still unclear on the future course of the pandemic and the macro economy.  However, we are proud of our organization\u2019s ability to adapt, providing care for those we serve and delivering relief and support to our stakeholders. At this time, we remain committed to our 2020 adjusted earnings guidance of greater than $22.30. As you have heard this morning, we have consistently demonstrated strong performance despite operating in an environment characterized by uncertainty.  While COVID-19 is certainly introduced many challenges, our long-term growth plan remains firmly intact as we seek to gain share in the Medicare Advantage market, leveraging growth at diversified business groups, increased the profitability of our fee-based business and modestly grow share in the commercial risk-based business.  Importantly, we invite you to attend our Virtual 2021 Investor Day Meeting on March 3rd, where we will discuss our long-term strategy in greater detail. As it relates to 2021 guidance, we will provide a more detailed outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call. Further, as you contemplate the headwinds and tailwinds, we see for next year, please keep in mind there is much more uncertainty than the normal given the unknowns related to COVID such as the timing, and efficacy of a vaccine, or if we could see another round of deferred utilization.  With that as background, our initial view of 2021 contemplates the following tale; the permanent repeat of the health insurer fees, which we use to partially offset investment in our Medicare business to improve our star scores, accretion from the 2020 M&A activity and share repurchases, IngenioRx growth and the continued progress on our commercial 5 to 1, to 3 to 1 strategy and Medicare Advantage membership growth. These will be partially offset by Medicaid reverifications and raid actions in the context of return to a normal operating environment. Commercial enrollment pressure, primarily in-group change as a result of broader economic challenges and higher investment spending to support long-term growth.  At this early stage, our view of 2021 would affirm our long-term EPS growth rate of 12% to 15% albeit skewed to the lower half given the unusual risk and challenges presented by the ongoing pandemic. And with that, operator we will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question, we\u2019ll go to the line of Stephen Valiquette of Barclays. Your line is open. Stephen Valiquette : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So, just on those comments on the tailwinds and headwinds, that was certainly helpful. The one I was curious to hear more about was the higher investment spending. Can you give us give a little more color maybe on that piece, in particular as you are thinking about trends for that for next year versus what you are spending voluntarily this year? Thanks. John Gallina : Yes. Thank you, Steve. Appreciate the question. And, the higher investment spending really is, putting more and more money into our AI and digital capabilities, investing more in stars in order to ensure that we improve our number of members covered by four star plan in the next rating period and beyond.  And, really the way that that care is going to be accessed here in the future is slightly different than how it\u2019s been accessed in the past from really investing in the various networks and capabilities to meet the customers where they need to be met. So, we\u2019ll provide a lot more specificity on that at Investor Day in terms of automating and reimagining processes and embedding digital and AI across the enterprise. It\u2019s all about simplifying and improving the customer experience. So, hopefully that can provide you a little bit of context here in the mean time. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks, Steve. I\u2019ll just also reiterate what John just said, which is, we have been investing what we found is that there is an opportunity to accelerate those investments as a result of the increased adaption that we\u2019ve seen over the course of the pandemic, particularly in our digital assets, where we made significant commitments around our Sydney and our Psych Hub and other things where we are seeing our consumers more actively engage with those assets. And then, stars is obviously a key priority for us and we continue to build a team there as well as invest in ensuring that we can pull through what we are doing in our pharmacy now that we have an under IngenioRx.  Thank you very much. Next question please. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice : Thanks. Hi everybody. Just one point of clarification and then a question. The 2021 outlook growth rate, is that using 2020 to 2030 jumping off point as the base? Or is there any adjustments we should make in thinking about what the base is for this year?  And then, my broader question is, you mentioned the puts and takes you have to deal with in thinking about the outlook for next year in developing medical cost trends, can you just maybe flush out a little bit more what are you thinking next year for medical cost trend and what are some of the major unknown variables or variables you have in the reservoir as you think about that cost trend expectation for next year, particularly like in the commercial risk business? Gail Boudreaux : Great. Thank you. Thank you very much, AJ. Let me start now, have John provide a little bit more color. As you said, at this early stage, our view of 2021 would affirm our long-term EPS growth rate of 12% to 15% off the guidance of 2020 to 2030 as you mentioned. Although as John commented in his prepared remarks it\u2019s skewed towards a little over a half of the range, just given the unusual risk and challenges presented by the ongoing pandemic. So with that, let me have John give you a little bit more color on some of the other specifics that you asked in your question. John? John Gallina : Yes. Thank you, Gail. And, good morning, AJ. Our 2021 trend expectations and really I think you maybe pointing to commercial pricing actions are very important, obviously many variables they have considered as part of our trend and our pricing assumptions. And I\u2019ll just be clear for everyone on the call here for competitive reasons, we are not going to provide a specific point estimate of where we see trend coming or what our pricing assumptions are at this point in time.  But I do think it would be instructive to highlight some of the things are considered. First of all, there is a permanent repeal the health insurer fee and that repeal actually is going to save Anthem customers or actually $2 billion in 2021 and certainly we removing its burden helps mitigate the impact of cost. And also, really looking closely at how will care be accessed in 2021. For instance, telehealth, ER visits, standalone surgery centers, other site of service changes, how are they going to evolve before and after a vaccine is available, And overall utilization be impacted or just it\u2019s the way that CARES Act. Certainly, we are trying to assess the ongoing impact of COVID-19 testing and treatment, assessing how much pent-up demand still exists versus the permanent cancellation of procedures. And then how is deferred utilization impacted underlying acuity.  And like, the list goes up, those are all just variables that are incremental and on top of the normal variables that exists each and every year when we assess trends. So, the one thing I\u2019ll say with all of that though, is that we are being very disciplined in our approach and we are being very disciplined in our pricing. Our pricing covers forward trend. We have committed that. We were priced to cover forward trend and we\u2019ll continue to do so. So we\u2019ll provide more insights into this in early 2021 questions on our fourth quarter call next January. And of course, as I stated on March 3rd during our Virtual Investor Day provide a lot more insights. But these are many of the variables that we are really working our way through right now as we finalize our 2020 year.  Thank you, AJ Gail Boudreaux : Thanks very much. Next question please? Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. One quick numbers question that I wanted to ask about Medicaid. So, on numbers, can you share with us the next if tailwinds, John, that you talked about that you are thinking about for 2021. I know you said that was offset by some reimbursement in stars. Want to get that net number from you. And then, can you talk to your views on Medicaid rate actions for 2021 being as given. I remember you expect it to end this year at 3% margins in Medicaid. Can you talk about that within the expectation for next year in terms of \u2013 do you expect to be at that 3% target for 2021? Or do you saw moderation in your \u2013 in services resumes within that 2021 guidance? Thanks. John Gallina : Hey, Justin, I apologize. Can you repeat the first half of your two-part question? I am not sure I understood everything you said. Justin Lake : Sure. Just first look at the net if tailwind for 2021? John Gallina : Oh the net if tailwind, okay. Justin Lake : Medicaid margins for next year. Thanks. John Gallina : Yes. The HIF, as I said, that was part of the overall headwinds and tailwinds that we had and in response to AJ\u2019s question, we\u2019ve certainly tried to factor everything into our headwinds and tailwinds as part of reaffirming our long-term growth rate and really don\u2019t want to get into cherry picking certain items as to why something as part of a starting point and my something else is not right. On HIF and of itself, we are looking at $0.60 to $0.80 of a tailwind in 2021 associated with the permanent repeal of that law.  Related to \u2013 as we said, part of it\u2019s going to be is to help fund some of the investments in Medicare to improve star ratings and other things. So, there is certainly a lot of fungibility associated with any number of headwinds or tailwinds, but $0.60 to $0.80, I think is the dollarized impact of the question.  Related to the 2021 and the Medicaid rate environment, obviously we are working very closely with the states to ensure that we get actuarially appropriate rates working through whether it be the collars of the corridors and how those things are impacting the methodology, I think we\u2019ll advice very wide open in terms of that. And as I said, conversations with our state partners regarding the need to have sound rates as we quickly return to a normal operating environment.  So, our expectation is, is that, we\u2019ll be able to achieve a appropriate return on capital and operate well within the target margin range in Medicaid in 2021 and are actually focused on being relatively close to the midpoint of that range. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question please? Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes. Hi. Good morning. My question is on the utilization trends that you are seeing, also you stated we are returning back to normal. So maybe you can give a little bit more color about the difference between the different books? And what type of procedures you are seeing coming back?  And especially as we think about this is looking ahead to 2021, John, you talked about the difference in the titles procedures is coming back. So if you think about ER visits if you are seeing less utilization there, does this mean that if that\u2019s likely to expect that these types of utilization will be back in 2021 and how is that shaping your thoughts to next year? John Gallina : Sure. Thank you, Ricky for that question. And maybe I\u2019ll provide some context that might answer questions that are in the queue as well in terms of your question. So, if you look at the underlying claims that we are seeing, as I stated in my prepared comments that, they are, excluding COVID would be below baseline levels.  But then, when you add COVID cost back in, we are exiting the third quarter at greater than baseline. So, we started the third quarter with a combination of both underlying procedures and COVID cost being below baseline and we ended the quarter with the combination to being above baseline. We fully expect that the fourth quarter would be above baseline for the entire quarter given the recent surge in COVID, as well as all the other trends that we are seeing.  Associated with where we are seeing some of the rebound, outpatient surgery has recovered the fast as pre-COVID and it\u2019s actually even trending above baseline in some instances. Some of the more costly procedures such as joint replacement surgeries have come back faster.  And a lot of that was anticipated and the actions we took to intentionally redirect care to the outpatient setting to ensure continuity of care are coming through. And to that end, we are focused on ensuring our members are getting the care they need in a timely manner, whether it be through telehealth or by redirecting certain procedures to outpatient setting.  The ER utilization is still below baseline at this point in time and we expect that to continue for a while as well. So, we are clearly taking all these things to consideration as we look at 2021 trends and as I stated for competitive reasons, we are not committing to a point estimate at this \u2013 on this call. But there is a natural system capacity constraint that will cause some utilization to carry into 2021 and we are certainly factoring that work off. Thank you for the question, Ricky. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question please? Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Stephen Tanal from SVB Leerink. Your line is open. Stephen Tanal : Good morning guys. Thanks for the question. And just on also Medicaid, maybe two-part question on this. So, Medicaid enrollment, obviously been really strong, it looks like pre-determination will be suspended at least through year end based on the last 8-K just \u2013 primarily health emergency. So, wondering if you guys had to do on enrollment in peak and then sort of related, small follow-up.  So, I believe that pretty decent outlook to the margin, but I guess, we are pointing on the rate path and other corridor and collar type actions you guys are taking, can you give us a sense for what that all in how to enrollment will take in 2020. I think that it was almost $300 million a quarter and how do you think 2021 looks versus 2020? And that would be helpful. Gail Boudreaux : Sure. Thanks for the question. I am going to ask Felicia Norwood to address some of your specific questions about reverification and timing of rates. But in terms of your very specific question about the all-in, what we expect that to be, as I said in my prepared remarks, $300 million was what we had in the quarter and we are expecting, obviously given where utilization goes and things that could move a little bit around $500 million would be that number. But with that, let me ask Felicia speak to the other questions you had. Felicia? Felicia Norwood : Yes. Good morning, Stephen and thanks for the question. As you mentioned, Medicaid growth had certainly been accelerated during this period, we\u2019re up 4.8% quarter-over-quarter and almost $389,000 over second quarter. And at this point, I don\u2019t know if we would back to the \u2013 just say when that peak is going to happen.  When you take a look at where we are today, states have spend at their reverification at least through the end of the public health emergency. That public health emergency right now will go through January 21st of next year. But in addition to the public health emergency, states are also receiving enhanced FMAP. So we would expect that states will continue to suspend reverification through the period of enhanced FMAP.  So that could be certainly through the end of January of next year as we head into February. We\u2019ve been in constant conversations with our state partners with respect to continuity of care for our members, particularly during this time of a pandemic. And continuity of care is very important. So we work with our state partners trying to make sure that we are working closely around aborting any type of clip event.  So I am not sure at this point, when things are going to peak certainly as long as this has a continuation of the public health emergency and the enhanced FMAP that states are currently receiving. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question please? Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks. Good morning. Just want to first just clarify quickly, on the Medicaid side, I think you mentioned target margins to get this 3% by 2021. I was hoping if you could give us a sense of where you think it will shake out for 2020?  And then, just wanted to ask about, membership was obviously holding better than our expectations and it sounds like your expectations as well. But the overall performance seems generally in line and guidance maintained. So, if you could help on what that delta is? Is it just cost coming back fast certainly you thought? Is it higher COVID or something else? Thanks. John Gallina : Yes. Ralph, thank you for the questions. In terms of target margins associated with Medicaid, we have \u2013 as you know, we have well over a half of our states are January 1 renewals and we are working very closely with them on rate actions. And that the trend information that\u2019s utilized for January 1 renewals is typically the two prior years.  So, 2018 and 2019 are the \u2013 really the actuarially sound rate information we have associated with that. So, we feel very good about how those conversations are going and where those rates are coming out. In terms of 2020, it\u2019s an interesting dynamic with all the deferred utilizations, the increase in COVID costs, some of the call backs of premiums, all in, we are \u2013 as you know, we\u2019ve had a $22.30 EPS guidance that we reaffirmed. The overall margins within Medicaid are coming out within the target margin range, but there is a lot of variables and lot of hard work to get there. But clearly, we are trending in the right direction during this period of uncertainty. Associated with the membership, as you know, we feel very good about our membership.  We think we have the most resilient membership mix in the business. We grow in periods of strong economic times. We grow in periods of economic uncertainty. And we made a cognizant decision here in 2020 that, we would help address the imbalances and inequities in the system created by the pandemic. So, as our membership continues to get stronger and stronger, we are helping give it back to maintain our guidance.  And then, lastly, in terms of the fourth quarter, we do expect the fourth quarter to have an elevated medical loss ratio and that\u2019s because the underlying cost of services, plus the pent-up demand that is partially coming through, plus the COVID cost that we are covering on top of all of that, we expect to be above baseline. And so, we are usually looking at a 300 to 350 basis point MOR in the fourth quarter higher than what normal seasonality would suggest. But thank you for those questions. Gail Boudreaux : Next question please? Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Sara James from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Sara James : Thank you. Can you speak to what is in federal versus the individual state control of when redeterminations for Medicaid turns back on. I am wondering if we could end up with different states turning on at different times and then when it does turn on, how long does it take to the states to catch up on evaluations and fully base out the benefit? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Felicia? Felicia Norwood : Good morning, Sara and thanks for the question. As I said, I would expect that states would suspend reverifications at least through the public health emergency and the enhanced FMAP. Once that happens, states have the ability to control when they return to reverifications with respect to membership. What the Federal government requires is that, Medicaid members to have their eligibility redetermined at least what, every twelve months. States can decide whether or not they want to then execute upon that beginning in the next quarter or thereafter, but you generally get through your entire Medicaid book of business over a twelve month period. So, as we take a look at our portfolio, which as you know is 23 states, all of those states will make determinations around when they commit reverifications at varying different intervals.  We are working very closely with our state partners and they\u2019ve been very collaborative with us around helping us to educate members around the reverification process and what\u2019s necessary, once that reverification process commences. But the return to reverification, the timing, the cadence around when that happens with respect to membership is certainly left with the state partners in terms of when that happens. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks, Felicia. Next question please? Operator : Next question we\u2019ll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. Wondering, I guess, just quantify the 2022 impact of the settlement on the Blue Cross Blue Shield. Just wanted to see this obviously other aspects to that settlement beyond the financial payment.  I was wondering if you could provide some color on if that settlement in any way would impact your view on 12% to 15% long-term growth, and/or change the way everything as you get to that 12% to 15% growth number? Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, Kevin. In terms of the settlement that we announced today in the financials, we will be including in our 10-Q a much more fulsome discussion. So, just to give you a perspective of that, which will be filed this morning. BCBSA and the Blue plans have approved the settlement agreement and relief to the subscriber settlement as part of the case. If approved, which the court still has to review it requires us to make the monetary settlement which we took our portion of its part of the third quarter charge. But also, there are a couple of non-monetary terms. One, eliminating the national best efforts rule in our license agreement.  And the second is allowing for some larger national employers with self-funded benefits to be able to request to bid for insurance coverage from a second Blue plan in addition to the local Blue plan.  As you know, we fully accrued our estimated liability in the third quarter of 2020. In terms of the impact of that, we view our strategy has been very consistent and don\u2019t really see any changes in our overall strategy. Thanks for the question. Next question please? Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Joshua Raskin : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I guess, just back on the commercial memberships holding up a little bit better, I am curious if you are seeing any recent signs of furloughs becoming more permanent.  If you guys have a better view on sort of what percentage your membership is currently in furlough, meaning not getting salary, but still getting their benefits? And then, maybe any geographic areas or segments that are seeing different trends from the overall book. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks for the question. Josh. I am going to have Pete Haytaian response to that on the commercial business. Pete Haytaian : Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. And yes, definitely commercial membership and enrollment activity continue to perform better than we expected. You noted furloughs. We don\u2019t have specific information on the volume of furloughs. We are obviously paying close contact with our employer and broker partners regarding this and we\u2019ve done a lot to make sure that we protect the membership and provide them with a lot of options in that regard.  I\u2019d say, that furloughs, as well as the fact that we have a disproportionate share of our membership in less risky segments which has certainly helped us and then as I think you alluded to the unemployment rate, it\u2019s certainly lower than we had originally expected. I\u2019d say, but most importantly, from an execution perspective, in terms of what we can control, I am really pleased with the teams\u2019 performance.  Our sales exceeded our last as again as we have for the last several quarters. One important point then to note, our fully insured membership in commercial actually only declined 27,000 members in the quarter. So, the overall net negativity that you are seeing in our membership is really caused by in-group change. And then as we look forward, your point about the future, we are modeling continued declines in the commercial market. We aren\u2019t necessarily seeing great variation by market. It\u2019s really hard to predict that with precision. But we are expecting continued declines. I would say that our early read, October is a continuation of what we saw in Q3. So, nothing that\u2019s fundamentally changes that. And then finally, I\u2019d just say, I think we are really well positioned. I am very pleased with the teams. The last couple of years we\u2019ve spent a lot of time on investing in a product portfolio and having product options to meet customers where they are and as the economy improves, I am confident that we\u2019ll have a solution for them. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question please? Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Your line is open. Lance Wilkes : Yes. Wanted to ask a little further on 2021 with respect to the employer business, and in particular interested in your outlook for, kind of wins, losses, so not the in-group aspect of it. And then, cross-sales and Ingenio penetration, how is that looking as you are kind of getting through the selling season here? Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks for the question. I\u2019ll have Pete add additional more color. But I as I shared in our opening remarks, we feel really good about our ability to increase our sales relative to our lapses.  And so, while this has been a very unusual year, we are still seeing particularly in the mid and lower \u2013 our small group business we are seeing really strong results because of our sales effectiveness. But I\u2019ll have Pete give you a bit more, because I think the work that his team has done over the last two years is really showing results this year. Pete Haytaian : Yes. Thanks a lot for the question, Lance. In the areas that we\u2019ve closed out selling \u2013 so for example, balancing group retiree we are very pleased, as Gail said with our execution and how we\u2019ve done. The activity in 2020 for 2021, at least in national for example in group retiree was \u2013 that was actives. As you would expect, some of the larger jumbo accounts, they did defer and you would expect that in light of what\u2019s going on, associated with the COVID.  But as Gail said, down market, smaller accounts, we are seeing a lot of really good activity. Our value proposition is really resonating in the marketplace. Our focus on advocacy with solutions like Gail mentioned in the prepared remarks, the Sydney technology, our consumer engagement platform, innovative programs like Total Health, Total You, et cetera are really playing well in the market.  We launched, as you probably have heard, high performing networks with our Blue Assisted plans across the country covering 55 MSAs. All these things are playing into our growth into 2021 and we feel good about that. Obviously, in-group change and the economy remains a big variable as it relates to the ultimate impacts. As it relates to the second part of your question, Ingenio and upselling, our approach 5 to 1, to 3 to 1, as it relates to what we can control, I feel really good about our progress and future prospects getting to the 301. Prior to COVID, this year, we were solidly on track to get to quarter one. COVID definitely did set us back a little bit, as you\u2019d expect.  But even with COVID, we are seeing really good activity across all the component parts that generate growth in our strategy 5 to 1 to 3 to 1. Our penetration rates and upselling rates around specialty products continues to improve. Obviously with affordability being a big focal point us selling the total value proposition across medical specialty and pharmacy, really seems to be playing well.  Our Anthem Whole Health Connections is really resonating similarly with all our clinical programs. We\u2019ve actually pushed really good programs like Total Health, Total You down into the local markets. And then as it relates to IngenioRx, we do feel really good about the future opportunities. Again, very similar, as it relates to big jumbo opportunities, there was a little slowing in that regard and people potentially deferring into the future. But as we head into 2021, we have some sales ready. We feel really good about the upsell opportunity, pharmacy into our medical and selling that total value proposition. I look forward to working with my new colleague Jeff Walter and the Ingenio team on that. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question please? Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Frank Morgan : Good morning. Appreciate your updated color around the mid-double-digit growth in the MA side of the business and I think in the past, you talked about the growth in telephonic sales. But I think did I say, expectations around our growth into digital channel. So, just any incremental color around that versus the telephonic channel and given COVID, do you have any thoughts or expectations around the level of planned switching with any of the plans as AEP? Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Well, thank you very much for the question. Just real quickly, when we start with the planned switching, we do expect less switching this year as people are shopping less. We\u2019ve had a strong and growing amount of sales from our digital channels and we do think that that is going to be particularly strong.  Early returns are showing that already. Obviously, face-to-face during a time of COVID is a little more difficult. So, again, we are expecting a very strong \u2013 strong results as I shared in our opening comments around Medicare Advantage and digital will be a very big part of that. Thank you next question. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Jones : Great. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to go back to the investment comments and just get a better sense about the investments not only for this year, but you highlighted a headwind from investments next year. So, I guess, maybe this year, just a $600 million in the business optimization charges that you had in the quarter. I know you cited areas like speed to market, streamlining operations, and then some of the digital initiatives it sounded like.  So, maybe just a little bit more on those investments? And then in 2021, how, I guess, are those investments potentially different? What areas would they be focused in and anything around the size of those investments as you sit here today and think about next year would be really helpful. Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. So I think there is two areas of the charge that I just want to make sure. One is around the reduction in the footprint, because we are reimagining our office space. And again, we are going to still be an office-based company and we will still have a presence in all of the states where we do business. But what we\u2019ve learned as part of the pandemic is that, we are really going to change the nature of those bases and consolidate the number of them we have in each of it, places that we work.  In terms of the investments we made, those are all very consistent with what we discussed back in Investor Day last year. And again, what we\u2019ve learned as part of the pandemic is an acceleration of both our ability to implement. So acceleration of digital that we\u2019ve been building, that needs a great examples, Psych Hubs and other ones, telehealth.  All of those things we\u2019ve seen consumers much more readily adapt and use than we had even predicted and so part of that is accelerating that and how our workflows and business processes as part of what we\u2019ve been doing, we embarked on an initiative to really simplify our operating environment to improve experiences for consumers to take out redundant steps, improve how we reach out to consumers, use AI-enabled claim adjudication. So, things along that nature. Very consistent, but it\u2019s \u2013 again an acceleration that we see in usage pick up dramatically. So we\u2019ve been able to accelerate the work that we are doing. Thanks for the question and next question please. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Hey, good morning guys and thanks for taking the question. I guess, John, not a numbers question, but just interested in how you guys think about how if utilization mix continues to change, I guess, can you talk about how you guys think that reflects in pricing for 2021? And have you guys looked at current utilization kind of modeled that into the pricing for 2021?  And then, just kind of a nitpicking question, when you talked about the lower end of the range for 2021, was it your intention to basically tighten the range that\u2019s off the 13% growth. So we\u2019ll see a tighter EPS guidance range for next year as opposed to a wider range which could be 12% to 15%? John Gallina : Thank you for the questions, George. I\u2019ll start with your last question first. Our long-term stated growth rate is still 12% to 15%. There is no intention of tightening that and we do believe that the 12% to 15% range is a sustainable range that we can deliver on for quite some time. The comment about being too lower end was just really due to an overabundance of caution, given the uncertainties related to the entire pandemic and COVID situation.  Related to the utilization question at the beginning, we have done really a lot of sophisticated modeling. Our various scenarios that we modeled since the beginning of the crisis have been going on and we constantly updated and incorporate new learnings in the model as the pandemic is involved. The recovery in utilization maybe lumpy.  We do believe our assumptions are very sound. As I stated I think in an answer to an earlier question, there will be some natural system capacity constraint that we do believe will cause some utilization to naturally carryover into 2021. And just to be clear, yes, we have tried to think through all of those and incorporate all of those variables into our 2021 thought process.  And then, as I stated before, we are pricing the cover forward trend. And so, our expectation is, is that, that we will cover forward trends in terms of our pricing and our revenue associated with price differences. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Next question please? Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Whit Mayo with UBS. Please go ahead. Whit Mayo : Thanks. Good morning. What are you guys thinking about or sharing some [Indiscernible] at levels across all your lines of business this year. So, maybe instead of asking suspenders, what are the signposts that you are looking towards perhaps shift that policy? Gail Boudreaux : Well, thanks for the question, Whit. You know, as we think about policies, obviously, in our government business, that continues to be and I think part of the guideposts really are about and where we are in the pandemic and access to care. Right now, we are seeing offices open and we are seeing individuals to have access to care clearly as long as there is a serious issue on COVID and the pandemic. And we are seeing rise in cases. It\u2019s something that we continue to evaluate. There is a lot of uncertainties right now and a lot of questions. Timing into vaccine, expanded testing which we continue to model pent-up demand and we are seeing as we mentioned that going above the baseline. So we are seeing people access care, which is important. And remember, our goal is also, we are reaching out to make sure that people have the right access to care particularly those we know who have multiple kind of conditions across our book of business. So, in terms of that, we continue to model it. We continue to look at it and our goal is to ensure that we have appropriate access to care.  And that is, we are learning a lot more about each of the events that are happening with COVID. Thanks for the question and next one please? Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Dave Styblo with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dave Styblo : Hi there. Thanks for the question. So, a quick clarification. John, when you talked about the MOR being 300 to 350 days at this point, above normal is sort of a fourth quarter of 18 a reasonable pocket to think about as a point of clarification. And then, second \u2013 the other question really is on Medicare Advantage.  You guys are talking about double-digit growth again more strong momentum. I guess, in past years, just the geographic expansion of your footprint has certainly helped that, as we look at the MA landscape file this period, it looks like you are only expanding by 1% or 2% of the senior population. So, I am just wondering what gives you confidence that you can sustain that momentum in terms of taking share from peers? John Gallina : Thank you, Dave. I\u2019ll answer the first half of the question associated with the MOR. Yes, the fourth quarter of 2018, of course doesn\u2019t need to be mix adjusted a bit for the fact that our membership mix has changed. But the fourth quarter of 2018 is as good of a starting point as any from a comparative basis to look at that 300, 350 basis point increase that I referenced. Gail Boudreaux : In terms of the second question, why do we feel confident about our growth projections? There are few things. One, I shared in my opening comments, which is really very strong product offering. We expect 90 plus percent of our members to be in or have access to zero premium plans. Our supplemental benefits continue to be some of the strongest offerings in this space.  And then third, we believe that there is still significant opportunity in our states to expand. I mean, right now, we don\u2019t have number one market share in many of those states and there is growth. We do have number one market share in the commercial space and our Blue brand is incredibly strong in those states. And then states where we are selling outside our Blue brand, we also are seeing some really nice momentum. We have partnerships and joint ventures with our Blue rather. And so, again, we are seeing a lot of momentum. Our brand resonates well. Our digital channels are also resonating very well in terms of the sales to marketplace. So, overall, while we don\u2019t have a significant \u2013 we have some expansion. We expect to gain market share in our states and we do think that our 85 new counties that we\u2019ve entered will also help us. But again, we feel our offerings are very strong and are resonating quite well. Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Steve Willoughby : Hi. Good morning. Just a quick question. I was wondering how you guys are thinking about cost of vaccines and therapies for COVID in 2021 in terms of essentially who is going to be paying for them and how much? Gail Boudreaux : Well, thanks for the question. I think, while you are focused on vaccines, no one really has the ultimate answer at this stage, where we are watching the situation very closely and learning about the potential. We\u2019ve modeled a lot of scenarios into our pricing. There is a number of variables, obviously around vaccines including when they\u2019ll be available from as early as January, or is it summer of 2021.  Clearly, dosing requirements, vaccination rates, storage, transportation, whole lot of things. I mean, that obviously goes to say that there is a ton of variables. But remember, vaccines are only one cost of COVID in total. We are looking at the total cost of COVID and I wouldn\u2019t look at this into cancellation. Our goal obviously is to advocate to protect our highest risk members first.  So, again that gets to the timing. But we also understand that CMS is going to be providing guidance at some point and we\u2019ll obviously look to follow their lead accordingly. Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead. I apologize. Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : Hi. Good morning. A two-part question. Given the business optimization benefits are fairly material number, would you anticipate also excluding those from adjusted earnings guidance in 2021? The second part of the question, just wondering we looked the last four years share repurchases around between about $1.7 billion and $2 billion annualized \u2013 on an annualized basis. Would it be in that range again this year? Anything extraordinary contemplated there for either 4Q or 2021 in that 2021 outlook? Thanks. John Gallina : Yes. Hey. Good morning, Gary. And thank you for the questions. Yes, first of all in the business optimization, we did certainly exclude the charge here in the third quarter. And the benefits associated with that will certainly come through over a period of years and become part of our runrate cost savings associated with the administrative structure of this company.  And again, as we had talked about, we have got our plan to get to a 11% to 12% SG&A ratio by 2023 that we have referenced at our Investor Day and this is certainly one step to get there. The other part of the question or the answer I would say is that, we\u2019ve also talked about incrementally investing really putting more money into the digital and AI, putting more money into the stars type of investments and we are obviously not going to exclude any of those cost from our numbers. So, 2021, we think should be fairly clean from that perspective that we\u2019ll have some savings and we\u2019ll have some reinvestment opportunities to really help position the company much, much better for the future. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. And I just like to reiterate too, it\u2019s a one-time charge. So just so we are clear about that. John Gallina : Yes. This year, yes, thank you. And then, on the share repurchase, we\u2019ve repurchased approximately $1.3 billion through the end of September. We have a increased share repurchase pace a bit here in the third quarter, especially when our stock price was really down, we thought far greater than what it could or should have been based on a PE multiple perspective.  We are obviously going to be opportunistic and watchful of market conditions. Our stated goal is to reinvest about 50% of our free cash flow into either M&A or back into the business, 30% in the share buyback and 20% in the dividends. As I\u2019ve stated, I do believe that those buckets are going to be appropriate over a five year period of time.  They will never be exactly correct in any one quarter. And probably not even exactly correct in any one full year. But I would expect that we would continue our share buyback here in the fourth quarter and maybe end the year little bit higher than what we\u2019ve been in the last couple of years, just given the weakness in the stock price that we saw.  And then head into 2021 from there. But at the end of the day, we need to be opportunistic with our capital and ensure that it\u2019s being allocated appropriately. Thank you, Gary. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, John. I think we have time for one last question. Operator : And our final question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Okay. Thanks. Thanks for sending me in here under the wire. A question, I just wanted to circle back just on the Blues settlement. And I know it\u2019s early here in terms of how this ultimately may affect the broader Blues landscape. But just, answer - so Gail, I guess, two parts.  One, do you think that ultimately this could lead to a renewal over time of the Blues consolidation theme, which obviously has been dormant for the last 15 years or so? And then also just from a strategy perspective, for Anthem, whether, the elimination of the Blues rules would lead you to think about doing larger non-Blues acquisitions over time? Gail Boudreaux : Well, thanks for the question, Scott. And, as I said before, our strategy, which we laid out at Investor Day has remained incredibly consistent. And so, we don\u2019t see this changing our strategy. We have significant opportunities to partner with Blues, as part of our diversified business group. We\u2019ve been very successful in selling in services and IngenioRx offers other opportunities.  And as you know, from our Medicaid and Medicare business, we\u2019ve done a number of partnerships with them well and recently Ingest announced actually a partnership in our group Medicare. So, I think, from our perspective, as I said before, I see \u2013 I really don\u2019t see this changing our stated strategy and I think that we are very excited about the growth prospects we have across Anthem. So, thanks very much for that question. With that, I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call this morning. As we shared today, Anthem is not a blow path for growth across our enterprise driven by our commitment to deliver a simpler, more affordable, and more effective healthcare experience for those that we are privileged to serve.  As always, I want to express my gratitude to our associates for their unwavering commitment to our customers, members and communities during this most challenging time for our country.  As you can see, we remain committed to delivering a simpler, more affordable and personalized experience for those we serve. And I look forward to building on our momentum throughout 2020. Thank you for your time and your continued interest in Anthem.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company\u2019s management. Please go ahead. Chris Rigg : Good morning. this is Chris Rigg and welcome to Anthem\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. As many of you know, I have transitioned the Head of Investor Relations to be the Chief Financial Officer of our Commercial & Specialty Business division. Steve Tanal will be joining Anthem as the new Vice President of Investor Relations. So, we look forward to welcoming him next week. With us this morning on the earnings call are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of our Commercial & Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today\u2019s press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Boudreaux : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Anthem\u2019s fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. Despite a year challenged by COVID-19 and significant economic uncertainty, we delivered strong growth across all of our businesses. This morning, Anthem reported fourth quarter 2020 GAAP earnings per share of $2.19 and adjusted earnings per share of $2.54. For the full year, Anthem reported GAAP earnings per share of $17.98 and adjusted earnings per share of $22.48. Our full-year results reflect the ongoing impact of COVID-19 treatment costs and more normal utilization patterns in the second half of the year. Consistent with our expectations, fourth quarter utilization was above baseline, reflecting higher costs attributable to the recent surge of COVID-19 cases, coupled with the return of non-COVID-19 care utilization. I\u2019m incredibly proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished in 2020, and the strength and resiliency shown by our enterprise amidst the global pandemic. We met our financial commitments, delivered strong growth, and we stepped up as a business and through the commitment and compassion of our associates to support our members, partners, and communities when they needed us most to address the new increase in an urgent need. Our growth in 2020 was powered by strategic investments we\u2019ve made in recent years to streamline and simplify our business and enhance the member and customer experience. Membership trends in the year exceeded expectations on all fronts. Medical enrollment finished the year strong at 42.9 members representing growth of 1.9 million members over the prior year. We\u2019re pleased that our commercial business has continued to grow even in this challenging economic environment. In addition to the AmeriBen acquisition, growth has been fueled by strong customer retention and a steady pipeline of new accounts sales. In fact, sales in our large group risk business that outpaced lapses in 14 of the last 16 months, reflecting the market leading performance of our new virtual strategies and tools, as well as the benefit of our innovative products, such as Total Health, Total You and further integration of our pharmacy offerings from IngenioRx. Total commercial membership was flat sequentially in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in our risk-based group business offset by in-group change in our fee-based business as a result of the economic environment. Our risk-based business has been incredibly resilient as we\u2019ve deepened talent, enhanced our products and improved sales execution across our markets. In addition, sales of our large group\u2019s specialty dental and vision products outperformed 2019 results, demonstrating that employers value the affordability and simplicity of Anthem\u2019s integrated medical and specialty offerings, it\u2019s clear the actions we\u2019ve taken to focus on the consumer and their unique needs are garnering a strong market response. Medicaid membership grew by roughly 1.6 million consumers during the year and nearly, 300,000 lives in the fourth quarter, marked by strong organic growth aided by the pause on new verifications, and two strategic acquisitions in Nebraska and Missouri. Medicare Advantage membership ended the year of nearly 18% compared to 2019, continuing our meaningful growth in senior business. Our essential extra suite of benefit options are resonating with seniors as we saw greater than 300% increase in the selection of benefits, such as personal home helper services, transportation benefits, and access to personal home safety devices. We\u2019re pleased with our continued growth in this important segment for Anthem and the demonstrated resilience of our diversified portfolio. Our AEP performance is in line with expectations and we expect another year of double-digit growth, once again, outperforming the industry average growth rate. Over the past year, Anthem stepped up as we trusted health partner to support our stakeholders as they navigated the pandemic. We adapted and accelerated our digital innovations, enhanced our focus on community health, transformed many of our products and solutions, and simplified our processes in the context of COVID-19. We recognize our critical role in ensuring safe access to care and COVID-19 vaccinations, and have launched a nationwide partnership with Lyft to support universal access to vaccines. We are leveraging Anthem\u2019s local market strength, provider relationships and data assets in combination with this on demand transportation network to serve at-risk communities, disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Our goal is to provide 60 million free rides to and from vaccination sites for low-income uninsured and at-risk communities. Further, we recently launched a new online C-19 vaccine tracker to provide personalized vaccination insights for Anthem members. This web-based dashboard aggregates vaccine-related data from public and private sources to give consumers a real-time view of vaccine distribution progress and help to inform our members when they might be eligible to receive the vaccine. We recognize the increased social and health needs of our members and communities during this pandemic. With each of our Medicaid States, we\u2019re performing detailed community needs, assessments to create localized solutions with our partners to support issues with housing, job training, and free internet for underserved children. And our Medicare members are provided access to firm-based social workers to help coordinate local resources and services to support their needs around food and security, transportation and more. For members with complex conditions such as cancer receiving care has become even more difficult during this pandemic. in response, we\u2019ve launched Anthem\u2019s Concierge Cancer Care Program from diagnosis to recovery, members received personalized 24/7 guidance and support to live health online and remote monitoring technology with access to top-tier cancer facilities across the country. This unique program has more than tripled since its launch in 2020. It is now available to nearly 900,000 members. Throughout the course of this past year, our deeply committed associates have stepped up and shown great compassion and care to those who serve and to one another. With more than a 100,000 volunteers always will have in our local communities through in-person and virtual giving. Our associates have embodied our values and culture, reflecting the fabric of who we are. As we move into 2021, we will continue to modernize our business to drive growth efforts to transform our business are not new. And in fact, our focus was sharpened and investments accelerated, and why did the pandemic? Today, we are continuing to consolidate our systems automated and streamlined processes, and embedding digital and AI across the enterprise to simplify and improve the customer experience and deepened engagement with all those we served. We've recognized the power of digital technologies to reach more of our stakeholders, particularly as part of our community health efforts; Kidney Health is personalizing care for consumers, helping to bridge gaps in care and improve outcomes for underserved populations. In fact, Kidney Health recently received several awards, including corporate insights, gold medal for virtual care, recognizing our ability to give members more options and how they engage with care providers, whether it be via chat, email, phone, or video, who are excited to be introduced in the first of its kind digital nutrition assistant. Through the use of AI, our food and nutrition app will be able to automatically recognize food and log meals and meal time, providing users with personalized information and progress on nutrition goals. This integrated tool is currently available to Anthem associates that will be available more broadly later this year to provide our members with a fully connected health and wellness experience. We know consumers are experiencing healthcare more digitally. So, we focused on creating greater access to care via telehealth, particularly in the behavioral health space with usage has gone up from single-digit pre-pandemic percentage levels to as much as 60% of all visits and that level has stayed consistent over the past four months. Our AI-based care finder is now live for all segments of our business and differentiates Anthem with a fully-integrated approach using predictive tool and AI to help guide members to the right care at the right time and place for them, which could mean via text, phone, video, in-personal chat. Additionally, through our AI-based predictive service and chat functionality, we were able to redirect five million member calls last year to on-demand digital channels, to provide members with information they needed quickly and efficiently. Today, we\u2019re delivering on consumer demands for simplicity and affordability, and we\u2019re helping to restore hope while making positive and sustainable change for our local communities grounded by our mission and driven by our purpose to improve the health of humanity. We move into 2021 with a bold agenda as we continue to grow and transform our business, and fundamentally improve the healthcare experience for those we serve. Our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance of greater than $24.50 reflects challenges unforeseen when we reported third quarter results, specifically adjusted net income guidance reflects the passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, which includes the one-year increase in Medicare physician rates as well as other COVID-19 related impacts on the Medicare business. All in, we estimate these items equate to a $0.50 to $0.70 net negative headwind. Importantly, these factors are transient and should diminish as we move into 2022. Looking ahead, we are poised to deliver membership growth of nearly 1.5 million members at the midpoint, driven predominantly by our risk-based businesses. our outlook reflects our ability to deliver solid enrollment growth despite the uncertainties in 2021. we remain confident in our ability to achieve long-term 12% to 15% earnings growth and look forward to our March 3rd virtual Investor Day. we will provide a more detailed look into our strategy, including the transformative digital and community health initiatives that are driving real growth across our business. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to John Gallina for a detailed look at our performance numbers. John? John Gallina : Thank you, Gail, and good morning. As Gail stated, we are pleased to report strong fourth quarter and full-year financial results. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $2.54, down 35% year-over-year driven primarily by cost related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including actions taken to support our members. for the full year adjusted earnings per share was $22.48 representing growth of 16% over 2019. total operating revenue for the fourth quarter was $31.5 billion, an increase of more than 16% over the prior-year quarter, reflecting solid growth in Medicaid and Medicare. for the full year, we ended 2020 serving 42.9 million members including growth of 300,000 lives during the fourth quarter. Medicaid membership was up more than 11 times the decline in our commercial risk-based business. This is the tenth consecutive quarter of membership growth, further demonstrating the strength and resiliency of our business. for the full year, operating revenue grew over 17%. The fourth quarter medical loss ratio was 88.9%, a decrease of 10 basis points over the prior-year quarter. COVID-related costs accelerated during the quarter above expectations. However, this was offset by non-COVID utilization coming in lower than expectations. taken together, overall utilization was above baseline, albeit slightly better than expected. The SG&A expense ratio in the fourth quarter was 13.7%, an increase of 80 basis points over the prior-year quarter due primarily to increased spending to support growth, including the efforts taken to modernize our business and become a more agile organization as well as the return of the health insurer fee in 2020. on a HIF-adjusted basis, our SG&A ratio decreased 30 basis points, compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by double-digit growth in operating revenue. Full year 2020 operating cash flow was $10.7 billion or 2.3 times net income. fourth quarter operating cash flow was $3.8 billion, compared to $1.3 billion in the prior-year quarter. the increase is primarily attributable to changes in our net working capital and enrollment growth in our government businesses. Our operating cash flow in the fourth quarter benefited by a number of payments that were originally expected to be received in 2021. These early receipts along with other items that benefited 2020 cash flow, including payment deferrals allowed under the CARES Act. We will reverse in 2021 and negatively impact our 2021 operating cash flow metrics. We ended 2020 with a strong balance sheet as the debt-to-cap ratio was 38.7%, consistent with our target range. Days in claims payable was 43.4 days, an increase of 2.3 days sequentially and 5.4 days versus the prior year, along with the growth in medical claims payable of 28% compared to an increase in premium revenue of approximately 11%. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 4.4 million shares and a weighted average price of $305.66. In total, we repurchased $2.7 billion of stock in 2020, or 9.4 million shares. As a reminder, our original guidance contemplated share repurchase of $1.5 billion. after reinstating share repurchases in the second quarter, we accelerated the pace of share buyback in the second half of the year in response to market conditions. Turning to our 2021 outlook, our current guidance reflects our latest assumptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, our guidance includes new items that were unknown at the time of our third quarter call, including the passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act in late December and the corresponding one year increase in Medicare physician payment rates and other COVID-related impacts on our Medicare business. In addition, the significant decline in non-COVID utilization in our Medicare business during the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll have an impact on our rich revenue by more than we had anticipated. all in, these items resulted in a net negative headwind of $0.50 to $0.70 per share, relative to the outlook we shared on our third quarter call. like 2020, 2021 presents its own set of the new challenges that we believe to be transient. our core business and underlying fundamentals remain strong, absent those new and unique circumstances. We remain confident that our long-term earnings growth target of 12% to 15% is both credible and sustainable. Turning to our 2021 guidance metrics. Total medical membership is expected to reach 44.4 million members at the midpoint, which reflects growth across our key business segments. In the commercial business, we project our risk-based enrollment in the year between 4.5 million to 4.6 million members. In our fee-based business during the year between 25.5 million and 25.7 million members. in our Medicaid business, we expect to end the year with approximately 10 million to 10.2 million lives, reflecting organic growth in our existing markets and the expectation that the re-verification process that remain on hold through the end of the year. In addition, our guidance also includes growth for North Carolina, which is expected to go wide later this year. In Medicare Advantage, we\u2019re projecting double-digit growth at the midpoint as we expect continued measured growth over the balance of 2021. Medicare supplement is expected to end the year between 950,000 and one million members, and our FEP business is expected to be flat to slightly down at 1.6 million members. with IngenioRx, now firmly embedded in our baseline, we expect 2021 operating revenue to be approximately $135.1 billion representing growth of 13.5% on a HIF-adjusted basis. The consolidated medical loss ratio is expected to be 88% plus or minus 50 basis points, an increase of 120 basis points at the midpoint from 2019, which is the most recent year, in which the health insurer fee does not apply. The increase is largely driven by a mix of business, more heavily skewed to Medicaid and Medicare, and the impact of COVID including the recently announced increase in Medicare physician rates. The SG&A expense ratio is expected to be 10.8% plus or minus 50 basis points, primarily due to growth and operating revenue. In addition to the permanent repeal of the health insurer fee and the benefit of modernization efforts, including systems consolidation and broader process automation. Looking below the line, we expect investment income to be $940 million, an interest expense of $785 million. The tax rate is expected to be in the range of 20% to 22% with the decrease primarily driven by the permanent repeal of the health insurer fee. Full-year operating cash flow is expected to be greater than $5.7 billion. As a reminder, operating cash flow in 2020 was heavily impacted by COVID-19 pandemic, as well as certain other receipts that were accelerated into 2020. absent the pull-through of those cash receipts, our 2021 operating cash flow will be roughly 1.1 times to 1.2 times net income. our long-term capital deployment targets are unchanged as we progress down this path of becoming the most innovative, valuable and inclusive partner in the healthcare ecosystem with the continued focus of delivering sustainable long-term shareholder returns. in terms of capital deployment, I am pleased to announce that we are increasing our quarterly dividend by nearly 19% to $1.13 per share, bringing our dividend yield to roughly 1.4% and continuing our trend of annual dividend increases. We expect full-year share repurchase of at least $1.6 billion in our weighted average share count in the year in the range of 246 million to 248 million shares outstanding. As Gail mentioned, this past year presented its own unique set of challenges. And while much has changed, it is clear that we are still in the depths of a global pandemic. We remain committed to our mission of improving the lives and communities, which we serve, and we will continue to do our part in 2021 to meet the needs of our associates, members, customers, and healthcare providers as we persevere through this pandemic together. operator, we will now open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to see if you can walk through the $0.50 to $0.70 as much detail as possible. You mentioned the stimulus with a higher physician fee schedule and the quarterly sequestration. So, I estimated that at about $0.20. So, I was hoping you could break out \u2013 confirm that and then break out the other $0.40 in terms of rebuild locations and how that benefits Medicaid, the higher total costs of 20% add on the Medicaid rebates, et cetera. And then lastly, can we assume that when you think about the 2021 jump-off point for the 12% to 15% EPS growth next year. Would you grow off the $25.10 getting back with $0.50? Thanks. John Gallina : Yes. Thank you, justin and good morning. I appreciate the question and the opportunity to clarify the $0.50 to $0.70 change in our expectations. as you mentioned, with the appropriations bill and the extension of the federal health emergency, we now have a disconnect between some of the costs and the embellishments. We completely agree with their approach to the Medicare at 3.75% fee schedule rate increases as well as a sequestration. The Medicare rate increased for 12 months. The sequestration is only for three months is an offset, but there\u2019s a third component as well. And that\u2019s a 20% bump in the inpatient DRG is going to be extended for the full year, as well as part of the federal health emergency. So, when we take the three of those combined that actually accounts for about two thirds of the $0.50 to $0.70 differential that you\u2019re asking about. the other one third really relates to the fact that the non-COVID utilization in the fourth quarter was lower than we had anticipated. And with the non-COVID utilization being lower than anticipated, we are unable to accurately capture all of the HCC codes to reflect our appropriate risk scores in our Medicare business. And so once you factor that in, that\u2019s about the other third. So, you take those out and we\u2019ll come down to the $25.10 that you have been modeling to the $24.50 at the midpoint. And then in terms of your question associated with the 2022 jump-off point, while it is premature to give 2022 guidance, it would be believed that many of these issues are transient and we\u2019re very comfortable affirming the 12% to 15% long-term sustainable growth rate on a $25.10 starting point. We always have the issue with COVID and rich revenues, and things could linger. And we will clearly be on top of that throughout the year. but as an outset, we\u2019re very comfortable with the $25.10 jump-off point. And thank you for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you for the question, Justin. next question. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. I know there are a lot of puts and takes around this question, but right now, people are trying to make an assumption as to when there be mass distribution of the vaccine and when things might start to get back to normal. Conceptually, when you think about your 2021 guidance, how have you pegged that thinking, and if we were to find out, for example, if we say, you\u2019ve pegged it for the middle of the year or later in the year, if it happens, if there\u2019s variance say, it\u2019s in March or it\u2019s in October, would that \u2013 how would that change the financial outlook that the company\u2019s presenting? John Gallina : Yes. Thank you, Jeff \u2013 A.J., I\u2019m sorry. A great question and as you\u2019ve indicated, there is a lot of variability and assumptions. the most vulnerable populations, which include Medicare advantage members, et cetera and our expectation is by the end of the first quarter that they will achieve the vaccination level appropriate. We\u2019re really looking at having somewhere in the neighborhood of about 60% of Americans vaccinated for the year. Medicare, we would expect to be a bit higher, the commercial population and the Medicaid population. We wouldn\u2019t expect the vaccines to be rolled out and complete it until the end of the summer. Maybe, even a little bit longer with the commercial population being close to the average for America for the year and then Medicaid being a little bit less. So, to the extent of the rollout and the efficacy of the vaccine, very clearly, could have an impact on the financial results for the year. As COVID costs go down when we do expect non-COVID utilization to increase. So, it\u2019s certainly not a one-for-one, but there\u2019s clearly a lot of dynamics associated with that modeling. And if the vaccine is either faster or slower, it\u2019ll have an impact in one direction or another. And hopefully, that helps. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. And A.J., this is Gail Boudreaux. I think, in addition to John\u2019s question, as we shared, it is an incredibly dynamic environment relative to what\u2019s happening with COVID and the vaccine. As I shared in my opening comments, we are working very closely though, to try to ensure access for our members. We\u2019ve added a number of new tools in terms of the, our trackers and our online tool kit, ensure that people know where vaccines are available. We\u2019re going to work with our States closely. We entered a partnership with Lyft to provide 60 million free rides. Our sense is that the senior population, obviously, in the rollout is going to have first access to that. And then if each of the States make their determinations and supply becomes available, we\u2019ll be side-by-side, who their partners to ensure that, that we can be as efficient in helping as possible. So again, everything John said, I think, we are trying to model in this incredibly dynamic environment, but remain optimistic and supportive of what\u2019s happening and want to be a good partner to our States and our customers. So, thank you for the question, our next question, please. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. your line is now open. Steven Valiquette : Okay, great. Thanks. Good morning, Gail and John. thanks for taking the question here. So, it\u2019s just in relation to those higher Medicare physician rates for 2021. If I was curious to hear more about the mechanics of this, just whether or not any of your capitated or at-risk payment arrangements with physicians would provide any sort of protection for Anthem again, impacts. And therefore, this might have greater impact on your fee for service arrangements with physicians, or is everything just indexed to the rate update and that doesn\u2019t really matter, but curious to hear more about the mechanics on that. Thanks. John Gallina : Yes. Thanks, Steve. I appreciate the question. The amount that we\u2019ve disclosed in terms of the impact on our guidance, it\u2019s really the net amount regardless of the risk methodology; we have with the provider network. So certainly, in the capital [ph] arrangement, there is an impact as I had stated in the A.J\u2019s question, we also have the 20% bump in inpatient DRG. It\u2019s impacting all this as well, and then the sequestration offset. So, we got to take them all into consideration, look at how they play through the reimbursement methodologies and what we\u2019ve provided is the net impact of all those. Steven Valiquette : Okay. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Yes. Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes. Hi, good morning. Question focused on the exchange business appears to competitive \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s always been competitive, but we\u2019re hearing some anecdotes and increased competition. How do you think about a dynamic in \u2013 specifically, how do you think about sort of, kind of like the margin goals that you have articulated in the past? Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, Ricky. I\u2019m going to ask Pete Haytaian, who leads our commercial business to respond. Pete? Pete Haytaian : Yes. thanks a lot for the question, Ricky. in terms of the individual business and sort of, as we see Q1 play out, we feel good about our strategy. We continue our thoughtful targeted approach and targeted growth approach in the individual business. We\u2019ve expanded into about 115 counties in 2021. Our approach continues to be based upon a focus on best-in-class economics, through value-based relationships, differentiated medical management, but really try to partner with key providers to enable excellence in quality and risk adjustment. And so that\u2019s been our grounding and we continue with that strategy. Overall this year, while we\u2019ll experience growth, environmental, and I think you\u2019re alluding to this. There is more competition. Also, there does appear to be less overall new sales across the federal facilitated marketplace and the state-based exchanges. It seems to be down a bit year-over-year. We believe that this is due to a variety of different factors. We all know that in several states, there were special election periods throughout 2020, which certainly, could have been a factor, also less overall government engagement and that could change with the Biden administration just in terms of overall marketing and then less prospect engagement, we saw that just in light of the political environment and the economic climate. but all that said as we look forward, we do remain optimistic regarding this business, the new administration, certainly, it looks like they\u2019re going to promote and pop up, excuse me, the ACA business. We just heard this week that we\u2019ll likely see an extension to open enrollment or special enrollment periods throughout the year, and then a possibility of more marketing and facilitated enrollment expenditures. So overall, I think we\u2019ll continue with our thoughtful approach, but with the new administration, I think there\u2019s an opportunity for further growth there. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. And I would just add to Pete\u2019s comments that we\u2019ve had a very consistent strategy around the individual marketplace that really hasn\u2019t changed year-over-year. We\u2019ve done some expansion in States, where we obviously have a very deep footprint and we would continue to be opportunistic and very optimistic about what we think the opportunities are there. So, it\u2019s again, very consistent with what we shared with you in the last couple of years. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is now open. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping to get into the MLR guidance a little bit more, John, the 80% \u2013 maybe, you can give us some underlying assumptions, it does imply a step up and I know you mentioned mix. But even outside of that, it seemed a little bit higher. So hoping maybe, a sense of expectation of what you assumed in guidance around maybe, Local Group medical costs for 2021 and how we should consider that maybe off of either 2020, or maybe 2019. Thanks. John Gallina : Yes. Thank you, Ralph for that question. and when we look at our MLR guidance, we certainly believe it\u2019s appropriate given the uncertainty around the timing and the efficacy of the vaccine rollout and the full-year impact of COVID, as well as those unexpected changes in Medicare physician rates and sequestration, timing mismatch that I talked about earlier, have obviously, all been incorporated in the 88%. But we\u2019re only looking at 2019 is the point of comparison since that was the last period that there was not a HIF. It\u2019s really; it\u2019s a fairly simple roll forward from that perspective. You look at the mix of the business that we have today with far more Medicaid members. We actually have had exceedingly strong growth in our Medicare advantage the last few years, being in the upper teens on a couple of year basis and exceeding the rest of the industry. All of that obviously changes our business mix. And just on a apples-to-apples basis, mix is driving about 60 basis points of the increase in the 2021 MLR versus the 2019 MLR. And then when we look at the impacts of COVID and there\u2019s a lot of things that go into COVID, there\u2019s certainly the cost of COVID, which is in the billions of dollars. There is non-COVID utilization impacts and in terms of, we believe that non-COVID utilization will be less than what a normal year would be in vacuum. And then of course, we had the pricing actions that we\u2019ve taken into account for that, as well as our reimbursements from regulatory entities that we believe are appropriate in the COVID environment. When we take the net of all those, the impact of COVID is another 30 basis points to 50 basis points on our MLR for 2021. And there\u2019s a multitude of other small items going in both directions that may be comprised of last 10 basis points. but it\u2019s really, those two items, with mix in COVID. thank you for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. George Hill : Yes. Good morning, John. You actually just covered everything that I was going to ask about the MLR and the COVID impact. I guess I would just say, one of your peers called out the COVID impact in Q4. I\u2019m wondering if you guys would be willing to do that. And then Gail, my follow-up is now that Ingenio was kind of fully stood up. Where do you see the white space in Anthem\u2019s offering going forward? John Gallina : Sure. I\u2019ll start with your question, George. and then and then turn it over to Gail. in terms of the COVID cost, I think really, probably, your question is what type of COVID costs are included in your guidance. And as I said, there\u2019s many factors and variables and so we\u2019ve spent considerable time analyzing and modeling potential impacts. A few of the peers, A.J. in particular, is asking, what happens with COVID vaccine with a lot of different concerns? Well, I\u2019ll tell you of all the modeling assumptions we have, the timing and efficacy of the vaccine is one of the assumptions that has the greatest amount of variability associated with it. But anyway all in, we\u2019re estimating that we have about a $600 million COVID headwind inherent in our 2021 guidance. And as I said, COVID costs when we include testing, treatment, vaccine administration, all the other things such as the Medicare fee schedules the sequestration, the various waves, it\u2019s several billions of dollars. but offsetting that is non-COVID utilization, less than a normal year, the pricing actions that we\u2019ve taken in regulatory reimbursement and we\u2019ve been modeling all that and it\u2019s coming out to about $600 million. And you only think about that, think about our $24.50, and then you add $600 million to that, that puts us really at the high end or slightly above the high end of our 12% to 15% growth rate range that we\u2019ve talked about on a sustainable basis. So again, we do believe that a lot of these issues are transient. and there would probably be some lingering effects in the 2022. We feel very good about the underlying core business fundamentals that we have in the company. So, wit that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Gail. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. thanks, John. And I just want to reiterate what John said in terms of just, we feel very good about these issues in our long-term EPS trajectory. And as you think about your question on IngenioRx; first of all, we\u2019re really pleased with the performance of IngenioRx has come in on our expectations. And I think that, we\u2019re past the transition and now, we\u2019re into know full integration of that business with our other opportunities. They think about it. IngenioRx, one of the areas this year, we had some nice sales and some real good throughput in integration with our commercial business, but it was impacted somewhat by the jumbo accounts, really not going out to market this past year. So, we would expect as we sell through 2021 that there\u2019s continuing an ongoing opportunity to integrate IngenioRx with our commercial footprint. And that\u2019s one of our biggest opportunities still. We still see a lot of runway for us to increase the penetration particularly, in our middle-sized and large accounts with integrated pharmacy benefit offerings. We did see some nice wins in 2021 on standalone business, which we\u2019re really, really happy with and we think that that\u2019s a big opportunities for to continue the impact on large accounts this year for just what\u2019s happening in the economy, I think is sort of depressed sales activity and movement, but we have very strong retention across both our commercial and our Ingenio books. So overall, we feel Ingenio is tracking very much aligned to our expectations and really, pleased with the performance of the business to-date. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to a lot of Kevin Fischbeck with bank of America. Your line is now open. Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. I wanted to see what your guidance was including for two of the, I guess, things that might still be a little bit influx, as far as the Biden policies, I guess, first on the view about redeterminations or do you assume that they\u2019re going to come back this year or in fact not come back until next year. And the second, how you\u2019re thinking about testing costs, it sounds like you\u2019re including some testing costs in there. but I guess Biden\u2019s been talking about having insurers cover potentially back to work and back to school type testing, which it\u2019s not clear that companies weren\u2019t necessarily pricing to. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks for the question. In terms of the sort of understanding inside of our guidance on the two issues reverification and testing. first, on reverification, we originally, I can share with you, our thoughts on where this year would come out. Our assumption was that the public health emergency would end in the first quarter that\u2019s what we knew at the time. but we also felt that Medicaid reverifications would probably really begin in the summer. So that was embedding our thinking. The other thing I think it\u2019s important to know is right now, we\u2019re assuming, based on the letter to governors that recently came out that reverifications will be on hold for all of 2021. But in our \u2013 even in our original assumptions, we never assumed that there will be cliff events and I think that\u2019s also an important assumption as you think about the progression of enrollment over the course of the year that law States were trying to understand their data and managing this, that given just the challenging conditions within each of these States that that would happen over time in the back half of the year. So again, as we think about this year, we\u2019re expecting no reverification \u2013 really, reverification to be on pause for the full year given sort of the initial guidance that\u2019s been given to governors. in terms of your second question, the policy issue on testing, we agree that testing is probably one of the most critical parts of controlling the spread of COVID, and we\u2019ve been strongly supportive of a wide availability of testing offerings and then it isn\u2019t unprecedented in terms of the situation, trying to understand the additional support for all types of testing and expanding that capacity and also finding it quite frankly, new, reliable, rapid, and inexpensive ways to do this. to think about our industry, health plan benefits have always traditionally covered medical tests as appropriate to diagnose and treat individuals that were ordered by a physician. This is consistent with long-held insurance practices or contracts, and quite frankly, federal guidance. And so as we think about workplace testing examples of that that have happened over, certainly drug testing or other traditional ways, employers have paid for that outside of the health benefit. And then similarly public health surveillance testing has traditionally been paid for by States and local health departments. So, those are \u2013 I mean, as we think about that we\u2019ve followed that consistent approach to testing and also gave you a sense of what we\u2019ve been under verification. So, thank you for that question. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. We\u2019ve kind of hit on this from various different quantifiable angles around the MLR, et cetera. but just maybe, going back, conceptually, I think one of the biggest concerns investors have is the risks that as COVID subsides, there\u2019s a bolus of deferred utilization and/or that utilization might be a higher acuity as \u2013 if health conditions have progressed and worsened, because of deferred care. So, when we think in the line of business, where that impact seems to be \u2013 the deferred impact seems to be most significant throughout 2020, seems to be the Medicare business, where seniors have stayed away as much as they are able to. So, as we think about your sort of house view in 2021, how are you thinking about non-COVID utilization, whether there is really pent-up demand, not just getting back to normal and whether that acuity is higher, and is that view particularly any different for commercial Medicare or Medicaid. John Gallina : Thank you for the question, Gary. and as you can imagine when I discussed earlier, the extensive modern that we\u2019ve done, there\u2019s a lot of different thought processes around that. but conceptually, yes, we do believe that there is pent-up demand in the system, and we do believe that there\u2019s a chance as it could be higher acuity associated with when folks get care. And that\u2019s probably most pronounced in the Medicare line of business. So really, the question is not if those will happen, because we believe those will happen. The question is to what extent and how significant, and then you also have things like emergency room, Biden and we believe will remain low, and that the way that people access care will continue to change a bit in the future as it had in the past. To the extent that COVID stays high, and then we expect non-COVID utilization, whether it\u2019s the normal utilization pent-up demand or anything else to actually be below normal. to the extent that COVID subsides and the vaccine is extremely successful. We do expect that to go off, there\u2019s really clearly a natural hedge in there. I have talked in response to other questions about what the net impact is and we really don\u2019t want to talk about specifically, how much we have for each of those buckets, because you\u2019re so fungible and interchangeable, and they do hedge an offset each other. But yes, the promise of your question, we completely agree with that, we believe is that based on our various modeling sensitivities and understanding of our membership that we believe that the guidance we\u2019ve provided is very solid and very appropriate and prudent. and that we\u2019ll be able to manage through changes in either direction. Thank you for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line Whit Mayo with UBS. Your line is now open. Whit Mayo : Hey, thanks. I\u2019m just curious what you guys are sort of assuming and thinking about COVID cost sharing this year. Is there any change in how you approach that? should we anticipate continuing to waive co-pays for the entirety of the year? And one other question I have is just around the sequester that if it does get delayed for the balance of 2021, how \u2013 is there any way to maybe size the impact there? Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, Whit. As we think about, as we\u2019ve heard, actually on this call, it\u2019s an incredibly dynamic environment. in terms of cost shares, the part of the public health emergency we are waving right now, cost shares for testing and obviously, when the vaccine deployment comes in, those will all be included. as part of this environment, I think the biggest impact of cost shares is going to be in the first quarter, which we\u2019ve shared with you. we\u2019re assessing access to care and how all of that is happening across each of our businesses. So, from that perspective and what I would say is first quarter is really how you should be thinking about the biggest impact of cost share waivers. And again, because of all the impacts that are happening, it\u2019s pretty, pretty dynamic. And so we\u2019re reacting and making sure that we assess that on a real-time basis. In terms of the sequester, maybe, I\u2019ll ask John to comment on the sequester. John Gallina : Well, the \u2013 thank you. So, there\u2019s clearly a disconnect right now. So, say that sequestration versus the DRG bump in the Medicare rate increase of 3.75%. The issue really, is that what the extension of the federal health emergency, the DRG bump is going to be for the full year. We know that based on the Appropriations Act that the Medicare rate schedule is going to be for the full year and sequestrations only for the first 90 days. And unfortunately, that will require a legislative action in order to extend the sequestrations. So, we have not included an extension of that and our guidance at this point in time. That really helps. thanks for the question, Whit. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Dave Windley : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You had \u2013 management had sized a $500 million number from Medicaid risk corridor or call-back, wondered if that turned out to be the $100 million that was going to fall in the fourth quarter, if that turned out to be an accurate assessment or if it was different than that and to what extent, are you viewing those call-backs are continuing into 2021. And then if I could slip in, the flu season is just extraordinarily, low apart from COVID and wondered if that has any impact on your thoughts or guidance for 2021? Thanks. John Gallina : Thanks, Dave. appreciate the question. And get together, all of which knows a little bit of a frame of reference in terms of when I answer it. In terms of some of the Medicaid call-backs, et cetera, we had experienced about a $100 million in the first six months of the year, had about $300 million worth in the third quarter. And during the third quarter call was asked, what do you think the full year is going to be? And I said, probably, we expected to be a little bit more than a $0.5 billion, meaning that just over a $100 million in fourth quarter. While it turned out that it was more than that in the fourth quarter, there is almost $250 million in the fourth quarter and to make almost $650 million for the year. I think it\u2019s very important to note that even with that $650 million call-backs with all the various corridor and collar and other rate protections that existed within that block of business, that Medicaid still into 2020 within target margin ranges. In terms of the impacts for the future, we have about half of our Medicaid States are re-priced on January 1. We are very comfortable with the actuarial credibility of those rates thus far and believe that we will continue to work with our state partners, in terms of the challenges that they\u2019re facing, and they\u2019re respectful of their budget issues, but the still received rates that are actuary sound and actuary solid for 2021. And then there are rate protections, as I said, between collars, corridors, rebates, whatever you want to call them, they all have the same aspect to try to better align cost and revenue within the same timeframe in same period. So, we\u2019re actually very bullish about our ability here in Medicaid. And then in terms of the flu season, yes, they \u201ctypical flu season or influenza season is much less than anticipated.\u201d We\u2019ve factored that in; I\u2019ve talked about non-COVID utilization being less than normal in total for the year that is part of the calculus. So, we\u2019re actually thrilled with a lot of things that we did even; we took staff to ensure that our members had access to the flu vaccine through our fall through campaign. You may not know this, but Anthem partnered with over a 100 community-based organizations across our markets. And we stood up 500 pop-up and drive to clinics and insurance neighborhoods to promote and support higher immunization rates. And we believe some of our efforts help contribute to the lower than normal flu incidence. And as I said, that\u2019s all factored into the non-credit utilization comments that I made earlier. I appreciate the question, Dave. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open. Joshua Raskin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Question is Anthem\u2019s strategy around working with physicians and health systems and risk-based arrangements. And if you could size the overall spend that you see going through risk-based contracts, and specifically, through global capitation. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. We\u2019ve shared this publicly a few times. We\u2019re a north of 60% in some type of \u2013 we\u2019ll call it, upside downside risk. So, what does that mean? It\u2019s a variety of relationships that we have, and we are moving to increase the much more capitated full risk arrangements, particularly in our government business. At this stage, a lot of them are gained shares. Although we do have a component of that 60% in full risk, our strategy is to continue to build upon that. And we believe that having one in eight patients in our markets that are Anthem patients across our book of business provides us a real foothold in those marketplaces and we\u2019ve been working with our care providers to improve that we started with the program was really based on primary care capitation and working with them on your share to get them more involved. So, our strategy does revolve around primary care. And we\u2019re going to continue to build on that. We have 180 accountable care organizations. 23% of those are roughly operating under shared risk arrangements as well. And then if you think about other innovation programs, you\u2019ve got about 69% of our medical spend tied to performance-based contracts as well. So, as you can see, this for us is evolving. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been working on for a number of years we\u2019ve had. the infrastructure in place to do it, and now, we\u2019re increasing and enhancing the amount of full risk that our care providers are taking with us. And we actually expect that to accelerate, because of the pandemic. We see an increased interest across our businesses and physicians working with us, and we find plenty of access in our markets. I mean, I think that\u2019s the question that\u2019s been asked before, is there enough capacity in our markets and we\u2019ve seen many of our physicians very willing to move along the continuum with us. So, it\u2019s a journey probably a few years still until we get to where we want to do. but ultimately, we make progress every year and it\u2019s a core part of our strategy. The other area that I just want to touch on is telehealth, which is another part of our strategy, not tied necessarily to behavioral health or not tied necessarily to risk-based payments, but we also see telehealth, tele-behavioral health, and in particular, a growing part of our strategy, I shared more than 50% of our visits and behavioral are done via telehealth. We think that\u2019s a great access. We also think bringing in quite frankly, not just physical health on the medical side, but behavioral health into these arrangements, and our pharmacy actually completes the circle for us. And then some of the capabilities within our Diversified Business Group around palliative care and the work that they\u2019re doing to make sure that we are being better positioned with data to help manage these relationships is another area that we\u2019ve been investing very heavily in. So, thanks for the question. It\u2019s a core part of our strategy. We\u2019re on a journey. We still have some work to do. but I think we\u2019ve made really good progress and continued to move down the risk corridors. So, thank you. Next question. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Your line is now open. Lance Wilkes : Yes. Could you talk a little bit about your strategy, and partnering and cross-selling into other Blue Cross organizations, and in particular, could you hit three areas that it\u2019d just be interesting to understand the progress and the outlook for Ingenio, for our diversified in particular, the Beacon asset name, and then also your Medicaid partnerships? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you very much. I\u2019ll begin, and then I\u2019m going to ask Felicia to share some comments around our Medicaid partnerships. You hit really on the three key areas that we\u2019re partnering with our Blue, other Blue plans on, and even there\u2019s a couple of others. First, in terms of Ingenio, as you know, Blue Cross of Idaho is one of our first commercial partners in that space, and we just added their Medicare Advantage business on January 1st. We continue to work across Ingenio in addition to several other relationships that we\u2019ve had with other Blues; it\u2019s a longer-term sales process, because as you know, most of those contracts are three to five-year contracts. So, it takes some time. And we really, until this year, we\u2019re not in a position, I think with the transition and other things we\u2019re doing to take on most of those kinds of arrangements. So, we\u2019ve actually been very balanced in pacing the relationships that we\u2019ve had there, but we actually do think there\u2019s a really good opportunity for us to continue to build and expand. An area that you didn\u2019t talk about specifically was the relationship we have in the group Medicare business. We\u2019ve got some partnerships there also with other Blues that we think, will help us to expand our combined footprint. And we\u2019ve been working with Blue \u2013 our Blue partners on that, because we think we offer obviously, some capabilities in that space and we can work with them on their commercial business to convert that to group Medicare and we\u2019ve had some wins this year in that area as well. The last areas of the Diversified Business Group and Beacon\u2019s a great example. I mean, that asset that we purchased and brought onto the Anthem family in the last year, we see as a very big opportunity. They obviously have a large footprint even before integrating with Anthem. They work with a number of Blue partners. We consider that an opportunity to integrate our whole health strategy. And we see our Blue peer is also very interested in expanding there in addition, on the Diversified Business Group, we\u2019ve seen meaningful opportunities to expand CareMore and Aspire. Those are two other companies that have worked with Blue partners. And then we\u2019re in a joint venture on our integrated health consumer capabilities, which we\u2019ve talked about in terms of Total Health, Total You, and some of the other work that we\u2019re doing, because those awful \u2013 also offer opportunities. So, as you can see a lot of different things are happening. These are generally several year sales. So, I won\u2019t say that it\u2019s going to happen overnight, but we\u2019ve seen a real increase in the external business that we\u2019ve had in working with our group partners. Medicaid is the space that we started our partnerships with, and expanded that into Medicare and the duals. And I\u2019m going to ask Felicia maybe, to comment on that because that\u2019s probably been our longest standing relationships with our Blue partners. Felicia Norwood : Good morning, Lance and thank you for the question. Now, we\u2019re very pleased with our Blue partnerships. We started the year with five partnerships on the Blue side. We\u2019ve now added Nebraska and Missouri. Both branded as Healthy Blue. The opportunity that we have is that we\u2019re really a natural partner to our Blue plan, and see this is an opportunity for us to continue to leverage the breadth and scope of Anthem\u2019s deep knowledge around Medicaid execution, and being able to continue to grow that membership as we go forward. When you take a look at where we are today, the great opportunity since not from Medicaid, but also to Medicare, we were able to leverage our partnerships for example, that we had in Louisiana to move forward with the D-SNP offering and we\u2019re doing the same thing with our partnership in North Carolina as well. So, the future of our alliances and partnerships, it\u2019s strong, I think this is an opportunity for us to demonstrate the value that we bring across the board to our Blue partners and we\u2019ll continue to enhance that as we go forward. Gail also mentioned GRS and our opportunities there, and we were able to actually partner with independence Blue Cross for 1/1/2021 in terms of our partnership with them going forward. So, between Medicaid and Medicaid, the opportunity continues to be robust and we will continue to grow this business as we move forward. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. I think the summary of all that is we\u2019re making some good progress, we\u2019re in early days. And we do think that there\u2019s significant opportunity. but again, these pipelines take some time and we expect over the next several years to continue to advance this, but it\u2019s an important part of our overall growth strategy. So, thank you for the question. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Robert Jones : Great. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I guess maybe, just one on the SG&A expense ratio, the expectation for 10.8% plus or minus at the midpoint. I know there\u2019s the moving pieces this year. I was hoping John; maybe, give us a little context on the drivers of this. Obviously, we would have the SG&A ratio lower than what we saw this year. And I know we\u2019re thinking about the HIF and mix, and then just other cost initiatives. So, just any breakdown of that would be helpful. And then \u2013 and as it relates to the cadence of how we should be thinking about SG&A throughout the year would be helpful. Thanks. John Gallina : Yes, sure. Thank you for the question. Our SG&A levels are decreasing and yes, they\u2019re really again, to be more consistent with the plans that we discussed at our Investor Day a couple of years ago. We continue to have systems migration strategies, looking very hard to eliminate non-value added work flows and really, enhancing our digital capabilities. Also, at the end of the third quarter of last year, we had some business optimization charges and you\u2019re starting to see some of the benefits of that already come through the P&L. So all in, we feel very good about that. We\u2019ve clearly seen significant revenue growth as well and our revenue growth is far exceeded our growth in SG&A expenses, which serves to lower the SG&A ratio. So, as you know, we\u2019re anticipating a lot of growth in Medicaid. Medicaid carries a lower SG&A ratio than the company does in general, in terms of mix and made an average. So, a lot of moving parts and a lot of factors, but we\u2019re very confident with our 10.8% and believe that it\u2019s very much delivering on the promises that we laid out a couple of years ago at Investor Day. So, thank you for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Next question. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Scott Fidel with Stephens. Your line is open. Scott Fidel : Hi, thanks. I actually wanted to just ask about Diversified Business Group just more broadly in terms of thinking about the 2021 outlook, and interested, if you could maybe, talk about how you\u2019re thinking about revenue growth in margin profile for the business. I know there\u2019s a bunch of businesses within that. But generally more broadly, and then call out, any key COVID headwinds or tailwinds to consider around that segment? Thanks. John Gallina : Yes. Sure, Scott. Thank you for the question. Diversified Business Group is extremely important part of our long-term strategy and our long-term growth aspirations. It is not yet large enough to be considered a separate reporting segment under SEC reporting guidelines. So, there\u2019s only so much information there that we can provide on a detailed basis. But now in 2021, we do expect to see some nice growth on a specific, on a percentage basis out of Diversified Business Group. The aim is proactively managing capacity as volume returns and we continue to monitor volumes as utilization demand normalizes. The Beacon has initially experienced a reduction in utilization and then rebounded significant throughout the year. Once Beacon and once the vaccine stabilizes the COVID issue, we expect Beacon to really be a meaningful growth driver in that area here for the future. And our program integrity area is also \u2013 the SIU is also within DBG. And that\u2019s been impacted a little bit here in 2020 with the lower claims volume and they expect that to kick back up in 2021. So, there are both opportunities for DBG to further penetrate Anthem membership and do things appropriate to help bend the cost curve within Anthem and then sell that externally. Gail just talked to a minute ago about some of the opportunities that they have in DBG, and penetrating more and more of the Blues. So, we\u2019re very bullish about DBG\u2019s long-term aspirations and helping drive the overall growth of Anthem for the future. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. And I\u2019d add to John, as I said, in my prior comments, the Diversified Business Group is, it\u2019s in the early stages. We\u2019re really pleased with the growth that we\u2019ve seen from it. We\u2019re very happy with Aspire and Beacon, especially because of the opportunities to integrate as part of our Whole Health strategy. We see big opportunities. We shared this at our last Investor Day about the impact that Diversified Business Group can have on Anthem\u2019s business to help accelerate our own growth and we\u2019re starting to see some of that already inside of the Anthem numbers, where both CareMore and Beacon, particularly this year really supported Anthem\u2019s growth. But as John said, similar to other health services business, COVID did have an impact on our ability to do in-house assessments and some of the utilization certainly was up in the Beacon behavioral health business. but overall, we\u2019re still very positive about the long-term growth projections of our Diversified Business Group. And we\u2019re going to share a lot more about where we see that going in our Investor Day in March. Thank you for the question. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Matthew Borsch : Yes. I was just wondering if you could talk about the enrollment outlook for the beginning of the year, particularly, what you\u2019re seeing in terms of large accounts. I think you referenced less movement there this year, which isn\u2019t surprising. And then Medicare Advantage also how you see that coming into the New Year? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Sure. I\u2019m going to ask for Pete to answer the commercial question and then Felicia about Medicare Advantage, but just a couple of overarching comments on that. Overall, we\u2019re really pleased with what \u2013 how our commercial business performed in 2020, just given the economic headwinds and as you saw, incredibly resilient business with most of our impacts, having a result of just the downsizing inside of accounts. but our sales have been robust and our retention good. but without stealing all of Pete, so let me turn it over to him to give a bit of a perspective and how we\u2019re seeing 2021 and then Felicia. Pete Haytaian : Yes. Thanks a lot for the question. I appreciate it. Just to reiterate what Gail said. We\u2019re really pleased at how we landed in 2020 and how the team performed. Overall, with all the headwinds we talked about in 2020, we actually saw the commercial book grow sequentially year-over-year. So that was great. And while we did see furloughs in our book of business and in less risky segments being a factor, as Gail just alluded to the execution was outstanding from the team. Our sales exceeded our lapses for this quarter again, and for nine of the last 12 months. That was great to see. And on the Local Group business side, we actually grew our fully insured and self-funded business in the quarter. So that really played out well. What you alluded to is what our headwind has been throughout the year? And that\u2019s really the in-group change dynamics that occurred in the larger size accounts. And that\u2019s really going to be the story for 2021, as it relates to our execution and how we\u2019re starting off the year in 2021. We still feel very good. We feel very good about our portfolio. but again, depending on the economy and how in-group change plays out of specialty upmarket, as you alluded to, will be a big factor as we head into 2021. If that changes and the economy improves quicker than we think, then that would be a positive obviously. But overall, we\u2019re taking a more conservative view of that in light of where the economy is today. And I\u2019d say that that would overall lend itself to about flattish overall membership growth in the commercial business. Felicia Norwood : And in terms of our Medicare business, Medicare Advantage, particularly, the results of the past AEP are in line with our expectations. And it\u2019s been referenced earlier in the call. We certainly expect another year of double-digit growth outperforming the industry average growth rate. As a reminder, our growth in Medicare Advantage has historically been more balanced throughout the year, rather than just limited to one-one. We\u2019re also pleased to be expanding our footprint into 109 new counties. And for the first time, we will be offering Medicare Advantage plans in Iowa, and state-wide across Kentucky and Tennessee as well. Our virtual sales comprise more than 60% of our total sales volume this past AEP and the results from our Care Guide is very promising. Care Guide provides our members with a new simplified orientation journey that begins at the point of sale and reduces number of touch points to ensure that they have consistency throughout the overall on-boarding process. And finally, with respect to group retiree, while there was a bit of a delay in the GRS pipeline, we still think that opportunity is intact and we expect to see more of these opportunities as we move into 2022 and beyond. Gail Boudreaux : I\u2019d like to just really give a shout out to our teams in both the commercial and Medicare business, because this was really unusual year. We had a pivot and the investments that we made in our tools in our digital engagement with brokers, et cetera, really pay dividends across all of our businesses this year. And I think that\u2019s \u2013 that really speaks to the kind of investments that we\u2019re making to \u2013 that we can engage even when we\u2019re not able to be in-person with our clients from a sales and account management perspective. So again, overall 2020, I felt our teams really responded well, and we\u2019re looking forward to 2021. We\u2019ve learned a lot. And I think the investments we\u2019ve made, have really helped us support our clients in this environment. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. Steve Willoughby : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Most of mine have been asked, but two things for you. One just to follow up on the last question, I was wondering if maybe, Felicia could comment at all as it related to Medicare Advantage between individual and group. And then Gail, I was wondering if you have any thoughts or have seen any impact on the National Accounts market as a result of the Blue Cross Blue Shield lawsuit and subsequent resolution and any rule changes with Blue Cross Blue Shield Association? Felicia Norwood : Thank you, Steve. As I referenced earlier, our individual sales for AEP were in line with our expectations, and the team certainly had to pivot in light of what we were seeing in the pandemic that led to more virtual sales. this AEP and results there were strong as well. So certainly, when we take a look at where we are. We are very pleased with what we saw and expect to deliver the double-digit growth that we referenced. From a group perspective, group membership came in well. I would say that, as we\u2019ve mentioned before, there were some delayed decisions from employers with respect to group retiree business for 2021. We expect that pipeline though remains intact. As we\u2019ve said before, when we take a look at our group business, we really have an inherent captive pipeline between the commercial business that we have, and our ability to be able to penetrate that business and grow as we go forward. So, while there was a real deferral, I think in some respects with respect to growth in group this year, we expect those opportunities to remain intact, and just were delayed and pushed out to 2022 and beyond. Gail Boudreaux : And in terms of the last question about the MDL and the subscriber settlement. I commented on that on the third quarter call and really, it remains the same. I don\u2019t really see that changing our strategies. We talked a lot about the partnerships we have. in terms of National Accounts, we\u2019re going to continue to be an active participant in that market as our peer. So other \u2013 in terms of the Blue Cross Blue Shield of litigation and MDL, I really don\u2019t see anything different than what I shared on the third quarter call. Gail Boudreaux : Well, thank you very much. That will be our last question. I want to thank everyone for joining our call this morning. As you\u2019ve heard here today, Anthem delivered strong results in 2020, and we\u2019re well positioned moving into 2021 despite the ongoing uncertainties. We\u2019re a very different company than we were even one year ago. And I\u2019m optimistic about the opportunities for more than 70,000 associates to further improve the overall health of our members and communities during these challenging times. I look forward to speaking with you at our Investor Day event in March. Thank you again, for joining us.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company\u2019s management. Please go ahead. Steve Tanal : Good morning and welcome to Anthem\u2019s first quarter 2021 earnings call. This is Steve Tanal, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning on the earnings call are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of our Commercial & Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division. Gail will begin the call by giving an overview of our first quarter financial results, provide an update on our response to the pandemic and touch on our updated financial guidance before turning the call over to John, who will discuss our financials in greater detail. We will then be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today\u2019s press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Boudreaux : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for Anthem\u2019s firsts quarter 2021 earnings call. This morning, we reported first quarter GAAP earnings per share of $6.71 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.01, reflecting growing momentum in our business despite the challenges of the environment. When we came together for this call a year ago, we were only just beginning to understand the scope of the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications for health care. Over these last 12 months, I'm incredibly proud of how we've led during a period characterized by uncertainty. From day one, we partnered with local state and federal officials to ensure our members were prepared with the resources and support they need to navigate through the pandemic. In 2020, our associates logged more than 110,000 volunteer hours and more than 17,000 hours so far in 2021, addressing critical issues in their local communities, such as food insecurity, and social isolation. Our efforts have recently shifted from a focus on treatment and testing to vaccinations. We recognize that we play a critical role in the fight against the pandemic, and in ensuring safe and equitable access to vaccines in our communities. Through our multi-channel approach, we've been able to reach nearly two-thirds of our members with information regarding where, when, and how they can access COVID-19 vaccines in their own communities, including coordinating in-home vaccinations for our homebound members, while covering vaccine administration costs for our commercial members with no out of pocket cost sharing. In addition, clinicians at our CareMore and HealthSun clinics have helped thousands of our most vulnerable seniors get vaccinated. I'm incredibly grateful to our associates, who have adapted seamlessly and work diligently through the pandemic to support our consumers. Our focus on health starts with our own associates, and we're committed to empowering them to live a healthy lifestyle. For those who received the vaccine, we're offering a choice of a one-time credit towards their own health care premiums or a donation on their behalf to the Anthem Cares Fund, which provides financial support to Anthem Associates in need. As a company that has been grounded in our local communities for more than 75 years, we have an unwavering commitment to positively influence not only the health of our consumers, but the health of the communities in which we live and work. Membership growth in the first quarter clearly reflects the balance and resilience of our core business, with strong growth in our government business led by Medicaid. With eligibility re-verifications on hold across the country, our organic growth remains robust. Medicare Advantage membership also tracked in-line with our expectations growing [15%] year-over-year through the first quarter.  We're honored to have been selected to serve Medicaid beneficiaries in Ohio, a state where Anthem currently holds the leading commercial and Medicare Advantage market share positions. With the launch of this contract, Anthem will serve consumers across all products in the State of Ohio further underscoring our ability to be a lifetime trusted health partner.  Commercial enrollment grew sequentially to start the year outperforming expectations with growth led by our risk-based business. As expected, commercial membership decreased slightly year-over -year, driven by in-group attrition in our group fee based business. In spite of many national account prospects electing to delay decisions until 2022, we had one of our strongest selling seasons in the past five years. Sales exceeded lapses in our large group fully insured business for the sixth consecutive quarter and for 10 of the past 11. Our success speaks to the strength of our sales team, the value of our innovative solutions, and our commitment to being a valued partner to our customers. Given our solid overall performance in the first quarter, we are increasing our 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to greater than $25.10 from greater than $24.50, putting us on track to achieve our long-term 12% to 15% annual adjusted EPS growth target, even as we continue to dedicate resources to combating the pandemic. Looking ahead, our digital solutions will continue to drive growth, and we are fundamentally changing how we leverage technology to deliver the exceptional experiences that consumers expect from us, and to help address health disparities and improve outcomes by sharing insight with care providers. We now have close to 10 million people engaged on our digital channels with access to a wide array of virtual care specialties and resources to help them lead healthy lives. One of our digital solutions, Anthem\u2019s Concierge Care program aims to solve distinct problems for our customers. Our suite of programs universally offers seamless experience for members facing chronic or complex conditions, connecting them with their entire care team on a single centralized platform and allowing them to seek support in real time when it's right for them.  Today, our Concierge Care programs are available to just under 1 million members, with line of sight into tripling enrollment over the next few years. This program integrates remote patient monitoring that shares real time data with care providers at all times. We have also partnered with connected device manufacturers to leverage their capabilities to expand remote care options that allow patients and their clinicians to conduct virtual office visits, culminating and personalized experiences for members\u2019 better outcomes and improved affordability. Our deep roots in our communities and our partnership with local care providers enable us to scale these initiatives in real time with a focus on collaborating across the continuum of care, while ensuring our care provider partners have access to best-in-class digital tools and capabilities to help them deliver better outcomes. Predictive AI and real time access to data, coupled with a growing focus on value-based arrangements with care providers, is enabling us to improve access to high quality, affordable healthcare and facilitate better consumer and physician decision making. The integration of these capabilities is what will enable us to deliver on our commitment to drive commercial medical cost trend down towards CPI by 2025. A goal we shared with you at our Investor Day last month. Earlier this year, we launched the nation's largest high performance network in partnership with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. The Blue high performance network is guiding members towards providers who are aligned with our goal of driving greater affordability and improved outcomes. The benefits are compelling, with average savings of 11% and up to 20% in certain markets. Through AI and machine learning, we're also providing members with access to personalized health information to help them make informed healthcare decisions. When searching for providers, most digital tools automatically default to recommending providers based solely on location. Anthem\u2019s smart provider finder on our Sydney Health App gives consumers greater control of their care by taking into account the factors that matter most, such as conditions, specific needs, affordability, and quality. We're intensely focused on enhancing our capabilities aimed at addressing the needs of people with chronic and complex conditions. Our pending acquisition of MyNEXUS combines the power of digital and advanced analytics to expertly manage and coordinate home based health care. Anthem has been a customer of MyNEXUS since 2017 with more than 830,000 of our individual and group retiree Medicare Advantage members currently managed by MyNEXUS. We have seen first-hand the positive contributions MyNEXUS has had on our members\u2019 quality of life, and we look forward to expanding this impact across even more of our members. Equally important, this acquisition provides Anthem with another pathway to managing a greater portion of the overall healthcare dollar. A key strategic pillar of our diversified business group that will allow us to create end-to-end seamless experiences from post acute care to home health, with pathways to services like [AIM], Aspire, and Beacon. As we continue to focus on addressing the social drivers of health, Anthem is introducing new programs and partnerships to positively impact community health. Beginning this year, Beacon is launching an innovative program designed to address the basic needs of an employer's workforce through onsite resource coordinators focused on things like housing, food, transportation, and other core resources. Through this program, Beacon will help employers identify and remove obstacles to creating a safer and more productive work environment for their employees. The need for this type of solution will only increase as employer\u2019s transition their workforce back into the workplace. And we look forward to scaling this offering across our markets in the future, after going live with a major national retailer in the second quarter. As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we stand ready to adapt and carry forward our momentum. Anthem\u2019s Benefit business is among the most balanced and resilient in the sector. And we have ample opportunity to unlock our full potential by scaling best in class healthcare services businesses to serve Anthem\u2019s members, as well as other health care plans externally. Should the pandemic come to an end sooner, and the economy recover faster, our commercial business will be well-positioned to accelerate its growth. Should the pandemic persist, our Medicaid business will likely continue to grow at an accelerated pace. Regardless of the outcome, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments to our consumers, care partners, and shareholders. I'll now turn the floor over to John to discuss our financial performance in more detail. John? John Gallina : Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported strong first quarter results, including GAAP earnings per share of $6.71 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.01 growth of over 8% year-over-year. Our first quarter results reflect the execution of our enterprise strategy, while continuing to navigate through the pandemic. We ended the quarter with medical membership totaling 43.5 million members, an increase of 1.4 million lives, or 3.3% year-over-year, despite a challenging macroeconomic environment. Our risk-based membership grew by 1.8 million members over the prior year quarter, driven primarily by organic growth in Medicaid, aided by the suspension of re-verifications. In addition, our Medicare Advantage membership grew by 197,000 lives or 15% year-over-year, in-line with our expectations, and on track to achieve low double digit growth for the full year. This growth was partially offset by negative in-group change within our commercial fee-based business, which was to be expected given the economic challenges presented by the pandemic. From a membership reporting perspective, please note that we have changed our presentation to delineate commercial risk-based and fee-based membership, and included a table looking back to the first quarter of 2020 in our press release for modeling purposes. Our overall growth in membership despite challenging economic backdrop reflects resilience and value of our core benefits businesses as our significant presence in both commercial and [Medicare] continue to complement one another well. First quarter operating revenue of $32.1 billion increased 9% over the prior year quarter or approximately 11% when excluding the impact of the permanent repeal of the health insurer fee. Growth was driven by higher premium revenue in Medicaid and Medicare and growth in our pharmacy product revenue. The medical loss ratio for the first quarter was 85.6%, an increase of 140 basis points over the first quarter of 2020 driven by cost associated with COVID-19, including testing and vaccine administration cost, and to a lesser extent, the permanent repeal of the HIF. Adjusted for the HIF, our first quarter MOR would have decreased by 10 basis points. Relative to our expectations, the cost of COVID-related care developed favorably driven by an earlier and sharper decline in COVID hospitalizations than we had anticipated. This was partially offset by a faster recovery and non-COVID cost, in-part due to the accelerated roll-out of the vaccine, as well as the impact of an extra calendar day in the first quarter of 2020. Medical claims payable for 2020 dates of service, or prior year reserve development also developed better than our expectations, but were entirely offset by reserve reestablishment. Or first quarter SG&A expense ratio came in at 12.2%, a decrease of 60 basis points relative to the first quarter of 2020.  Excluding the effects of the HIF, our SG&A ratio would have increased by 60 basis points, driven by increased spending to support growth, including our ongoing efforts to become a digital first enterprise, partially offset by the leverage against the growth in our operating revenue. The investments we're making today will be key to achieving greater operating efficiency over the long-term, and will enable us to achieve our 11% to 12% SG&A ratio target by 2025. Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a debt to capital ratio of 41.6%, up from 38.7% at year-end 2020. The increase was due to debt raised in the quarter to fund our pending acquisitions and refinance and upcoming maturity. We continue to expect a debt to cap ratio to be slightly below 40% by the end of the year. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $316.06 for approximately $447 million, representing slightly more than 25% of our full-year guidance. At this point, we continue to believe that our initial guidance of $1.6 billion in share repurchase remains appropriate for the full-year. We maintained a prudent posture with respect to reserves in-light of the pandemic and its associated uncertainties. And as a result, days and claims payable increased by 3.5 days sequentially, ending the first quarter at 46.9 days, which is up 5 days year-over-year. Medical claims payable increased nearly 25% year-over-year, compared with premium growth of approximately 9%. Finally, our operating cash flow during the first quarter was $2.5 billion or 1.5 times net income better than expected and yet another indication of our strong quality of earnings. Note that operating cash flow as a percentage of net income will drop later in the year as we make payments on the multi-district litigation settlement and satisfy certain [MLR or collar payments]. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter performance. And as a result, we have raised our full-year outlook for adjusted earnings per share by $0.60 from greater than $24.50 to greater than $25.10. The raise in our guidance reflects both the upside from strong core performance in the first quarter, and the approximate $0.30 benefit associated with the extension of the sequestration holiday through the end of the year, partially offset by higher vaccine administration cost and the ongoing uncertainty around the pandemic. Our full-year outlook continues to embed net cost associated with COVID in the order of $600 million. Despite this headwind, we are pleased to be on track to deliver growth and adjusted earnings per share inside our long-term annual target range of 12% to 15%. While our core businesses perform well during the quarter, we remain cognizant of the risks and uncertainties associated with the pandemic. Notably, the potential for a prolonged fourth wave, new COVID variants, pent-up demand for healthcare services, and the potential for higher acuity episodes of care associated with a deferral of procedures throughout the pandemic. Our updated guidance contemplates all these factors and we are pleased to pass through much of the upside in the first quarter, despite a cautious, but prudent approach to forecasting the balance of this year. With much of our guidance raise reflecting the first quarter outperformance, we now expect between 52% and 54% of our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to occur in the first half of the year. Given a faster roll-out of the vaccine, we expect non-COVID utilization to rebound sooner, and we now expect to absorb higher COVID vaccination administration cost during the second quarter. As a result, we are currently modeling our second quarter [MLR] to be near the midpoint of our full-year outlook of 88%, plus or minus 50 basis points.  And with that, operator, please open up the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Mr. Wolfe, please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. So, a couple of quick numbers questions here. First, PYD and reserves in the quarter, you had [growth PYD] of 1.5 billion significantly above typical, but reserves actually grew despite that. So, I was hoping you could give us some color on, you know how that impacted the quarter? And then, you know, the Biden administration has been making a significant changes to the exchanges in Medicaid that would seem to drive membership growth, I was hoping you might be able to give us some color on how you think the benefit might be here and the potential offset against the future restart of re-determinations in Medicaid by the states at some point? Thanks. John Gallina : Thank you for the questions, Justin, and good morning. This is John. So, I'll start out with the reserve question in the prior period development, you know, the $1.5 billion number looks like a big number, but you know, please note that the presentation is on a gross basis. And that number in a vacuum can be somewhat misleading. You know, a large percentage of that release will never hit the income statement. I'm sure you know that as reserves are released, you know, some of the items impact MLR rebates and collars, risk corridor calculations, and we're funding mechanisms with some of our contractual provisions. But most importantly, we believe that we have reestablished the reserves to be uncertainty associated with COVID. And, you know, consistent with that maybe a question, you know, I will affirm that we believe that there is no net benefit to the first quarter associated with the PYD that was going through the statements this quarter, [with that]. Gail Boudreaux : Hi Justin, this is Gail, thanks for that question. In terms of the exchanges, we are pleased about the extended open enrollment and feel that while we're in the midst of it now, we feel that there will be some solid membership growth in the individual exchanges. In addition, though, to your second part of the question, how does that affect re-verification? I think at this stage, it's very hard for us to see our assumption is that re-verification remains on hold through all of 2021. You know, we do have a balanced portfolio. We've shared that a number of times and the mix serves as a natural hedge for us. But as we look at, you know, the growth inside of our Medicaid business, we've not really seen a significant amount of individuals coming from the commercial market into Medicaid at this stage. Some of that just may still be the timing and people are still on their employer plans, etcetera. But at this stage, we haven't seen a significant growth in Medicaid. It's been predominantly through e-verifications. The other thing I just want to note is that we don't really see a cliff event in 2022 as we work with our states, even as re-verification will go away in 2022. We see that as much more of a gradual approach as our states think about continuing to keep people on the Medicaid rolls. So thanks very much for the question, and we'll go to the next question. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Matt Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Mr. Borsch, please go ahead. Matt Borsch : Yes, can you hear me? Operator : Yes, I can. Matt Borsch : Okay, sorry. I just wanted to ask a question on your utilization management program. Specifically, what I'm referring to, we're hearing what seems to be some apparently sort of intense pushback from the hospital providers regarding what they're describing is your push to drive outpatient services off the hospital campus to less expensive freestanding locations? I'm not really familiar with what you're doing here. But I know, I think I understand you're not alone, other plans are taking similar actions. I'm just curious about how you're handling the blowback from hospitals? It's all financial and what they claim is related to quality of care. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, Matt. I think that there's a lot in there and not just specifically to, you know, your question on hospitals. You know, first and foremost, our focus is on really implementing value-based care and ensuring that our care providers really are in the driver\u2019s seat of right place, appropriate place of service etcetera. As I think about your specific question, however, we are looking to work with our hospital providers, as well as our outpatient facilities to ensure that patients are in the right place of care with what's happened in the pandemic. Clearly, our patients were more concerned about being in the hospital settings. That allowed us to enable that we supported outpatient care and outpatient settings more specifically. And so, so we have implemented those policies, we had them in place before. So, this isn't new, but I think it's accelerated with the pandemic, as patients have become much more comfortable in those settings, as well as the access has been greater for individuals. So, in terms of the overall model, our focus again is on affordability, trying to drive affordability, make sure that it's appropriate care at the right place and right setting that's been specific. And it ties very much to our value-based model, where we work closely with our local physicians. So, it's not just Anthem doing this through [UM programs], it's really part of embedded in our value-based value based programs with physicians. So, thank you very much for the question. Next question. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Mr. Rice, please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. I might just ask, sounds like working with the other Blues, this launch of the high performance network you're talking about? And the savings you're generating, I guess I'm interested in how much of a change you have to get in the way people there \u2013 the patterns that people are using for care with doctors, hospitals, close to give providers to realize those savings? Are you changing significant amounts of their typical patterns of utilization to get that or is that sort of around the edges? And to the extent that you're doing this with the other Blues, I guess I brought it out and also asked you about any updates on you thought about Blues collaboration, some of the initiatives around there? Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, A.J. It's a great question. As I shared in my opening remarks, we launched the high performance network in conjunction with other Blues. And just to give a little bit of background on how it works, it really launched just beginning in January of 2021. So, it's a fairly new offering across the system. And it's available right now in 55 MSAs. So, most of those, but half of those, roughly half are in Anthem service areas right now, but we comprise about 56% of the U.S. population, and it's something we're going to continue to grow every year. So, I think that's important. The cost savings are significant. I gave you a range of savings anywhere from around 11% to up to 20%. Our goal in this, like a strategy, network strategy is focused on leveraging already deep provider relationships and to scale and simplify it and also focus on the high performing providers that we know based on our deep data across the country. So what we're seeing, you know, in our first offering, you know, we had a number of customers select us over 350,000, I think total members had access to it and our first entry, again, is about 10% to 15% of those who have access to it are picking the high performance network, we expect that to grow. Again, this is a new offering in January. But it's flexible enough to allow our local markets in partnership with other Blues to continue to build and develop that. So again, this is based off of our deep knowledge and deep information that we have around networks and our partnership with other Blues. So, thank you very much for the question. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Mr. Wilkes, please go ahead. Lance Wilkes : Yeah, good morning. Could you just give an update on capital deployment priorities and what I was specifically interested in is, if you could talk a little bit about your focus and what you're doing with respect to, kind of value-based care delivery initiatives, including stakes in companies and things like that, and maybe contrasting that with your discussion on digital first, and especially businesses to cross-sell, and complimentary care delivery capabilities. In particular, I'm focused on where you're acquiring or partnering with companies as opposed to your organic build. John Gallina : Thank you, Lance. I appreciate the question. So, first of all, I think our approach to the capital deployment is remaining consistent. We're looking to take approximately 50% of our free cash flow and utilize it for reinvestment in the business, as well as M&A and their deployment activities close to 30% for share buyback and 20% as dividends directly return back to the shareholders. And we obviously want to be very opportunistic and advantages associated with that, but, you know with that, I think Gail wanted to make a couple comments on your specific question. Gail Boudreaux : Yeah, thanks, Lance. There was a lot in there. So, I'll try to try to capture each of them. I want to start with your, sort of underlying question, which is investments in the care delivery system. You know, as you know, our strategy first and foremost is to partner with primary care physicians in our local markets. And I've shared that on a number of times in this call. Part of that, again, is one in eight patients already carrying [Anthem idea], we feel that that model really enables us to work closely with them, and that we can drive differentiated managed care performance by using the data and we've been investing in AI and virtual care to ensure that we can help them make better decisions. With that said, though, I think what's under I think, valued and under understood, not understood well, in terms of our investments that we are participating in the value created through our value-based relationships. So, where we can keep our members healthier and I think specific examples of where we participate in that value creation and invest is, you know our examples of CareMore in HealthSun, and recently our announced acquisition of MMM.  And another area where we've deployed capital, which I shared areas that enable and create new payment models, and those are the ones that can address the more complex conditions. And again, examples there would be MyNEXUS, Aspire and Beacon, where we\u2019re leveraging that first and foremost across our Anthem membership to create value both for DBG, as well as Anthem in driving down overall costs of care, but also to sell externally. So, it's a bit of a double strategy there and I think, help support, you know, how we're using our capital to drive better returns, both for our customers, as well as Anthem internally. And then, you know, we shared at Investor Day a number of investments that we're making in digital to create the healthcare platform. Some of those are around consumer tools. Sydney, we've continued to advance where we are with Sydney Care. We're also investing in our health OS model. All of that\u2019s wrapped around artificial intelligence to really drive much better decision making. And the last area that I just want to share is, we recently announced collaboration that's part of our broader innovation. A collaboration that allows us to partner with stakeholders across the health system called [hydrogen]. Our goal there is to really support virtual care driving down costs and trend towards CPI, which we've shared, giving consumers access to basic health care needs. And this is again, another virtual care opportunity, whether it's via video, phone, text, or chat, looking for efficiency and quality. The partnerships with K Health enables us to provide access to virtual care. So that's an example of innovation, where we're investing as part of the overall healthcare ecosystem. So again, a lot of examples there, trying to give you a sense of both from how we're investing in the healthcare delivery system, and participating in the value that we create there, as well as in our virtual tools. So thanks very much for that question. Hopefully, we got to all the components of it. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of David Windley from Jefferies. Mr. Windley, please go ahead. David Windley : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to drill into, kind of claims and your visibility into pent up demand and utilization, it seems that patient hesitancy has perhaps been a little bit higher in the senior populations. I think that's logical, but it also seems to be borne out in the data. And so I'm wondering if you could speak to the relative levels of deferred care between the books of business, and how much visibility do you feel like you have into what is scheduled? How much might come back, how much might not come back, and whether the reserves that you are keeping on the balance sheet at this point are a conservative position against the unknown, or more of a known position against what you're kind of able to assess in the system capacity? Thanks. John Gallina : Thank you, David, for that one lengthy question. See, if I can respond to all of the items that you've focused on. You know, in terms of the claims versus the visibility, we obviously track that very, very closely. You know, we're evaluating pre-served, pre-authorization information on a daily basis, certainly understand that. We're looking at the types of care that are deferred versus those that are not deferred, and trying to assess that associated with, you know, the core underlying businesses. You know, it's still a little bit too early to have a noticeable shift in non-COVID utilization. But as I said, we continue to closely monitor our markets as vaccination rates increase. And, you know, in terms of geographic, there's probably not a big disparity at this point associated with lines of business. You know, the senior population has been vaccinated sooner. And so we are seeing a significant decline in COVID in-patient associated with seniors, which means that the non-COVID can rebound a bit faster. We believe that we've totally factored that in. You know, people were still able to largely get care in 2020, after the stay at home mandates for ease. So, you know, the giant backlog we don't think is quite there, the same way, and there are natural systems capacities as well. And maybe just to focus on your reserves that question at the end, we believe our reserves are very prudently stated, and that they are associated with a lot of the unknowns and uncertainties associated with COVID as opposed to the other part of your question. So, thank you for that and hopefully that addresses all of your questions. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Steve Valiquette from Barclays. Mr. Valiquette, please go ahead. Steve Valiquette : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Yeah, John, on the last quarterly conference call, you made some positive comments that with the $0.50 to $0.70 COVID headwinds built in the initial 2021 guidance of $24.50, [but] you still viewed $25.10 as a proper jump off point in 2021 when thinking about EPS growth in 2022 that could still track within the long-term range. I guess, just given the updated guidance for 2021 today with the increase as the moving parts, as you alluded to, I just want to confirm what you believe is the updated jump-off points this year when thinking about potential normalized 12% to 15% EPS growth for 2022? Thanks. John Gallina : Thanks for the question, Steve. You know, as we discussed last quarter, you know, $25.10 was the level of earnings that we felt best represented or normalized earnings power for 2021. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver on the 12% to 15% growth target off of that level beginning in 2022. You know, it's really too premature to get any more specific associated with 2022 at this point in time, but we do feel very good about the $25.10 representing our core earnings or normalized earnings power is a jumping off point. So, thank you for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Mr. Fidel, please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Hi, thanks and good morning. Had a question just on the Medicaid business and interested if you could just give us an update on what the impact was from Medicaid, from the risk corridors and experience rated rebates in the first quarter, and how that trended relative to your expectations? And then just how you're thinking about the tempo of government margin over the course of the year? First quarter was a bit below the long-term target, but obviously had the impact from the Medicaid rebates, I'm assuming. So, just thinking about how that \u2013 you think that's going to trend over the course of the year? Thanks. John Gallina : Sure. No, thank you for the question. You know, Medicaid, certainly Medicaid is performing well. You know, we do believe that we have received appropriate [naturally sound] rates from our state partners. And we very much expect to end 2021 within our target margin ranges. Feel very, very good about Medicaid. On Medicare, maybe just to be very forthright about the Medicare business, finished the first quarter slightly below our target margin ranges, but largely for all the reasons that we've already identified. The elevated COVID cost, mostly in January impacted the senior population.  The reduction of the risk revenue did a suppressed 2020 utilization, which we've talked about in the last call is certainly impacting. And as you know, we have the continued payment of the 20%, DRG bump, and the 3.75% Medicare fee schedule increases impacting that line of business. But you know, those COVID factors are all transient. And, you know, we have great membership growth trajectory in Medicare, really improving that block of business, and we think that the future earnings potential for Medicare is significant and feel very, very good about the long-term aspects associated with Medicare. Gail Boudreaux : Can ask Felicia maybe to comment a little bit just about the Medicaid business? Felicia Norwood : Thank you. You know, our Medicaid business is continuing to perform well. We are very respectful that our states are going through a very challenging time in light of the pandemic, but we've been working very closely with them to make sure that the rates that we're receiving are actuarially sound and taking a view with respect to the long-term. If you know, we are at a point now, where roughly 50% of our states have already renewed and our states that renew in the second half of the year with respect to rates, we're engaged in conversations with them right now. You know, as you know, this is really an iterative process. We work very closely with our state partners to make sure that we achieve actuarially sound rates, but have been very mindful of the consequences of the pandemic and the recovery that needs to follow. So, as we think about 2022, we are very optimistic about being able to deliver performance within our target margin range of 2% to 4%. And we'll continue to work closely with our state partners during this time. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks, Felicia. And as you heard, I think we feel very constructive about those businesses. And as John shared with you a lot of the things that are really transient related to COVID-19, but overall feel very good about our core businesses. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Mr. Giacobbe, please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks, morning. Gail, you mentioned the delayed decisions until 2022. First, just wanted to clarify that the 2021 selling season for 2022 or were you saying 2022 for 2023? And then just maybe if you can give us a sense of how much of your book is going out this year versus a typical year, and just any insights on how much is up for grabs more broadly, and maybe your opportunity to gain share within commercial? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Sure. Thanks for the question, Ralph. Let me just clarify or answer your specifics. And I'll ask Pete to talk about the commercial market. Now in my prepared comments, I was really referring to this year selling season for national accounts where a lot of individuals differed from 2021 to 2022. However, we still, as I mentioned, had one of our most successful selling seasons ever, and I really credit Pete and his team for, you know, the focus of the products and innovation that they brought to the market, but it was in terms of pipeline, individuals winning, but Pete, why don't you comment a little bit more about the commercial market? Pete Haytaian : Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Gail. And thanks for the question, Ralph. We were really pleased with how enrollment landed in the first quarter. We saw nice sequential growth of 159,000 in the quarter, excuse me, the same dynamics that I really mentioned in the past are continuing. First of all, from an execution perspective, as Gail noted, our sales continue to exceed our losses. And what was really nice to see, you know, this year in the quarter, again, is our fully insured growth. Our local group business grew nicely, sequentially. If you were to, sort of say, you know, what was a bit of a headwind, our growth could have been more if not for the economic impacts, again, associated with COVID, and the in-group change dynamics that really continue, and most specifically affect our fee-based business. But like Gail said, I feel very good about our positioning going forward, our execution is strong, our portfolio products, our choice is strong. And as we see the economy improve, we're very confident that we're going to continue to see our growth accelerate. Gail Boudreaux : And Ralph just a quick comment on your other question about what is the season. It's really early in the national accounts selling season? So, we're, it's really developing at this stage. We are seeing some expanded opportunities. And certainly we'll update you as we get to the second quarter call where I have a little bit better insight. But overall, we feel really well-positioned. I think our offerings have been resonating quite well. Biggest issue for Pete right now is just the in-group attrition that came through in the first quarter. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Mr. Hill, please go ahead. George Hill : Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. One of the things that you guys highlighted in the press release was the change in timing as related to PBM business, and the impact of selling integrated pharmacy and medical on the positivity of results. I guess, could you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in the selling of the integrated medical and pharmacy business and the impact of the out of period adjustment? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : I\u2019m going to ask Pete to address that. Thank you. Pete Haytaian : Yeah, thanks for your question. You know, we mentioned this, but, you know, last year because of COVID, we did see a bit of hesitancy in terms of transitioning, pharmacy and transition of PBMs, especially on the upper end of the market, as you'd expect. That said, we are beginning to see and I'm very, very pleased with the progress we're beginning to see more activity. And to your point, the team is working very closely on the integrated value proposition. I think down market, we are definitely beginning to see good signs. Our win rate is improving on down market and the [RFP activity] is picking up. And at the upper end of the market, there's still a bit of hesitancy, but as I said, we are seeing RFP activity pickup for 2022. We are in the middle of that selling season right now. We are in a lot of finalist presentations, and we're across several different opportunities. I would say, it's, just like Gail said, as it relates to the national selling season, it's early as it relates to 2022 still, and I'd say over the next several weeks and months, we'll have better visibility on our wins on the upper end of the market headed into 2022. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Mr. Jones, please go ahead. Robert Jones : Thanks for the question. I guess maybe just to stick with Ingenio, you know, operating gains in the quarter were relatively strong. No, I was hoping maybe you could give a little bit more around the drivers there. And I do think in the press release, you did call out an out of period adjustment. Just wanted to make sure we understood that as we think about modeling Ingenio for the balance of the year. Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks very much for the question. You know, overall, Ingenio has been performing extremely well, based on our expectations, and again, it's the group growth within Ingenio and sort of the strong work on that we've had. In terms of the one-time adjustment that was called out, it really is a true up in our specialty pricing. So, on a run rate basis, we still feel very good and bullish about it being in a 6% to 6.5% margin target. That's sustainable. So, as you think about that, overall, those are really the key drivers. I think Ingenio has really hit its stride in terms of our business. One of the things I think that's important to keep in mind that our first quarter 2020 results were somewhat elevated, artificially elevated, [that is] because we relaxed the refill to soon provision as part of the pandemic, and the pandemic was intensifying here as everyone knows. So we \u2013 that resulted in a pull forward of earnings from the second quarter into the first of 2020. So, hopefully that gives you the insight that you're looking for. Thanks for the question. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron. Mr. Raskin, please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Are you seeing any evidence of an increase in utilization either pent-up demand or higher acuity resulting from, you know deferred care from last year? John Gallina : Thank you, Josh. I think it's still just a bit early to see any noticeable shift in non-COVID utilization and pent-up demand. We are seeing some of our states like Maine and Connecticut have some of the highest vaccination rates were Arkansas and Texas appear to be a bit lower. And there's really not a big material difference in utilization levels between those markets. And I think part of it has to do with the comment that I made earlier in the Q&A session, that, you know, folks were able to get access to care in 2020, you know when a lot of the stay at home rules were relaxed. So, at this point in time, you know, we are taking a very cautious approach, certainly monitoring all the variables. But you know, we still believe that our original outlook for utilization is appropriate and prudent. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Mr. Goldwasser, please go ahead. Ricky Goldwasser : Yeah. Hi, good morning. So, my question is on SG&A. I mean, clearly SG&A in the quarter was high, reflecting the investment in the enterprise. When we think about these investments, I mean Gail, you talked about everything that you're doing in digital, should we think about these as sort of front end loaded versus kind of like rest of the year? And then as we think about a specific investment, from your perspective, sort of what makes you most excited about and how is the relationship with Blackstone and K Health on the digital side relates to the internal investments, would love to hear a little bit more about that? John Gallina : Thank you, Ricky. I'll start out by answering the beginning your question and turn it over to Pete to talk a little bit more about K Health and that aspect of your question, but you know, as you know that we continue to invest in new digital mobile capabilities to drive greater automation and enhance our customer experience, really, a lot of the consumer facing tools. You know, we're focused on improving the way we do business with our distribution partners. We have a new broker portal that offers distribution partners, a simplified digital platform to enable them to sell seamlessly. And we're standardizing our clinical and well-being solutions and the preset packages. Make it easier for our employers to understand and purchase the suite of products most relevant to your needs. So, I give those examples just to show you that your digital capabilities and digital investments are impacting every aspect of the company and every aspect of the business. You know, and that's with \u2013 also doing our system consolidation work that we've been focused on here for the last several years. In terms of the spending, you know, obviously, we did accelerate some spending here in the first quarter, but we will be spending on this throughout the year. The SG&A ratio will go down a little bit in the latter half of the year as our revenue accelerates, you know specifically when we go live with North Carolina Medicaid with some of the continued growth that we expect in core Medicaid with the special enrollment for ACA. All businesses have a drive to top line accordingly, but there's still a lot of spending left to be done in order to achieve our goals and expectations. With that, I'll turn it over to Pete to talk a little bit more about K Health. Pete Haytaian : Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot, John. And, you know, I'll just jump off of what Gail was saying earlier about the acceleration of digital on our product offerings and the importance of partnerships. And our partnership with K and Blackstone is really another example of one of these strong partnerships where we're developing an approach to accelerate the use of digital AI to really help drive more efficient and effective care with a differentiated consumer experience. Specifically, as it relates to this partnership, it builds upon all this. It's helping us offer direct to consumer, direct to employer and direct to ensure or product options that really enabled Anthem as the front door to healthcare. It's really creating this digital first experience where access to basic care needs can occur via, as Gail said earlier, text, chat, and videos with a physician. And if more acute care needs or in-person care is needed, it really helps facilitate or triage care to the right care at the right place at the right time. And so, yes, this is just another great example of a partnership that helps bring greater efficiency and a better consumer experience to our members. Gail Boudreaux : Ricky, you asked an important question about which investments and pieces of digitally you should be really excited about? And I guess I wanted to address that directly. Because I think that this is really, our investments are long-term investments to drive growth in a business model transformation. And quite frankly, I think we're excited about all of them, but fundamentally what we shared at Investor Day, the digital platform for health, which is going to transform how we work and what we do both at the consumer level, as well as at the level of our care providers with our Health OS operating platform. Plus, we're also investing heavily in virtual care. So again, that goes back to my earlier comments around us participating in the value creation of that, all surrounded by the use of the data that we've had locked for a long time. So, ability to be predictive with AI. So, I'm excited about the business transformation that digital drives across all of our businesses, and I think that's really the core. To put out a sort of final point on how we think about the investments, as John said, you know, our goal is, again, this is to drive growth in our business, and we are committed to \u2013 this is our way to get to the long-term 11% to 12% administrative expense ratio that again we shared at Investor Day. So, thanks again, for the question. There's a lot of initiatives embedded inside of that, but I think fundamentally, it's about a business model transformation and a digital platform for health. Thanks for the question. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Mr. Fischbeck, please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. So trying to understand the moving pieces and the guidance, because you guys beat and then you raised by the beat, but then it seemed like half of the race was due to sequestration. You didn't change your view on the COVID headwind, so that doesn't seem to be an offset to the numbers. And then you said that the core business was performing better than expected. So, just trying to reconcile all of that, I guess maybe you just elaborate a little bit more when you say the core business came in better than expected, driving a raise, what exactly, you know is coming in better than expected. And if it's coming in better than expected, why isn't that leading to a larger raise, you know, through the rest of the year? John Gallina : Thank you for the question, Kevin. And, as you pointed out, there are many moving parts associated with the guidance for the year. First quarter results of $7.01 were about $0.60 ahead of consensus estimates. And as you pointed out, the sequestration extension adds another $0.30 of upside. And then with all that, we also have the fourth wave of COVID as I've been more prolonged and anticipated. And also, just a month or so ago, we found out that we're required to increase the vaccine administration rates from $28 of those to $48 of those. You know, all-in with the, you know, with that core performance, we obviously feel very comfortable delivering the upside back to the shareholders and raising guidance, up to $25.10. In terms of core performance, you know, core performance is a lot of things. You know, it's the growth, you know, we've seen great core performance and better than expected in commercial, in Medicaid, in Ingenio, in Diversified Business Group, they\u2019re all doing very, very well. And, you know, we've seen growth in all those areas. You know, the medical cost, as we look at the costs that have been incurred, plus the expectation of pent-up demand, we feel good about that. And the SG&A efficiencies on a run rate basis after we pull out some of the investment spending. You know, so we're really very bullish about how well positioned we are and what the future holds. So, we've raised guidance accordingly. But thank you for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question, we'll go to the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Mr. Rhyee, please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Yeah, thanks for taking the question. You know, maybe Gail, I wanted to go back, you were talking earlier about, you know, the work you're doing, particularly for social drivers of health and a lot of new programs, a partnership that you were talking about, and particularly with Beacon. And you kind of made a comment about Beacon like it's trying \u2013 is that talking about transitioning from an onsite kind of service to be delivered through a retail, kind of model, because you talked about going live with a major national retailer, maybe can you talk a little bit more about how that actually works? What the economics are for Anthem and who\u2019s paying for the service, is it still employers? Any kind of commentary there would be helpful? Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks for the question, Charles. Let me clarify a little bit about what the innovative model that we're building. One of the things that we've learned, both of our own employees, quite frankly, and the work that we've done in the community is that the social drivers obviously have a huge impact on people's health. And that has always been embedded in the core of Anthem\u2019s strategy. The specific program that Beacon is working on is with a large national employer, basically, who is a retailer to help support all of those efforts within their own employee population. That's, I think an innovative product offering, I would think of it that way, as a way to connect all of these issues that affect employees.  We've had them, at Anthem, we actually built into our own employee benefit program this year; with something we call a health essentials program to help support people. And what we learned during the pandemic is that the needs, particularly the behavioral health needs, the needs to social services, access with caregivers, all of those things really weigh heavily on employers and impact their productivity. And their ability to quite frankly, come to work and be their full self, especially in an environment like this. So, we saw that need, built this innovative product.  It does include on-site resource coordinators to help with housing, food, and transportation. This is a product we think, again, very innovative, no one else has it in the market that we believe will resonate very much with our, particularly our large national accounts. It's something we've done in our government programs. I think what's not well understood for a lot of individuals is that the issues that affect that we put in \u2013 the programs that we put into place in our government programs affect individuals, consumers in our commercial markets, as well.  And so we're taking what we've learned from those markets and hope to scale it across all of our markets. So, again, a great question. We think it's a really innovative approach. And we think it's a great opportunity to offer a different solution for employers as they bring their employees back into the physical workplace. So, thanks very much for the question. Next question, please. Operator : For the last question, we'll go to the line of Rob Cottrell from Cleveland Research. Mr. Cottrell, please go ahead. Rob Cottrell : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the color on MyNEXUS, it sounds like that's primarily focused on the Medicare population today. Curious if there's opportunity to expand that. So, Medicaid and commercial members, and then also any Blue partnership opportunities that may come from, you know, the increased exposure to home based care? Gail Boudreaux : Well, thanks for the question. I'll start and then I\u2019ll ask Felicia to provide a little bit of color because she has worked closely with MyNEXUS, as you know, MyNEXUS will be part of our diversified business group. You know, I think MyNEXUS is really a great example of a fit within Anthem and our strategy that we shared with you at Investor Day, around managing integrated and multi-care services. And again, our strategy has always been around whole person care, providing that expertise. And this one, MyNEXUS in particular, offers an extensive network of home providers, including 9 of the 10, top national providers in high quality. So again, those are really important components of it. As we look at the, you know, in-home visitation authorization and time to care, all those things, what was great about MyNEXUS is that we had worked with them extensively, and we saw the value. So, this is a great example of driving value inside of our own population. Today, it is predominantly Medicare Advantage members. But we do see opportunities to obviously offer this to other health plans, because we think it's a highly valued service. And I\u2019ll ask Felicia maybe to comment on the opportunities that are across our broader book of business, because again, we do think that the model works quite well. And we've seen nice returns. So Felicia? Felicia Norwood : Yes, thank you for that question, Rob. And I will say Gail hit it well. We found this to be a very valuable asset for us from a Medicare Advantage perspective. But we certainly see the opportunity to take a look at the ability to scale this across other parts of government business as well. As you know, our duals are a key platform for us when we take a look at the opportunity for growth in our government business. [Indiscernible] populations will be continued areas focus for us as we go forward. So this is an example of an opportunity for us to leverage this internally, but also across the blue partnerships that we have in government business and Medicare, as well as Medicaid. So thank you very much for that question. Gail Boudreaux : And thanks, Felicia. One other thing that I would notice that MyNEXUS, you shouldn't think of it as just a standalone because we actually see the opportunity for really integrated solutions, combining home health post acute, palliative, and behavioral. So, if you think about what we do, and some of our other businesses like Aspire, again, our ability to be deeper in the home, this provides, again, an integrative opportunity. Thank you for the question. Next question, please. Operator : And that was our final question. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you very much. I guess we are done with our questions. So, appreciate all of the questions that we had today. And I want to thank all of you for joining us for the call this morning. As you heard and can see, Anthem has shown solid growth throughout this pandemic while continuing to provide critical support in resources to our communities as we combat this pandemic together. Our performance in the first quarter gives us confidence in our ability to capitalize on future growth prospects and deliver on our commitment to all of our stakeholders. Our success would not be possible without the hard work and dedication of our more than 85,000 associates who exemplify our mission, vision, and values. And I want to thank each and every one of them for all that they do each and every day. Thank you for your interest in Anthem, and I look forward to speaking with you in the future. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, a recording of this conference will be available for replay after 11 :00 A.M. today through May 20, 2021. You may access the replay system at any time by dialing 866-430-8786, and international participants can dial 203-369-0937. This concludes our conference for today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Please go ahead. Stephen Tanal : Good morning and welcome to Anthem's second quarter 2021 earnings call. This is Steve Tanal, Vice President of Investor Relations and with us this morning on call are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Peter Haytaian, President of our Commercial and Specialty Business Division; Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division and Jeff Alter, President of our Pharmacy and Health Solutions Businesses. Gail will begin the call with the brief discussion of the quarter, recent progress against our strategic initiatives and close on Anthem's commitment to its mission. John will then discuss our financials results and outlook in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Boudreaux : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for Anthem's second quarter 2021 earnings call. This morning, we reported second quarter GAAP earnings per share of $7.25 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.03, ahead of our expectations despite ongoing uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm pleased to report that we continue to deliver on our commitments to our stakeholders, while making considerable progress against our long-term strategy to transform our organization from a health benefits company to a lifetime trusted partner in health. This transformation is fueled by the continued expansion of our digital platform, which improves connections across the healthcare system, while leveraging the industry's largest data sets to drive actionable insights in pursuit of better health. In the second quarter, Anthem produced strong membership growth, one significant new contract in our government business and continued to integrate and expand our digital platform. On the membership front, we ended the second quarter with 44.3 million members, up 1.9 million or 4.4% year-over-year and 820,000 new members since the end of the first quarter, reflecting the strategic acquisition of Puerto Rico's leading Medicare Advantage organization MMM as well as strong organic growth in our core benefits businesses. MMM is the largest Medicare Advantage plan in Puerto Rico and operates the only 4.5 star rated plans in the territory. And it's also the second largest Medicaid health plan. Through its integrated care delivery model, MMM has established a strong track record of delivering quality care for seniors and dual eligible with complex and chronic needs. Medicare Advantage remains a key area of focus for our organization. And we continue to see an immense opportunity to grow and optimize this business. Just last week, we were awarded a major contract to serve the retirees of the city of New York in partnership with Emblem Health. And what was one of the largest public procurements for group Medicare in the last decade.  This opportunity builds on our more than 50-year relationship serving New York City's workers, retirees and their families and will significantly increase Anthem's group Medicare Advantage business as well as our Medicare Advantage market share in New York. We're honored to have been selected to make a material difference in the lives of New Yorkers who worked hard to serve the city.  In addition to MMM, we also closed on the acquisition of myNEXUS during the second quarter, advancing our strategy to grow and deepen Anthem's capabilities and Medicare Advantage. MyNEXUS is a digitally enabled organization that optimizes home health for more than 2 million Medicare Advantage members across 20 states, including more than 900,000 existing Anthem Medicare Advantage members. MyNEXUS improves outcomes by facilitating timely, personalized care for our members in the comfort of their homes, leading to improved continuity of care and reduced hospital admissions, readmissions and ER visits. In addition to supporting future growth in Medicare Advantage, myNEXUS furthers our diversified business group's strategy to deliver on its risk contracts to the expansion of home-based care. Our Medicaid business is also performing very well and continues to build upon our deep local alliances and investments in population health, digital tools and local solutions to help address the social drivers of health in our communities. We extended our strong RFP track record in the quarter, securing an award to continue serving consumers in the state of Nevada. This follows our recent award in Ohio. These wins build on the momentum, we have coming off a fantastic start to the launch of North Carolina, which went live at the beginning of this month. Our healthy Blue plan has already become the largest Medicaid managed care plan by membership in North Carolina, and the leading choice for consumers of beneficiaries who chose their plan; nearly 50% selected Healthy Blue, underscoring the power of our alliance partnerships and the Blue brand. In our commercial business, together with IngenioRx, we continue to innovate while demonstrating the power of true integration. By deploying machine learning and automation across our comprehensive ecosystem of medical, pharmacy, lab and social drivers of health data, Anthem and IngenioRx are improving outcomes. Across these businesses, we're leveraging our proprietary predictive modeling algorithms to apply rich and analytic solutions that allow us to tailor our integrated medical and pharmacy offerings to each member population. This enables us to deliver the right solutions to improve health based on individualized needs. We extend this customized approach to our specialty products, which we are increasingly selling in bundles through Anthem's Whole Health Connection, a differentiator in the marketplace. This traction gives us confidence in the long-term targets we articulated for our commercial business at our recent Analyst Day, including narrowing the profit gap between our fee and risk based commercial business by serving more of our fee base members in more ways. The success we are seeing in our core business validates our commitment to continue to invest in building our digital platform for health. The essence of a platform is that what we own matters less than what we can connect and we are seeing great success in making connections through consumer and provider facing tools.  While we are still in the early innings, our efforts to simplify the healthcare experience, while creating a more connected and powerful platform are clearly resonating with consumers, providers and employers. For example, over 30% of members registered for Sydney health are actively using the platform. In the second quarter, we continue to expand access to Sydney across multiple Medicaid markets and saw a five-fold increase in engagement compared to our legacy digital tools for Medicaid. In the commercial markets, 32 national accounts have purchased Sydney preferred for its superior end to end experience and enhance functionality like our find care feature, which provides members seeking surgical treatments, a personalized omni channel experience including price transparency, tailored physician and facility recommendations and access to telephonic health coaches to guide them through the process.  Digital is also playing a key role in deepening our value based care penetration and provider enablement by improving conductivity and real time access to meaningful, actionable data. We continue to invest in building enhanced data connections to enable deeper collaboration at scale via our HealthOS provider platform. HealthOS connects siloed health data in disparate technologies to drive deeper insights and reduce costs and complexity. More than 100,000 value-based care physicians and 13,000 value- based care coordinators are connected to HealthOS today. This connection allows technology partners and providers to plug into HealthOS and gain data driven insights as part of their existing workflow. In May, we announced a new partnership with Epic that will allow bi- directional exchange of health information, paving the way to better leverage data driven insights into care decisions. Epic is a significant enabler of many of our efforts to improve our HEDIS and star scores. We have nearly 150 provider systems on our glide path through the end of 2022 and are in discussions with other healthcare information companies for similar partnerships. All of these efforts aligned to Anthem's purpose, to improve the health of humanity. Our community health strategy supports our purpose by addressing the health related social needs of our associates, members and communities, to data and evidence based interventions that promote health equity. Our commitment to living this purpose has earned recognition that I'm particularly proud of, for example, Anthem was recently named one of the top 100 US companies supporting healthy communities and families by Just Capital, the leading platform for measuring and improving corporate performance in the stakeholder economy. We are the leader in our industry, ranking number one among healthcare providers, and number 14 overall on the list. In addition, Points of Light, the world's largest organization dedicated to volunteer service, recently recognized Anthem as one of the 50 most community minded companies in America for 2021. As we reflect on our achievements this quarter, and our broader mission, we're cognizant that fundamentally improving the health of humanity takes partnerships, aligned incentives and connections across people, care providers, researchers, data scientists, communities, and others dedicated to improving health. Anthem is making these connections through our digital platform for health while following the data and embracing our unique assets to drive positive change in ways that only Anthem can. We have deep local roots in our communities, and the industry's largest data sets, both of which position us uniquely well to deliver against our mission.  I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail. John? John Gallina : Thank you, Gail. And good morning to everyone on the line. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter results that included GAAP earnings per share of $7.25 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.03. Another strong quarter in which we delivered on our financial commitments, while reinvesting in each of our businesses, all while navigating the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Second quarter results again underscored the balance and resilience of our enterprise. We ended the quarter with 44.3 million members, growth of 1.9 million lives year-over-year, or 4.4%, including growth of 820,000 in the second quarter alone. Excluding the acquisition of MMM, we grew organically by 232,000 members in the quarter driven by growth in our Medicaid and commercial fully insured businesses partially offset by continued in group attrition in our large group and national fee based accounts, in line with our expectations and prior guidance. Second quarter operating revenue of $33.3 billion grew 14% over the prior year quarter, on a HIF-adjusted basis; our top line grew nearly 16% with no impact from MMM, which closed at the end of the quarter. Growth was driven by higher premium revenue in Medicaid and Medicare associated with strong membership growth. In addition to rate increases to cover cost inflation. Pharmacy product revenue also contributed to our top line growth as IngenioRx grew affiliated and unaffiliated revenue, with a value proposition that continues to resonate in the marketplace. The medical loss ratio for the second quarter was 86.8%; an increase of 890 basis points is compared to the prior year quarter, driven by an increase in non-COVID utilization from the press levels a year ago, and to a lesser extent, the repeal of the health insurance tax in 2021. Relative to our expectations, total medical costs were favorable, driven by non-COVID cost developing favorably partially offset by somewhat higher than expected cost for COVID related care. Please note that while total benefit costs were favorable to our expectations, total cost ended the quarter slightly above our estimate of a normalized level. Our second quarter SG&A expense ratio came in at 11.5%, a decrease of 240 basis points year-over- year, excluding the effect of the repeal the health, our SG&A ratio decreased 110 basis points, driven by leverage of strong revenue growth, partially offset by ongoing investments in support of our growth and our evolution to become a digital first enterprise.  Turning to our balance sheet; we ended the second quarter with a debt to capital ratio of 40.9%, down sequentially from 41.6% in the first quarter. The decrease was due to the early repayment of debt at par originally scheduled to mature in August of this year, and an increase in equity driven by our strong bottom line performance in the quarter. We continue to expect our debt to capital ratio to end the year, slightly below 40%. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $380.59 for $480 million. We have now repurchased close to 60% of our full year outlook of $1.6 billion, which is still an appropriate figure for modeling purposes. We maintain a prudent posture with respect to reserves to the second quarter, ending the period with 48.1 days in claims payable, an increase of 1.2 days compared with the first quarter and 2.1 days year-over- year. MMM and myNEXUS, both of which close during the quarter, increased our June 30th claims payable balances with minimal impact on the average day of claims, resulting in the DCP calculation increasing by 1.6 days. Excluding these acquisitions, days and claims payable was largely consistent with the last quarter decreasing by just 0.4 days. Given the continued uncertainty associated with COVID, we continue to take a prudent posture in establishing reserves. And as a result, our second quarter earnings did not benefit from the favorable prior period development. Operating cash flow was $1.7 billion or 0.9x net income in the second quarter. The year-on-year decline was driven by the deferral of normal tax payments out of the second quarter of last year into the back half as was permitted by the IRS. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow is $4.2 billion or 1.2x of net income. Given our solid performance in the first half, we are increasing our guidance for full year operating cash flow to greater than $5.8 billion. As a reminder, our operating cash flow is depressed this year due to the timing of certain payments, as well as the settlement of the BlueCross and BlueShield multi district litigation scheduled for the fourth quarter. Turning to our earnings outlook for the year, we're raising our guidance for the full year adjusted earnings per share to greater than $25.50 from the greater than $25.10, which squarely puts us at the midpoint of our long-term annual adjusted earnings per share growth target of 12% to 15%. There are a number of moving pieces associated with our revised guidance, which includes a portion of the upside we generated in the second quarter. The underlying fundamentals of our core business remain strong, evidenced by our first half results. Given strong year-to-date performance on medical costs, we now expect our full year medical loss ratio to end in the lower half of our full year guidance of 88% plus or minus 50 basis points. Given accelerated reinvestment in our business in the first half of the year, and startup costs for new contracts in the back half, we now expect full year SG&A ratio to end the year in the upper half of our prior guidance range of 10.8% plus or minus 50 basis points. We have also increased our outlook for investment income for the year, given strong performance in our alternative investment portfolio in the first two quarters, which we have not carried forward in our guidance. The outperformance in this non-operating line item is more than entirely offset by higher effective tax rate and our full year guidance. In the context of our upwardly revised guidance, we now expect to absorb earnings delusion in the second half associated with the startup cost for the award of the city of New York group Medicare Advantage contract and our entry into the Ohio Medicaid program, both of which will go live in 2022.  We have also taken a slightly more cautious view of the back half of the year, in light of new COVID variants, coupled with a slowing vaccination rate, a combination that could result in the potential for higher COVID related cost. Our guidance also includes a partial year of MMM and myNEXUS, both of which are expected to contribute much more meaningfully to our financial results in 2022 and beyond. As noted in our press release, we now expect to generate approximately $137 billion of operating revenue in 2021. And to end the year with 44.8 to 45.3 million members. Finally, while it is premature to comment quantitatively on 2022, we want to remind you that group Medicare Advantage contracts and large Medicaid wins are generally dilutive in the first full year of operations. We have a strong line of sight towards a compelling ROI on our recent new business wins. And over the seven year term of our new group Medicare Advantage contract with the City of New York, our expect to returns are well in excess of our cost of capital. Additionally, with these two wins, our percent of membership and revenues from our government business division will become an even larger percentage of our totals. In closing, we were pleased to deliver another quarter of solid growth while reinvesting in our enterprise. We continue to grow inward in our services businesses, and outward in all of our segments, each of which remains well positioned for growth. Our mix continues to evolve towards our strategic areas of focus, Medicare Advantage and the government business. In addition to our service segments. We have entered the second half with strong underlying fundamentals, solid momentum in a prudently position balance sheet. And with that, operator, please open up the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] For a first question, we'll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. LanceWilkes: Yes, could you could you talk a little bit about utilization you saw during the quarter in both government and commercial lines and any trends you're seeing with July? And in particular, maybe any distinction between COVID and non-COVID? And how you think the Delta variant might impact that? Thanks. JohnGallina: Good morning, Lance. And thank you for the question. This is John. So in terms of the utilization of the second quarter, the overall utilization was slightly above normalized levels, but slightly less than our expectation. So in total for the company we exceeded baseline, albeit that we were better than what we projected. When you really think about it on a line of business by line of business basis Medicaid had the highest level of deferred utilization. And then certainly, they had some COVID costs, and so Medicaid was below baseline, commercial was slightly above baseline all-in and Medicare Advantage was actually slightly above baseline all-in once you take into account all the other issues associated with the risk score revenues, and the additional payments that were still making on the 3.75% rate increases that existed. So all very much consistent with what we thought 90 days ago, just a little bit better. And as you look at July, we really don't provide mid quarter guidance, per se. But we're obviously monitoring our preop and pre certification data and as a reminder, as I just said, in the prepared comments, we do expect both the third quarter and the fourth quarter to be above baseline each quarter for the rest of the year. So based on everything we've seen so far, July is tracking very consistent with those expectations. So thank you, Lance. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. JustinLake: Thanks. A couple of questions on the government side; one, can you give us an update on how much membership you've gotten from, you think you've gotten from re-determinations being delayed? And then how you think about that kind of rolling off as you look ahead to 2022 and beyond. And then you talked about this big Medicare Advantage contract from the city of New York, would be helpful to know, I was just looking on the internet was like it might be a couple 100,000 members. Is that a ballpark estimate there for 2022 on what you might pick up? Thanks. GailBoudreaux: Great. Well, thanks for the questions Justin; we will try to tick them off. I'll start first on the city of New York and then Felicia should share some of her insights on the Medicaid business in particular. Thanks again for the question, because first, we're really honored to have been awarded the contract with the City of New York and continue serving these members in the state as we execute on our strategy. This is really, I think, a great proof point for Anthem that we shared with everyone at our Investor Day about our goal to get deeper in each of the sites we serve. This contract gives us that opportunity in a very important state. And it also I think, is a proof point for our goal to convert our existing clients to group Medicare Advantage, so two really strong, I think proof points for the strategy that we've been talking about over the last several years. I think a little bit of background would be helpful on the city in New York; we have served them for more than 50 years.  And we've actually been their medical management vendor of the past five years. So if you think about that, it's really given us a really good strong understanding of the members and their health needs. So it was really for us a great opportunity to provide them sort of the strategic offering and group MA. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks that generally these contracts are dilutive in the first full year of operations. The back half of the year, we're going to incur startup costs and with no offsetting revenue, so as we get ready to go live in January of '22. And we're absorbing that in the guidance that we've given you. And as we've noted, in past contracts of this size tend to be diluted as the members transition a group MA. I think the good news is obviously as the medical management vendor we have some insight into these members, but we also need to collect the data to reflect the members acuity and risk scores and ramp up other medical management issues, particularly our value based care provider relationships, and obviously working with our partner Emblem. In terms of overall membership, at this time, it's a little bit early to call, but we believe it'll be over 200,000 lives, there's going to be some variability in that because there is a choice in open enrollment to buy up and do different things. But we think, clearly, it'll be over the 200,000 lives. And as we think about 2022, the guidance and what that means we'll share that later in this year. We're a little early and ahead of that, and we'll address that at the end of the year. But again, I'll just close on this section, that as a seven year contract, we think that it's really positive for us overall. And it really gives us breadth and depth in the market. And beginning in '23, we expected to have a positive impact to our earnings and a really strong and compelling ROI. So with that, I'm going to ask Felicia to address the second part of your question, I guess, which was about Medicaid and re-verification. FeliciaNorwood: So good morning, Justin. Our Medicaid enrollment ended the second quarter at about 9.7 million members, that was up 582,000 when you include MMM, so just in terms of our organic growth, 267,000 increase in terms of our Medicaid membership compared to the first quarter of 2021, when you take a look at it all-in, the increase is certainly predominantly due to the continued suspension of re-verifications. And we had a couple of small tuck-in acquisitions in our Florida market as well. As our guidance assumes that re-verifications remain on hold through the end of 2021. And with the renewed public health emergency from the Biden administration on yesterday, we still feel very good about that timeline. With that said, we continue to work very closely with our state partners, and our members, helping them understand re-verifications what it means. And we're going to continue to stay close to that as we look to the end of the year. Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. A.J.Rice: Hi, everyone. Thanks for the question. I just may be asked about Ingenio, looks like it was one of the bright spots in the quarter. Is there any update you can provide as to script trends? I know COVID vaccines as well as just the return of acute scripts seem to be helping and wonder if you saw that. And any comment you could give us on the PBM selling season. I know you were targeting some of your customers; do you have ASO business with long standing relationships, any movement there that you've seen? GailBoudreaux: Well, thanks, AJ. I'm going ask Jeff Alter to comments on your questions. But thank you, we felt very strongly about our Ingenio results and think Jeff can share with you some of what's happening inside of the business. Jeff? JeffAlter: Thanks, good morning, AJ. Yes, so we, it was a strong quarter, thanks for noticing that. We believe our integrated stories are beginning to take hold in the marketplace. And then the work that we do to make sure that our partners with inside, our Anthem businesses, as well as some of our external partners, are getting the best course of treatment at the lowest possible drug costs. And so, as we see that continuing to resonate in the market, we were enjoying a nice trajectory on our earnings, as well as our growth in script volume, and membership. So it's -- we're in the middle of the selling season, that value story is resonating. We particularly see it an advantage inside the labor and trust segment and the mid market of our commercial business. And again, continue to be strong support for our government businesses, Medicaid and Medicare. Thanks for the question. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Rob Cottrell from Cleveland Research. RobCottrell: Hi, good morning. I wanted to see if you could help quantify what you're thinking the expected COVID kind of all-in number will be this year relative to the previous $600 million expectation. JohnGallina: Thank you, Rob and good morning. So as you noted the prior guidance was $600 million headwind. And there's certainly a lot of moving parts behind that estimate. Year-to-date, COVID cost did come in slightly better than expected. Non COVID cost tracking. I'm sorry. COVID came in slightly higher than expected with non-COVID tracking slightly better than expected. So all-in costs are a bit favorable to our outlook in the first half. But there's still a considerable amount of uncertainty surrounding COVID in the back half of the year, until we obviously want to maintain a prudent if not cautious posture with respect to our guidance. Yes. So in that context, we believe that the net headwind of $600 million is still appropriate, with a majority of that in the back half of the year. And that's an all-in type of an estimate that includes the impact on our risk scores, the additional fee schedules, the COVID cost, the increase in vaccination, administrative cost all-in so at this point in time, we think $600 million is a reasonable estimate to stay with. Thank you for the question. GailBoudreaux: Thanks, John. Only thing I'd add is that's very similar and consistent to what we've guided through throughout the year. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gilson, JPMorgan. LisaGilson: Hi. Good morning. Thanks very much. Gail, you mentioned several times today digital as well as virtual Care Initiative. Can you maybe just give us a little more color as we think about virtual care and utilization of virtual care? And, ultimately, how do you see that impacting your medical cost trend? GailBoudreaux: Well, thanks for the question, Lisa. I think a couple things there embedded in that we are, as I shared with you, in the opening comments, particularly around our HealthOS platform, we're really building an integrated platform where we can drive data. So I'll address virtual care in a minute. But I think it's all connected, we're starting with really our deep data insights. And we're connecting that with our care provider network, trying to give them the best information across every point in time. And then we're using that to enable our value based care providers. So I think the core of what we're sharing is that virtual is a component of it. And you saw, not only virtual, but also at home care. We believe that our ability to get to the commitment, we made at Investor Day around getting our trend to CPI is really about the -- I guess I'd say the combination of all of these things. So starting again, with enabling our value based providers providing data at real time, and connecting that to consumers through our Sydney platform. So we accelerated a lot of those initiatives over the past year, particularly in the second quarter, you heard the proof point that we just shared about our Medicaid because we think there's opportunities there as well to accelerate the engagement of our consumers. But fundamentally, this is really about getting our value based payment, and our providers enabled with the data so that they can make the right decisions take greater risk. And we do see that as a critical element of getting to CPI, trended CPI over the next several years. So I think they all come together. And again, virtual care is just part of I think, the continuum of care, including at home care that we're offering our providers as part of the mix of how they best serve patients, where they need to be at the right time. So thanks for the question. I think it's a core element of our strategy. But it's quite comprehensive. It's not only about the digital platform; it's really about value based care. It's about connecting of care providers with consumers, and then enabling the providers to actually get more involved and take more risk along the way and feel confident that they can manage those patients. So thanks again. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. StevenValiquette: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a quick question on memberships. So in the prepared remarks, you talked about commercial and specialty enrollment decreasing by 174,000 lives mainly on the fee base side as a result of the economic environment. I know the high level unemployment is still trending favorably as 2021 progresses, and now there's all sorts of noise around for low impact on payrolls. I guess I was just curious to hear more from you guys just color or just around the mechanics of the economic environment leading to that sequentially lower membership and how that sort of plays out for the rest of year. Thanks. GailBoudreaux: Well, thanks. We'll have Pete address that as part of the commercial outlook. PeterHaytaian: Hey, Steve. No, thanks for the question. And as you alluded to, I mean, enrollment and membership in the quarter really came in as we expected. And again, as you suggested, the themes haven't really fundamentally changed. First of all, I do want to note how proud I am of the team in terms of our performance and execution, as you saw it on the print, we have good year-to-date growth over 100,000 members year-to-date, our sales again exceeded our lapses in our local market business, really strong performance on the fully insured side where we saw sequential growth in the individual small and local large group business so that was very good in terms of what we can control and execute against. As it relates to your question on the economy. Yes, I mean, that's where we continue to see a headwind, on our fee-based business, and the group changes that continue to put some pressure on us. We are beginning to see things open up a bit. And the pipe had been light in the fee-based business, over the last year, but we are beginning to see that pipe open up as it relates to Q3, and Q4, and then headed into 2022.  We have some good visibility, as it relates to 2022, on the national side of our business. So, we are feeling good about where that stands right now, in terms of the growth headed into 2022. It's a little bit early. We're sort of at the middle to the end of that selling season. But I do feel strongly that based upon the execution of our team, the tools and capabilities, we're using, our engagement with the broker community are focused on affordability that as the economy continues to improve, you will begin to see that membership come back in the back half of the year into 2022. GailBoudreaux: Thanks, Pete. I just want to reiterate a couple points that Pete made, because I think they're really important; one, is just our ability to sell more than our lapses. I mean, we've really been consistent over the last year and a half plus. And I think a lot of that goes back to our tools, our products. We've done a lot of work on our sales effectiveness, and that's really resonating in the marketplace, are focused on whole health. And so again, while Pete shared that attrition, still in our fee-based business is something that we're closely watching. We're really pleased with the growth in our risk based business. We've taken a very consistent approach. And we've done well in the markets. And again, it's all about our depth, trying to continue to get keep being deep in those markets and strong national account showing as well this year. And we're very optimistic about our pipeline. So, thanks for that question. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Scott Vidal from Stevens. ScottFidel: Hi, thanks, and good morning. I'm just interested; just I know you're not ready to talk specifically about 2022. But just first, in terms of the proper jumping off point to think about as remodeling would be increased guidance range for EPS be the right number, or are you still thinking about where the prior EPS was in terms of the jumping off point. And then, clearly significant, two contracts that you've got here with New York City, group MA in Ohio, Medicaid, and just thinking if there's a way to potentially just ring fence, how you're thinking about initial dilution in 2022. On that just as we try to sort of model properly thinking about 2022 growth rates? Thanks. JohnGallina: Thank you, Scott, for the question. And I completely agree with the very first comment you made, it's premature to talk about 2022 at this point in time. However, related to the specificity in our new guidance is $25.50, which does reflect that $0.40 raise. And we're really very, very happy with the core operating performance of the company, really improving throughout the quarter and throughout the year.  I think what I could say, though, without providing any specifics for 2022, is that the core fundamentals of our business do remain solid, we're very confident in our ability to deliver 12% to 15% annual EPS growth over the long term. However, having said that, there will be dilution in for these big contracts in 2022, it's too early to actually declare that as Gail said, we still don't even know the exact number of members that we have in the city of New York.  And we need to do a lot more work on that. And so, as we get closer to 2022, we'll be in a position to provide additional clarity on our expectations. The only other comment I will make is that, we are incurring various startup cost, and set up and cost here in the second half of '21. And we have already included that cost structure in our thought processes, and then our guidance for the year. But thank you for the question. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of David Windley from Jefferies. DavidWindley: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Good morning. If I look back balance sheet was to the beginning of the pandemic, your DCP depending on the kind of the starting timeframe looks like it's increased anywhere from like 7 to 10 days. I'm wondering, do you expect that over the long term DCP will come back down to the high 30s where it was pre pandemic and what visibility would you need to see that happen? And then, if I could slip in, since nobody else has asked where are your analysis of AduHelm and your thoughts around coverage of AduHelm. Thank you. JohnGallina: So, thank you. I'll start with the first question and then I think I would like to address the AduHelm. But, in terms of the dates and claims payable, it was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter as you said up either 7 or 10 days, depending on your starting point, really a ton of uncertainty associated with this environment. And we have to record reserves, consistent with the actuarial standards. And we need to ensure that our methodologies and calculations are very consistent. And as I said that they need generally accepted accounting principles. Having said that, there are a lot of uncertainties and a lot of unknowns that have existed, each and every quarter each and every month, during this entire pandemic. And so, we've tried to be extremely prudent and conservative in our approach, and would expect to have that to continue until, there's a little bit more line of sight into the future. I would say that over time, and over time is a long period of time, it could be a few years, but over time, I would expect our DCPs to go back down.  Now there\u2019s lot of other things that impact the days and claims payable as well. We've talked a lot about our investment in digital. Well, that investment in digital also includes better auto adjudication rates, cleaner claim submissions from providers to us, and that is done better and better and faster and faster. That automatically would reduce the days and claims payable without impacting the income statement by a penny, it would just be better throughput.  And actually, the improvement would be our administrative cost structure could go down simultaneously. So, there\u2019s a lot of variables with DCP. And I would really carry out everyone to say, do not just look at a number, and then think that there's a P&L impact, because you also have rate collars and corridors and impacted et cetera, et cetera. But really the short answer to your question is yes, we do expect it to go down over time as we get a little bit more clarity into the current environment. Thank you for the question. GailBoudreaux: Thank you. In terms of your second question, I want to address that because Anthem does recognize that there has been really little hope or choice for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, quite frankly it is a heartbreaking disease for patients, their families, their friends and caregivers. We've been monitoring the development of the drug for over a year, we're closely watching the FDA guidance and all available evidence as it continues to change. And as new information becomes available, we're going to continue to evaluate it with our clinical experts we've had, we've advanced them the FDA guidance and recommendation from others. So it's all really, I think times to the relevant evidence that will become available. We really do appreciate the patience as we can take this due diligence and ensure that it really is the most clinically appropriate use of drugs and therapies for our members. So thank you for the question. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. RalphGiacobbe: Thanks. Good morning. I guess first just wanting to clarify the commentary. Maybe I misheard it, but sounded like better medical cost performance. But John, I think you said, but overall, our total cost was higher than expectations. So just wanted to clarify that. And then going back to Scott's question sounds like, you don't want to really sort of quantify the dilution for '22. But it sounds like there is startup costs this year. So can you help at all in terms of the magnitude of that in terms of what you're absorbing this year for startup costs around those contracts? Thanks. JohnGallina: Ralph, thank you for the question. And I appreciate you asking me to clarify, because if anyone wasn't clear, then I did want to take this opportunity. Our total cost for the second quarter was better than our expectations. Simultaneously, our total costs for the second quarter were above baseline or a normalized level, given the absence of COVID. So maybe that's where the clarification is necessary. So we're above baseline for the quarter, but better than overall expectations, and that's one of the reasons our medical loss ratio is at the very low end of the guidance range as well. And then associated with the City of New York startup costs, the Ohio startup cost, we're really not going to go through specificity of dollars at this point in time. Since there's a lot of moving parts in our 2021 guidance. We do have, we closed on MMM and myNEXUS, which certainly includes some financing costs, deal costs and integration costs on for those entities. We have the startup costs for New York GRS as well as Ohio; we've taken all that into consideration. And it's all been thought through in terms of our $25.50 guidance. So thank you for the question. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. StephenBaxter: Hey, thanks for the question. Wanted to ask one on Medicare Advantage. Just wanted to ask about your current expectations for risk adjustment revenue in 2021. And then get a sense of how the company is feeling about revenue recovery for 2022. And then as we think about, MMM, is there anything we should be keeping in mind here about any dynamics they might have versus the rest of your portfolio? Thanks. GailBoudreaux: Felicia? FeliciaNorwood: Good morning and thank you for that question. We've engaged in significant outreach this year, with our members really checking in to see how they were doing helping to address health related social need, making sure that they were getting vaccines, and that they're able to see their doctors and access care, especially to close gaps in care that were lingering from 2020. This includes home visits and telehealth, really meeting members where they are and how they feel most comfortable engaging with their care providers. Based on our analytics, we feel very good about where we are, and believe that we are on track to help our members health risks reflected in our 2020 payments at levels that are similar to 2019. And in terms of the CMS make your payment. I wanted to make sure that you know we've received that. And it's certainly in line with our expectations. So we feel good about where we are around risk scores, collecting the data, making sure that we are having coding accuracy appropriately. And as I said before, the '22 payments will be similar to what they were in 2019. And just want to make sure I corrected that. Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Matt Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. MattBorsch: Yes, if I could just ask about a little bit more about utilization patterns. So in Medicare Advantage in the second quarter, you made reference to the impact of the risk score issues, but were the utilization, the elective procedures and so forth were that above your sort of normal baseline? If I understood you correctly. JohnGallina: Oh, yes. Thanks, Matt. Maybe I can help answer that question. So in the second quarter, we saw that the inpatient was still below baseline, ER utilization is still short of baseline. However, doctor's visits and outpatient were a bit above. And part of that at our encouragement, we're trying to encourage our members to seek health care when they need it, paying their checkups, and their annual visits, and various things like that. And as you know, more often that the seniors going to see the doctor, the better opportunity there is for us to collect data and information on them to help maximize the risk or revenues. So part of our strategy was consistent with that, to ensure that our members actually saw it and got the care they needed. And we're seeing that. So yes, we did see outpatient and doctor's visits above baseline for the quarter. And we're actually pretty happy about that because we think that's a good thing in the long term. So hopefully, that helps. GailBoudreaux: Yes, and I just like to add to John's comment, because remember, we've been forecasting that we expected this to be above our normalized level. And again, particularly Medicare, where you have a highly vaccinated population, we looked at what happened in 2020. Again, we're encouraging them, with house visits to come into the doctor's immunizations, preventative care, et cetera. So that's an important part of it. And again, as we've shared, while we're projecting the back half of the year to be above baseline, again, been very consistent with that. We don't see a surge coming just because of some of the utilization constraints within the system. But again, we're very prudent about what's going to happen with the Delta variant. And that's all been part of the guidance that we gave you. So hopefully that helps clarify. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Joshua Raskin from Nephron Research. JoshuaRaskin: Thanks. Good morning. So my question is on the commercial employer preferences as we move into 2022 and I'm curious if you're seeing any impacts from COVID on sort of employer group preference around benefit design, and work from home, any sort of things that are popping up in terms of new apps and then I guess the other would be any impact on your goal to increase that number of products that you sell into individual or specific customer groups. PeterHaytaian: Yes, thanks for the question, Josh. We continue to see what we spoke about at Investor Day, real focus on affordability, on ease of use. And that's really been also on behavioral health and advocacy, those are really been, that has been the focus, over the last several months, especially coming out of COVID, as you'd expect, with a greater focus on behavioral health and the needs associated with behavioral health. And the importance of being able to navigate the system and the complexity of the system. And when we talk about around advocacy is really become critically important. And we are selling that value proposition into the marketplace, we're beginning to see that really resonate, as I alluded to before, in talking about our national business, which again, we're about in the seventh inning of that selling season, those are the themes that were selling through, and we're really seeing it resume, we're seeing new account wins come through, and then importantly, and what I'm really encouraged by, is our existing employer accounts are also growing.  And for the reasons, that we stated that we were really being sensitized to these issues, around COVID, and need for advocacy, affordability, and focus on issues like behavioral health. In addition to that, you had mentioned digital and some of the things that we previously talked about that and digitization of our business. And yes, that is also focused, again, looking back to what Gail said earlier about, really leveraging digital in a much greater way, both as it relates to navigating our product portfolio, but then importantly, as it relates to our members and our providers, and having data in the hands of providers at the point of care is really an important point that is also resonating and something that we're trying to sell to. GailBoudreaux: Thanks, Pete, and I guess the only thing I'd add, and Pete did a really good job of describing everything. I'll point to sort of the two proof points. One is the Sydney care sales that we've been seeing, particularly in the largest end which usually are the first movers. And it's been all about integration. And we've done really well with our Total Health, Total You, which is really focused on, again, integration and overall between behavioral pharmacy everything. So overall, I think those are, again, the themes and as Pete laid out the major things that are happening in the space. So thanks for the question. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. KevinFischbeck: Hi. Great, thanks. I just wanted to follow up on the commercial commentary, because we've been hearing this from a couple of other companies as well, that commercial utilization is coming in a little bit above baseline, just kind of figure out whether you can parse that out as far as core utilization versus COVID utilization and whether there's any kind of implications for pricing for next year, and whether you're able to kind of really parse out whether there's an actual trend issue or whether it's simply, timing or COVID costs. JohnGallina: Thanks, Kevin. Well, I'll just address the pricing issue head on, and we've said this before, we are going to stay disciplined with respect to pricing, and we're going to price it to forward trend. We said this in 2020. We did that. And we're seeing that come through in 2021. And feel good about our pricing as it relates to what we did in 2020. Yes, you're right; there are a lot of moving pieces and parts. We do have a sophisticated model, we're tracking this stuff, weekly, we talk about this and we take really all the COVID and non COVID impacts into consideration for pricing purposes. So everything that you mentioned, whether or not what, what are vaccination rates looking like the population, in terms of who's receiving vaccines, the upticks and potential, variants, non COVID electives, core utilization, et cetera. All that is being taken into consideration. If you look at some of our public filings, like in the individual business, you will see, that we are pricing in for these COVID impacts, I would say there's variation by geography, and there's variation by product line. So there is complexity to it, but I think we're being very prudent and again, we're going to price the forward trend and be disciplined about pricing going forward. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. RickyGoldwasser: Yes, hi, good morning. Two questions here. One on the MMM acquisition. Can you quantify for us the impact to the benefit for the second half of '21? And then Gail in your prepared remark you talked about myNEXUS about 900,000 of Anthem MA members on it. How long would take to deploy it across your entire MA book? What's the limiting factor there? And can you maybe quantify for us what would be the impact on medical cost? JohnGallina: Thank you, Ricky for those questions. First of all, I'll address the MMM, past year results for MMM when you look at it in our consolidated numbers, certainly weighed down by financing cost, integration costs. And also Puerto Rico has a higher tax rate on average than the rest of the US. And so all those things have been taken into consideration. And really, there's not a lot of accretion associated with that for 2021. It's really we expected to be much more meaningful in terms of its contribution in 2022. So as I had stated in the prior question, there's a lot of moving parts for the back half of '21, and a lot of integration and implementation cost. They've all been factored into our $25.50 guidance already. With that, I'll turn it back to Gail. GailBoudreaux: Yes, thanks. In terms of your question on myNEXUS, thank you. MyNEXUS, as I shared is really one of the critical elements of our strategy, both inside of Anthem and outside of Anthem. So you think about 2 million lives serve 900,000 inside of anthem, we've deployed it pretty extensively. But there is more opportunity. We're working through our integration plans clearly, as we grow. And some of the new opportunities, we see this as a critical opportunity for us to get care in the home and also have a digital integration. So I think that's really important. But also, it's part of our diversified business group strategy to sell to others, our Blue strategy and other clients that we work with extensively. So I see it both the opportunity to grow inside of Anthem, and that's something we know them well, we really liked the capabilities, obviously, we use 900 -- we have them against 900,000 members. So we see more opportunity there across our businesses, including our duals. And then secondarily, we think there's a really significant opportunity to grow that business outside of Anthem as well. So this one hits kind of both parts of our strategy. In terms of our cost of care, going to the home, virtual value based care, all of those are critical elements of our cost of care strategy. And so again, having a strong in home offering, I think, is a really important part particularly for the senior population. So we see this as having an important part of that piece of it. So thanks for the question. I think it's for us an important building block and an important piece of our overall strategy. Operator : For the last question, we'll go to the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. GeorgeHill: Hey, good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. I guess as it relates to Medicare Advantage and partnerships, you guys have relationships with Agilant and other kind of provider based organizations. I guess can you talk about the appetite to expand and grow those partnerships as a way to contain costs and ensure visibility? And what can -- and as you roll out those partnerships, and cover lives faster, can you talk about how that impacts how you run the MA business as you have better cost visibility? GailBoudreaux: Well, thanks for the question. I'll tell start. And then I'll ask Jeff Alter to provide a little more context. I mean, part of our strategy there is, and again, as we think of our value based relationships, working with dense providers in markets that we want to go much deeper in Medicare Advantage; we want to have stronger enablement for them to move up the risk quarter. And so we've picked partners that we think can help us do that, again, we are -- goal is to be extremely deep in the markets we serve. And so we see the capabilities there is really strong and also aligned, again, with the data that we shared, our HealthOS platform, so part of the partnership is not just to do a contracting relationship, but it truly is to integrate with our data, our systems connected to our consumer facing capabilities, and then have the capabilities that we've built, whether it's myNEXUS or other things, help support them and hitting their overall cost goal. So I think it's an important piece and component of our value based strategy. And we see, again, our opportunity to get deeper and grow with these partners is actually a really compelling value proposition for that. So, Jeff, I don't know if you want to make any additional comments about that. JeffAlter: Maybe I'll just say that, we believe it is the best way to effectively build a strong value base network for our Medicare partners, and have the ability to bring that data into the Agilant and the [Indiscernible] in the S3, so the world and then have them distribute that down into their network. So that we do this in a one to one to one to many, as opposed to Anthem having to connect to 1000s of smaller primary care practices. This enables our strategy in a much more efficient and expeditious way. Gail Boudreaux : So thank you for that question. And I'd like to thank all of you for joining us for this morning's call. As you can see, Anthem has shown solid growth throughout this pandemic. While we continue to provide critical support and resources to our communities as we combat the pandemic together. Our performance in the second quarter gives us confidence in our ability to capitalize on future growth prospects and deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. Our success would not be possible, however, without the hard work and dedication of our more than 87,000 associates, who truly exemplify our mission, vision and values. And I want to thank each and every one of them for everything they do each and every day. Thank you all for your interest as well in Anthem, and I look forward to speaking with you in the future.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session where participants are encouraged to present a single question. [Operator instructions]. These instructions will be repeated prior to the question-and-answer portion of this call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Company's management. Please go ahead. Stephen Tanal : Good morning. And welcome to Anthem 's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. This is Steve Tanal, Vice President of Investor Relation. And with us this morning on the earnings call are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO, John Gallina, our CFO, Peter Haytaian, President of our Diversified Business Group, IngenioRx, Morgan Kendrick, President of our Commercial and Specialty Business Division, and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division. Gail will begin the call with a brief discussion of the quarter, recent progress against our strategic initiatives, and close on Anthem 's commitment to its mission. John will then discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we'll reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, antheminc.com.  We'll also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks Steve, and good morning everyone. We're pleased to talk with you about another strong quarter. This morning, we reported third quarter GAAP earnings per share of $6.13, and adjusted earnings per share of $6.79. Ahead of expectations, despite another surge in COVID that created challenges throughout the country, once again, Anthem continues to deliver on stakeholder commitments, accelerate growth in every core benefits business, and make considerable progress towards our long-term strategy to transform from a health benefits company to a lifetime trusted partner in health. Addressing the whole person is essential to becoming a trusted lifetime partner in health.  Responding to the pandemic has allowed us to instill new agility and innovation into the business, particularly around solutions for physical health, pharmacy, behavioral and social needs, with an emphasis on maternal health, access to nutritious food, and health disparities. Ultimately, we believe we're only as healthy as the communities we live in, and recognize our important role in ensuring everyone has an opportunity to be and stay healthy. As the healthcare paradigm shift, we're accelerating work to simplify members' and clients' every day experiences, and meet their evolving needs to a personalized experience. Moreover, there's abundant opportunity to modernize further and reinforce our position, leveraging our technology, predictive analytics, and innovative products and services to bring an enhanced experience only Anthem can offer. We expect whole-person healthcare, powered by digital technology to help us achieve our goal of driving commercial medical cost trend down towards the rate of TPI by 2025. Currently, we're exploring more ways to drive differentiated value across medical and pharmacy. Our insight-driven approach is fueling new programs that drive better cost and quality outcomes for our members, including in the areas of behavioral health and autoimmune disease. Additionally, we recently launched a new offering to test the full suite of our capability in the form of a virtual primary care first product, which we expect to demonstrate meaningful reduction in overall cost of care, and greater member satisfaction. We are already selling virtual-first risk-based commercial plans in certain markets across each of Anthem's 14 blue states for the 2022 plan year, featuring simplified plan designs, 24 by 7 service, and leveraging our high performing network that enable affordable price points.  We've also seen strong interest in these capabilities from our fee-based clients, and will be embedding virtual primary care with several large fee-based clients throughout 2022. At the same time, innovative product offerings like Sydney Preferred, which allows employers to customize a digital first health care experience for their employees are gaining considerable momentum. To date, more than 50 national accounts have signed up for Sydney Preferred, representing nearly 900,000 commercial members. To help accelerate our digital platform, we've elevated Rajeev Ronanki to President of Digital Platform. Rajeev will drive the commercialization of our digital capabilities for consumers and care providers, as we re-imagine the health ecosystem.  Then we'll share notable third quarter highlights and business driving initiatives for the balance of fiscal 2021, starting with our Medicaid business which is performing well. Our Healthy Blue plan in partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina has quickly become the largest Medicaid managed care plan by membership in North Carolina and the leading choice for consumers. Its success, coupled with the ongoing suspension of eligibility redetermination, drove Anthem's total Medicaid membership, above 10 million at quarter-end, exceeding our internal expectations. Our commitment to members and their community has never been stronger. And we continue to develop innovative solutions to meet their unique holistic health needs. As a result, our focus on reducing health disparities and inequities remains vital to the value Anthem offers day partners. This is reflected in our momentum along with our 100% RFP win rate year-to-date. Looking further ahead, Anthem will launch another new statewide Medicaid managed care contract in Ohio in the summer of 2022. After earning the City of New York 's Group Medicare Advantage contract last quarter, we added several new group MA customers in the third quarter for January 1st, 2022 start dates, and having growing pipelines of new prospects. As part of our strategy to deepen our Medicare Advantage market penetration, we remain focused on converting commercial age-outs to MA relationship, and preparing for a flawless January launch of our Group Medicare Advantage plan for New York City's retiree. Customized solutions at scale underpin our approach to individual Medicare Advantage benefit for 2022.  Many of our MA plans will allow customers to choose what's best for them from a menu of innovative Whole Health benefits. For example, in some areas, the program will include a Kroger grocery card, generous over-the-counter benefits, and up to 60 hours of in-home support to assist with light housekeeping, errand, and companionship. We expect these and other benefit enhancements to help drive another year of double-digit growth in our individual Medicare Advantage membership next year. Medicare star ratings continue to be a focused area across Anthem. And the ratings released 2 weeks ago show we've made solid progress. We're particularly proud. Health Fund received a five-star rating for the fifth consecutive year.  The only Medicare Advantage health plan in Florida to accomplish such an achievement. For the 2023 payment year, we anticipate approximately 73% of members in plans that CMS rated as 4-plus stars up from 58% on a comparable basis a year ago. That figure will move even higher with the City of New York 's Group Medicare Advantage contract launch next year. At the same time, investments in provider partnerships are accelerating Anthem's evolution towards high quality, value-based care. This is necessary to drive improved outcomes and cost of care across all of our benefits businesses, and is critical in Medicare Advantage where they are impacts reimbursement through star ratings.  This year, more than 60% of our Medicare Advantage spending will be in risk-sharing arrangements. Based on our current contracts, we expect that to increase to more than 70% in 2022 with approximately 30% of Medicare Advantage spending in fully capitated risk arrangements. Investments in our primary care partnerships in particular will support members and drive growth through the expansion of value-based care leading to an even larger proportion of our members and 4-plus star contracts over time. We recognize there's still more work to do, and we'll continue our efforts to raise customer satisfaction by aligning incentives with care providers to improve quality and medication adherence, while simultaneously enhancing our member experience, accelerating our use of data and analytics, and leveraging IngenioRx as our pharmacy benefit manager.  Lastly, a few highlights of the strong growth we see in our commercial business. We're nearing the end of the most robust national account selling season in Anthem's history. Volume of RFPs was down, but averaged size was up considerably, and we want a disproportionate share of new business and expanded services with our existing clients. IngenioRx is also showing exciting growth, with more than fivefold increase in new sales at this point in the selling season, compared to the relatively depressed base a year ago when the pandemic weighed heavily on employer decision-making. The consistent theme across all of our businesses is that each continues to produce strong organic growth.  This droves medical enrolment to more than 45 million U.S. consumers, strengthening Anthem's position as the largest health insurer in America by membership. I'm pleased with the progress we're making towards delivering our strategy, and want to share two recent leadership changes to accelerate our efforts. Pete Haytaian will lead our Diversified Business Group and IngenioRx, both of which are critical components of our growth strategy. Pete has an impressive track record of growth and innovation in his previous roles, leading Anthem's commercial and government businesses. With Pete 's transition, we're confident our commercial and specialty business division will maintain its strong momentum under leadership of Morgan Kendrick, who has driven market-leading growth across critical lines of our commercial business, including national accounts and most recently, as President of Anthem's commercial west markets, our largest region. The breadth and depth of our collective leadership ensures we stand ready to deliver on our promises to stakeholders across all areas of our business and will guide Anthem to long-term sustainable growth. It's a privilege to work alongside such a strong group of leaders committed to advancing our purpose and mission. In summary, our actions and the focus and discipline we've brought to the business have positioned Anthem for the next several years of growth. Our strategy to extend our role from a partner in health benefit to a lifetime trusted partner in health is resonating in the marketplace, as evidenced by our growth. Our response to COVID brings a new level of agility and speed to the business, along with more opportunities to reach consumers and care providers than ever before.  And we continue to simplify and personalize our member relationships with relevant benefits and enhanced innovative experiences. where and when they want. With that, I will turn the call over to John to discuss our financial results in more detail. John Gallina : Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $6.79, an increase of approximately 62% year-over-year, driven by strong growth across all of our businesses. This growth was a result of focused execution against our strategic priorities despite a challenging backdrop created by another surge in COVID. Our third quarter results once again, demonstrate the balance and resilience of our core benefit businesses, and the strong growth momentum we are producing across the board. We ended the quarter with 45.1 million members, growth of 2.4 million lives year-over-year, or 5.7%, including growth of 730,000 during the quarter, led by the successful launch of our Healthy Blue Medicaid plan in North Carolina. In addition to the 426,000 members gained in that state, we produced incremental organic growth of nearly 380,000 members during the quarter, driven by strong growth on our Medicaid and commercial risk-based businesses. This growth was partially offset by continued in-group attrition in our group fee-based business, consistent with our expectations. Operating revenue in the third quarter was $35.5 billion, an increase of 16% versus prior-year quarter, and nearly 18% on a HIF adjusted basis. The increase was driven by higher premium revenue associated with strong membership growth in our Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial risk businesses, as well as rate increases to cover cost trends, and ongoing momentum in our diversified service businesses, including in IngenioRx.  The benefit expense ratio for the third quarter was 87.7%, an increase of 90 basis points compared to the prior-year quarter, driven by the repeal of the health insurance tax in 2021. Excluding the impact of the HIF, our medical loss ratio would have decreased by approximately 50 basis points, driven by an unfavorable rate adjustment in our Medicaid business in the third quarter of 2020. All in, the cost of care was above what we would consider to be normalized or baseline levels in the third quarter of this year, driven by higher COVID cost in the month of August and September. But medical costs were nonetheless better than we had expected for the quarter overall, With lower non COVID utilization helping absorb the higher-than-expected COVID related cost. Our third quarter SG&A ratio was 11.1%, a decrease of 620 basis points from the 17.3% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to charges we took last year related to business optimization and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association litigation settlement.  Excluding charges from the base year, and the impact of the repeal of the health insurance tax, our SG&A ratio would have decreased by approximately 130 basis points, driven by leverage associated with growth and operating revenues. Partially offset by higher spending to support our growth and our transition to becoming a digital enterprise for health. Operating cash flow during the quarter was $2.5 billion- or 1.7-times net income. Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 38.9%, down approximately 100 basis points from the 39.9% as of the end of the second quarter. The decrease was driven by growth in shareholders equity associated with our earnings in the quarter and a reduction in commercial paper outstanding.  We continue to maintain a prudent posture with respect to reserves, given the ongoing uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in lengthening in cycle times that we have seen since the pandemic began. We ended the third quarter with 46.8 days in claims payable, a decrease of 1.3 days compared to the second quarter, and an increase of 5.7 days as compared to the prior year quarter. The timing of our acquisition of MMM inflated days and claims payable in the second quarter, and drove the sequential change. Excluding timing-related impacts associated with the acquisition, our days and claims payable would've increased by 0.2 days sequentially. Given strong performance year-to-date, we are raising our guidance for full-year adjusted earnings per share to greater than $25.85 from greater than $25.50, putting us at the high-end of our long-term annual adjusted earnings per share growth target of 12% to 15%.  Please note that this guidance continues to reflect the total COVID and non - COVID costs combined, exceeding baseline in every month of the fourth quarter and assumes a similar overall net headwind from COVID for the year relative to our prior guidance. Given significant outperformance in the third quarter on our investment income line, we have increased our full-year outlook for investment income by $100 million to approximately $1.2 billion, which is 260 million above our initial outlook of $940 million. Much of the outperformance in this area stems from stellar results in our alternative investment portfolio year-to-date that we would not expect to recur. Accordingly, we believe that there is at least $200 million of non-recurring upside in the investment income line that should be removed when assessing the appropriate base for earnings growth for 2022, equating to approximately $0.65 of earnings per share in 2021 and implying a baseline for growth entering 2022 of $25.20. Most importantly, our businesses are performing well with strong growth momentum that we expect we'll carry into 2022. Although we will not provide specific guidance for next year on this call, I would now like to shift focus to the tailwinds and headwinds that we are considering into next year starting with the tailwinds. Recall that our 2021 guidance continues to embed a significant net headwind related to the effects of COVID.  While it is too early to declare how much of the overall net headwind, we will be able to earn back in 2022, we do believe that we will recover a portion of it resulting in a year-over-year tailwind. Based on our strong competitive positioning, we expect another year of double-digit membership growth in our individual Medicare Advantage membership. We also expect strong growth in our Commercial membership, aided by what is shaping up to be the strongest national account selling season in the history of the company. We expect accretion from the annualization of earnings of our acquisitions of MMM and myNEXUS. And we expect an EPS lift from our share repurchase program, which was opportunistic during recent periods of volatility in our stock price. Our tailwinds will be weighed against known headwinds and these include the dilution associated with the first year of operations of our new Group Medicare Advantage contract serving New York City's retirees, which we continue to expect will launch on January 1st, as well as dilution related to the startup and launch of our new Medicaid contract in Ohio, which we expect to begin on July 1st, 2022.  In addition, the resumption of Medicaid eligibility re-determinations, assuming a return to a more normal operating environment, and finally, the non-recurrence of the upside in the investment income line this year that I had described earlier. Based on what we know today, we believe our tailwinds will largely offset our headwind, enabling us to reaffirm our commitment to growth and adjusted earnings per share of at least 12% in 2022 after adjusting for the portion of investment income that we have identified is non-recurring. We look forward to providing more specific guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call when we will discuss our 2022 outlook in more detail. In closing, we continue to execute against our strategic growth priorities, and are pleased to have delivered another quarter of strong growth and continued reinvestment in our business, all while maintaining a solid balance sheet given the ongoing uncertainties associated with the pandemic. And with that, Operator, please open the line to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Once again, we ask that each participant limit themselves to a single question to allow ample time to respond to each participant that may wish to participate in this portion of the call. For our first question, we will go to the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice : Thanks. Hi, everybody. I appreciate the headwinds and tailwinds for next year that you're offering. I guess when you look at those items that you've delineated, a lot of them look like they're pretty well set at this point. What would be the ones where there is the greatest potential variability? I'm assuming the COVID related issue. How much of that you get back next year is probably one, but can you comment on that? Where there's the greatest variability among those items? John Gallina : Good morning A.J. and thank you for the question. Associated with the headwinds and tailwinds, of course, we do want to look at them in their entirety but we should think about the potential variability, COVID has the absolute most uncertainty of any line item on there. I mean it's been an incredible situation that we've been through as a country since March of 2020 and COVID continues to have uncertainty associated with it. The New York group retiree business are still going through their enrollment process so we don't have the absolute exact number of lives lined up at this point in time. And so there's some variability there. But you are correct. We do have some pretty good line of sight on most of the rest of them. But COVID is clearly the lion's share of uncertainty at this point. Gail Boudreaux : AJ, I'd add to John 's response that one of the things that we do feel very good about is the underlying strength and the core of our -- all of our benefits businesses. Our growth's been strong, and I think we've been performing very well in line with the expectations we set. So next question, please. Thanks for the question. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to clarify something then a question. The clarification is just wanted to make sure, John, you were talking about 12% growth, and then you talked about that off at $25.20 jump-off point. So that's number 1, and then just the question is on cost trend, looks like the Government margins were materially stronger than commercial in the quarter. So you gave some overall posturing commentary, but was hoping you could give us some trend breakdown between commercial Medicaid and Medicare, how that performed in the quarter versus that slightly above normal overall discussion you had. Thanks. John Gallina : Yes. Thanks Justin, I appreciate the question. In terms of the jump off point for 2022, you are correct. We've quantified our investment income, outperformance for the year. We believe that there is at least $200 million that's unlikely to recur. And so that $200 million equates to approximately $0.65 of earnings per share. And then you take that off of our updated guidance, and we believe the appropriate jump off point for 2022 growth is $25.20. So appreciate the opportunity to clarify that.  Associated with the various lines of business, the commercial profitability, they're still very, very good. However, commercial had the surge of COVID in August and September was really more significantly pronounced within the commercial line of business than it was in the other two lines of business. We took the opportunity to reserve prudently within the commercial line for that spike and to build commercial reserves as a result of what we're seeing at that point in time. Fortunately, non - COVID came in much lower in September across all lines business, which allowed our quarter to come out in a really, really good place. Medicare was very much consistent with expectations.  Medicaid was actually a little bit better than expectations for the quarter. And just as a reminder, we had guided to be above baseline costs for COVID and non - COVID combined for each of the 3 months in the third quarter and we were. We were just ended up being better than our expectations. But the commercial issue was really had to do with the spike in August associated with COVID. Thank you for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Lance Wilkes : Yeah, thanks a lot. Could you talk a little bit about the strategy and vision for Diversified and Ingenio, with Pete moving into that role? And maybe as part of that, talking a little bit about the pipeline of opportunities in the Diversified and Ingenio book, as well as selling government services and other Blues. Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the multitude of questions I'll ask Pete in his new role to respond to Lance. Peter Haytaian : Thanks, Lance. No, I really appreciate it. I'll -- I think I'll touch on the growth associated with Ingenio first, and then reference Diversified Business Group. And I do want to thank Gail and the team for putting me in this position. I do think I'm in a unique position having non-Government and Commercial have a perspective on this. And I think working collectively as an enterprise, we can do very well in penetrating the Anthem portfolio to a much greater degree.  But as it relates to your question on Ingenio and growth in Ingenio, we worked very closely with the commercial business. And as we talked about before, the greatest opportunity for us is penetrating the self-funded business. I'd say that activity for us has really picked up this year relative to last year. We're seeing really nice success plans down market. on the smaller side of the business and the middle market. So we're definitely seeing more activity there and we're also seeing a lot more wins from that perspective.  And as we've talked about, that's really a sweet spot from a financial and profitability perspective, whereas that's a really good position for us to be in on the larger end of the market with some of the jumbo accounts. We are also seeing activity pick up as it relates to pharmacy. But it is a competitive space and we see the power of incumbency being a little more significant and a factor there. So heading into 2022, as it relates to Ingenio, we feel really good about our growth trajectory and our performance and net membership growth will be improved relative to what we've seen in 2021. As it relates to the Diversified Business group and our strategies and then I'll also talk strategically about Ingenio a bit, I'm really excited about where we are. If you think about where the puck is going in healthcare, you think about the significance of specialty pharmacy. You heard Gail talk earlier about virtual and the opportunities for virtual even in pharmacy. There's tremendous opportunity for that business to continue to grow. We're at the beginning of the evolution of, I think, that pharmacy business and there's a great opportunity there for us and to penetrate the Anthem business.  And then as it relates to the DBG portfolio, if you think about the verticals that we talked about at Investor Day and the opportunity there, a tremendous opportunity. So you think about behavioral health and the opportunities there with Beacon as a leading asset in the space, and we think there's tremendous opportunity to grow that business and diversify that business. When you think about side of care and redirection, it becomes hugely important as it relates to the Commercial business and cost of care when you think about assets like AIM and myNEXUS, a recent transaction where we're seeing tremendous success. And then you think about managing the chronically ill and the great assets we have there around CareMore and Aspire. I would say this, Lance, that my -- and I've only been on the job for about a week-and-a-half, so I don't want to be too presumptuous here, but the opportunity to penetrate Anthem is very significant across our entire portfolio : Medicare, Medicaid, and Commercial, but I also think there's tremendous external opportunities. So I look forward to leading us and working with my colleagues, Felicia and Morgan on growing the business together. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Pete, and thanks for the question, Lance. I think to sum up what Pete has shared; this really is part of our ongoing journey and evolution in Anthem that we shared with you at our Investor Day. It really is part of our transformation from a health benefits company to truly a trusted lifetime partner in health and we see significant opportunities. And I think this shows the maturing of the strategy we shared. So thanks for the question and next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Matthew Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Matthew Borsch : Thank you. Hoping you could comment on the aftermath of the Blue settlement, particularly as it relates to how you see competition among the Blues and your role with that changing, maybe intensifying as we go into next year and after. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Matt, thanks for the question. We are still in the midst of that litigation and the settlement is ongoing, so I won't comment. I think it's inappropriate to comment at this time. But given the tone of your question, I think it's really important, and we've had a long history, quite frankly, up partnering with Blue in addition to working with them on accounts that are in our service areas, part of the seeding process. And so, we expect that to continue, expect, obviously, to offer the capabilities that we have.  Pete just shared with you what we're doing with IngenioRx. We also think our diversified business capabilities are going to be incredibly important. Some of our Digital Platform capabilities that we've also offered to other Blues. So I can't really comment on where we are in terms of that litigation because it's not finally settled yet, but we feel that there's a significant amount of opportunities for us even outside of this settlement to worked with Blue partners across the country. Thanks to question and next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe : Great, thanks. Good morning. I guess I just want to go to membership. ASO dipped and you cited some of the economic backdrop, but commercial risk was up nicely sequentially. So is there some shift between the two? Or maybe just any thoughts around those dynamics. And then one thing specifically around individual enrollment as well are pretty nicely sequentially. And, John, to your comments around higher COVID costs, was there any disproportionate pressure on the exchanges specifically that sort of weighed on margins in the segment? And then just hoping you could talk about your positioning on the exchanges for 2022 and expectations for growth there. Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Ralph, thanks for the question. I'm going to ask Morgan Kendrick, who's leading our Commercial businesses also, they've been intimately involved in these, to respond to your questions. Please, Morgan. Morgan Kendrick : Thanks, Gail. And Ralph, thanks for the question. There was a lot there. And when you talk about your comments about the reductions in the large group business, that's certainly in line with our expectations. We were expecting reduction in our fee-based business. We've had, as you indicated, noted, nice growth on the risk-based business across the segment. Individual, as you've noted, has benefited from a long extending special enrollment period. So we've seen year-over -- month-over-month growth there. Also, when you look at our large group, small group business, we've seen month-over-month growth in sales exceeding lapses. And notably, our large group businesses performed quite well. In fact, 23 of the last 25 quarters, our sales have exceeded lapses. Looking forward into the new year, clearly, it's a competitive geography and competitive market when you look at individuals and HDA. It's one of those that I would characterize it as rational nonetheless. And one that we've -- not inconsistent with our strategies in the past, we take a very disciplined approach. We look at this market-by-market, county-by-county. Morgan Kendrick : And in fact, as we expand next year for 2022, we're going to be at 83% of the counties that we can serve. That's up from 71% from the prior year. And this is most notably done by leveraging our unique provider partnerships, leveraging the scale and density we have in our geographies to provide value for the market. Again, the strategy is not a shortsighted one and we're confident the pricing is appropriate on our modeling of our forward trends. So thank you again for the question. Gail Boudreaux : And one last thing, Ralph. You asked the question about anything distinctive about the individual relative to COVID, and I would say no. I mean, our individual business has performed in line. So across the board, we saw -- as John shared, higher COVID spikes in commercial -- individual is not unique or distinct that we feel that we're appropriately positioned in that market. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gil from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gilson : Thanks very much, and good morning. I just wanted to go back out to your thoughts on the virtual primary care offering. One, can you talk about how that product will be priced? And then secondly, If they are going to be an all 14 of your markets, or will this be more of a limited type of offering initially? And then lastly, as I think about virtual primary care, how do we think about the cost trends there and the potential savings when we think about those types of products. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, Lisa. I think it's actually a really important one as we think about the next-generation of where products are going to go. One of the things that's happened is the pandemic has really highlighted the need for these virtual care services. We shared with you quite some time ago, our JV with Hydrogen Health, and we've been in the market actually working closely with our partners to deliver those services, particularly best-in-class urgent and care, primary care, using chat and texting. What we're talking about now is, I'll call it the next-generation of virtual primary care.  We've gotten some experience in our early entree with virtual care over the last year, and now we're continuing to evolve that. So we did launch as I shared in my remarks, this virtual first services. Think what's interesting and unique about this is they're integrated with our high-performance network, and that's really important. And we're seeing a lot of traction in our high-performance network. And I know we've shared previously, our high -performance network has anywhere from 12% to 15% cost structure differential. And as you think about virtual primary care added to that, we expect those to be the starting point of what we can gain traction on.  So I'm really encouraged by this initial launch. We can -- we're going to continue to, I think, innovate and evolve from that. In terms of where we are doing it, we are working in our Blue states. We're in most of our markets right now. We have offerings not in every county, but we're going to continue to expand that as we certainly learn about it, look at the alignment. A lot of this does, as I said, rely on our high-performing networks and our ability to use both virtual care as well as our high -performing network. And just to give you a sense of what it is, I mean, we're looking at the offerings to cover virtual visits with the $0 copay simplified plan designs, 24 by 7 service to leverage the network. Value-based contracts are at the core of this to drive that cost structure differential. And again, we would expect at least 15% below traditional products. But again, that's a starting point. We're going to gain experience with this. And there's been a lot of interest. We've seen a significant amount of interest. We've offered it first in our fully insured risk-based business and now our national fee accounts are interested in embedding this in their offerings. And as you heard, I think from my opening comments and then what Morgan said, we've had one of our strongest ever national account-selling seasons. And again, I do credit the innovation we're bringing around digital to the success we're having there, and just a fundamentally strong differentiated cost structure really driven by high -performance networks. But thanks for the question. We are -- we're excited and optimistic about how we think that this can drive future trend and future opportunities for our clients. So again, more to come on this, but you'll be hearing a lot more about it in the coming months as we gain more traction with our employers. So thanks for the question. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Gary Taylor from Cowen. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. Can you hear me? Gail Boudreaux : We can. Thank you. Gary Taylor : Okay, sorry. As I was thinking about 2022, I wanted to ask about something I thought would be a tailwind and something I thought would be a headwind but you didn't mention, so just some color would be helpful. Was thinking that the special enrollment period on exchanges, if that were to eventually go away, would potentially be a tailwind for that business, but you said you're performing in line there, so maybe don't see that as material tailwind, and then on the Medicaid side of the house, you did mention redeterminations as a headwind, but we certainly note for you and across the board, that seems to be a population that's not just vaccine hesitant but utilization hesitant and the MLR s look really strong there. So I was thinking there could be headwind, not just on redetermination, but on margin as well. So just wanted some color on those two things. John Gallina : Yes, sure, Gary. Thank you for the question. So let me see if I can address these appropriately. With the special enrollment period and the exchanges, we have talked about the fact that exchanges are a nice strategy of ours. We're being very, very prudent in terms of our approach. We're going from having I think just a little bit over 70% of our counties covered, just over 80% of our counties covered next year. And we do expect some nice membership growth associated with the individual. But I would say that is all captured in just our core underlying growth in the fundamentals of the business performing extremely well.  We expect all of our businesses to grow, and the individual is no different. In terms of the Medicaid in the redeterminations, the headwind that we referenced really has to do with Medicaid membership, but this is my opportunity to again talk about the balance and resilience of our membership and our catcher's mitt. And we may be able to turn that headwind into a tailwind depending on where those folks go. We do believe that once redeterminations start, that we will be able to maintain a significant amount of that membership within an Anthem product. We offer a product for every American in every situation, young, old, rich, poor, sick, healthy. We have a product for all of them.  And right now, there is a significant number of members within our Medicaid plans. And after redetermination occurs, Medicaid may shrink a little bit, but that means that there's really some significant growth opportunities in other lines of business. I didn't spike it out specifically because we think it's a driver and we could actually turn a headwind into a tailwind. Thank you for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Steven Baxter from Wells Fargo Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Yeah. Hi. Thanks. You touched on this a little bit, but was hoping you could expand on the national account outlook for next year. We'd love to hear more about what you think is driving that growth and what you're seeing in terms of competitive dynamics in that market. And then just to clarify, was that commentary influenced at all by what insight you're getting from your clients about in - group expectations or that's purely a comment about the new accounts that you wanted? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : I'll ask Morgan to address that. Morgan Kendrick : Yes, Steve, thank you for the question. And as Gail noted, the national business continues to perform exceptionally well, and also noted there was a bit of a dampening in the RFP activity, it was down. But when you think about it, it was down in numbers of the -- of RFP s, it was up in membership, and Anthem had an exceptionally successful year Morgan Kendrick : Up-market did quite well. I think one of the other things that was notably observed is a record number of customers that went out for a -- that went from a multi-partner healthcare solution to a single partner healthcare solution in selected Anthem. And to get directly to your question, to me, we have to earn the right to win every day. And I think when you -- so look at our assets and how they are resonating in the market, you look at the advocacy-based Whole Health digital solutions are winning. Morgan Kendrick : When you think about Sydney, Gail mentioned earlier that we have 50 customers that were Sydney Preferred, which is theoretically our digital front door or we could call it our gateway to help. It's the entry point for all the other assets that we deliver. Also, when we think about 23, I mean, these assets continue to be innovated upon, and like I said, it's incumbent upon us to earn this right to when, we don't take it lightly. But the market is loudly voting with their feet and -- so we're excited about where we're headed in '23. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Rob Cottrell from Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Rob Cottrell : Hi, good morning. Wanted to ask about, Gail, you mentioned behavioral briefly. Curious if you can provide a little bit more comment on the Beacon cross-selling efforts and how that's going across both the government and commercial businesses? Gail Boudreaux : Great. Thank you. I'll offer a quick comment and then I'll ask Pete to to comment on that because it fits within our Diversified Business Group. But overall, we know that there has been significant need for behavioral health. And what I want to just touch on briefly is the tight that Morgan said to Whole Health. And we -- Beacon has always been a very strong player in the Medicaid space. And we're continuing to integrate it into our overall government business, but it's got a big upside in the commercial space. And maybe, Pete, some early commentary from what you're saying. Peter Haytaian : No, I appreciate, Ralph. Just to remind everybody, Beacon serves about 44 million members, 13 million of which is Anthem. The services are very broad, and as I said, Beacon 's an industry-leading asset, it's been a leader in the behavioral health space for a long time. So as it relates to some of the services from mild, moderate, to acute mental health, treatment for family support, crisis prevention, opioid abuse, FMI, EAP programs, it's a broad portfolio, which really will serve, I think, Anthem really well. The other thing I'll say, and this was very important to us and it really worked out from a strategic perspective. But the pandemic obviously really accentuated the need for behavioral health. We experienced three times more people reporting symptoms of anxiety and depression in this period, 2.5 times more people reporting suicidal ideation, and with opioid abuse, there was a very significant increase. And so that plays really well across our portfolio. We obviously have a broad portfolio across Medicare, Medicaid, and Commercial. The integration process is going really well between the parties. We actually, as it relates to penetrating, the Anthem business have embraced a lot of the clinical programs and expertise of Beacon as we integrate. We also, in my old life on the commercial side, we worked on new product offerings. A product called Behavioral Health Advantage which is being deployed in 2022. And then obviously, as it relates to our government program business working very closely with Felicia and the government team -- and the Medicare team on a post-acute care product, and this is just the beginning. I think there will continue to be tremendous opportunities around behavioral. One of the areas that I'm very focused on is also virtual, and the importance of virtual. We've seen an exponential increase in virtual services as it relates to Beacon and penetrating our portfolio in that regard, will become very important going forward. I appreciate the question. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks, Pete and the only thing, I guess I would add is you think about the commercial markets, that next-generation of EAP services in area that we are highly focused on. And you've heard us share our strategy about sub-segment market within the commercial business. So we see it clearly in the employer space expansion student space to military services space where we see the demand and need for behavioral health services dramatically increasing as a result of the pandemic. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley Please go ahead. Ricky Goldwasser : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Question on utilization. John, you talked about the fact that September you saw a dip in non - COVID utilization. How is it trending in October? And if I recall last quarter, you said that the MLR guidance did low-end of the range assumes that I think going to end the year above baseline. So how are we trending there? And then in line with that, if we think about 2022 your commercial pricing, what did you embed in your assumptions regarding return of core utilization? John Gallina : Thank you for the question Ricky. And maybe I'll talk a little bit about the fourth quarter and then turn it over to Morgan to talk a little bit more about 2022. But in terms of the fourth quarter, our expectations and our guidance are that the COVID and non COVID combined will continue to be above baseline each month in the fourth quarter. So obviously the entirety of the fourth quarter being above baseline. We are seeing very good trends, as I stated we had the spike in August, it started to decline coming into September, non COVID utilization was lower in September than we had expected. October is relatively close to expectations at this point, but there's a lot of uncertainties in the fourth quarter.  The Delta variant is still out there, and we want to be very respectful for it, as well as any other new variants that may or may not exist. And we are expecting an increase in testing, an increase in some of the vaccinations and booster shots, especially with the kids. It's unclear right now exactly when the 5-year - old will be eligible for vaccination, but we want to make sure that we're cautious in terms of our guidance associated with that cost structure as well. And as you -- I'm sure you already know, the fourth quarter just on a normal basis has a higher seasonality in terms of MLR. And so, that's obviously factored in as well. But I'd say, at the end of the day, we've been very cautious and very prudent in our fourth quarter expectations with combination of COVID and non-COVID combined being above baseline. Morgan. Morgan Kendrick : Yeah, John, thank you. And, Ricky, thanks for the question. I would -- John covered most of it, I think. I would say, looking next year, it's not indifferent. We remain confident in the approach and our discipline. In consistent with what we've done quarter-over-quarter year-over-year, we're pricing to forward view of trend. Certainly, that's always respectful of market uncertainty. And as John indicated, COVID is going to be around for a while. We've done extensive work to assess various scenarios and how that could play out. But nonetheless, we feel quite confident that way we priced the '22 business. So thank you again for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please, go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. Just wanted to dig in a little bit into the redetermination headwind that you mentioned. Is there any way for you to kind of size how much memberships today you think you have due to redeterminations, how you're thinking about net losses, how much you might pick up on the exchanges in the commercial market. And then, as it relates to Medicaid rates, how you feel about Medicaid rates broadly, particularly again, with redeterminations coming in that can influence what rates are appropriate given the risk pool. So, those 3 aspects. John Gallina : Sure, Kevin. I'll see if I can start out and respond to your questions. But in terms of the redetermination, we're really taking a look at where we think these members are going to go and there's been a lot of other studies out there that we think are relatively credible. But we believe that by the end of next year, and that assumes that redeterminations do start to occur maybe late, early second quarter of 2022, that will still have a good 35% of those folks would still be maintained on the Medicaid rolls. We're looking at about 45% of them going back into employer-sponsored plans, and that would take the -- about 20% being eligible for subsidized coverage on exchanges.  And as I stated, we have products and all those things, and we expect to keep and maintain our fair share. So we feel very good about our opportunity and our ability to keep the membership within an -- the Anthem family over the course of next year. And then as it relates to the Medicaid pricing, we learned a lot a few years ago in terms of working with states being very proactive and ensuring that we're having actuarially - justified rates, and we'll certainly continue to do that. It's very early in the ratings season, but we're comfortable with what we're seeing to-date and building our financial plan with prudent assumptions that we believe are well supported. And the states are very -- say we're having some very productive conversations with the states as well about ensuring that we get actuarially - justified rates throughout the future. The only other thing I'll say about the Medicaid is there are a lot of financial measures that are in place now that -- far more than used to be in place in terms of collars, corridors, and things like that. That -- it really helped maintain the profitability and maintain the stability of that marketplace. So really need to look at Medicaid over a long period of time. Thank you, Kevin. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of David Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Windley : Hi, thanks. Thanks for taking my question. My question is about kind of your strategic investment preference. Gail, you've emphasized that for Anthem, your preferences to partner rather than own your provider networks. I'm wondering if you could shine maybe a brighter light on how your investments in behavioral and digital and some of the other areas that you've mentioned kind of accelerate your strategy and driving a better return for Anthem than the possibility of owning and controlling some of your key providers. Just I'm sure that those others are higher return, but in what way are they for Anthem? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, David. A couple of things, I think you hit on many of the core drivers. First and foremost, as we've said, because of the density that we have in our markets, we believe that investing in partnerships makes the most sense because we believe we can drive better membership, better stars ratings, and with 1 out of 8 patients being an Anthem member, the density of working with those providers provides us a good return. And also remember, we can participate in the profit stream s there by embedding some of our DBG assets, or our other assets around Interior and so, it's not that we're walking away from participating in those profit streams. We actually think we have a much more capitally efficient use by investing, partnering, and then pulling through the other assets that we have invested in. And so that's the core of our strategy and it worked really well and we're continuing to accelerate that strategy. And as I shared, we expect to have 70% in value-based arrangements, 30% in full capitated arrangements. It's a big driver for our Medicare Advantage business. Quite frankly, all of our benefits businesses are going to have an opportunity there. In terms of other areas that we're investing and we've said that we really want to transform ourselves and part of that transformation is building this digital platform for health. The opportunities are inside of Anthem as well as with our Blue partners and we see again opportunities to commercialize that.  That's going to be over the next several years, one of the reasons they elevated Rajeev Ronanki who has been leading this area, is to really explore those opportunities. Again, we've been doing that inside of the Anthem, but we think there's an opportunity with our partners to do more. Areas around Sydney, for example Sydney Health, which is gaining great traction, our Health OS, which we think could be a broader opportunity for the Health ecosystem. We've done quite a bit of investment in Stars and heat is quality improvement in AI and analytics, digital therapeutics. So there's a broad range of things around the digital capabilities and ecosystem we're building. But in terms of the value, again, we look at the most efficient way to deploy our capital, where we have our strength, which is the density in the markets we serve, and how it fills I think our strategy and then how we pull through Ingenio, DBG, and other services, which really are not -- those are still immature in the sense that we haven't pulled them through to the potential that they have and excited about Pete 's leadership there, given his understanding of both commercial and the government business and the opportunities that exist. But thanks for the question. Again, we think it's a really strong future growth opportunity for us. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Great. Thanks. Good morning. So I have another question on the lower than expected non - COVID utilization for the third quarter. I guess I was curious if you have any additional color by medical cost category, whether it's inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, etc. What I'm really curious about is specifically whether any cost category had a more notable falloff versus baseline when thinking about the sequential trends in 3Q versus the trend back in June quarter. Thanks. John Gallina : Thanks for your question, Steve. In terms of the specificity, I would say that what we saw in September was that inpatient non - COVID probably dropped the most of all of the different buckets that you stated. We don't view any of these things as being changing to the ultimate baseline. There were announcements that were made at the beginning of September that certain facilities were deferring or canceling some elective procedures in order to ensure that there is appropriate bed space. So while certainly we saw the impact on the financials, we do monitor pre-OSP research, various other things, and don't really view that situation as a significant change through the baseline going forward. But thank you for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to ask about the additional Group MA contracts that you called out that you've added in the 3Q for 2022. Any chance that you can maybe size the number of lives that you're expecting from those? And then just on the Group NYC contract implementation, I know you're still working on membership and things like that, but interested if you can maybe bring expense for loss, the dilution, you're thinking about for 2022 against that 12% EPS growth off the baseline you talked about. That will be helpful as well. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : I was going to ask Felicia to respond on your MA questions first and then we'll have John. Thank you. Felicia Norwood : Good morning, and thank you for the question. I'll say, Scott, that at the end of the day, the additional contracts that Gail referenced, we're certainly pleased with the opportunity to add those to our business for 1/1/22. They are not going to be material drivers of their own. But what they do is that they represent the ability for us to continue to penetrate that pipeline that we have with our Commercial customers. So as you know, our strategy has always been to be able to penetrate the inherent commercial pipeline that we have so that we're able to keep members Blue for life. And what we've done in terms of that third quarter is to have a very robust pipeline that gives us some very nice sized groups, certainly much smaller than anything you've seen around city of New York or anything else, but they are not going to be material drivers in bit, I would say, very closely with what we consider the sweet spot when we look at the opportunities to grow MA going forward.  We still consider this a very strategic asset for us in being able to grow that business as we go forward. Once again, we are very poised to deliver on the launch of the City of New York business for 1/1/22, and are certainly pleased with the opportunity to be able to continue to support New York retirees, who have been customers for Empire for a long period of time. So this is another, I would say, affirmation of our strategy around what we're doing with respect to group MA business. And additionally, the pipeline for this business remains strong as we head into 2023. And with that, I'll turn it over to John to talk about the dilution. John Gallina : Thank you, Felicia and Scott, I appreciate the question. Unfortunately, this is third quarter call and we're really not going to get into specificity associated with guidance for 2022. We'll talk in more detail about that at the next quarter. And as I said, New York's still going through their enrollment process, so we don't have all the information that quite fine-tuned, but what I would ask you to do is to really evaluate the tailwinds and the headwinds that I provided in their entirety. And then after you adjust for the out performance and investment income, we think that those headwinds and tailwinds pretty much offset each other and will allow us to achieve our 12 to 15% growth for the future. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Hey, good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. I guess this is probably going to be a 22 question as well, John, but I was wondering if you could claim any numbers around the success of Ingenio, given all the positive commentary. Can we just have any comments on how you guys are thinking about the opportunities with generics to [Indiscernible] and biosimilars in general? John Gallina : Yeah, thanks for that. Thanks for that question. As you referenced as it relates to Ingenio, we're really pleased with the performance. In large part, the performance this year was due to strong membership and volume across the entire portfolio, so all our lines of business. And utilization is also tracking to expectation. So we feel good about that heading into 2022, as well as the growth that I talked about and our focus on penetrating the ASO business. So we feel good about the Ingenio business heading into 2022, the growth and then the stability of the business in terms of its margin contribution. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go the line of Joshua Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Joshua Raskin : Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in here at the end. How do you think about the No Surprises Act around your strategy or network contracting and maybe potential changes in the balance of power between payers and providers and local markets? And specific to Anthem, do you think best cost position, biggest discounts, is that helpful or harmful as you think about the future? Gail Boudreaux : Well, thanks for the question, Josh. In terms of the overall, our past year, we have had a cost structure advantage in a cost structure advantage. But as you heard in my comment, given our market density, we are moving heavily towards value-based payment. I mean, that is at the core of our strategy. So that's an alignment of working with care providers in a much different way.  And again, we believe both the investments we're making in primary care, the investments we're making in downstream homecare, other things through our Diversified Business Group, IngenioRx that we have an opportunity to bring those assets together uniquely. And then, leverage the density, originally, in our Commercial business, but now our Medicaid business and our Medicare Advantage business, so we feel we've made really good strides on that and we actually see a better alignment with care providers than we've ever had in the past. So quite frankly, I'm optimistic about where we're heading, and I think that that really is the core of our strategy. So thank you for the question and next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Whit Mayo from SVB Leerink. Your line is open. Whit Mayo : Hey, thanks. Last year you guys in the industry waived a lot of co-insurance requirements, and just remind me what you're doing now, are you -- are we back to 2019 co-pay, co-insurance member requirements? Are we still waiving on MA for primary care? I guess really the question here is thinking through 2022 and any headwinds or tailwinds as we think about any changes and member cost sharing. Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks. Thank you for the question, Whit. Certainly during this heart of the pandemic, where non - COVID utilization dropped significantly, and we also wanted to be a very thoughtful participant in what was happening. We did a number of waiving of cost shares as you know, it was part of our response across all of our businesses. Gail Boudreaux : As we headed into 2021, those normal -- I'll call it normal course, came back into play mostly because non - COVID utilization returned back to normal levels in many instances in total and there weren\u2019t significant drops. So from that perspective, we're following the policies that we have across the board right now and then heading into 2022. Thanks for the question. Next question. Operator : And our final question will go to the line of Frank Morgan from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Frank Morgan : Good morning. There is a lot of suggestions about labor with providers, and I'm just curious, are you starting to have discussions when you start to negotiate with the providers about their wage inflation outlook they're seeing, and what is your sense of that? And then secondly, just any early initial insights into what might be resonating so far in the annual enrollment period. Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Yes, thanks for the double question. The first one around the labor market, clearly across all labor markets, people are seeing pressure on the ability to get employment levels up to where they need to, and then there is some pressure. In terms of our negotiated contract, we do those over three-year cycle and we're also very focused, again, on value-based payments. So I think the big opportunity is to move away from individual unit costs increases, which has been the historical, I guess, trend in the industry to really bundling value-based payment, paying for episodes and procedures.  And that's really where we've been. So at this stage, what I'd say is look, we're always in a dynamic environment in terms of our negotiation, but we feel we factored that into how we're looking at the forward view of everything that's going on, and we just see the biggest opportunity is not just only managing unit costs, but really managing value and part of the value-based payments because there is a much better alignment of taking -- doing the right services at the right time, and that's our view. But in terms of our forward review, again, we're taking into consideration everything. And again, many of our largest contracts are on a 3-year basis, so not all of them obviously are in play right now. Thanks for the question. I'm going to ask Felicia to talk a little bit about our annual enrollment period, which I think was your second question. Felicia Norwood : Yeah. Good morning, Frank, and thank you for the question. If you know, we're in the early days of the annual enrollment period, and we're actually very pleased with what we've seen so far with respect to how we are positioned competitively in terms of our benefits in the plans that we're offering, and feel that we'll be able to produce another year of double-digit growth in our individual Medicare products. I'll say we're especially pleased with our supplemental benefits, our over-the-counter offerings. These are the things we call our essential extras, everyday extras. We give members an opportunity to choose from a portfolio of benefits that allows them to address during these, particularly the social drivers of health. The other thing I will say is that we are also pleased with how we are positioned with respect to our [indiscernible] products, where we have a very strong value proposition considering our deep knowledge and experience between Medicare and Medicaid, and being able to serve chronic and complex populations. So when we think about where we are today, a little bit less than 5 days in, we feel good about our positioning and look forward to having a very successful AEP. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you Felicia, and thank you again for your interest in Anthem. As we close the call, I want to recognize our associates. This continues to be a challenging year, each day they step up and they step out to live our mission and values and serve our members and communities with care and compassion. I'm impressed and grateful for what they do all the time. We work hard to create a culture at Anthem where everyone feels valued and their contributions make a difference, so I'm particularly proud to see us recently named among America 's 100 great places to work, and healthiest 100 workplaces. I'll leave you with this.  There's increasing opportunity for Anthem to offer elevated personalized experiences as we holistically address what our society needs to be and stay healthy. We're building for tomorrow and beyond, evolving the business to be more digital, moving fast, thinking differently, and operating with discipline. Personally, I'm extremely optimistic for our future. Thank you.

Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to share Anthem once again delivered solid operating results in the fourth quarter, capping off another year of outstanding growth, as we transform with focus and discipline from a health benefits company to a lifetime trusted partner in health. I'll start by sharing performance highlights for the quarter and the year and follow with some key actions and investments that drove our growth and laid the groundwork for what we expect will be another year of strong operating performance in 2022. In the fourth quarter, Anthem delivered GAAP earnings per share of $4.63 and adjusted earnings per share of $5.14 ahead of expectations and against the backdrop of COVID-19. For the full year, Anthem reported GAAP earnings per share of $24.73 and adjusted earnings per share of $25.98, reflecting a 16% increase year-over-year. During 2021, our investments in enhancing the customer experience, delivering innovative, customized whole health solutions and deepening digital engagement helped to deliver strong growth across our health benefits businesses, all while rapidly scaling our diversified health services solutions. We ended the year with 45.4 million members, up 2.4 million or 6% year-over-year, with approximately 3/4 of those gains coming from organic growth. In our Commercial business, improved selling strategies and innovative customized product offerings sustained our momentum and led to the best ever selling season for our national accounts team. In addition, traction is accelerating as we address clients' unique needs in targeted subsegments such as balanced funding for midsized employers and customized plans and digital tools for college students. The flexible architecture of our Sydney Health mobile app enables seamless integration into clients' ecosystems, while helping deepen digital engagement with members in this fast-growing market. As a result, we anticipate delivering another year of growth in our Group and Individual businesses in 2022. For many employers, our focus on affordability and integrated whole health solutions is prompting consolidation with Anthem, eliminating other medical carriers and integrating pharmacy management. Consequently, IngenioRx saw significant growth in net new sales to start 2022, keeping us on track with our goal of narrowing the profitability gap of risk-based and fee-based Commercial customers. Moving to Medicare Advantage, our continuing work to strengthen Anthem's value proposition helped drive another strong annual election period. Customers want their benefits to meet their needs today and in the future, and packages like our everyday extras that offer holistic services such as transportation, personal home health, and healthy pre-prepared meal delivery are resonating because they provide the flexibility to choose what matters most to each individual. Offering flexible and personalized benefits will remain a key part of our approach in individual MA and we expect ongoing enhancements to power another year of double-digit growth in 2022. We also expect a substantial membership increase in group Medicare Advantage when our contracts serving the retirees of the City of New York begins on April 1st. This timing is consistent with the recent court ruling that upheld our contract and extended the open enrollment period for an additional three months. In Medicaid, our team did an outstanding job in 2021 demonstrating the differentiated value we offer states built on our deep understanding of the needs of their communities. Our rich legacy of investing in community health uniquely positions us to address health disparities with solutions that extend beyond clinical care to improve health outcomes. Our 100% RFP win rate included renewals of our statewide contracts in Tennessee and Indiana and a new statewide contract in Ohio, which will help further deepen our roots in that state given our leading market share positions in commercial and Medicare Advantage. Then as we begin serving Ohio in July, our pending acquisition of Paramount Advantage's Ohio Medicaid contract will amplify our Medicaid footprint. This investment follows our pending acquisition of Integra, a New York managed long-term care plan that will strengthen our presence and capabilities in the greater New York City area. These examples demonstrate our commitment to strategic and programmatic M&A. And we've become more agile and proactive as we target health plans that deepen our existing benefits business and acquisitions, which diversify and expand our addressable markets. A good example is our myNEXUS acquisition, which enables members to live healthier lives in their homes. myNEXUS has performed well to-date, driven partly by its expanding scope within Anthem. In addition, we expect the ongoing aging of the population and consumer preference for at-home care to propel growth for years to come. Over the last year, we significantly advanced our care provider strategy with investments in risk bearing primary care providers and aggregators, while enhancing value-based arrangements across our network. These arrangements accounted for more than 60% of our medical expense last year. We expect this strategy to accelerate membership growth, increase star ratings and improve health outcomes and cost of care. Investing in providers and aggregators secures joint governance to maintain alignment of shared interest with our partners, giving Anthem value from sharing risk and elevating the customer and provider experience. Importantly, this strategy ensures Anthem is not overly reliant on one care model as value-based care matures. Our diversified business group will increasingly benefit from these arrangements by opportunities to service Anthem's providers with enablement programs and other diversified services, many of which target the needs of complex and chronic patient populations where we see significant opportunities to improve outcomes, access and total cost of care. We expect to remain flexible and thoughtful in our provider strategy, partnering in most markets and investing in care delivery and others where it makes sense. We also made meaningful headway in our digital transformation during the quarter with accelerated investments to deepen digital engagement and meet the increasing need for convenience and personalized care. During our peak onboarding period earlier this month, digital registrations rose 150%, and visits to Sydney Health grew 142%. Capabilities and investments in artificial intelligence, which power our personalization engine are helping optimize the customer experience and reduce low-value administrative tasks. For example, our virtual primary care platform builds real-world learnings on commercial members' usage patterns and preferences to anticipate customer needs and offer customized experiences, and automating the on-boarding process delivers better experiences by saving time and improving the accuracy of critical data and the quality of virtual visits. To illustrate, more than 1,000 emergency room visits were avoided last month by predicting and addressing adverse health events through our virtual care options. Results like this are encouraging, and we're excited to accelerate the pace. Anthem enters 2022 with strong growth momentum across all of our businesses. This gives us confidence in our ability to deliver growth in adjusted earnings per share consistent with our long-term target range of 12% to 15%, as John will discuss more in a moment. Looking ahead, you can expect us to continue investing in profitable growth, innovating for consumers and advancing our digital platform for health as we work to achieve our purpose of improving the health of humanity. As part of our community health and sustainability commitments, I'm pleased to share, we recently met our 100% renewable electricity goal four years ahead of schedule and are now producing enough clean energy via off-site purchase agreements to power all of the Anthem's offices, data centers and clinics. It's gratifying to see our efforts earn Anthem a place on the 2021 Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the fourth consecutive year and on JUST Capital's 2022 rankings of America's most just companies. We're also in the early stages of leveraging insights derived from a dynamic model, tracking the health of our communities across local, social and clinical drivers. We call it our whole health index, and we believe it will help us more closely assess our progress towards helping people live healthier lives. In its simplest form, the index will help us identify the most promising opportunities to improve the health of our members and their communities. To date, we've leveraged the index to design and launch programs to manage obesity in five of our Medicaid states, where this health issue is especially severe. We're currently learning from field tests and are excited about the possibilities ahead, notably in diabetes prevention and customized wellness campaigns for employers based on the needs of their employees. As part of our ongoing work to support our customers' health, we also began offering risk-based Commercial members free at-home COVID tests through our Sydney app starting last November, Delivered within one to two business days, the kits allow members to test safely without leaving the comfort of their homes. This program has positioned us well to comply with the administration's recent requirement to provide home testing at no cost. In closing, I'll leave you with these three takeaways. Anthem's fiscal year 2021 performance demonstrates our strategy to become a lifetime trusted partner in health is helping unlock Anthem's full potential. With our plans and continued investments for fiscal year 2022, we are excited about our ability to sustain this momentum and deliver growth in the years ahead. And our strategic approach to innovation and digital transformation enables us to move even faster and with greater agility as we accelerate our digital platform for health and offer new ways to attract, engage and retain more customers while streamlining our business and simplifying the consumer experience. Now I'd like to welcome John to add his view on the quarter and our outlook for 2022. John? John Gallina : Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail stated, we are pleased to have delivered solid fourth quarter financial results, closing out another year of strong growth, driven by the continued execution of our long-term strategy, all while navigating the ongoing uncertainties associated with the pandemic. Fourth quarter earnings per share of $5.14 was ahead of our expectations and drove full year adjusted earnings per share to $25.98 reflecting growth of approximately 16% year-over-year, above our long-term 12% to 15% annual earnings per share growth target. Total operating revenue for the fourth quarter was $36 billion, an increase of more than 14% over the prior year quarter, reflecting solid growth in our benefits business, coupled with continued momentum in our services businesses. We closed the year with 45.4 million members growth of nearly 6% or 2.4 million members in the year, including 303,000 lives added just during the fourth quarter and with growth in both our Government and Commercial businesses. This was the 14th consecutive quarter in which we grew total medical membership, underscoring the strength and resilience of our core benefits businesses through periods of economic strength and periods of economic uncertainty. In 2021, we grew our government membership over 17% driven by organic growth in Medicaid, another year of double-digit organic growth in Medicare Advantage and the acquisition of MMM. Commercial enrollment grew modestly as solid growth in our risk-based areas were partially offset by in-group attrition in our fee-based business due to broader labor market dynamics that occurred during the year. Our fourth quarter benefit expense ratio was 89.5%, an increase of 60 basis points over the prior year quarter, driven by the repeal of the health insurance tax in 2021. As expected, total medical costs in the quarter were above normal or baseline levels but still compared favorably to our expectations driven by lower utilization of non-COVID care partially offset by higher-than-expected COVID-related costs, notably in December. Anthem's SG&A ratio in the fourth quarter was 11.7% on a GAAP basis, a decrease of 200 basis points over the prior year quarter. Excluding adjustment items noted in our press release, our adjusted SG&A ratio would have been 11.1% down approximately 250 basis points year-over-year. The decrease was driven by the repeal of the health insurer tax and the expense leverage associated with strong growth in operating revenue, partially offset by increased investments to support our growth and digital transformation efforts afforded by outperformance in our investment income. Fourth quarter operating cash flow was $1.7 billion, bringing full year 2021 operating cash flow to $8.4 billion or 1.4x net income. Our fourth quarter and full year cash generation beat our expectations, reflecting strong operating performance this year, as well as a shift in the timing of the planned payment of our share of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association litigation settlement. We now expect to make this payment of approximately $500 million in 2022, which is included in the guidance we provided this morning for operating cash flow of greater than $6.9 billion. We ended 2021 with a debt-to-capital ratio of 38.9%, in line with our expectations and well within our targeted range. Consistent with our approach throughout the pandemic, we maintained a prudent posture with respect to reserves. Days and claims payable ended the year at 45.2 days, an increase of 1.8 days year-over-year, with medical claims payable up 19% year-over-year compared to premium revenue increasing by 13%. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares of our stock at a weighted average price of $417.92. For the year, we repurchased 5.1 million shares for $1.9 billion, ahead of our original guidance of $1.6 billion. We were opportunistic in the year, capitalizing on periods of market volatility, notably during the fourth quarter. Turning to our outlook for 2022. We are pleased to provide initial guidance, including adjusted earnings per share of greater than $28.25, which reflects growth of at least 12% from the normalized adjusted earnings per share baseline of $25.20 in 2021. As a reminder, we benefited from significant investment income outperformance during the year, including amounts that we believe to be non-recurring. We offset a portion of the upside in the fourth quarter by accelerating investments in our business. In total for the year, we believe nearly $0.80 of our adjusted earnings per share to be outside of our run rate. Accordingly, we continue to view $25.20 as the appropriate starting point for our growth in 2022. We expect to end 2022 with total medical membership in the range of 45.6 million to 46.2 million members. This outlook includes the expectation of generating double-digit organic growth in our Individual Medicare Advantage business and the launch of our group Medicare Advantage contract serving the retirees of the City of New York in April, to add at least 200,000 group Medicare Advantage lives, while shifting a like number of members out of our commercial fee-based enrollment, given that we currently serve the city's retirees on a self-insured basis. In all, Medicare Advantage membership is expected to grow in the mid-teens percentage range. Our outlook also reflects strong growth in our Commercial risk and fee-based businesses, including a strong starting point due to a record selling season for national accounts. We expect commercial fee-based membership to grow by 2% to 3% or 530,000 to 730,000 members net after covering the transition of our more than 200,000 existing fee-based members in New York into our new group Medicare Advantage contract and low single-digit growth in our commercial risk-based members. With respect to Medicaid, our guidance assumes that public health emergency will end in mid-April as is currently planned with Medicaid eligibility redeterminations resuming around the middle of the year. Correspondingly, we expect to capture our commensurate share of growth in commercial fee and risk-based markets as consumers losing Medicaid benefits migrate to employer-sponsored coverage and individual plans. As you might expect, our membership outlook for our Commercial and Medicaid business is highly dependent on the timing and pace of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations. The launch of our new statewide Medicaid contract serving Ohio in July is also contemplated in our guidance range, while membership associated with pending acquisitions is not. We expect continued momentum in our Diversified Business Group and IngenioRx segments with revenue growth on a combined basis in the low to mid-teens. Altogether, the momentum we are seeing across all of our businesses will drive operating revenue up 11% year-over-year to approximately $152 billion. This includes approximately $130 billion of premium revenue, also up 11% over 2021, representing an increase of nearly $13 billion. The consolidated benefit expense ratio is expected to be 88%, plus or minus 50 basis points, in 2022, consistent with our initial outlook for 2021. At the midpoint, this reflects a 50 basis point increase year-over-year driven primarily by the launch of our New York Group Medicare Advantage contract. With respect to the impacts of COVID on our overall cost structure, we anticipate another year in which the overall cost of care will track above normalized levels driven by COVID-related treatment, vaccination, and testing costs. We expect the SG&A expense ratio to be 10.8%, plus or minus 50 basis points, in 2022, reflecting a reduction of 60 basis points at the midpoint of the range relative to our adjusted SG&A ratio in 2021. The reduction was primarily driven by operating expense leverage due to strong growth in revenue, in addition to the benefits of our ongoing modernization efforts, including workflow automation and digitization. This is partially offset by continued investment in our initiatives that will drive future growth and the operating efficiencies, including digital engagement and system migrations. We expect our operating gain for the year to be greater than $8.4 billion reflecting growth of at least 8% year-over-year over adjusted operating earnings in 2021. Below the line, investment income is expected to be approximately $1.1 billion and interest expense is expected to be approximately $840 million. Our effective income tax rate for the year is expected to be in the range of 22% to 24%, consistent with 2021. Full year operating cash flow is expected to be greater than $6.9 billion, which includes the anticipated payment of our share of the BCBSA litigation settlement, which, as I noted earlier is approximately $500 million. From a capital deployment perspective, our long-term targets remain unchanged, and we will continue to pursue programmatic M&A in an effort to enhance the organic growth of our existing operations and diversify and extend our capabilities, moving us closely to our goal of becoming a lifetime trusted partner in health. While our guidance does not include any benefit from future or pending M&A, it does contemplate a 4% to 5% contribution to growth in adjusted earnings per share associated with capital deployment, including M&A completed in 2021, notably MMM and myNEXUS, and anticipated share repurchases of at least $1.5 billion in 2022 that we expect will drive our weighted average share count into the range of 243 million to 244 million shares outstanding for the full year. With respect to seasonality, we are projecting profitability patterns close to our historical ranges and expect to earn approximately 55% of our income in the first half of the year, although earnings in the first and second quarter will be split roughly evenly. Our guidance assumes that our benefit expense ratio will approximate the midpoint of our full year range in the first quarter, which we believe will be a prudent assumption in light of the uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. I am also pleased to announce that our Board recently authorized and increased our quarterly dividend of more than 13% to $1.28 per share, continuing our track record of increasing our dividend every year since we began paying dividends in 2011. Our new dividend annualizes to $5.12 per share, a yield of approximately 1.2% based on our current share price. In closing, we are pleased to have delivered another year of strong growth despite significant challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. While much of the backdrop remains uncertain, we are committed to managing the uncertainty thoughtfully and prudently. We look forward to making further progress against our strategy and delivering on our financial commitments once again in 2022. Operator, we will now open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we'll go to the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Steven Valiquette : Great. Thanks. Good morning everybody. So regarding Medicare Advantage, there's obviously been a lot of industry discussion related to the external telephonic sales channel. Just curious if you can give us an update on how important you think that channel is in relation to your growth outlook in individual MA. Can you also remind us again where you stand on your internal sales and distribution capabilities for individual MA? Is this something that you're content with as far as the sizing right now? Are you looking to expand that further? Thanks Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, Steve. I'm going to ask Felicia Norwood, who leads our Government Business, to respond. Felicia Norwood : So good morning, Steven. Thank you for that question. First and foremost, let me say that we are very pleased with our overall performance during this past AEP, and we're on track for another year of double-digit growth in our individual Medicare Advantage business. When we think about distribution, we meet our members where they want to be met from a sales perspective, and that means providing them with a range of distribution options. The EMO channel represents an important and valuable distribution partner for us. We saw an acceleration in this channel prior to the pandemic, and we've long recognized the value that they bring in educating consumers about Medicare options and, equally important, the differentiated value that Anthem provides. This AEP for us wasn't meaningfully different in terms of our distribution mix, and we are going to continue to provide a distribution mix that represents being able to meet our consumers at the full end of the spectrum. We believe in the strong value of MA. It's a very solid business, and we really provide a strong value proposition for consumers. So we continue to evaluate all the time our mix, but we feel good about where we're positioned today with our distribution mix. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, Steve. And I'll just sort of summarize what Felicia said. I mean I think we felt we had a very strong AEP. We're expecting double-digit growth and very consistent from our perspective around the competitive market as well as the distribution channels. So thanks for the question. And next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. First, I wanted to just follow up on Steve's question there in terms of the specific around the third-party marketing. The focus has been on churn. So I'd be curious what you've seen on churn. And then I know there's some more compliance that CMS is looking for there. So do you think that affects the market or the effectiveness of that market? And then my question was just around commercial trend. Can you talk about testing costs in 2022 and what you're thinking there? And then just, overall, I know you said you had -- John, you said that there'd be some consistency in terms of an expectation of trend above normal? Any differences in 2022 versus 2021 on -- by segment, given that commercial seems to be running hotter than the government going into the year? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Well, thank you, Justin. There were a number of questions there, so we'll try to address. Let me first take the first one around Medicare Advantage. Overall, I think very consistent competitive environment. When you talk about churn specifically, we're not seeing anything significantly different than we've seen in the past. It's been a competitive market. It remains a competitive market. As I shared, we feel that our supplemental benefits and the things that we do to help support Medicare beneficiaries has been very positive. And also, we spent a lot of time on ensuring that through our marketing and other things that our members understand the components of our benefits and have a good welcome experience with us. But again, we see that as pretty consistent. I'm going to ask John to address the questions that you had more specifically around trend. John Gallina : Yes. Thank you, Justin, for the questions. In terms of trends by lines of business, and as I had stated in the prepared comments, overall, total COVID was higher than anticipated, but non-COVID more than offset it. And so our total cost structure, while above baseline, was better than our expectations. Commercial had the highest cost compared to baseline. You look at what happened in the fourth quarter. Children were eligible for vaccines for the first time. You had the Omicron surge, et cetera. Medicare was next in line with overall cost structure of adding COVID and non-COVID combined to be slightly above baseline. And Medicaid overall, actually ended the quarter slightly below baseline. But all in, the total is what I said. As you look to 2022, there's consistent themes, and we're not going to go into specific trends by line of businesses. But, overall, we expect Commercial to have the highest amount of cost compared to baseline of the three lines of business for the year and Medicare to be second and Medicaid to be third. So very consistent 2022 expectations versus fourth quarter actuals. So thank you for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Maybe just following up, John, on the comments on the MLR. I think you said that first quarter MLR would be kind of consistent with the annual range. That's a fair bit higher than, I think, how it typically trends. So could you maybe just go into some more detail on what you're expecting to play out in the first quarter and what's driving that step-up? Thank you. John Gallina : Yes. Good morning, Nathan, and thank you for the question. And maybe I'll address earnings seasonality and MLR seasonality somewhat consistently, because they obviously drive each other. You look at the seasonality of earnings patterns that we've had historically as a company, we've had 55%, 60%, closer to 60% of our money we make in the first six months of the year pre-pandemic. That obviously has shifted the last couple of years and which are really not the best benchmarks to use now for analysis purposes. And now we look at what we expect this year. We expect closer to 55% of our money to be earned in the first half. And then we expect the first and second quarter to be relatively consistent with each other. First quarter MLR, as you pointed out, will be a bit higher than historical patterns. A few key reasons for that. We ended 2021 going into 2022 with an Omicron surge. That was impacting our Commercial business, maybe a bit more than other lines, consistent with how I just answered Justin's question. There's a spike in hospitalizations that we're going through. We do expect non-COVID to drop, but the quarterly timing maybe isn't quite as clear. One other comment just to make -- to help clarify maybe a change in seasonality patterns is, we're within the public health emergency right now. And the public health emergency has many, many provisions associated with it. One of those is that any COVID diagnostic testing or cost structure, we need to waive co-pays and deductibles. And so, if you think about our historic seasonality patterns and the historic fact that, at the beginning of the year, that co-pays and deductibles are a significant part of the leverage between quarters, you don't have that to quite the same level during a public health emergency. And while those co-pays and deductibles are still in effect for the full year, they do not apply to COVID-type cost structures, and so we have a shift of cost between quarters. And then in the second quarter, we do expect COVID to be a little bit less severe than it is in the first quarter, and so that will impact our MLR positively. But we also launched the City of New York Group Retiree business and that excellent contract that we won. And so that will put upward pressure on the MLR in the second quarter. So all-in, we think we're in pretty good shape, and we want to be very prudent in terms of how we're assessing the COVID, the pandemic and our guidance. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, John. And I guess I would reiterate, as John said, there are a number of moving parts to this, but we feel that we've taken those into consideration and wanted to share our thoughts on certainly the first half of the year but feel confident in the way we've managed through it in 2021 and heading into 2022. Next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Hi everybody. I know Pete took over the Diversified Business Group operation in October. And I wondered if I could get either Gail or Pete, to talk a little bit about where the near to intermediate-term opportunity. I know you mentioned a lot of things that touch on DBG in your prepared remarks. But what are the two or three or four big opportunities for DBG looking over the next year or two? Gail Boudreaux : Well, thanks for the question, A.J. And I will turn this over to Pete Haytaian to share his perspective, but I think there's a few things, going back to my remarks. One, clearly, a huge opportunity for us in IngenioRx as well, and we shared how well that business is performing and the opportunity that we have to continue to embed the Ingenio as part of our whole health solutions into particularly mid-market accounts, and we've done a nice job there. And then in terms of the Diversified Business group, again, serving our complex and chronic patients has been an area of focus for a number of years, and we're seeing acceleration in that. So I'll ask Pete to give some specific points about where he sees that growth coming from. Peter Haytaian : Yeah. Thanks, Gail, and thanks, A.J. Appreciate it. I continue to be really energized about the opportunity. As Gail said, serving the complex and the chronically ill really aligns well with our core business and where we're seeing the trends go in our core business. I'd say of paramount importance is the opportunity to penetrate Anthem more as it relates to our core existing offerings, a tremendous opportunity to expand our product portfolio and offer new products for these complex populations. I'd say we're very focused on, at least I am and the team in the short term, on how a lot of these solutions stitch together and extend to create further value. For example, if you think about myNEXUS, which, as Gail said in her prepared comments is performing really well, its connection to the home, it allows us to consider a lot of extension product opportunities. So when you think about that more specifically, the post-acute care opportunity, and we're actually going to be launching some new post-acute care product offerings this upcoming year. When you think about managing durable medical equipment and the opportunity there. And then importantly, as we've talked about for the last several quarters, the importance of social drivers of health and how much is occurring in the home, so that's one area that we are very interested in. And then again, how you weave IngenioRx into this also plays a critical role in terms of specialty pharmacy and potentially home infusion, et cetera. And I think the other really important point, as we put these product offerings together and stitch them together, it creates tremendous proof points as it relates to our opportunities externally. With the Blues and our Blue partners, we currently have 26 Blue clients. I think there's tremendous opportunity to improve that. And then importantly, with those Blue clients, we have 10 with multiple solutions. So I look forward to the opportunity to create value in Anthem and then extend that externally as well. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thank you, Pete. And I think you heard from Pete, there's really two huge opportunities for us for accelerating growth. One, deeper penetration inside of Anthem, and we're beginning to bring all of these products together in a much more integrated way; and two, the opportunity through our provider strategy, our aggregator strategy to use our diversified business assets to participate in the profit pools in that area. So those are two, we think, growth opportunities for us in the future. And again, it's early days, but we're seeing some really nice progress in these early days. Thanks for the question. Next one, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Hi. Thanks for the question. I don't think I heard you talk too much about the outlook for the Individual, Commercial business during prepared remarks. Was hoping you could give us a sense of where membership there is expected to be for 2022 in that business and then how you're thinking about profitability in 2022 in light of your expectations around COVID and anything you want to touch on for competitive dynamics there. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. I'm going to ask Morgan Kendrick, who leads that business, to provide some commentary. Morgan Kendrick : Hey there, Stephen. Thank you for the question. I -- first of all, I'd say we are expecting growth in our individual business this cycle. You asked about our margin trajectory on that and how we felt about it. Clearly, we're expecting to -- we price the business accurately. We price it based on our forward view of trend. COVID certainly is a big piece of that. And when we think about it, we've adjusted pricing as necessary, but we're seeing -- and we're still in open enrollment for 1/1. Some of them are extended through the end of the month. And right now, things are looking quite good. You would imagine there are some states, there are puts and takes across the country. But nonetheless, we feel good about it, and we're expecting growth in the first quarter. Thank you for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Just want to go back to thinking about medical costs. And John, you talked about overall cost of care being above, and you talked a lot about COVID. But how do we think about any elective procedures that have been pushed off due to COVID would be my first question. And then secondly, as you looked at Delta versus Omicron, it appears at least from the seat I sit in, that it was much less severe. A lot more people had testing and other types of costs. But how do we think about if there is that next variant -- now that we'll have a treatment in the marketplace, obviously, a lot more testing, how do we think about how that cost progressed and what that means to pushing off incremental elective procedures to have those costs offset? So how do I think about that in total? John Gallina : Sure. Thank you, Lisa, for the questions. I'll see if I can unpack them all with this answer. But in terms of access to the health care system, over the past year, we really have not seen anyone that has been denied access to needed -- necessary care. And so while there may have been some puts and takes and some pent-up demand in the past, we think the vast, vast majority of that has all passed. And while that does happen on a temporary basis during some of these surges, the system is able to accommodate. So -- and the other thing I think is very clear that we've seen is that whenever there is a COVID surge, that there has historically now been a non-COVID drop that is a natural hedge against it. In terms of the just the cost trend in general and other variants, I certainly don't want to predict what the next variant's going to look like or even what letter of the Greek alphabet it's going to be named after. But on the other hand, as we look at Omicron, Omicron is clearly less severe on a per-member basis, but far more contagious. So you look at really the number of people who are infected by it, it's more multiplicatively higher than the number of people that were infected by Delta or the original COVID, and then the hospitalization rates are then a fraction. But you look at it sort of on a year-over-year basis, the hospitalization rates are relatively consistent in total and maybe even up a little bit for Omicron. So it's really hard to say exactly what the next variant is going to look like, but we model these things. We try to be very thoughtful and even prudent and conservative in the way that we've modeled it. And I think you can see our 2021 performance has shown that we are a bit conservative in the way that we assess these things, and we're going to continue that same thought process for 2022. So thank you for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Rob Cottrell from Cleveland. Please go ahead. Rob Cottrell : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to focus on the commercial fee growth and the outlook for 2% to 3% membership growth. Just curious, are those members coming in with higher specialty attachment rates that keep you on track for the 3 :1 margin targets, or is that something that potentially pushes that target out, given the stronger growth? Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question. Just to clarify a little bit, when we talk about the profitability between fully insured and our self-insured business or risk versus fee, we're really talking about adding more services to the fee-based business. So I wasn't sure if I understood your question correctly, but we are making great progress on that. We had predicted that we would end the year on 4 :1, which we did. And we're seeing, as I mentioned in my opening comments, the opportunity to add IngenioRx plus clinical services, advocacy. So there's a whole number of areas that have begun to gain traction in that. So we feel very much on target, feel good about it. If you think about just our fee-based revenue in the fourth quarter increase 12% compared to a year ago, when revenue increased over -- and for the year increased over 7%, so this growth came despite somewhat flattish membership growth. I think that really punctuates the impact of the various buy-up programs that we had. So, again, overall, I feel like we're making really good progress on that. Your question about the 2% plus risk-based membership growth, we feel that, that's a prudent projection going into the year. We had very strong growth in 2020, but feel good about where we are positioned. There was a previous question about our individual membership. Again, we have taken, I think, a very steady and consistent approach to the individual market. We did that again this year. So we don't look for outsized growth in any one of those markets, but consistent growth across our risk base and in the 14 states where we do business. So, again, feel good about it, making progress around all of those. And, again, we are making progress on that profit targetability. Thank you. Next question. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Lance Wilkes : Yes. Good morning. I wanted to ask you a little bit about your value-based care delivery strategy and was interested in the stake you've taken in some companies recently and how you look at -- how you kind of parcel out the country with respect to those, one. Also, has your appetite for owning care delivery changed? And then last, as you're thinking about partnering with other Blues, is this a capability that you could provide to other Blues in some sort of way? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Well, Lance, thank you very much for the series of questions, and let me try to kind of go through each of them and give you a bit of a perspective. As I shared in my opening remarks, I think we've been very consistent actually in our care provider and our value-based strategy over the years. Specifically, your question comes to what it relates to primary care, I think we've always taken a very thoughtful approach to how we leverage our scale in the market because we do believe that's one of the critical criteria for success. Recently, we shared and have updated everyone on some of the partnerships. Our model primarily has been a partnership model. So our investments, for example, in Privia and Adalat are the two that I think you're referring to, but there have been others that we've also shared. When you talk about taking an ownership position, again, that's something we have done in the past. So it's not -- I know often we get the question of why we don't do it. We have done it actually and where it makes sense in our local markets and based on the depth and the dynamics. And good examples, very early on with CareMore but also HealthSun simply, most recently last year when we bought MMM. So we're not against owning care delivery, but we do think in areas where we want to own it would be where we can accelerate our membership growth. And predominantly in areas where complex and chronic patients, we can improve the impact we have there, obviously, increase our Star ratings and improve the health outcomes and by partnering is one of the important parts in our aggregators. I want to take a minute on the aggregator strategy and why we're investing in some of these because they also allow us to stand up joint governance structures. And my prior answer, we talked a little bit about making sure that we remain aligned with our care provider partners. So that's a great way for us to participate in the governance structure and be aligned with our care providers and be very direct about our partnership preference where we can do it. So as you think about these partnerships, they also benefit our Diversified Business Group. Again, going back to my last answer, we see an opportunity to wrap around different provider enablement programs. Also some of the acquisitions we've done recently are good examples of where we can do pull-through, and we can participate in the profit pool in a broader way, so very consistent with that. They're very capital-efficient for us. And again, our focus is very much on complex and chronic, and we see significant opportunities. So I guess I would conclude our strategy is different than our others, and we see that as unique because of the set of assets that we have are very unique, and we want to leverage that depth and, again, that partnership that we've built. It also allows us to derive value from sharing risk and ensuring that we're not reliant on any single model. As we know, this value-based space continues to evolve and mature. We don't think that one model is going to work in every market. We fundamentally believe that care is delivered locally and that's the core to who we are and how we've grown up as a company. And so we see each model as unique, but we do think that there's an opportunity for scale and to wrap around, particularly our DBG assets, and to drive differentiated outcome. In terms of your last question, we do share a lot of these models with our partner, Blues, particularly in states where we have JVs already. So yeah, we do think there's opportunities for us to take a leadership role there and work closely. Other Blues have great ideas, and we also learned from them. So we think this is an opportunity where the market is going to change quite a bit, and we're going to keep optionality and be very capital efficient but also drive through, I think, a differentiated cost structure, and that's kind of where we start today. So thank you very much for the question, and next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Gary Taylor from Cowen. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. I just had a quick follow-up on the 2022 MLR guidance, that 88% midpoint, up about 50 basis points. How do we think about mix impacting that this year? Obviously, that group MA account would push it higher, but the Medicaid redeterminations, we would think about bringing consolidated MLR down. And I just want to think about the mix impact versus your comment that overall cost of care will still run above baseline in 2022. And just are you implying that there are certain lines of business where the MLR moves up because that underlying trend isn't priced for 2022? John Gallina : Gary, thank you for the question, and I really do appreciate the opportunity to provide clarity because it's actually an excellent question that you've asked. The increase in MLR is essentially entirely driven by mix. So we have the state of New York -- or I'm sorry, the City of New York, Medicare Advantage contract that goes live. It's going to be in excess of 200,000 members launching April 1. That will increase the overall MLR of the company. We have just general growth in various other areas. We acquired MMM mid-year 2021. We will have a full year of MMM in 2022. The overall aspect of that is that the weighted average MLR for the entire company goes up. We'd go live with Ohio mid-year as well in our new Medicaid win. So when you -- our Medicare Advantage on an individual basis is growing by double-digits, really outpacing every other line of business we have in the company, and the average MLR associated with those new members increases the MLR of the company. So the core underlying MLRs associated with each of the lines of business, the forward pricing aspects of including COVID, we feel very good about and feel very solid about. But the analysis of the 50 basis point increase, it's entirely mix. So thank you for the opportunity to provide that clarification. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Matt Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Matt Borsch : Yes. I had a regional question, which is you talked about the New York market. It seems like you're making progress in a number of fronts there. Can you just talk about the small group market? As I recall, you pulled out of the small group market, I want to say, maybe eight years ago. And is kind of -- as I understand it, kind of dysfunctional the way it's structured, and you've got a lot of small groups that are going into sort of private employer pools as a result. I'm just wondering, I realize this is kind of region-specific, but if you'd be willing to address that. Gail Boudreaux : Yes, Matt, thanks for the question. As you can appreciate, we won't go into details on specific markets and really won't comment on one area in particular. Overall, our small group market, we feel really good about, particularly the alternative and submarket strategy that we've launched over the last several years and have continued to make gains in it. So our products are resonating there quite well. We added a virtual-only product this year. That's having -- gaining a lot of traction but, again, won't speak to specific markets. Thanks for the question. Next question. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes. Hi, good morning. So just as a follow-up, on the cost of care in 2022, that's coming in above normal trend. Just for context, how does it compare to the $600 million in COVID costs that were in 2021, the headwinds? And then with the Blue settlement now finalized, how big is the opportunity when you think about market expansion into new states? John Gallina : Thank you, Ricky. I'll answer your first question on the cost of care, and then maybe I think Gail wants to make a couple of comments on the Blue settlement. But associated with the cost of care, I did not say that we would be above normal trend. I said that the cost structure would be above baseline. So I just want to make sure that the nuance of those words is very clear to everyone on the line. In terms of how that compares the COVID headwind and the $600 million, I'll just say COVID headwinds, there's many different things associated with them. Certainly, there's treatment cost, vaccine administration and testing that all go through cost of care. Our COVID headwinds, though, encompassed everything associated with COVID that might include things like the impact on risk adjustment revenue, not necessarily cost of care but clearly an item that's going to impact revenue and impact the bottom line. And then offsets, it will include drop in non-COVID utilization, pricing actions and various other aspects. And those are just examples of a very, very long list. And so in 2021, we did estimate that about $600 million of net headwinds, and while each bucket maybe didn't come out exactly how we had predicted, the overall estimate was reasonable. And so you look into 2022, our net headwind is smaller. For instance, risk adjustment revenue should be improved compared to 2021 as you look at the amount of utilization that occurred in the Medicare Advantage in 2020 versus 2021, we should have better risk scores. But additionally, we've continued our pricing discipline. So anyway, so thank you for the question. I just want to make sure that we are clear on exactly what the headwind related to and the size of it. Gail? Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks for the second question, Ricky. In terms of the BCBSA litigation, just to clarify, as you know, the final approval hearing was held in October of 2021, and that court took the matter under advisement, which is typical for cases of this size and scale. And so, some of the account members have submitted objections, which they're working through right now, and that's not unusual, so it's pretty typical for a case of the size. So in terms of projecting what this all means, et cetera. As John said, we expect to pay the settlement in 2022 versus what we had previously projected in 2021. We fully accrued for that. In terms of the overall market, I think it's too early to say. I mean we've always worked inside of the Blue system with our peer plans. We have a number of seeds, and so I really don't have a comment on that until we get through the overall process. But, again, I feel that, that will get resolved in 2022. Thank you. Next question. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. You guys, I guess, I don't remember you going in and specifically quantifying the impact of having to cover in-home testing. Can you just talk a little bit about how you guys thought about it? Is that not an issue, because you already assume COVID cost? Is it an issue because there's offsets on the PCR front? Any color there about how the size or think about how you came to your net impact? Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks for the question, Kevin. In terms of home testing, I think, it is a good opportunity to provide a little clarity on just how we're thinking about it. First of all, let me point out, and I know everyone is quite aware of this, that we're already paying for a significant volume of testing, mostly inside of medical facilities. And generally, these tend to be eight to 10 times the price of the at-home test. In addition, you add on the office fee. So while it's difficult to know the exact degree, to which the home testing or testing will go up as a result of the role, we do expect some substitution with lower cost home test displacing some of those tests that are currently done in the medical facilities. It's also, as you heard in my opening remarks, we proactively began offering free home COVID test to our risk-based commercial members through Sydney Health in November. And those tests right now are delivered to our members' homes within one to two business days and our early experience indicates that individuals are ordering these based on their need and there's been appropriate usage. In respect to our guidance, we did consider the effect of the substitution, the availability of the four free tests per household that the federal government is supplying, current short-term supply constraints and the likelihood of spikes in demand in the year that would drive potential surges in the COVID case rate. So those tended to go inside, as you know, with the lower non-COVID utilization. So that should be a natural offset, as John has shared earlier in the call. So bottom line, there's pretty wide range or there is a wide range of outcomes around the world, but we believe that our guidance provided that this morning captures the most likely net impact in our financial results. And that's one reason why our cost structure is expected to be at/or above baseline in the four quarters of 2022. So overall, we feel we've used our analytics to do our best assessment. And again, we do have some experience with the test through our Sydney app. So thanks very much for allowing us to clarify how we're thinking about that. Next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dave Windley : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Thanks for squeezing me in. I believe you've talked about 60% of your medical costs, I believe, specifically in MA are running through value-based care. I'm wondering how much of that is full risk capitation, how important that is to your strategy there. And maybe relatedly, how important are duals in your MA strategy and moving them into more value-based care? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Dave. Just to clarify, it's actually 6% across all lines of business. So that's across commercial Medicaid and Medicare Advantage, so just to clarify that answer. In terms of duals, duals are an important part of our MA growth strategy. We have a very significant impact on duals that aligns both with the Government Business but also what Pete does in the Diversified Business Group and a lot of the investments that we've made, so in myNEXUS home care and Aspire palliative care. Part of what CareMore does is quite extensive in the dual market. So very important part of us. Part of what we do, we think value-based care is critically important to this space. And some of the investments we've made with aggregators will help support our strategy there. In terms of full risk, as we shared at our Investor Day, it's an area that, right now, we're looking to significantly grow and impact over the next several years. So of that 60%, it's mid-teens, I'd say, across our book of business in total, where it continues to grow in terms of full upside downside risk. So not just capitation, but other arrangements that we're also looking to expand. So overall, it's a growing area for us, including with our high-performance network providers. But we think across the board that this is a core to how we get in to trend at CPI plus in our commercial business and to continue to deliver value in our government based business. So thank you very much for the question. Next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I was hoping to get a little more insight into your expectations on Medicaid enrollment for 2022. Maybe if you could talk about some of the offsets in terms of how much the traction from membership you're assuming just from the resumption of reverifications and any sequencing on the timing of that. And then as a positive offset, if you have an estimate on the amount of members you're going to add from the new Ohio contract in Medicaid, that would be helpful, too. Thanks. John Gallina : Yes. Thanks, Scott. Appreciate the question, and hopefully, I can give you some detail to help clarify. The timing of the public health emergency clearly is the most significant assumption that needs to be evaluated as part of all this. And right now, the public health emergency is slated to expire April 16. And as a result, we would expect reverifications to begin in the middle of the year. So obviously, if the public health emergency changes and everything else, I'm saying right now needs to be updated simultaneously. But at that point in time, we do expect to see the reverifications. We expect the reverifications to occur over a 12-month period of time through the end of 2022 and the first half of 2023. And we are not expecting a cliff event associated with membership dropping off. At the same time, we expect to capture our fair share of those commercial members, and part of our commercial risk membership growth is predicated on the Medicaid reverifications occurring as I had stated. And so there's certainly a natural hedge or an offset associated with those. The one thing I do want to make sure that everyone is clear about is that there are two states out of our portfolio of Medicaid states that expanded the number of MCOs in their geographies for 2022. And those are states that we have retained our business. However, with additional members -- I'm sorry, additional payers in those, that the states are going to redistribute many of the members. And so there's somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000 members that we will lose within those states that we have retained. And that's probably part of the reconciling item that maybe you don't have associated with this. And then as we look at our membership in total, we gave all the components, fee-based, up very nicely individual; MA, double-digit growth; group MA, nice growth with the City of New York; commercial risk, up a couple percent; and then the balance is the loss of members through the Medicaid reverification. So hopefully, all that clarifies your membership questions. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Hey, good morning, guys and thanks for sneaking me in. My question is on Ingenio and Rx volumes. And we talk a lot about medical utilization. But could you guys talk about if you feel like prescription drug utilization has kind of rebounded off of how I would think about a normalized growth trend line maybe from an unaffected 2019? And kind of what -- can you talk a little bit about the puts and takes if we see a \u2013 a rebound in prescription drug utilization, both in the risk book and in the fee-based book in Ingenio? Thank you. John Gallina : Yes. So thank you, George, for the question. Really reflecting on what happened in 2020 maybe as a starting point, we have about half of our scripts are maintenance-type scripts. And so certainly, when the pandemic first occurred, we didn't see any impact really, notable impact on that level of script volume. And then, if you recall, we did relax the 90-day rules back then and saw a little bit of a blip in script count, but the overall script volume of the remainder of the scripts was down, and that really corresponded directly to the non-COVID utilization being down as well. And so, now as we fast forward through 2020 -- through 2021 into 2022, script levels are relatively consistent with where we would have thought. Certainly, as I said, half of the scripts are maintenance scripts. Those haven't been impacted at all. And then the other half very much are related to the non-COVID. And the non-COVID utilization was approaching baseline levels near the end of the year before this last Omicron surge. So the script volume really corresponded to that. So hopefully, that clarifies the issues on that. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Thanks. I just wanted to take one layer deeper on the strategy around working with value-based providers. And I'm curious what model seems to be working best. And I think maybe you could delineate commercial versus Medicare, because it sounds like it's across both books of business. And then lastly, I'm not sure I understand what you mean by aggregators. Are those the sort of tech enablers? And should we read into your comments and investments in Privia and Aledade as a preference there? I didn't hear CareMax or any of the center-based investments that you've made. Gail Boudreaux : Well, thanks for the question, Josh. In terms of value based, I mean, the deepest penetration has historically been in the Medicare Advantage space, given the nature of the product design that we've had, it's been more around very specific networks and the depth. So I think -- the industry has a lot more depth and experience in Medicare Advantage, but we're seeing significant growth in our commercial business across, not just Anthem, but our partnership with our other non-Anthem Blues. So our high-performing network, part of the success that you saw in the significant growth in our national account business was just a significant difference in our value proposition driven by high-performing networks. And again, we've got double-digit improvement in costs versus our competitors there, that has been validated by outside consulting firms. So again, that's one of the reasons we consolidated. We're one of a multi carrier in those accounts. And this year, particularly with our largest, probably most discerning accounts where they could see year-over-year performance, we were able to consolidate to a single carrier. So I'd use those as some proof points around the traction happening in the high-performing markets or high-performing providers. And again, those are particularly -- mostly contracting relationships. When I referenced the two aggregator models, those are examples. We clearly are working with others, but I thought that, that would give you a sense of two of the models that we're working with. We're learning a lot. I guess I'd say it's still early days in many of these relationships. We began them over the last, really, 12 to 18 months. We think that what's important there is an alignment to the goals, the depth of our market share and the opportunity for us to work hand-in-hand in that local market to really the unique needs of that marketplace. Predominantly started in Medicare Advantage, but as you saw from some recent announcements, we're also doing quite a bit of work in commercial, because we see the real opportunity there. And then you look at some of our markets where, Ohio is a great example, we have leading market share in Medicare and commercial, and we'll soon add Medicaid to that. So again, you think across all businesses and supporting those. Many of the early value-based providers were focused on Medicare Advantage. We see that expanding much more broadly to all markets and the skill sets there. So again, I wouldn't read in just the two names that we shared with you. Our preference is to really work with the best of breed in the markets and be able to leverage our scale and deliver something very differentiated because of that unique market. And we're going to continue to evolve that marketplace, and we do believe that the Diversified Business Group can wrap around its services, and that's a way for us to participate in the profit pool, but also bring our services to our members and keep a very consistent consumer experience. So hopefully, that answers your question, and thanks very much for the ability to clarify that. Next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Ben Hendrix : Hey thanks guys for squeezing me in. Just one, going back to your value-based evolution here. Your competitor United had talked about achieving 8% to 10% margin across the overall across the various cohorts of their capitated membership as they've been scaling rapidly. And I know you guys are taking a very much more capital efficient partnership approach. So how should we think about margins as you scale in value-based and capitated arrangements, maybe as you grow and then also on a run rate basis? Thanks. John Gallina : Yeah. Thank you for the question. And we do provide some target margins at a line of business level. But we really don't think it's appropriate to go through and talk about target margins at a more granular level than that. The one thing I will say, though, associated with margin expansion is that our Diversified Business Group is going to provide us a great opportunity for margin expansion because, as Pete had talked about serving Anthem members more holistically, more deeply. And the Commercial and the Government Business units will pay Diversified Business Group fair market value for the value that Diversified is providing. And then Pete will continue to make a margin on his services. Certainly, the transaction will eliminate intercompany revenue. Yeah, we'll still have target margins on Commercial and Government, and then we'll have the margins within Pete's area. So we do expect margin expansion over the next five years and really driven by that. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Whit Mayo from SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Whit Mayo : All right. Thanks. I'll be quick. Just looking at the individual exchange enrollment numbers, they look pretty good, at least at the national level. Is there anything that you've learned as you study these new members? Any underlying characteristics of where they're coming from? Were these commercial? Were they Medicaid? Just what you're thinking as it relates to the risk pool? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Morgan Kendrick will address that. Thank you. Morgan Kendrick : Thanks, it's Morgan here. Thanks for the question. Regarding unique characteristics, one thing we've noticed -- I mean we like this business. As you've said, we see it behave and evolve differently by geography. One of the things is there's a stickiness to it that wasn't there originally. And that's something that's been notable of late. As far as where it's coming from, we're typically seeing it come from other exchange members in the market. There are targeted areas where we've made real discerning efforts to get after deep areas that we're underpenetrated in certain geographies that we have, and they're paying dividends for us. So again, one of the things in the beginning of the ACA, it wasn't a sticky market. There was lots of churn every year. We're seeing that very differently now. And we believe the assets we have and the assets we're bringing to the market will indeed pay dividends for us. So we like the market and look forward to continued work there. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Morgan. Now, I'd like to close by saying thank you. It's been a strong year for Anthem, and we greatly appreciate the interest you've shown in our company along the way. I hope today provided some more insight into how we're managing the short-term while building for the long-term. Our results show we're on our front foot and we're optimistic about the future. We're clear on our commitment to make whole health reality. And as we go forward, you can expect our focus on being a lifetime trusted partner in health to be consistent. Our work is a privilege and a responsibility of all 98,000 of us in Anthem, and we take it personally every day, and we'll keep executing with excellence and discipline to make a valuable difference for all of those, who we are so privileged to serve. Thank you, everyone. Have a great week.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session where participants are encouraged to present a single question. [Operator Instructions] These instructions will be repeated prior to the question-and-answer portion of this call. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Company's management. Please go ahead. Steve Tanal : Good morning, and welcome to Anthem's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This is Steve Tanal, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning on the earnings call are Gail Boudreaux, our President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Peter Haytaian, President of our Diversified Business Group and IngenioRx; Morgan Kendrick, President of our Commercial and Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division. Gail will begin the call with a brief discussion of the quarter, recent progress against our strategic initiatives and close on Anthem's proposal to change our holding company name to Elevance Health. John will then discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to share that Anthem is off to a strong start in 2022. In the first quarter, we delivered GAAP earnings per share of $7.39 and grew adjusted earnings per share by 18% to $8.25, exceeding our expectations. Based on the strong start to the year and the momentum in our business, we have increased confidence in our ability to deliver another year of growth in line with our long-term 12% to 15% annual adjusted earnings per share growth target. As a result, we've increased our full year outlook to greater than $28.40 per share, representing growth of at least 12.7% of the adjusted baseline we provided last quarter. It's the ongoing momentum in every one of our businesses, driven by the disciplined execution of the strategy we shared with you at last year's investor conference, coupled with the balance and resilience of our core benefits business that is allowing us to produce this level of growth. We ended the first quarter with medical membership of 7.5% year-over-year to 46.8 million members, widening Anthem's lead as the largest insurer by U.S. medical membership. In recent years, Anthem has been on a journey to transform from a traditional health insurance company to a lifetime trusted health partner, by focusing on whole health, addressing the physical, behavioral and social drivers that we know are critical to achieving optimal health. Our results demonstrate that our employer, consumer and state partners are universally looking for solutions that address underlying drivers of cost, while enhancing and simplifying the consumer experience. We are delivering in these areas and its propelling strong organic membership growth in each of our benefits businesses, in addition to creating opportunities to scale our service divisions. Last quarter, we shared that Anthem produced its strongest national account selling season in the history of the Company. Today, you can see in our results that commercial group fee-based enrollment grew by over 750,000 members in the first quarter alone, with a meaningful proportion of that growth driven by existing large employer clients consolidating their business with Anthem after working with us on a piece of their business in the past. Cost of care is paramount for self-funded groups, and the success we're seeing underscores our confidence in our leading cost of care position. Employers have come to expect more, notably in the way of enhanced experiences, and we continue to innovate to meet their needs. In the first quarter, we expanded virtual primary care capabilities to reach 5 million commercial members and expect to reach 10 million members by year-end. We're excited about the potential to expand access to care, especially in underserved rural areas, while offering convenient, personalized solutions. We also continue to advance client advocacy solutions and elevate our consumer engagement platform, Sydney Health, which has been core to our success in the employer market. Last year, we launched Sydney Preferred, a version of our Sydney Health app that allows employers to customize our engagement platform for their unique benefits and needs. Today, nearly 1.2 million members are on Sydney Preferred, and we closed the first quarter with more than 12 million registered users on Sydney, up approximately 40% year-over-year. Our commitment to Whole Health is also driving growth in our Government Business, where we are focused on health equity and meeting the needs of vulnerable members. Last quarter, we shared how our Whole Health index helps us better understand and address local, social and physical drivers of health. We're leveraging the tool to identify members with diabetes who may benefit from one-on-one virtual coaching, supplies and preemptive notifications to help better manage their health. In our diversified business group, new behavioral health programs, launched by Beacon, address family therapy, suicide prevention and offer a concierge model for members with comorbid conditions. All of these efforts support our focus on community health. Through our Whole Health index, we've been measuring Anthem's impact on health outcomes and are seeing encouraging, albeit early trends. Our health equity and community health initiatives that targeted vaccine outreach community health worker readiness, housing stability and diabetes management during COVID-19. Programs made possible by our deep roots in our communities were recognized recently by the Institute of Medicaid Innovation. All of this work keeps Anthem uniquely well positioned to serve the needs of our state partners and directly ties to our 100% Medicaid RFP win rate that we extended into 2022 with renewal awards in Indiana and Louisiana. Personalized Whole Health solutions are also resonating with seniors, notably dual eligible members with complex and chronic needs, and driving strong growth for Anthem and Medicare Advantage. For example, supplemental health plan benefits, like those offered by Simply Healthcare, address food and security issues by delivering food shipments directly to our most vulnerable members, benefit packages like our Everyday Extras, provides members the flexibility to choose which supplemental benefits matter most to them from menu of options. We remain on track to produce double-digit organic growth in our individual MA business, led by growth in duals. We also remain opportunistic in terms of driving inorganic growth through acquisitions. MMM has performed well since we acquired them last year, and we look forward to adding Integra, a high-performing plan serving high-needs Medicaid members in New York, to our portfolio when we close our purchase later this year. Across our organization, we're committed to accelerating value-based care, both in context of benefit expense for our health plans and growth of our diversified services businesses. We know that value-based care leads to higher quality outcomes, better patient provider satisfaction, more predictable cost for our health plans and by extension, more in our benefit packages. All of these factors can lead to higher star ratings in Medicare Advantage, which is a key strategic priority for Anthem. Over the last year, we significantly advanced our care provider strategy with investments and risk-bearing primary care providers and aggregators. This drive towards value-based care is one of the most important strategic imperatives inside of our organization. In 2021, more than 60% of our consolidated medical expenses repaid under value-based care arrangements, with roughly 1/5 of that or a low double-digit percentage of total spend in arrangements with downside risk. In the coming years, our primary focus will be to increase the penetration of downside risk sharing, including via global capitation. We expect to make significant strides in the coming years, targeting more than 1/3 of overall spend arrangements with downside risk in 2025, with significant increases in penetration in Medicaid, Commercial and Medicare. In addition to the benefits our health plans derive from value-based care, we see significant pull-through opportunities for our diversified business group in the areas of provider enablement, and carve-outs of specialized care management, including behavioral and home health. Beacon and myNEXUS are leaders in these areas, with the proven ability to generate high-quality outcomes and solid profitability in risk-based arrangements. Notably, 100% of myNEXUS' affiliated revenue earned from Anthem's health plans and 99% of Beacons will flow through risk-based contracts in 2022. Guided by our enterprise strategy, we are making significant investments in our digital capabilities and platforms. We see three distinct benefits : elevating consumer and provider experiences, improving the cost and quality of care and improving administrative efficiency by automating manual processes. Adoption of our digital tools, combined with strong and rising customer satisfaction surveys, suggest that our consumers and care providers are finding value in our digital channels. Less than two years ago, we implemented live chat and AI messaging capabilities for our consumers and care providers to provide more choice and convenience. Today, chat is our best-performing channel for issue resolution and consumer experience metrics. Consumer chat usage grew by nearly 40% year-over-year in the first quarter, and now represents 24% of the contact mix. For care provider chat, usage grew by nearly 50% year-over-year and now represents 20% of our provider contacts. Meanwhile, Anthem is benefiting from improved efficiency, having reduced an estimated 1.2 million calls from members and another 1 million from care providers in the first quarter alone. Year-to-date, we've also made significant progress advancing our Health OS digital platform, which is now utilizing clinical data from providers and health systems for more than 20 million members. We use this data to advance clinical quality and elevated experiences by sharing more comprehensive data and insights with care providers and value-based care arrangements in order to facilitate better care management and personalize member interventions. We're also leveraging the platform to advance our cost of care analytics and streamline data collection for risk adjustment, all while automating processes that reduce administrative burden for our associates and providers. We're rolling this tool out rapidly with a goal of covering another 4.5 million members by the end of this year. In conclusion, we're continuing on our journey to transform from a traditional health benefits organization to become a lifetime trusted health partner and our proposed name change to Elevance Health marks an important milestone. Bringing together the ideas of elevate in advance, Elevance Health will reflect our position as a health leader, committed to elevating the importance of Whole Health in advancing health beyond health care for our consumers, their families and communities. Grounded in our mission and fueled by our bold and ambitious purpose to improve the health of humanity, Elevance Health represents the Company that we are today and will continue to be in the future. I would like to thank our nearly 100,000 associates for the important work they do every day on behalf of the members who we are privileged to serve. Our passion to improve lives and communities is inspiring, and it extends to our own associates. We were pleased to once again be recognized as one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to work for, with a ranking of 57, up from 71 last year, on this year's list of America's leading employers and workplaces. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to John for more on our operating results. John? John Gallina : Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail mentioned, we delivered strong first quarter results, including GAAP earnings per share of $7.39 and adjusted earnings per share of $8.25, reflecting growth of approximately 18% year-over-year. Our first quarter results demonstrate continued momentum across all of our businesses, driven by the execution of our enterprise strategy, the benefits of investments in key capabilities and the balance and resilience of our core benefits business. We ended the first quarter with 46.8 million members, up 3.3 million or 7.5% year-over-year with nearly 3/4 of the growth being organic. In fact, we generated organic growth in each of our Medicaid, Medicare, commercial risk and commercial fee-based businesses. Membership grew by 1.4 million lives in the quarter alone, driven by the strongest national account selling season in Anthem's history and aided by the acquisition of Ohio Medicaid members from Advantage. Commercial membership is off to an especially strong start this year as Anthem's integrated solutions, which focus on Whole Health, the customer experience and total cost of care continue to resonate in the employer market. Our brand value and unique product offering, leveraging our deep local roots and value-based provider partnerships, also continued to gain traction with consumers. For example, in the ACA exchange market, we delivered individual membership growth of 8% in the quarter or 12% year-over-year. The Medicare open enrollment period was also consistent with our expectations as we remain on track to produce double-digit organic enrollment growth in our individual Medicare Advantage business. This includes strong growth in our dual special needs plans, where our strategic investments targeting specific benefit categories continue to attract consumers with complex and chronic health needs. In Medicaid, we overcame a significant membership headwind to start the year as additional carriers entered two of our existing markets, and we still ended the quarter up 319,000 net new members. In addition to continued organic membership growth, the acquisition of Paramount Advantage's Ohio Medicaid members in February added 256,000 members in the quarter. We are very excited about this strategic acquisition, which provides Anthem scale in Ohio's Medicaid program ahead of the future launch of the new contract we were awarded last year. First quarter operating revenue of $37.9 billion increased $5.8 billion or 18% over the prior year quarter, with strong growth in each and every one of our businesses. We earned higher premium revenue due to the growth in Medicaid membership, the acquisition of MMM and Paramount and the individual Medicare Advantage and commercial risk-based enrollment growth, in addition to premium rate increases to cover overall cost trends. We also produced strong double-digit organic growth in our IngenioRx and Diversified Business Group businesses. Our services businesses are off to a strong start this year as IngenioRx's value proposition is gaining traction in the market. The Diversified Business Group continues to execute on the strategy we articulated at our Investor Day in March of 2021, growing both affiliated and unaffiliated operating earnings across its portfolio of best-in-class assets. In the first quarter, DBG continued to grow its risk-based arrangements with our commercial health plans consistent with our strategy. With the risk transfer between businesses, we expect more seasonality in DBG's earnings with a larger proportion of full year earnings in the first quarter relative to prior years and a decrease in the seasonality inherent in the commercial business. It is important to note that this affects seasonality only. Our annual segment target margins for the Commercial and Specialty business division are unchanged. Revenue eliminated in consolidation, representing intersegment business, grew 23% year-over-year and represented 21.4% of benefit expense in the first quarter, up from 20.7% in the same period a year ago. Anthem's consolidated benefit expense ratio for the first quarter was 86.1%, an increase of 50 basis points over the first quarter of 2021, primarily driven by the continued shift in mix of business towards government, which has a higher medical loss ratio. Relative to our expectations as of mid-January, when the Omicron surge was still peaking, in the terms of the at-home COVID testing coverage rule had just been released, our medical cost structure developed meaningfully better than our original guidance ranges, driven by a lower net impact from COVID. Specifically, the Omicron surge dissipated faster than we had expected in February, while producing lower acuity COVID cases relative to prior surges. This combined with the absence of any material stockpiling or abuse of free at-home COVID test, helped drive favorability in the first quarter benefit expense ratio relative to our initial guidance. Even with these positives, the overall cost of care in the quarter was still above what we would consider to be a normalized level. Anthem's SG&A expense ratio in the first quarter was 11.5% on a GAAP basis, a decrease of 70 basis points over the prior year quarter. The decrease was driven by expense leverage associated with strong growth in operating revenue, partially offset by higher investments to support our growth and digital transformation. First quarter operating cash flow was $2.5 billion or 1.4x net income. Please note that we continue to expect to pay our share of the BCBSA litigation settlement of approximately $500 million later in 2022, which was included in the guidance we provided for full year operating cash flow of greater than $6.9 billion as we discussed on our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. As of the end of the first quarter, Anthem's debt-to-cap ratio was 39.2%, in line with our expectations and well within our targeted range. Consistent with our approach throughout the pandemic, we maintained a prudent posture with respect to reserves. Days and claims payable stood at 46.9 days at the end of the first quarter, an increase of 1.7 days from year-end and in line with the first quarter of 2021. Medical claims payable once again grew faster than premium revenue in the first quarter relative to the prior year. With respect to our outlook, we are pleased to have delivered a stronger-than-anticipated start to the year. Outperformance in the first quarter has increased our confidence in our ability to grow adjusted earnings per share of 12% to 15% in 2022 off the adjusted baseline of $25.20, in line with our long-term target. We now expect benefit expense ratio for the full year to be at the midpoint or in the lower half of our initial full year guidance range for this metric. Given the strong start to the year, we now expect to produce adjusted net income per share greater than $28.40, representing growth of at least 12.7% from our adjusted baseline. With the recent extension of the federal public health emergency, we also now expect Medicaid redeterminations will begin later than we had previously assumed. While the extension will enable us to maintain our Medicaid membership longer, please note that we will also incur increased cost associated with the PHE in our Medicare and commercial risk-based businesses for an additional three months. Importantly, Anthem is uniquely well positioned to navigate the end of the public health emergency and to support continuity of care for Medicaid members who lose access to Medicaid by providing a robust set of commercial offerings. The momentum we have in each of the balance and resilience of our core benefits business, should allow us to maintain healthy levels of membership, while continuing to scale our diversified services operations. Consistent with this strategy, we are well positioned to continue delivering against the financial targets we shared at our March 2021 Investor Conference. In that context, I want to point out that while we are excited by strong growth in our commercial business and the expansion of our risk-based arrangements with our diversified business group, the operating margin of the Commercial & Specialty division remains challenged by the net impacts of COVID. However, while the year-over-year margin performance in our reportable segments table includes the impact of the seasonality shift I mentioned earlier, the underlying performance of the business is better than the optics. Relatedly, we would caution against annualizing first quarter operating profit of the other segment, which includes the Diversified Business Group and the impact of the seasonality shift in that business. Importantly, the expanded risk-sharing arrangements with DBG have no impact on our full year margin expectations for the Commercial & Specialty Business. We expect commercial margins to recover as the effects of the pandemic subside. We also anticipate strong earnings growth in our Medicare business. These opportunities, coupled with the expectation of continued strong double-digit growth in our services businesses, Anthem's programmatic approach to M&A and our opportunistic focus on share repurchases, leave Anthem uniquely well positioned for growth in the coming years. With that, operator, we will now open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we'll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Interested, if you could give us your perspective on the final 2023 Medicare Advantage rates certainly looked quite solid from my opinion. And just interested in how you're thinking about some of the gaming theory at this point just around competitive psychology out there, just given what seems to be a pretty strong tailwind that we're seeing around the 2023 MA rates? Gail Boudreaux : Thanks, Scott. I'm going to have Felicia Norwood, who leads our government business, to address your question. Felicia Norwood : So, good morning, Scott, and thank you for the question. With respect to the CMS final notice, the expected rate increase, excluding CMS' estimate of coding trend, was 4.88%, which was certainly better than we expected. We're also very pleased with the progress that we've made in stars, last October, which will have approximately 73% of our members and plans set up four stars are higher in the payment year for 2023, which is up from 58% in payment year 2022. So, coupled with the positive proposed rate increase from CMS, we think that 2023 is shaping up well. Our plans have stayed competitive as we focus on supplemental benefits to address whole person health and believe we will continue to remain competitive. So, all things considered, we would expect our Medicare margins to be inside of our target range. And we would expect another predictably competitive year with respect to Medicare Advantage. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks, Felicia, and thanks, Scott. And as you heard, I think we feel really good about our Medicare Advantage, especially the start to this year and going into next. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Question, cost trends and -- can you give us a little bit of color of where you see COVID versus non-COVID across the three businesses in the quarter? And John, you also talked about commercial and some investments you're making there, running a little bit below. Where do you think commercial margins can shake out over the next two or three years once you get passed through the five to three to one and commercial trend normalizes? John Gallina : Yes. Thanks, Justin. So in terms of COVID and non-COVID combined, as you know, that there was a significant spike of COVID in January and then it came down even at a faster rate in February and March than we had seen a decline at any point in time during the entire pandemic. Having said that, Commercial had the highest COVID cost in the quarter on a comparative basis, so Commercial COVID and non-COVID combined were clearly above baseline for the quarter. Medicare was next. And if you take Medicare COVID and Medicare non-COVID combined, it was still above baseline, but performed actually much better than Commercial. And then Medicaid continues to actually be the line of business that's performing the absolute best during the entire pandemic from a COVID and non-COVID combined perspective, and the total of those two are relatively close to baseline. So all in, the Company was above baseline, even though it was better than our overall expectations. Associated with commercial margins, we do feel good about the targets that we laid out in Investor Day back in 2021. As you know, we talked about getting to a 10.5% to 11.5% range by 2025. We've got a lot of things going on with COVID. It's certainly the single biggest factor that is causing commercial margins to be a little challenge this year versus prior years. And we also have some seasonality issues with our risk deals with our diversified business group, and that's not going to impact the annual margins at all, but it will impact certainly the quarterly margins. And Diversified Business Group, as I said in my prepared comments, I would not annualize that because of the fact that the shifting seasonality. And then Commercial, I wouldn't annualize that either because of that same aspect. So, we feel very good about the commercial growth and where we're heading as a company and the value proposition it has and feel very good about our 2025 targets. We're just challenged this year given -- or this quarter, the high COVID in January. But thanks for the question, Justin. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: I wondered, if can you just get updated thoughts on how you're thinking about the re-verifications on the Medicaid side. I know it's delayed. Does that change your thinking about how much of a roll off there might be? What opportunities there might be for you to recapture your own in other areas like the exchanges or in the commercial book? And then also just in that aspect, the enhanced subsidies, which are slated to expire this year on the public exchanges. How important is it that those get extended? And you're thinking about recapturing some people that might come off on the re-verifications. Gail Boudreaux : Well, thanks for the multipart question, A.J. We'll try to address it because there's a number of pieces in that, one about our -- how we're thinking about re-verifications in Medicaid, which right now, as you think about, we've said, with the extension, we're really looking for those to begin sometime towards the late part of the summer. We also believe that they're going to be paced over time. So, I think it's important to remember that the states now have up to 14 months to do the re-verifications. And as a result of that, each state will have a very different cadence of that. So, we do think that will be more phased in. In terms of your second part of your question, I'm going to ask Morgan Kendrick to address that in terms of how we're thinking about capturing that. We've done quite a bit of work on that, and I know we've shared some of the statistics about where we see that business going. But I think Morgan can offer a lot more color on that business. So Morgan? Morgan Kendrick : Yes. Thanks, Gail, and A. J., good morning. We have done a lot of work. And if you think about the fact that the Commercial business, the Medicare business -- well, the government business in entirety, as well as our marketing organization and our government affairs partners have worked to build out a plan for when re-verification begins. And presently, we're expecting roughly 35% of the present Medicaid membership to stay with the Government division and then 45% of that will move into commercial group insurance, with another 20 moving into the individual ACA exchanges. Certainly, the commercial group insurance will be one that the employers will pick it back up as they begin re-verification. But on the exchanges, I think one thing that's notably important is we talked last quarter about a renewed focus on our individual ACA business. And looking at that business differently and more competitively, we've expanded the product offering. We've expanded the network opportunities. We've expanded the counties in which we serve our customers from 71% to 83% of the counties in our 14 geographies this year. So, we feel we're poised quite well to pick up when verification begins. And as Gail noted, that certainly will slide over a period of time given the 14 months that the states have to continue to work. But thanks again for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. And just a bit of a clarification, 35% really relates to the lives that were added during the suspension of redeterminations. So as you know, some of our growth is also the result of winning new RFPs and new entrants into markets. But overall, we feel good about the plan. We've obviously had this in place for a number of years. And in addition to capturing some of our own Medicaid lives and Commercial, we think we have an opportunity to capture other Medicaid lives that will be coming off the books. So again, we've been planning for it. We hope to see a very organized transition of this and that's what we're working for. So thanks very much for the question. And next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Matt Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Matt Borsch : Yes. Could I just ask about your commercial enrollment -- your enrollment outlook for the rest of the year, but particularly on the commercial side because you did have such a strong result in the first quarter, you're already well above, as I can see it anyway, the high end of your guidance ranges on both insured and self-insured enrollment. I'm wondering, how you see it progressing from here? Gail Boudreaux : I'm going to ask Morgan to address the question on commercial. Morgan Kendrick : So, Matt, thanks again for the question. So yes, we've had a fantastic start to the year. We do expect that to continue. Certainly, north of 50% of our business, especially on the upper end, all of -- just about all of the national business is January focused. So we've kind of gone through that. The balance of the business will be the continued local market business. And we've seen a big uptick in our fee-based business, which is terrific. We see the next big tranche coming on in July. I wouldn't expect it to be materially larger than what we've seen in typical years, but we're growing that business nicely month-over-month. To me, the assets are resonating in the market. When I look at how the business is performing. And also the opportunity back to the comment earlier on expanding in account value, the 5 :1/3:1 strategy is proceeding nicely, just given the actual opportunity with the fee-based business around stop-loss. Presently, our penetration, we've got opportunities there as well as our specialty products, pharmacy as well. So I feel really good about it. I wouldn't expect it to be -- right now, we've said that we would be somewhere around 1 million members, commercial business full year. And we have some attrition that certainly bleeds off through the year of the national business, but feel good about our position now and for the balance of the year is how it's setting up. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks for the question. Overall, strong growth and we really feel that we had a really strong selling season. And as Morgan said, feel good about our positioning. So thanks again and next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : John, I just wanted to follow up on the updated expectations for MCR for the year. I guess given the significant beat in the first quarter, I guess looking at the updated guidance, it doesn't seem like your expectation expectations have changed significantly for cost trend over the balance of the year. I guess, is that fair? And are you still expecting, I guess, second quarter cost trend to be above baseline levels? And related to that, I'd just be curious if you're seeing any signs of a recovery in surgical procedures that some other med tech companies have talked about in April? Just be curious on your updated second quarter outlook. John Gallina : Yes. Thanks, Nathan. I appreciate the question. We did end the quarter better than anticipated, but still above baseline, certainly, very pleased with our start for the year. However, there is still uncertainty, boosters, vaccination, potential spikes in COVID. But we feel very good about where we are right now. And with those unknowns, we still believe that we want to take a prudent posture to our guidance. With that, though, right now, we have a bias that our medical loss ratio is going to be closer to the midpoint to the lower half of the range. So it is an improved outlook from what we talked about 90 days ago, but still very prudent given the overall circumstances. Thank you for the question. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : I wanted to ask about the significantly higher interest rate backdrop we find ourselves in. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how you think this will impact your investment portfolio over the next couple of years as your investments mature and reinvested. And also, I guess, how should we think about this as impacting the EPS growth rate you're targeting over the next few years? Wondering, if there is going to be used potentially invest further in the business or potentially this could help fuel you towards the higher end or maybe even slightly above the outlook you've laid out? John Gallina : Sure. Thanks for the question. I'll take that one as well. On the interest rates and its impact, you look at our investment portfolio we have about $35 billion in fixed maturities at this point in time. And about 30% of that $35 billion is in variable rate. So, there is an immediate benefit that portion of the portfolio gets from the rising interest rates. And then you look at the other half of the balance sheet. And as you know, we try to target close to a 40% debt-to-cap ratio. We're at 39.2% at the end of the quarter, so very much in line with our targets. And that right now is about $23 billion of the debt, and only less than 10% of that is variable rate which obviously will go up. So we're actually winning the arbitrage game from that perspective. And so the rising interest rates are actually a net, net, good guide to us. In terms of long-term earnings expectations, we're still very comfortable reaffirming the 12% to 15% growth rate in EPS that we've been talking about here since our last Investor Day. And I think what these interest rates do is give us a lot more flexibility in terms of decisions that we can make and be more strategic with those decisions here in the future. Thank you for the question. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Whit Mayo from SVB Securities. Please go ahead. Whit Mayo : Gail, can you elaborate more on the carve-out opportunity with Beacon? And myNEXUS, maybe just more specifically myNEXUS and just elaborate like you're doing differently? It sounds like something is new here. I've kind of thought about this more as a utilization management play, but I hear you talking more about risk. So, just anything that strategically changed would be helpful. Gail Boudreaux : Great. Well, thanks very much for the question. And I think myNEXUS is a great example as our AM and Beacon and some of the other assets that we have inside of the Diversified Business Group. When we brought myNEXUS into the family, the opportunity, obviously, to transition patients from the hospital to the home, we had strong expertise with them already in our Medicare Advantage business. But part of our goal is to do two things : one, to take our assets and embed them in our value-based payment arrangements. So as I mentioned, we have a number of those arrangements already that we're working on, both with primary care assets that we've invested in, plus also those that we're moving to value-based care. We see that as a downstream opportunity, but we also have an opportunity to capitate that business inside of Anthem's health plan and there's a huge runway for us there. And so, generally, we've started in our diversified business group first with a fee-for-service arrangement. And then as we get confidence in our ability to execute and do well with that, we're moving that along the risk continuum to cap, and that's a good example of that. It might be a good opportunity for Pete to share a little bit about how he sees what's happening in our diversified business group, and maybe even talk a little bit more about myNEXUS capabilities. Pete? Peter Haytaian : Yes, I would -- appreciate that, Gail. And I think Gail answered it really well comprehensively. I would say though, what you've sort of referenced a change in strategy, let me just reiterate what our strategy is. We're really focused on managing the complex and chronic patients and managing the complexities in health care more generally. And as Gail said, our primary client is Anthem. The opportunity is very fast. When you think about the complex and the chronic members and the spend associated with that population, you're talking about around $12,500 per member per year. Compared to an average commercial member, that's about $4,500 per member per year. So you can see there's a lot of spend there, a lot of opportunity there. And as Gail said, as we get more mature in the development of our assets, when you think about things like myNEXUS, we think there's a lot of opportunity to actually grow the portfolio. Yes, it is known towards UM capabilities and its access to care capabilities in terms of managing home care, but we see a lot of natural extension opportunities. So for example, we're very focused on post-acute care. We're very focused on DME as an opportunity. We're focused on social determinants of health. These are all areas in that complex and chronic category, where we can ultimately take risk and drive more value for our health plan businesses, creating predictable and stable cost of care, but then importantly, generating value in the DBG and incremental value for Anthem overall. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Rob Cottrell from Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Rob Cottrell : I guess I'll ask about the upcoming national account selling season given the strength that you all saw for this year. Any early commentary you can provide given the kind of increased expectations for switching into 2023? Gail Boudreaux : Sure. Morgan, why don't you address that? Morgan Kendrick : Yes, Rob, thanks for the question. This season was spectacular. As John said, it was the best we've ever had in the Company. So I'll tell you, the business doesn't all -- the cycle isn't always the same. These very, very large cases, usually bid on a 36-month cycle. So certainly, we're not seeing the volume. It's interesting, we've seen some very early, very large 2024 prospects already that we're bidding on. But I expect the assets to continue to resonate and our win rate to be consistent with what we've seen in the past. We continue to build upon what we've done. And our digital assets are resonating quite nicely, our clinical assets as well. So, it's a bit early. We do have some wins already in cases and the volume differ by year and that's not inconsistent. So it's not unexpected. Thanks again for your question. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks, Morgan. I think, to add to that, he mentioned a couple of areas that have been really important for us. One is consumer experience, our investment in digital platforms. I mentioned Sydney Preferred has been very popular, along with our consumer advocacy model. And then the last area is our high-performance networks. Across all of the Blue system, I think we've done really well, and that's been a really strong validation of our unique cost of care position for the system. So thanks very much for the question. Again, really strong selling season and very encouraged by what we're seeing. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dave Windley : John, your DCP was up close to two days sequentially in the first quarter on what has already been a fairly conservative posture through the pandemic period. Could you talk about the drivers of that? Were there any kind of payment timing issues that might have influenced that? Or was that all just growth in IBNR? John Gallina : Thank you, Dave, and I appreciate the fact that you recognized that we've already had a conservative stance associated with our reserves. But -- our approach to reserves has been both prudent and consistent, and we obviously need to ensure that we follow actuarial standards and comply with generally accepted accounting principles. Associated with the first quarter, there is a natural seasonality aspect to the days and claims payable metric. And the first quarter has typically been a little bit higher than the fourth quarter on a sequential basis. And you can see that the last several years and that happened again this year. A lot of it has to do with a lot of new clients coming on, and we did have such a significant new sales activity. And as you know, we have 1.4 million new lives in the first quarter alone. And it usually takes a little bit of time for those folks to really get through to the doctors and get the manning and get all those claims paid. So, it's very natural to have a small increase in the first quarter. I would say that we feel very confident with the strength of our balance sheet and that the reserves that we booked as of March 31. They're very consistent with the reserves that were booked on December 31. So thank you for the question. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : I just wanted to ask about IngenioRx. And one, how it came out in the quarter versus your internal expectations? And then secondly, you talked about the strong growth in the commercial market. Can you maybe talk about the cross-sell opportunity, the penetration that you have? And did you see that pull-through come through here in 2022? Or is there a longer selling season once you bring the commercial member on? Gail Boudreaux : Thanks, Lisa. I'm going to have Pete address that. Peter Haytaian : Yes. Thanks a lot for the question, Lisa. First of all, we're really pleased with our progress and growth occurring in the pharmacy business. We're encouraged by what we're seeing and we saw through Q1 '22 in terms of the receptivity in the marketplace around IngenioRx around our integrated offering as we penetrate Anthem's ASO commercial business. In fact, we saw about a 300% year-over-year improvement in the members sold when you compare Q1 of '21 to Q1 of '22. And I do want to point out where we're seeing a really good traction, that's in the middle market and down market, where I think Anthem has a lot of strength. And we create a lot of value. So a really good place for us to be. As it relates to our operating game performance and the differences there, Q1 '21 over Q1 '22, it's really completely explained by a one-time positive reconciliation item that we mentioned previously in '21. Without that, we're completely on track. We remain confident in achieving our '22 operating gain expectations and our growth expectations. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Rivka Goldwasser : Can you give us an update on the New York group MA contract? There's some news that's been delayed from April 1. So when do you expect to onboard it? And how should we think about the impact on guidance for the rest of the year considering that I think it was supposed to be dilutive for 2022? Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, Ricky. First and foremost, I want to say that we are looking forward to serving the retirees of the city of New York and extremely -- remain extremely pleased about have been awarded this contract -- have been awarded this contract. We've had a long relationship with the city, and we do continue to administer those benefits for the employees and our fee-based business today just as a bit of background. As you mentioned, based on the legal challenge, the city did not move forward as planned on April 1, and the city has appealed the decision, however. At this stage, given that process, we'll share more definitive information when it becomes available. As you think about how you should think about the financial impact, it's not dissimilar from what we said on our last call when we had a three-month delay at hand, which was directionally slightly positive as we're still incurring, as you know, run rate costs from being ready to go on 1/1, and that still remains the case today. So thank you, question, and we look forward to serving the city. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Ben Hendrix : Just a quick question on your capitated strategy and increasing your downside risk sharing. I was wondering if you could kind of give us an opportunity or an idea of what the margin is there versus typical MA margins and kind of where that could go? What you're targeting? And how that is progressing with the capitation membership that you've achieved so far? Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks very much for the question, and thanks for bringing it up. I'll just sort of start really at a broader perspective. Our care provider strategy is really a core component of our enterprise strategy, which is the integration of our Whole Health focus. And we've set a couple of key things. One, better outcomes we see by capitating and moving to more upside downside risk. Certainly, higher satisfaction, better and predictable outcomes from our health plans higher star ratings, which we think because of the alignment drives and greater stability for our benefits business, MA, our Medicare Advantage business, but also our Commercial and Medicaid businesses are a really important part of the strategy. Over the past year, we've made some very significant advancements in that strategy, particularly with our investments in risk-bearing primary care providers and aggregators, but we've also been advancing those that we haven't invested in around our VBC process. And that ties very much to our high-performing networks, and we're seeing growth there, as I mentioned a few moments ago. So -- as I think about those and your direct question, these are a kind of an early stage. We do see pull-through opportunities. So there's more than just your question about how does it affect MA. We see pull-through opportunities in our diversified business group, and they're resonating things like combining Aspire with those groups in their palliative care offering. We just talked about myNEXUS a little bit. And again, those are opportunities for us against to advance our overall performance at Anthem generally. As we move, we're moving very specifically to your question, to move to more capitation risk within the Anthem health plans. This year, we started some of the services like AIM. But our strategy again isn't reliant on a single model. So, I want to again reiterate that I've shared that in the past. As we see our value-based care mature, we think that there's a number of models in that. Specifically, about 60% of our consolidated medical expense, as I mentioned, is paid under VBC. That number is interesting, but I don't think it's the most important. The number that we're really targeting is moving upside and downside risk. We have global capitation, and as I mentioned, Today, we're about low double-digit range across our enterprise, with about 40% in Medicare in capitated arrangements to put some perspective on that. Our target is that about 1/3 of our overall spend in value-based care by 2025 we'll have downside risk. So, again, a pretty significant move and again, that's across Medicaid, Commercial and Medicare do you get a sense of the breadth of the strategy that we're deploying. So overall, feel good about the progress we're making. I think there are a number of value drivers across our business beyond just the simple question around Medicare Advantage. But clearly, that's an important one, both for top line and bottom line in our Medicare as well as our other businesses. So thanks very much for the question. And next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : I want to understand a little bit better the admin fee growth of 7% against that really strong membership growth, and this movement of 5 :1 down to 3 :1. And just sort of understanding where you are on that path? And maybe what's the pushback from employers that aren't signing up for those additional services? And lastly, if you could just include stop loss as one of those services in terms of trends you're seeing, that would be helpful. John Gallina : Yes, thanks for the question. Certainly, we're very pleased with the growth. The admin fee growth is both a combination of the ASO fees on the fee-based membership along with the fee-for-service aspects of many of these add-on value proposition type services. And then, we -- as you know, on the 5 :1 to 3 :1, we're doing very well. We had about a year delay at the beginning of COVID, but we ended 2021. And it began 2022 at about 4 :1 within that range. And we still feel very good about hitting 3 :1 by 2024. In terms of the overall growth, I mean, look at the membership, I mean the membership is just going awesome, our best national account selling season ever, and that's obviously adding to the admin fee revenue growth. Gail Boudreaux : And maybe Morgan to comment a little bit about what's happening in employer decision-making? Morgan Kendrick : Yes. And, Josh, thanks again for the question. When I think about the reasons for the win, it's basically two things it's economics and experience. And when you look at the up market business, let's just focus there for a minute. It's one of the things that's consistent is buying various levels of advocacy services. So it's a heightened service model on the front end, which is probably north of 90% of our business. That's part of complementary to the just base admin fee that John described earlier. Also, we think about the clinical model that's unique and more elegant connecting back to a higher order front end. That's another model that we've seen great success for in the national market. In fact, we launched in 2018 with Total Health, Total You. Presently, we're sitting almost 7 million members across both the national business and local markets that have accepted that product and enjoying the product and what it's delivering. When you think about where the market has kind of evolved to your point around what people are looking to buy, I mean the labor market is tight. Most employers look at their health benefits as a human capital strategy, and they're looking for these unique nuanced ways to have a better solution rather than just a health benefits product. Lastly, commenting on your comment around the -- your question regarding stop-offs, there's a big opportunity there for us. When you look at the penetrable market, up market, we have a very, very large percent of it. We've got roughly 60% of our business in the stop-loss business penetrated today. We expect that to continue and look for different opportunities to serve our employers through value-based arrangements where it's a pay for value. And we do find the sign-up or the employer uptake to be quite large when it's positioned that way when payment is received upon value delivered. So again, thank you for your question. Gail Boudreaux : And thanks, Morgan, John, just to put a fine point on it, Josh, you think the strong growth that we've seen, particularly across the commercial business, is a really nice runway for us to add additional services. And that's really been the trajectory of our business over the last several years is continuing to consolidate employers and continuing to demonstrate our value first on the medical cost side but also on digital tools and other things that we're bringing to market. So, we feel good about the trajectory and the opportunity that we have. And again, very strong growth, and we're really pleased to see it. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : I'm just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color about what was driving the improvement in MLR, specifically, COVID, non-COVID? And if you can go into a little more detail about the types of procedures that you don't expect or that are coming in better than expected? John Gallina : Thanks, Kevin. Specifically associated with the first quarter medical loss ratio, really have to look at what the situation was when we first provided guidance. The Omicron variant was peaking at a higher point than at any time since the pandemic began. And the home testing rule adjustment issued, amongst other things. And so, part of the guidance that we provided at that point in time was having those facts in front of us. What would happen was is that February and then March had even a much more significant drop in positivity rate that we had seen for any of the other prior surges that we've had since COVID started. And then we're also very pleased that there is no evidence of any abuse or stockpiling of the free home testing kits that was part of our concern as well. And non-COVID obviously, went back up as COVID went down as this occurred at every phase through the pandemic. But all in, the cost structure was better than our expectations, still above baseline, but better than our expectations. And that really was the primary driver of the better performance in the quarter. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Just a quick confirmation question and then the real question. First, on the investment income, $360 million in 1Q, that puts you above the run rate for the full year guidance to $1.1 billion. I guess the question there is, was the $151 million of net loss on financial instruments in 1Q, was that part of the full year guide for non-investment income or is that separate? And the real question was just quickly just to confirm, a lot of the discussion around the seasonality of MLR. But as far as the comment you made last quarter about 55% of income in the first half of the year, is that that tossed out the window now? Or is that still valid as we kind of think about that comment that you made last quarter? John Gallina : Thanks, Steve. I'll see if I can answer both those questions. On the investment income, do not run rate our first quarter performance. And first of all, know the loss on the write-down of the assets was not part of that. The outperformance really to do with our alternative investment portfolio and some of the positives that has come through, we're very, very happy with that, but we do not believe it's run rate. And then associated with the seasonality and the MLR, again, we're very pleased with the strong start for the year. And we did raise our full year guidance to $28.40. Simple math will tell you, $8.25 is about 29% of the full year. Essentially, for modeling purposes, I'd say the current consensus estimates for the second quarter right now are a reasonable approximation of second quarter expectations. So hopefully, that helps. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Gary Taylor from Cowen. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : I might just piggyback on that last thought, John. I'd just go a little bit further. If we look at the last five years or so, MLR almost always grew sequentially every quarter. This year, because of the COVID cost you're anticipating, you had a different cadence that fortunately didn't play out. So the questions are, are we just back to a typical sequential MLR build through the year? Is that reasonable? And then same question for G&A, I think in the last five years, with the exception of one of '21, G&A dollars generally just grew sequentially throughout the year. It looks like now they would have to drop for a while otherwise you might miss your full year guidance. But MLR cadence, are we sort of back to normal? And then on G&A, do we -- how do we think about that over the next few quarters? John Gallina : Yes. Sure, Gary. Good questions. On the medical loss ratio, we're not completely back to normal. There are still certain things associated with the public health emergency, where various cost shares are waived. The free home testing kits, even though they weren't abuse or stockpiling of those, there was a cost. They did cost. And we expect to continue to incur those throughout the entirety of the public health emergency. So we think the seasonality factors will differ a bit from historical patterns because we're just in a completely different situation. And then associated with the SG&A and the cost structure, some of it is also opportunistic spending of accelerating investments in our digital areas when we have the ability to accelerate. And our expectation is, is that with the really excellent top line growth that we've seen, clearly, top line growth does include some variable costs that will obviously be incurred above and beyond what had been assumed. But we feel very good about still hitting our guidance numbers for the full year. So, unfortunately, I don't think our historical seasonality patterns are a great proxy given the situation that we're in this year. Gail Boudreaux : I think we have time for one last question. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : John, mine is an MLR-related question. It has to do with medical cost inflation. And I guess could you talk about what you guys are seeing as it relates to cost inflation? I'm thinking about things like provider wages and medical supplies that could be inflation impacted versus what you guys are doing to offset that. And the question really is, are you guys seeing inflation yet? And maybe if you can rank order the big buckets of what you can do to offset inflation? Clearly, virtual is one of the things you can do to offset capitation and risk sharing is another thing. Just trying to understand the big puts and takes as it relates to MLR cost drivers, focusing on inflation. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks for the question, George. I think, first, there's no question that the labor market is tight. So as you think about inflation, we hear it certainly from our provider partners, and we see it in certain parts of our own business. Now let me start with the biggest bucket, which is hospital pricing. As you know, the majority of our contracts are three years in duration. So, we negotiate roughly 1/3 of those each year. And yes, there is more pressure on the system. But at this point, we're not seeing incremental rate pressure. And quite frankly, we believe our ultimate responsibility is -- that's paramount for our customer is affordability. So we have -- we're keeping costs contained to the lowest possible level and take that responsibility very seriously. It's really the core of kind of, frankly, what we do. We're also taking the opportunity though to change this conversation and make it less a transactional conversation and move to value-based care, which has been the core part of our strategy with all of our providers. So we believe that there is an opportunity to transition from just unit cost negotiation and volume-based discussions to value-based care. And our strategy is key in that context. So, we think that that's a core element of this, paying for outcomes and paying for value. We've been investing, as you heard through the discussion that we've had in tools that help our providers make that transition to value-based care and also help safeguard and mitigate some of the uncertainty that they have. So that's a core part of we think what's important in managing that. We're watching these dynamics closely. And we've been refining our high-performance, high value-based care model. So again, we think that an acceleration opportunity in our own business. We're strongly committed to digitizing and looking for end-to-end improvements across our business. We've been on a multiyear journey around that. We look at a number of areas around our own -- how do we improve experiences? How do we tie things end to end better? How do we improve our own efficiencies, looking at touchless claims, as an example, simplifying our pre-authorization processes, investments in better provider finders? So a number of the things that we're investing in around our digital transformation helps us in terms of our own internal cost structure, but also improves the cost structure of our trading partners, care providers and our customers. And again, affordability, we think, is critical in this environment in the scenario that we believe is our role and responsibility and are very focused on it. So, we have a number of tools or those on the provider side, really focused on value-based care and then on our own side around really changing workflows and digitization and moving much more aggressively into that space. So thank you very much for the question. I'd now like to close by saying thank you. We're pleased to have carried forward our momentum into 2022, and we're confident that the ongoing execution of our strategy positions us to continue to deliver against the financial targets we shared with you at our investor conference last year. Across our organization, we're accelerating innovation to advance our digital capability and resources simplifying our processes, improving our consumer experience and delivering products and services to champion a Whole Health approach and advanced health beyond health care for consumers at all stages of their lives. We're fueled by a passion for making a positive difference in the world and we're improving health by addressing consumer needs at a personal level, removing barriers to care and creating more meaningful connections across the lifetime of milestones and experiences. We'll keep executing with excellence and discipline to bring increasing value to all of our stakeholders. Thank you for your interest in Anthem, and have a great rest of the week.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session where participants are encouraged to present a single question. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Please go ahead. Steve Tanal : Good morning, and welcome to Elevance Health Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This is Steve Tanal, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning on the earnings call are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Peter Haytaian, President of Carillon; Morgan Kendrick, President of our Commercial and Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business division. Gail will begin the call with a brief discussion of the quarter and recent progress against our strategic initiatives. John will then discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, elevancehealth.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Elevance Health. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to share that Elevance Health delivered another strong quarter. In the second quarter, GAAP earnings per share was $6.79, and we grew adjusted earnings per share over 14% to $8.04. Based on our results in the first half of the year and the momentum in our business, we've increased our full year adjusted earnings guidance to greater than $28.70 per share, representing growth of at least 13.9% off of the adjusted baseline we provided at the beginning of the year. Before we discuss the quarter in more detail, I want to spend a moment on our recent name change and rebranding strategy. We officially changed our holding company name to Elevance Health on June 28, having secured shareholder approval in May and are now trading under the new ticker symbol, ELV. This marks the culmination of a multiyear journey in which we have transformed from a traditional health insurance company to a lifetime trusted health partner, addressing the physical, behavioral and social drivers that we know are critical to achieving optimal health. Elevance Health captures the fact that we are now much more than a health insurance company and reinforces our commitment to elevating the importance of whole health and advancing health beyond health care for our consumers, their families and communities. Last month, we also announced the launch of our new health care services brand, Carillon, and the health plan brand, WellPoint, which joined the company's family of brands that include Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield. Our simplified brand architecture will streamline our brand portfolio, reduce complexities, and reinforce our evolution as an organization delivering solutions beyond health insurance. Grounded in our mission and fueled by our bold and ambitious purpose to improve the health of humanity, Elevance Health reflects our position as a health leader. Strong growth in all of our businesses continued in the second quarter, demonstrating that our employer, consumer and state partners are universally looking for whole health solutions that address underlying drivers of cost, while enhancing the consumer experience. Our strategies and investments in these areas are propelling strong organic membership growth, in addition to creating opportunities to scale our services division. Medical membership grew 6% year-over-year to 47.1 million members, maintaining Elevance Health's position as the largest insurer by U.S. medical membership. Over the past year, we've added more than 2.7 million net new members, including over 1.5 million net new government members and nearly 1.2 million net new commercial members. In Medicaid, the ongoing suspension of eligibility redeterminations and our industry leading RFP win rate continues to drive organic growth, which we continue to supplement through programmatic health plan acquisitions consistent with our strategy. In the second quarter, we closed the acquisition of Integra Managed Care, a Medicaid plan in New York focused on patients in need of long-term support services to help them live in their homes and communities. We're excited to welcome the Integra team to the Elevance Health family. Their commitment to patients with complex and chronic needs is well-aligned with our focus on serving the needs of the people who need us most. In Medicare Advantage, personalized health solutions are resonating with seniors, notably dual eligible members with complex and chronic needs and our supplemental benefits, which emphasize social drivers of health, supporting members with in-home support, transportation needs, healthy groceries, assisted devices and more, continue to gain traction. We remain on track to produce double-digit organic growth in our individual MA business, led by growth in duals, and are excited about our plans for 2023. In the employer market, our share gains are being driven by our leading cost-of-care position and innovative solutions focused on consumer experience and engagement. Employers have come to expect more, and we're investing to meet their needs. Today, we have strong traction in our total health connection's fleet of advocacy solutions that serves 3.9 million members, representing a 33% year-over-year increase. The programs guide members to the next step in care through a simple, intuitive and personalized experience. We leverage real-time data analytics to identify health risks so their advocates can personally connect with members to proactively facilitate preventive and, at times, responsive care. Our commitment to whole health solutions extends to our care providers, where we continue to advance value-based care and are increasingly looking to integrate health equity and social drivers of health measures into our contracts. The early indicators we are seeing in Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid businesses demonstrate that value-based care delivers higher quality care and greater affordability. In fact, our value-based providers are helping us achieve significantly higher quality scores for impacted plans, including an 8-point improvement in quality compliance measures for Commercial members and value-based arrangements. In addition, our value-based provider partners are conducting 12% more annual wellness visits with our members on average and delivering lower overall costs for our Commercial, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid members, with 19% lower emergency cases per 1,000 for members and value-based arrangements, compared to those not and 15% lower inpatient admissions. With the highest local concentration of membership of any health insurer, we're taking a market-by-market approach to our provider strategy to accelerate value-based care. Our local market density is unique and a valuable strategic advantage that provides optionality, allowing us to balance partnerships and investments in certain care models and geographies with select ownership through Carelon in markets where we see opportunity. We do not believe a single primary care model will prove superior for all populations and markets over time, and we are committed to a thoughtful approach that considers the structure of care delivery in our local markets and our membership density across lines of business, notably with respect to complex and chronic members. With our deep roots in our communities, we're continuing to leverage our proprietary Whole Health Index, a dynamic model tracking the health of our communities across local, social and clinical drivers. We're increasingly using the tool to measure our impact on the health of our communities and to identify and better address local, social and physical drivers of health with an emphasis on health equity and members who need us most. We've leveraged the tool to identify at-risk or equity-challenged member populations across Medicare, Dual Special Needs plans, Medicaid and our Commercial exchange-based populations and we're working with community-based partners to coordinate engagement, outreach and support, bridging physical, behavioral and social services. In practice, we're reimagining the ecosystem of care delivery for our most vulnerable members with plans to scale learnings for even greater member impact in care coordination overtime. We're privileged to be in a position to positively impact our members' lives, especially in light of the challenges faced since the beginning of the pandemic. In addition to helping us achieve our purpose as an organization, to improve the health of humanity, we're confident that our efforts are being recognized through our industry-leading Medicaid RFP track record. Core to our enterprise-wide focus on Whole Health, we also continue to accelerate our service and capabilities business through Carelon to connect people to accessible, affordable and integrated care with focus on those with complex needs. The top priority for Carelon today is to work in concert with our health plans to develop offerings that drive differentiated value for the 47 million medical members we serve, including more than 20 million fully insured members and the more than 118 million consumers we support across Elevance Health. Partnering with owned and aligned providers, our near-term focus is driving greater affordability and quality outcomes by providing the right care in the right settings, such as enabling care in the home or more effectively managing specialty pharmacy. As an example, myNEXUS, with its deep experience in managing home-based care, recently launched a new post-acute care product serving our Medicare Health Plan in Indiana via a capitated risk-sharing arrangement. Enabling providers with better technology and tools, myNEXUS will help optimize appropriate levels of care post inpatient discharge, delivering a much better patient and provider experience while having a positive impact on our health plans and driving growth for Carelon. Over the next six to 12 months, we expect to scale the post-acute care product to all of Elevance Health Medicare markets. For more than 30 years, we've been recognized as a leader in behavioral health management, an area that is a major driver of healthcare cost today and a critical component of whole person health. We manage behavioral health benefits inside of Carelon for more than 40 million consumers. And our expertise in this space was reinforced recently when Beacon, a Caroline Company, was awarded a contract to participate in the operation of the new 988 National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. The launch of 988 is a game-changing shift in how mental health services are accessed in our country, and we're proud to be part of this historic milestone. Guided by our enterprise strategy, we are fueled by a passion for making a positive difference in the world. In fact, environmental, social and governance frameworks are integral to our enterprise strategy. And we understand the connection to long-term business success. Accordingly, we continue to invest in key areas such as health equity, greenhouse gas mitigation and community health as part of our ESG practices. We're also proud to be an initial signatory to the healthcare sector climate pledge focused on achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. We are confident in our organization's ability to adapt and to achieve our pledge, having met our goal of powering all of our operations with 100% renewable electricity earlier this year, four years ahead of schedule. We're proud that these efforts have been recognized externally. Elevance Health was recently named to Points of Light 2022 List of the Civic 50, a national standard for corporate citizenship. Just 100 ranked our organization first among healthcare providers for just business behavior. And we are the highest rated managed healthcare company by ISS and Sustainalytics, including a perfect quality score from ISS. In closing, I'd like to thank our nearly 100,000 associates for the important work they do every day on behalf of the members we are privileged to serve. Our passion to improve lives and communities is unwavering, and we look forward to making a meaningful difference as Elevance Health. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John for more on our operating results. John? John Gallina : Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter results, including GAAP earnings per share of $6.79 and adjusted earnings per share of $8.04, reflecting growth of more than 14% year-over-year. We were pleased to deliver another quarter of double-digit growth in revenue, operating income and adjusted earnings per share, driven by the disciplined execution of our strategy. Our results exceeded our expectations. And with momentum in all of our businesses and confidence in our growth trajectory, we have increased our full year earnings per share outlook. We ended the second quarter with 47.1 million members, up 2.7 million or 6.1% year-over-year, including growth of 276,000 members in the second quarter. We grew enrollment year-over-year in each of our benefit businesses with approximately 90% of our membership growth being organic, supplemented by the acquisitions of the Paramount and Integra Health Plans, which added 255,000 members and 43,000 Medicaid members in the first and second quarters of this year, and together strengthened our footprint in two attractive existing markets. Second quarter operating revenue of $38.5 billion increased $5.2 billion or approximately 16% over the prior year quarter, with strong growth in each of our businesses. We earned higher premium revenue driven by membership growth in Medicaid, Medicare and Commercial; premium rate increases to cover overall cost trends; the acquisitions of Paramount and Integra; and the timing of the MMM acquisition, which closed at the end of the second quarter in the prior year. Our services businesses, Carelon and IngenioRx, produced very strong growth. IngenioRx revenue grew 14% year-over-year, while the other segment revenue, comprised primarily of Carelon, grew operating revenue 31%. The strong performance in our services businesses is being driven by the disciplined execution of our strategy to work side-by-side with our health plans, the scale services that drive differentiated value for consumers, beginning with the more than 47 million medical members, which includes the more than 20 million that are fully insured, for whom we can more quickly roll out new capabilities. Beyond helping to improve our members' lives and reducing health care costs across the system, the growth of Carelon and IngenioRx are aiding diversification of Elevance Health's businesses and producing cash flow in noninsurance and therefore, nonregulated entities. Revenue eliminated in consolidation, a proxy for business between Carelon and IngenioRx and our own risk-based health plans grew 24% year-over-year in the second quarter and represented 21.8% of the consolidated benefit expense, up from 20.5% a year ago. The consolidated benefit expense ratio for the second quarter was 87%, an increase of 20 basis points over the second quarter of 2021, driven primarily by the shift in mix business towards government programs, which carry higher medical loss ratios relative to the Commercial business. The overall medical cost insurance businesses remained higher than what we consider to be a normalized level had the pandemic never happened, with Commercial furnace above, Medicare near normal cost levels, and Medicaid still somewhat below. However, medical costs in the quarter were slightly favorable to our expectations. We expect the cost structure for health plans to remain somewhat elevated in the back half of the year, which is reflected in our guidance. Elevance Health's SG&A ratio in the second quarter was 11.1% on a GAAP basis, a decrease of 40 basis points over the prior year quarter. The decrease was driven by expense leverage associated with strong growth in operating revenue, partially offset by higher investments to support our growth. Second quarter operating cash flow was $2.5 billion or 1.5 times net income, which includes the impact of higher working capital in relation to certain provider pass-through payments in one of our Medicaid states that we anticipate will be paid in the third quarter of this year. As a reminder, we also continued to expect to pay $500 million, which is our share of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association's litigation settlement. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 39.7%, in line with our expectations and consistent with our target range. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of common stock for $624 million. Year-to-date, we've been opportunistic with respect to share repurchases during periods of volatility in our stock and have already repurchased 2.5 million shares for $1.2 billion. Our full year outlook of $1.5 billion is, however, still an appropriate figure for full year modeling purposes. We continue to maintain a prudent posture with respect to reserves. Days and claims payable stood at 47.8 days at the end of the second quarter, an increase of 0.9 days sequentially and a decrease of 0.3 days year-over-year. ECPs would have been 46 days, excluding the timing of certain provider pass-through payments that we will anticipate in the third quarter of this year. As a reminder, DCPs were elevated by 1.6 days in the second quarter last year due to the timing of acquisitions. Normalizing for timing-related impacts, DCPs are very consistent on a year-over-year basis. Given stronger-than-expected performance year-to-date and the continued momentum in each of our businesses, we are increasing our full year earnings outlook. We now expect adjusted earnings per share to be greater than $28.70, implying growth of approximately 14% off of the adjusted baseline of $25.20 provided at the beginning of the year. In closing, we are pleased to have delivered another strong quarter, our first reported as Elevance Health. In my 28 years with the company, this is easily the most prepared and well-balanced our enterprise has been as we look into the future. Strong underlying fundamentals, coupled with our balanced and diverse set of businesses, gives me confidence in our ability to deliver another strong year of growth in 2022, regardless of how the macroeconomic environment evolves. The diversification of our enterprise and the resilience that provides is an extremely valuable asset. Consider that in 2021, operating revenue of our Commercial and Specialty businesses represented just 25% of our total gross operating revenue, down from nearly 70% in 2008. And for the first time last year, operating earnings in our government business exceeded operating earnings in our commercial business. It is no coincidence that we have produced strong growth for our enterprise in both good and bad times for the broader economy in recent years. Simply put, we are well-prepared to meet the needs of our clients should they evolve in response to a more challenged business environment. Today, the momentum in each of our businesses, driven by the disciplined execution of our strategy, coupled with the diversity of our businesses, positions us uniquely well. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Just maybe drill down a little more on the comments around the commercial business. I know the commercial operating margin dipped year-to-year to 7.6%. And I wondered, it sounds like you're seeing elevated utilization there. Is that something that you just think is temporary? Will that correct itself? And are you moving toward making pricing adjustments for 2023 on that? Or is this sort of the run rate to go forward with? Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, A.J. I think as you think about our commercial business, there's a couple -- like I want to parse out a little bit of what you're seeing in that business, because I think it's important to first look at the entire business. One, we've had strong and consistent growth and feel pretty good -- very good about our business in the last few years. And there's two elements. One is obviously the risk-based business and the other fee-based business. I'm going to start with the fee based, and I'll address your question directly on risk base. In terms of the fee-based business, we're making really good progress on the strategy around margin improvement. And as we've laid out on the five to one to three to one strategy, and we continue to grow our fee-based business, I think, at an industry leading rate. And just a couple of, I think, proof points that help show that even inside of the totality of the business, our fee revenue grew 7.9% year-over-year, and then if you just look at it sequentially, 7.3% for the six months ending June 30th, which shows that acceleration of growth that we've been talking about. And you compare that to our membership, which grew about 3.4% year-over-year. So clearly, there is really good improvement. And I think we're very much on the progression that we described at our Investor Day to improve our revenue for fee-based members. Turning to the operating margin, more in our risk-based business. As I've shared before, that does remain challenged by COVID, and that really is what we believe to be the most significant issue, and we do think it's transitory. We do expect our margins to recover to the pre-pandemic levels and are taking actions to do that. You saw an improvement overall from first to second quarter. But again, this has to pace through as we do renewals. The last thing I would say is, we also know we've been in this pandemic now for several years. COVID is not going to zero. Ultimately, as we think about our pricing in the commercial market, we're not changing anything about the approach or philosophy that we've used historically, we're always pricing to our forward view of costs. If you look at this year, COVID hit at a time high in January and February. So, as we look to forward pricing, we're looking around all of our costs and now, I think, have a much better perspective on projection of what those costs should be. And so, you'll see ratable improvement over the course. And maybe I'll ask John to just talk about your question on utilization a little bit. John? John Gallina : Yes. Thank you, and good morning A.J., and associated with utilization, in our first quarter call, I think we were very clear that the Omicron surge in January was most significant to the commercial market. And so that obviously has a direct impact on the commercial margins. And even as we go through the full six months and project out for the rest of 2022, we do believe that commercial will have a cost structure, when you add COVID and non-COVID combined, to be in excess of baseline -- above baseline actually each quarter for the year. Medicare is going to be close to baseline. And Medicaid, we expect to be a bit below baseline. Overall, the entire company above baseline for the rest of the year. So clearly, those cost structures being directed more towards the commercial marketplace have a direct impact on the commercial margins that you're seeing. And as Gail said, we do believe that they're transitory, and that we will price the forward trend for the future. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks. Next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks, good morning. If I could just follow up on A.J.'s question first. You have a 2025 margin target, I think, in the Commercial business of 11% out there. Let's say, you do close to 8% this year, do you still take 11% a reasonable target for 2025? And if so, how do you think the pace of kind of getting there is over the next three years? And then my question would just be, can you give us an update on the City of New York contract? Looks like you pulled out of that, can you give us some background on how that affects numbers? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Sure. Well, thanks for the question, Justin. Let me address your first question. We have not changed our 2025 perspective in the short run, different impacts that we didn't obviously have at the time we gave that, but we haven't changed anything about our 2025 overall margin perspective across the businesses that we shared. So, I just want to be really clear about that. In terms of your second question, the City of New York contract, a couple of things on that. One, when we originally bid on this contract, it was set to go live in January 1 of this year. But as you know, and we've shared on this call, due to litigation, that go-live date has been delayed several times now. Based on the fact that we've been on in the active litigation, we had asked the City for some certainty around exactly what the benefits would be. And also, quite frankly, Medicare Advantage contracts take a lot of work to put up, and we want to make sure that the members were best served. We've served these members for a long time, and we needed greater certainty. So we did not feel, based on the inability of what's going on with the litigation as well as being prepared, that we could go forward with the contract. And then notably, the City remains one of our very important customers, and we continue to serve those clients on a fee-based business. So that's where we stand on the city in New York. Thanks very much for the question, though. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Lance Wilkes : Yes. Could you talk a little bit about the Carelon business. And in particular, I'm interested in as you look at penetration in the fully insured and the self-insured business, what is the current status of kind of product penetration there? And what are the biggest opportunities for you as you drive that forward? Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, Lance. I'm going to have Pete Haytaian, who leads Carelon, please address that. Pete? Peter Haytaian : Thanks, Lance. Appreciate the question. First of all, we're really pleased with our progress and performance in Carelon so far from a growth and operating perspective as we build up the services business. Overall, Q2 is in line with the improvements we expected. I'm really pleased with the performance improvements across all the verticals. As we've discussed before, Lance, one of our main focal points is really driving more capitation and risk through Carelon. So as it relates to progress, we're really executing on that strategy with strength. So from a cross-selling perspective, we've played that through in Beacon, in AIM and with myNEXUS. As we talked about with AIM, we just finalized capitating a lot of the services this year starting last year. We're also executing on our strategy associated with growth, and I'm really excited about the innovation that's occurring. Gail mentioned in her remarks, a really great example is the rollout of a post-acute care offering being myNEXUS indexes. This is a great example of penetrating our business to a greater degree. I think you've heard me talk about this before, but one of the things we're trying to do is naturally extend our offerings and penetrate our business to a greater degree. And that's exactly what the supposed acute care offering is. We're taking the tools, technology and capabilities of myNEXUS, and we're utilizing that with a new offering to penetrate the Medicare business in a much more broad way. So I'm really thrilled with the progress. You'll continue to see that. I think the opportunities are vast in terms of further penetration. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks, Pete, and thanks for the question, Lance. And I think, as Pete shared, we're excited about this business. It's an important strategic lever for us. But importantly, it's really early innings. And the examples that I shared in my early -- earlier comments to show that we can begin to implement this in certain markets, get experience on it on a risk basis and then roll it out to the rest of our 20 million-plus risk-based members and 47 million total. So lot of opportunity for us, but we also want to make sure we execute this with precision and benefit both our health plans as well as Carelon. So, thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Cal Sternick : Yes, good morning. This is Cal Sternick on for Lisa. A quick question on the Medicaid redeterminations. So what are you assuming for timing on when those will resume? And I know you've previously talked about retaining about a one-third of the members you added during the public health emergency period. Does that still seem like the right target in your view? Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question. I'm going to ask Felicia Norwood, who leads our government business, to please address that. Felicia? Felicia Norwood : Good morning and thank you for the question. As you know, the PHE was recently extended to October 13. So it follows that we are going to have Medicaid attrition related to redetermination that could begin as early as November. However, I would say, given back-to-school, it's also possible that COVID prevalence could rise around the September, October time frame or that the population might need boosters or other vaccines. So at this point, it's really simply too early to predict, but it's certainly possible that we could have a PHE extension into January of 2023. If there is another extension into January of 2023, that could lead to Medicaid attrition starting right around the February time frame. So redeterminations would then commence over what would be 14 months, given guidance from CMS that ask states to have up to 14 months to redetermine members and not redetermine more than one night of that membership in a single month. As we think about where we are, you should keep in mind that we operate obviously in 14 Blue states. And our Medicaid membership -- our total Medicaid membership, I'll say, has grown significantly across that platform. So as we think about where we are today, we are going to continue to work very closely with our commercial colleagues to make sure that we have in place a process for looking very thoughtfully market by market and having a view of the competitive dynamics in those markets and capture as much as we can inside of the Anthem 14 Blue states, where we will be offering ACA plans in nearly every county in 2023. So as we sit here today, we gave that early numbers, certainly with respect to 35% of that membership staying within Medicaid, another 45% or so going into Commercial plans, about 15% on the exchanges and 5% in uninsured, but the macro environment certainly has changed tremendously. What we'll say is that, we are positioned very well to navigate through the end of this PHE and the return of redeterminations when that happens, based on a very balanced portfolio here at Anthem, Elevance Health, I should say. And certainly, we'll continue to work closely with our Commercial colleagues to make sure that our members have access to care, continuity of coverage and can really navigate this landscape when redeterminations begin. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Felicia. I just want to reiterate one point, I think, that's really important that Felicia made, which she and John have said many times, which is the balanced portfolio that we have across Elevance Health. And one of the statistics that I think really brings at home is there's been more than 6 million Medicaid entrants as part of not doing redeterminations in our 14 Blue states. And we have significantly, regardless of the percentage you look at in our commercial business, have coverage now in nearly every county on our individual exchanges. So we've been planning for this. We're preparing for it across our businesses and feel very well prepared to manage that. And again, obviously, CMS has given the guidance to take up to 14 months and not determine more than one night at a month. So again, thank you very much for the question. But overall, we feel that we've got very good coverage. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Matt Borsch from BMO. Please, go ahead. Matt Borsch : Yes. Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to ask about, as you pull these pieces together or have pulled them together for Carelon, how are you thinking about home health? And I mentioned that in the context that, of course, an acquisition of a home health company by one of your largest competitors and also the issues in the home health area with the shortage of nurses and so forth, and how you're grappling with that, frankly, in the current environment? Gail Boudreaux : Sure. Pete, would you like to address that, please? Peter Haytaian : Yes. No, I appreciate the question, Matt. Home Care is a space we're really interested in. Our focus with Carelon, as we've talked about, is on complex patients. We've talked about being on the right side of health care, giving patients access to services in the most appropriate setting. And certainly, home is a critical component in that regard. I think when you look at our acquisition of MyNEXUS, which closed last year, and its focused on the home through utilization management tools and capabilities and partnering with a very vast network of providers, we have nine of the top 10 nationally to drive the most appropriate level of services in the home is a good example. Another example in terms of how we're penetrating the home today is through Aspire. It's a national leading company in the delivery of palliative care services. So, I'd say strategically, in the short-term, I mentioned this before, we've been looking actively for natural extension opportunities with regard to the assets we have. And again, a great example of that is the post-acute care launch that we just mentioned. We also launched most recently, as it relates to the home, the delivery of social determinants of health and star services via those capabilities. On a longer term basis, in terms of your question, we really -- we do continue to evaluate further opportunities in terms of direct care that can be provided in the home and delivering that value to all our Elevance Health plans and ensuring patients get the right level of care. And we are very sensitive to your last point about the labor issues. It's been interesting, but a lot of the companies that we've been partnering with have been able to effectively navigate some of the labor issues as it relates to home in terms of our members getting critical care. So, that's a good thing right now in the short term. Gail Boudreaux : Next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on the commercial selling season for 2023, you're obviously coming off a very strong national account selling season for 2022. Could you talk about maybe how those conversations have progressed for the upcoming year? And have there been any changes in the nature of those conversations just given the macro backdrop? And has that changed the opportunity to sell in services like pharmacy or stop loss or others? Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Well, thanks for the question. I'll have Morgan Kendrick, who leads our Commercial and Specialty Business, to address that. Morgan? Morgan Kendrick : Hey Nathan, thank you for the question. Yes, it's -- the business is cyclical. Typically, these cases renew on a 36 or 60-month cycle. So, you think about the very large year we had for the 2022 cycle, 2023 is down from that, and that's expected. There were a number of jumbos last year. What we're seeing notably, which is consistent with last year, is a number of cases going out for single vendor opportunities. That hasn't changed and what we've seen this year, albeit we have seen the dampening in the large jumbo cases in our geographies. But the conversations are consistent. You can certainly imagine, you alluded to the fact that we've got a talent challenge. And employers have shifted this concept to more of a human capital strategy and how they actually think about their benefits differently in attracting, retaining talent. So, that's been a big piece of it. At the end of the day, the conversations are generally focused around two things : number one, economics; number two, experience. When we think about the assets that we deliver from a network perspective, nationally, we score very well. Also, when you think about how we think about the experience component, Gail mentioned earlier our total Health Connection suite of services up 33%, with nearly 4 million of our commercial members. That's almost half of our commercial business is using that service. We think that's going to crescendo. So, we feel confident in it. Certainly, it's a smaller sales cycle. We're seeing that across the country. It's not notable to any geography, but we are seeing wins where we're seeing consolidation, and we're having -- we're starting to get the answers for the one-ones, they're affirmative, and we feel really good. Thanks again for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Yes, thanks. I'm going to have Pete address your pharmacy penetration question. Pete? Peter Haytaian : Yes. No, thanks for that. And working very closely with Morgan, this is a critical issue for us as we've talked about in terms of penetrating the Elevance book of business and our ASO business. And we continue to get really strong feedback from the distribution community regarding a lot of our solutions. Our pricing is coming in line. Many of our offerings, like our specialty cost relief program, our enhanced specialty condition management programs are really gaining legs as well as the way we're bundling offerings. How this is playing out in the market is a really good results and improvement year-over-year. We've experienced a 300% improvement year-over-year, year-to-date in terms of the total numbers sold. And importantly, I want to emphasize at this point, we're seeing a lot of growth in the middle market and down market, less than 10,000 members. It's a really nice sweet spot for us. It's where Morgan and the Commercial business do very, very well. And our margin profile is very strong as well as it really plays through on the integrated value proposition, and that is a big contributor to the five to one to three to one that we've talked about historically. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks, Pete. I think what you heard from both Morgan and Pete is really, we're very pleased that we're winning in the most sophisticated and discerning segment of the market, and that really plays across all of our customers. So thanks very much for the question. Next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Gary Taylor from Cowen. Please go ahead. Mr. Taylor, your line is open. Gary Taylor : Can you hear me now? Gail Boudreaux : Yes, we can hear you, Gary. Gary Taylor : Okay, great. Sorry. I just want to come back to Commercial operating income a little bit, obviously, you had growth -- modest growth this quarter. COVID still impacting it. I think earlier in the year, you had talked about some of the extreme quarterly seasonality in Commercial OI easing a bit this year, which would imply that Commercial OI growth in the second half will continue to look better. Just want to make sure that's still your expectation. And particularly with -- just in the early months of July, we are seeing COVID hospitalizations picking up again. Is it still your expectation that that Commercial OI growth can improve from what we've seen in the first half? John Gallina : Thank you for the question, Gary and good morning. Associated with the seasonality, I'll just clarify for everyone on the line of what we talked about during the first quarter was that there are many of the services that Carelon offers are being sold to Commercial on a capitated rate basis. And so the seasonality that historically would have been in Commercial associated with those services is now going to be in our Carelon segment and Commercial will have less seasonality. So yes, that is still playing out exactly as we talked about 90 days ago, and that will continue to be part of the quarterly cadence for both of those entities over time. And then associated with the overall cost structure. As I had said, I think in A.J.'s question, we are expecting the commercial cost structure for COVID and non-COVID combined to be above baseline again in the third quarter and again in the fourth quarter, which obviously puts pressure on the overall margins. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. And that, again, as John said, very consistent with the expectations that we've always had. Next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask about just for an update on the marketplace business, and if you can talk about how marketplace margins have been performing year-to-date relative to plan. Then also just some initial insights on how you're thinking about the pricing environment for the exchanges in 2023. Obviously, a lot of different moving pieces to pricing as there always seems to be in this business, but does seem that at least some of the most, let's call it, aggressive actors in the market have started to file for some firming rate increases. So, just interested in your perspectives on how pricing is looking for the exchanges next year? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Sure. Let me ask Morgan Kendrick to comment on that. Please, Morgan? Morgan Kendrick : Yes, Scott. Thanks for the question. Generally, your question is around how we think about the '23 pricing. Again, we've noted we really like this business. There's a great opportunity. Our margins are performing as expected, quite honestly, for '22. We're just now pricing '23. We're in the middle of that cycle. Your point is spot on, that there's always an actor that's looking to take aggressive share in aggressive pricing points in each geography. We are seeing some firming, but there's always a new actor that wants to come into the mix, so to speak. It is a competitive market, but we continue to look at this as an expanding opportunity. As Gail alluded to and Felicia alluded to, when we think about the Medicaid redetermination, we are now in north of 95% of the counties in the geographies that we serve. So, we feel strongly about it. We're taking prudent, normal pricing actions. Nothing's changed in our pricing strategy. We're pricing to the forward view of trend with all of -- in modifying for all of the challenges that are currently facing in the business or in the economies. That said, we expect it to be expanding. We've been notified some expansions in some of our largest geographies. We know that we look good in those geographies. So, over the next 60 days through -- 60 to 90 days, we will firm up the position. But right now, we feel quite good about it. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. And thanks, Morgan. I think sort of summarizing that, we feel good about this business. We've had a pretty consistent strategy. We haven't looked for outsized growth. We want to be in markets where we can be for the long term and that's why you've seen us year-over-year, expand the counties we're in as we continue to see the stability of that marketplace. So again, that business is performing along our expectations, and we expect to be in more counties. We see some opportunities, obviously, as redeterminations come in as a real catchers met for some of that. So, thanks for the question. Next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Thanks. Good morning. I guess mine is really just more of a confirmatory question around some of the comments on the elevated commercial medical cost trends. I think in one part of the Q&A, you mentioned the elevated costs relate to maybe more to the exchange individual membership within Commercial. So, I just want to confirm, yes or no, is that the bigger part of what's happening? And I guess just for further clarification, yes or no, is the group risk-based commercial book of business, in particular, seeing elevated medical cost trends above the pre-COVID baseline? Just a little more color around the two subsegments within commercial risk? Thanks. John Gallina : Thank you, Steve, for the question. So just for clarity, we have not provided any commentary associated with the difference between ACA and Group. We've talked about Commercial in total. So, I'm not exactly sure what comment that you were referring to, but it's not anything that was part of this call. And just to reiterate what I've said, we have seen overall cost structures in commercial to be elevated in excess of what a normalized baseline would have been, had COVID had never occurred. You can certainly look at the amount of membership that we have in fully insured risk versus ACA. And obviously, risk is the lion's share of the membership -- the group risk. I'm sorry, is the lion's share of the fully insured membership. So obviously, that is the primary driver. But overall, we do believe that the COVID costs are transitory. They're not going to go to zero, as Gail had said. We are going to proactively price for forward trend. But the impact that we have on our margins currently is a transitory piece of that equation. And so we feel very good about our long-term aspects. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks, John. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of David Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Windley : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question on Medicare Advantage. I think you're targeting double-digit growth this year, rolling your way to that. Wondering if that can be -- if that can continue next year, what you're thinking about for the open enrollment and competitive landscape there and with the necessarily healthy rate for 2023. So just views on Medicare Advantage. Gail Boudreaux : Sure. Felicia, would you like to address that? Felicia Norwood : Good morning and thank you, David. First and foremost, let me start by saying, we are pleased with how we are performing this year. We started with a very strong AEP, and that certainly has kept us on track to deliver double-digit growth in our individual MA business. You might also want to recall that most of our business continues to come in throughout the course of the year, because we have a very balanced portfolio when we look at our duals growth, and that membership comes in year round. It's too early to talk about 2023 and anything associated with double-digit growth. I will say, we expect to continue to have strong growth. We have what we believe will be very competitive products in the marketplace. Our benefit designs, which are really led with our supplemental benefit offerings as we think about whole health, continue to resonate with our consumers. And we continue to be very focused on going deeper in our markets, particularly in our Blue states. So when we think about how we are positioned today, with very nice competitive benefits, strategically, we've continued on that course as we head into to 2023. And I think we're positioned to continue to deliver strong growth. Long term, our focus and our -- certainly, our perspective on Medicare Advantage remains unchanged. This is a very attractive segment for us, strategically important with us and our Carelon services as well. And we're committed to continuing to deliver strong growth in our business. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes, hi. Good morning. So one clarifying question. You talked clearly about COVID plus non-COVID utilization being about above a baseline for the year and second half. What are you seeing for non-COVID utilization on the Commercial business? Is it in line with pre-COVID or below? And then secondly, can you comment on the sensitivity of commercial membership to potential changes in unemployment? One of your competitors talked about 50 basis points for every 100 basis point change non-employment. So just kind of like wanted to see if you have any context to give us there? And what are you hearing from your clients about their plans to manage their workforce? John Gallina : Thank you, Ricky, for that multipart question. Let me try to answer the first part of it, and then ask one of my partners here to reply to the other part of your question in terms of cost structure. So we have been really disclosing COVID and non-COVID combined as our total cost and not really specifying or trying to parse out the -- at least publicly, the amount that's COVID and the amount that's non-COVID. And I can tell you that non-COVID, all by itself, is a bit below baseline, even in Commercial. And then when you add COVID on top, the total of the two exceeds baseline. We have seen still ER utilization being down from pre-pandemic levels. Inpatient is actually down a bit here this year. Outpatient is actually up a little bit compared to pre-COVID levels or pre-pandemic levels. But all in, the cost structure is the cost structure, we have to cover it all, and we certainly will. So, hopefully, that gives you the clarity you need. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. And to the second part of your question, I think, I caught most of it, Ricky. But I think there's a few things, one, to your how are employees thinking about their workforce. As I think we shared a little bit earlier in the call Morgan did. Now we're really seeing, kind of, employers still expanding their workforce and looking for more benefits and to maintain the strength of their workforce. So we haven't seen any pullback yet in terms of our employer populations across any of the sized segments that we serve. That's not to say that, that couldn't happen. But at this stage, it's -- as you think about the challenges in the economy, they're more inflation-based than employment-based at this stage. And employers are still looking for strong solutions. One of the things that we're offering, obviously, is affordable products. We've been continuing to enhance our product portfolio. We have a very strong cost position. Again, one of the reasons we win is, we go in with a very strong medical cost position across all those segments. So I think from that perspective, we have not seen any noticeable difference. In terms of our own book of business, if you look at our history, we've got actually -- I really can't comment on the others who've given you some numbers around what they think would happen. But our book of business has been quite resilient. As you remember, we have a very deep -- we support school districts, public service -- public services, et cetera. And so, we have a very, I think, different profile across our businesses, and our history has shown that those have had greater stickiness during both up and downtimes in the economy. So, overall, I think at this stage, we're still seeing strong interest and strong growth from the commercial sector. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Robert Cottrell from Cleveland Research. Please, go ahead. Robert Cottrell : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow up on Medicaid. Given that now utilization within the Medicaid business has been running below baseline or below expectations for the past several quarters, is there any risk to states coming back to you and doing rate adjustments, given the lower-than-expected utilization? John Gallina : Yes. Thanks, Rob. Very good question. I would say, first and foremost, we are always working with our state partners to ensure that we have actuarially justified rates, rates that really mirror the acuity of the population. There is one really significant item, just to make sure that we're all aware of, and that's we're in an MLR collar or MLR rebate position in many of our Medicaid states currently. So we will be refunding back to the states amounts of the premium that we've been paid here this past year or so. And as we look at what future rate actions or rate filings could do, the first thing that they will do is they will reduce the amount of the MLR rebates before we end up with our final read. But at the end of the day, we feel very good about our ability to negotiate actuarially justified rates with our state partners. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Yes, hi. Thanks. I just wanted to ask about the assumptions you're making on utilization in the back half of the year and what we should think about through the MLR cadence there. So, appreciating that you're running above what you view as the baseline, but it does seem like other parts of the system view that they're below baseline, are expecting a ramp of utilization throughout the year. I guess how much of that is in your thinking for the guidance. Thank you. John Gallina : Steve, I'm not positive I can comment on what other parts of the system you're referring to without a little bit more specificity on that. But I'll just say that we track utilization very closely. We certainly understand the seasonality factors associated with utilization. I think Felicia even mentioned going back to school and things that, that might cause, and we're trying to factor all those variables in. And we actually feel very, very good about the analytics and the informatics we have associated with this information. So, we have certainly put our best thinking forward in terms of our -- in terms of the cost trends, the pricing and the guidance that we've provided. So, thank you for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Next question please. Operator : We'll go to the line of Whit Mayo from SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Whit Mayo : Thanks. I just wanted to go back to MyNEXUS for a second. Can you share like what percent of your MA membership is in states that you have delegated some services to MyNEXUS today? I'm just trying to think of the opportunity as you scale the partnership. And when you delegate risk, if that's what we want to call it to MyNEXUS, what are they doing with network tiering, narrowing the network when you optimize the level of care? Is that just reducing the allowable visits? I'm just trying to properly understand exactly what you're doing. Gail Boudreaux : Sure. Pete, would you like to respond? Peter Haytaian : Yes. Let me start with what you asked about exactly what we're doing on the post-acute care launch because it's something that we're really excited about in terms of the natural extension of the capabilities we have. Today, when you think about what MyNEXUS does, we have industry-leading tools and capabilities that really allow us to efficiently manage on the UM side. And as we've talked about, partner with our network providers and then effectively manage the level and appropriateness of services in the core product, it's in the home. So, when you think about the post-acute care product, just to give you specificity on what we're doing, we're really -- we're leveraging these tools for post-acute care management upon discharge of the patient out of the inpatient setting. And then through our leading portal, again, the tools and technologies that really differentiate us, post-acute care providers are easily able to make requests for services. It creates a much more effective and efficient experience for the provider. And this enables us to be very clear upfront in terms of the most appropriate levels of post-acute care. So, when you think about that in that setting, you think about long-term acute care facilities, you think about rehabilitation facilities, you think about skilled nursing facilities. And we're managing the appropriate level of services, and then we're eventually facilitating a discharge hopefully to the home. And as we've talked about, what Carelon does is we manage that entire episode of care on a capitated basis. This builds in predictable cost-of-care for our partners and the health plans in this case, for Felicia, in the Medicare business. And if we're effective at managing that, we are driving an incremental margin for Carelon and then incremental benefit for Elevance. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks, Pete. I think that there's two points that I wanted to highlight from Pete's subscription. One, a core part of our strategy that we shared about Carelon is moving from a fee basis to a risk basis. And so when we acquired myNEXUS, we did have a large participation with them and knew them quite well in our Medicare business, but on a fee basis. So this is the next iteration across all of our Carelon services, where we now have, I think, much better insight and can move this to a risk basis. So that was just the beginning and why I see early innings there. And then the second thing is we see this as a huge opportunity, as you talk about network strategy, pull this through our value-based contracts and our partnerships and relationships. And again, another core part of our strategy where we see this as a very synergistic. So thanks for the question. Next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Adam Ron : Hey, thanks for the question. This is Adam Ron on for Kevin. Going back to the comments about Medicaid, how should we think about maybe the impacts to margins from redeterminations? I could see two potential sources of margin compression that are pretty clear, like one is obviously just negative fixed cost leverage from losing membership. But more importantly, and I guess, complicated is the potential that healthy people are more likely to lose coverage first. So there are a risk that there would be a rate mismatch from the state for an extended period of time, it may take time to reevaluate the acuity? Thanks. John Gallina : Yes. Thank you, Kevin, for the question. And certainly, some of the questions you asked were may be consistent with some of the things we saw in 2019. So let me just maybe reference a little bit what's different now versus then. So in 2019, we went through a redetermination process. It worked through very quickly. And then the overall acuity of the population was a little bit higher than what the rates that had been set, well, justified. And just FYI, there were retroactive rate increases ultimately, but there was clearly a disconnect for a few quarters there in 2019, where now we have a very well thought-out process that's going to take up to 14 months that won't even begin until after the PHE expires. The other thing is, as I had mentioned in a different question, we're in an MLR collar position in virtually every Medicaid market. And so the immediate impact to any of the rates will first be to reduce the MLR collar position that we're in. In 2019, we were -- had very, very few MLR collars. But I think the most important element of all this is now part of how the pricing is done, that the -- thanks to some of the great work our teams have done, that the standard rating input now, as part of the Medicaid pricing, includes an acuity change factor. And that was not the case in 2019. That was a one-off conversation, and now it's part of the standard input into the rates for 2022. So all-in, we think we're in a significantly better position today than we were then. 2019 might be informative but it's certainly not a precedent. So we actually feel very good about our future state prospects. Thank you for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Ben Hendrix : Thank you very much. I just wanted to do a quick follow-up to Dave's question about the competitive backdrop for MA and duals. Clearly, supplemental benefit is a key area of competition as we go forward and this Medicare Advantage becomes more competitive. Just wanted to see if you could go into a little bit more detail about how you're differentiating your supplemental benefits and products for those members. And I think you had mentioned on the first quarter call, everyday extras. And just if you could go into more detail on that and how that's differentiating your offering? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Sure. Felicia? Felicia Norwood : Yes. Ben, thank you for the question. I will say that we were really early leaders in the supplemental benefit areas because of our focus on whole person health. And what everyday extras or what we call essential extras allow us to do is to allow members to really personalize the benefit that best meets their needs. All of our members are different. And at the end of the day, we think it's important that they are able to have a range of benefit offerings that either allow them to provide transportation, grocery benefits, whatever that need is from an overall Whole Health perspective. So, I think the differentiation for us lies really in the personalization. So, we've developed a range of offerings that allow members to really improve their overall health outcomes, and that gives them the flexibility to be able to decide what works best for them. So ultimately, I think that's the differentiating factor for us from a Medicare Advantage perspective. We've tried to make sure we continue with that stability as we head into 2023 and certainly give members the opportunity to make those personalized decisions that works best for them. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Felicia. And now we'll take our last question. Operator : For our final question will go to the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks for pick me in. So, with the rebranding complete, and it's been a little while since the 2021 Investor Day, could you just remind us the overall strategy at Carelon? And I'd be most interested in any areas of interest that have changed over the last 1.5 years or so and why? Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. And I'll have Pete address the Carelon strategy. But I think, what you saw certainly in our overall rebranding with Elevance Health is, our business has changed. We've been on a journey from just traditional health benefits, which are still important to us and continue to grow. And as John shared and just how our revenue has changed even over the last five years, a pretty significant shift. Carelon's a really important part of our move in the services strategy around the complex and chronic, but more importantly, that serving our captive membership already of 47 million members. So just maybe, Pete, you can talk a little bit more about how you see Carelon strategy evolving. Peter Haytaian : Thanks, Gail. And Gail just hit it at a high level in terms of our high-level strategies, advancing Whole Health and connecting people to accessible, affordable and integrated care. And as she said, our focus now is on the Elevance Health plans, 20 million fully insured, 47 million folks in total. And just to double-click on that, we're really focused on, on those complex populations. When you think about the spend in those complex populations on a per member per year basis, significantly higher at 12,500 for example, versus a standard average commercial number of 4,500 per member per year. And again, this creates a real wonderful springboard for us to sell externally and penetrate clients externally, especially the Blues. In addition, we talk a lot about being on the right side of health care, which, again, means providing services in the most affordable, highest-quality setting. So that's something that we're very focused on and ensuring that those are connected to the growing profit pools outside of traditional insurance. So, none of that has really changed. As you know, Josh, in terms of what we talked about historically, the verticals that we're focused on are care delivery, behavioral health, advanced analytics and services and then pharmacy. I'd say what we're very interested moving forward, I wouldn't say it's a change, but that we're very interested is a deeper interest in the home, as we've talked about, certainly, specialty pharmacy, where we're seeing trends accelerate. And we believe the opportunity is really vast to penetrate the Elevance book. And then finally, I'll close on something that we're very, very focused on and we believe could be a differentiator is how we connect with our digital organization and build a digital platform for health that really connects all these services in a cohesive and coherent way, ultimately for the patient. And that's something that we're actively working on. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Pete, and thank you to everyone for joining us and for your questions this morning. In closing, we're really pleased with the ongoing momentum in our business in 2022-to-date. And we're confident that the ongoing execution of our strategy positions us to continuing to deliver against the financial targets that we shared with you at our investor conference last year. We'll keep executing with excellence and discipline to bring increasing value to all of our stakeholders. Thank you for your interest in Elevance Health, and have a great rest of the week.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, where participants are encouraged to present a single question. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Please go ahead. Steve Tanal : Good morning, and welcome to Elevance Health's third quarter 2022 earnings call. This is Steve Tanal, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning on the earnings call are Gail Boudreaux, our President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Peter Haytaian, President of Carelon; Morgan Kendrick, President of our Commercial and Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division. Gail will begin the call with a brief discussion of the quarter and recent progress against our strategic initiatives. John will then discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, elevancehealth.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Elevance Health. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to share that Elevance Health delivered another strong quarter. This morning, we reported third quarter GAAP earnings per share of $6.68 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.53 ahead of expectations and reflecting strong revenue and earnings growth across our businesses. Based on our year-to-date results and confidence in our momentum, we are increasing our full year adjusted earnings guidance to greater than $28.95 per share, representing growth of approximately 15% off of the adjusted baseline we provided at the beginning of the year. Before we discuss the quarter in more detail, I want to spend a moment on the recent hurricanes that have tragically impacted the lives of people in Florida and Puerto Rico, including some of our own health plan members and associates who live and work in the impacted areas. As an organization deeply rooted in our communities, the impact of these disasters is personal. I'd like to thank our associates who are leading efforts to provide water, food, durable medical equipment, transportation and shelter, along with our clinical teams, social workers and behavioral health specialists for their extraordinary commitment to support those in need. It's in time such as these that our culture shines through and I am proud of our associates for the work they are doing to support their colleagues and communities. Turning to our business performance. We are pleased to report ongoing broad-based momentum across Elevance Health, a testament to our integrated and personalized whole health approach to addressing the physical, behavioral and social needs of our members and communities. Our focused efforts and investments in these areas are resonating with employers and state partners driving strong organic membership growth in our commercial and government health benefits businesses, as well as rapid growth for Carelon and IngenioRx. While our business trends remain strong, we are mindful of the inflationary pressure and general uncertainty in the economic environment and are focused on delivering affordability and value for customers and consumers in all of our businesses. Medical membership grew 5% year-over-year to 47.3 million members. Over the past year, we've grown to serve 2.2 million more consumers with both our commercial and government businesses delivering robust growth that solidifies our position as the largest carrier by U.S. based medical membership. In the employer market, we continue to gain market share on the strength of our leading cost of care position and innovative consumer products such as our total health connection suite of advocacy solutions. Total health connections is an example of where we're delivering an integrated whole health experience for consumers by guiding members to the next step in care through a simple, intuitive and personalized experience. Our clinical advocates help members navigate the healthcare system, leveraging real-time data analytics to identify health risks that enable our advocates to personally connect with members and help them proactively manage some medical, behavioral and social issues impacting their health. Health connections has grown more than 60% over the past two years and will support more than 5 million of our members in 2023. In addition to advocacy solutions, our integrated digital offerings are also gaining momentum. Sydney Health, the digital front door for our members' health needs, continues to rapidly expand the number of registered users and is now hosting more than 6 million visits every month. We are also seeing strong member satisfaction with our virtual primary care offering, which is available through Sydney Health and integrated into our commercial products and is increasingly being used to support members with chronic conditions such as hypertension and Type 2 diabetes. Our findings reflect that 62% of the top 10 diagnoses to date have resulted in the treatment of chronic conditions demonstrating that virtual primary care can improve access to needed care with the potential to improve health outcomes and reduce overall costs. Turning to our Medicare business, we're well positioned to achieve another year of above market growth in individual Medicare Advantage membership. For 2023, we expanded our Medicare Advantage offering to 145 new counties and added PPO plans in 210 counties, significantly increasing our reach into this important market as we continue to deliver differentiated value for seniors with strong core benefits and industry-leading supplemental offerings. With widespread pressure on the cost of daily living, affordability and value are more important for seniors than ever, and our health plans are positioned to meet their needs. Nearly 75% of our Medicare Advantage plans will have a $0 premium and no copays for primary care in 2023. Our supplemental benefits include popular over-the-counter offerings, transportation, dental and vision, as well as in-home support and healthy groceries. Seniors on our plans will also now have a simplified way to access and keep track of their benefits with a single prepaid card that is customized with spending amounts for their unique benefits and can be used at thousands of participating retailers or on an online portal. Medicare Star Ratings remain a key focus area across Elevance Health. Many of our affiliated Medicare Advantage plans continue to earn high quality scores and we're particularly pleased with the performance of our HealthSun Health Plans in Florida, which received a five star rating for the sixth year in a row in the recently released 2023 Medicare Advantage Star Ratings, which will impact the 2024 payment year. In aggregate, we did see a modest drop in the percentage of our members in four star or higher rated plans for the 2024 payment year, predominantly due to the end of COVID-era relief. And while we will decline by less than the overall industry, we remain intensely focused on our long-term goal of achieving and maintaining star ratings at the high end of all Medicare Advantage plans in our markets. Carelon continues to accelerate its impact and drive differentiated value for Elevance Health Plan members. In the third quarter, we began implementing and rapidly scaling the myNEXUS post-acute care management product, which is now serving our Medicare Advantage members in 15 markets with plans to add more markets in the coming quarters. This new product offering represents a major service line expansion that helps optimize appropriate levels of care post inpatient discharge by working with acute and post-acute facilities to safely manage patient transitions and thereby reduce hospital readmissions and average length of stay. Carelon is also delivering distinctive cost and quality results for our commercial business at scale. As we discussed earlier this year, Carelon\u2019s AIM Specialty Health business expanded its risk-based contract with our commercial health plans to perform focused management of select clinical conditions such as oncology, surgery and diagnostic imaging to cover our entire 14 state footprint at the beginning of this year. AIM has been performing well year-to-date, benefiting our commercial members while producing stable, predictable cost of care for complex conditions for our commercial health plans and driving growth for Carelon. Our enterprise-wide focus on health equity remains central to our strategy and continues to guide our business decisions and targeted investments. We were pleased that our Simply Healthcare plan in Florida recently achieved Health Equity Plus accreditation by the National Committee for Quality Assurance with an almost perfect score. Similarly, Anthem Blue Cross' individual exchange plan in California achieved NCQA distinction in Multicultural Health Care. Awards like these show our commitment and progress to identify and address local, social and physical drivers of health with an emphasis on members who need us most. These results would not be possible without the dedication of our more than 100,000 associates. And I would like to thank them for the important work they do and the impact they make every day. Their passion and commitment is reflected in our recent recognition as a great place to work for the third consecutive year, and also in our inclusion on the 2022 Fortune Best Places to Work For and People's, Companies That Care list. Our associates take pride in the work they do and the difference their contributions make to our company, our members, and the community. We see this every day and most recently in the results of our associate engagement survey, which showed that 96% of associates understand and are inspired by our purpose to improve the health of humanity. These strong results and national recognitions reflect our commitment to leadership and represent our employees\u2019 experience defined by high levels of trust, respect, credibility, fairness, and pride, and help our efforts to recruit and retain top talent, a reflection of our culture. Our passion to improve lives and communities is unwavering and we look forward to making a meaningful difference as Elevance Health. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John for more on our operating results. John? John Gallina : Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $7.53, an increase of approximately 11% year-over-year driven by broad-based momentum across our enterprise. We are pleased to have delivered another quarter of double-digit growth in revenue, operating income and adjusted earnings per share, driven by the disciplined execution of our strategy and ongoing growth of health benefits and services businesses, progressing us further down our path of transforming from a health benefits company to a lifetime trusted partner in health. We ended the third quarter with 47.3 million members growing 2.2 million or nearly 5% year-over-year, including growth of 232,000 members in the third quarter. Our industry-leading organic enrollment growth, which constituted nearly 90% of our total enrollment growth year-over-year, was led by strong sales in our commercial fee-based membership, growth in Medicaid driven in large part by the ongoing suspension of eligibility redeterminations and growth in excess of the overall market in our individual Medicare Advantage business, primarily driven by dual eligible members. We supplemented strong organic growth with the acquisitions of the Paramount and Integra Medicaid health plans which together added approximately 300,000 Medicaid members earlier this year. Operating revenue in the third quarter was $39.6 billion, an increase of $4.1 billion or approximately 11% over the prior quarter with strong growth in each of our businesses. We earned higher premium revenue driven by membership growth in Medicaid, including the acquisitions of Integra and Paramount; Medicare; and commercial risk and fee-based membership growth and premium rate increases to cover overall cost trends in all of our health benefits lines. Our services businesses, Carelon and IngenioRx produced a very strong growth as we continue to execute against our long-term growth strategy. IngenioRx grew revenue 11% year-over-year, while the other segment comprised primarily of Carelon, grew operating revenue 26%. Carelon and IngenioRx are delivering significant value to our Commercial and Government health plans. And consistent with our strategy, we continue to increase the breadth and depth of services Carelon is providing. Revenue eliminating consolidation, a proxy for affiliated business between our risk-based health plans and our services businesses, grew 17% year-over-year in the third quarter, representing approximately 21% of our consolidated benefit expense, up from approximately 20% a year ago. The consolidated benefit expense ratio for the third quarter was 87.2%, a decrease of 50 basis points over the third quarter of 2021. During the quarter, we realigned certain quality improvement expenses incurred since the beginning of this year, which had a favorable impact on our benefit expense ratio and an offsetting unfavorable impact on our SG&A expense ratio with no impact on operating earnings. Excluding the impact of the accounting realignment, our benefit expense ratio would have been approximately flat year-over-year and better than our expectations. We were pleased to deliver operating margin expansion in our commercial business, driven in part by stronger medical underwriting performance in our Commercial group risk business. The successful July 1 renewal process where we repriced approximately 25% of our large group risk business and the continued increases in penetration of services into our fee-based businesses contributed to the segment's performance. We were pleased with the retention of our July 1 renewals and have even more confidence as we approach the January 1 renewal date. Elevance Health's SG&A expense ratio in the third quarter was 11.4%, an increase of 30 basis points over the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily driven by spend to support growth and the realignment of certain quality improvement expenses as previously described. Excluding the realignment, our SG&A ratio would have improved by approximately 20 basis points year-over-year. Third quarter operating cash flow was $4.9 billion or 3.1x net income, driven primarily by the early receipt of certain fourth quarter premium revenue from CMS during the third quarter. We also paid our share of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association's litigation settlement of approximately $500 million in the quarter. Excluding both of these items, operating cash flow would have been $3 billion or 1.9x net income, another indication of high quality earnings. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 39.7% in line with our expectations and consistent with our target range. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of common stock for $579 million. Year-to-date, we've been opportunistic with respect to share repurchases during periods of volatility in our share price and have already repurchased 3.7 million shares for $1.7 billion, exceeding our initial outlook of repurchasing at least $1.5 billion in 2022. We continue to maintain a prudent posture with respect to reserves. Days in claims payable stood at 47.7 days at the end of the third quarter, a decrease of 0.1 days sequentially but an increase of 0.9 days year-over-year. Given strong performance year-to-date, we are increasing our full year earnings outlook. We now expect adjusted earnings per share to be greater than $28.95, implying growth of approximately 15% of the adjusted baseline of $25.20 provided at the beginning of the year. Our businesses are continuing to perform well with strong momentum that we expect will carry into 2023. While we will not provide specific guidance for 2023 on this call, I would like to review some known tailwinds and headwinds worth considering as we continue planning for 2023. Starting with the tailwinds, the continued execution of our commercial margin recovery in 2023 through disciplined underwriting to cover our forward view of medical cost trends, enhanced operating efficiencies and ongoing strategies to improve the productivity and profitability of our commercial fee-based business. The growth we anticipate in our individual ACA and employer-sponsored membership as consumers transition coverage when Medicaid eligibility redeterminations resume. We expect strong earnings growth in Medicare Advantage driven by membership growth in excess of the broader market and operating margin expansion that we expect will be driven by three primary factors. Number one, having 73% of our Medicare Advantage members in four-star or higher-rated plans for the 2023 payment year, an increase of 15 percentage points year-over-year. Number two, the continued recovery and risk adjustment as utilization has returned to more normalized levels. And number three, a relatively strong funding environment for the overall industry in 2023. Finally, we expect ongoing momentum in Carelon services and IngenioRx, which will carry into next year. Our tailwinds will be weighed against one known headwind, and that is the membership attrition and related impacts on our Medicaid business is eligibility redeterminations are conducted over the course of the next year. Although interest rates continue to rise rapidly, investment income is not expected to be a material tailwind or headwind. In 2022, we enjoyed significant outperformance in our alternative investments in the first half of the year. Rising interest rates are expected to benefit the second half, and we are anticipating a full year of benefit from higher rates in 2023. While performance in both years is expected to be strong overall, I would not call out investment income as a material tailwind or headwind for either 2023 or 2022 at this point. We\u2019re also mindful of the uncertain economic environment and the risk that business conditions could deteriorate. While the balance and resilience of our enterprise and the momentum we have across our businesses leaves us well-positioned for growth in the coming years, a more severe recession could create challenges. Our associates are prepared to adapt to any change in the business environment with detailed plans that ensure we will remain positioned to meet the unique needs of our clients and customers as they evolve with a commitment to affordability and value throughout. Accordingly, at this point in time, we expect to produce another year of growth in adjusted earnings per share in line with our long-term target compound annual growth rate in 2023, which is consistent with the current consensus estimate. We look forward to providing more specific guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. In closing, we continue to execute against the strategic priorities we mapped out at our 2021 Investor Conference and are pleased to have delivered another strong quarter while also continuing to reinvest in our business, better positioning us to deliver strong growth for years to come. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we\u2019ll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys, thanks for the question. This is Austin on for Justin here. On commercial margin, just focusing on that for a second. You guys showed some sequential improvement there, but it looks like you probably need around 300 basis points to kind of hit that 2025 target range that you laid out there. Just curious, on the pacing of that, how much are you expecting to come in 2023 and 2024? And then maybe a slight follow-up there. You mentioned retention, John. How did that track versus typical on those July 1 renewals? Thanks. John Gallina : Yes. No, thank you for the question, and maybe I\u2019ll start out and then turn it over to Morgan Kendrick to fine-tune some of the comments on retention. But in terms of the pacing, as I had stated 90 days ago, we expect that 300 basis points is a 2025 target, and it will be a little bit more heavily weighted to the beginning half of the time frame. So as you know, we just re-priced about 25% of our large group fully insured business here on July 1. We\u2019re going to reprice about 50% of that business on January 1. The other 25% goes throughout the year. Obviously, it\u2019s going to take a couple of years for that to get to the point where it needs to get to. And then the \u2013 really, the really nice trajectory and improvement we\u2019re having on upselling our fee-based businesses, our 5 :1 to 3 :1 strategy, it\u2019s going very much accordance to our expectations and the plans that we laid out, which actually do have us going through 2025. So I think the short answer to your question is a lot more of the improvements early on, but we will take till 2025 to get there. With that, Morgan? Morgan Kendrick : Thanks, John, and thanks for the question, Justin. As John said, this is going to be \u2013 it\u2019s going to take a bit to get it completely turned. July came in actually as expected. Certainly, there was some attrition in the large group risk business. To give you some concept there as it relate \u2013 context here as it relates to January, John said about 50% of that business is up for renewal. We have just released those in market. So it\u2019s a bit early to tell, but our expectations are that there will be some attrition, which is \u2013 would be natural when we\u2019re right pricing this business and we\u2019re unmoved by anything being different than expected as we move forward. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks, Morgan, and thanks, Austin, for the question. And I think as you heard from both John and Morgan, we feel we\u2019re making really good progress in this business. And as I shared in my opening comments, we\u2019re seeing really strong uptake, particularly in our fee-based business, along with the disciplined process. And so overall, it met our expectations on attrition to be real specific. So overall, feel very good about the quarter and where we\u2019re heading on commercial. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Thanks for the question. Maybe just get you to comment a little bit on the trends in the government business. I know you swung to a little bit of a decline in margin year-to-year in the government. Can you just parse out a little bit more what you\u2019re seeing there? And then any read on the landscape files and your expectations around MA growth next year? I know you said, John, I think, solid growth. I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any way to flesh that out further at this early date. John Gallina : Thank you for the question, A.J. So, our Government Business division is actually performing very well. And for the year, we\u2019re certainly going to be posting some very strong results. Both Medicaid and Medicare have been growing nicely. And I think that\u2019s evidenced by the excellent top line growth we\u2019ve seen of over 13% year-over-year. Medicaid\u2019s performance is strong, but for Medicaid, and we\u2019ve said this in the past, on a quarterly basis, results can be a bit more variable and susceptible to swings. And when viewed in isolation, any one quarter could be misleading. Medicare is continue to perform consistent with our expectations and, as you know, has significant upside for 2023. If you think about Medicare and the improving star ratings that I talked about in my prepared comments, the more complete and accurate risk scoring that will allow us to enhance the revenue in those areas. We feel very well positioned for the future of our Medicare Advantage book. And in terms of 2023 growth, it is premature to provide specifics associated with 2023 growth. But our goal is to clearly grow faster than the industry. And we have done that on a percentage basis now for the last several years in a row and expect to do that for the next several years ongoing. So thank you for the question, A.J. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. And thanks, A.J. Maybe I\u2019ll ask Felicia Norwood, who leads our Government Business, to provide a little bit more color on our Medicare Advantage. It\u2019s early. We just started the AEP process. And as John said, we feel confident about above-market growth, but she can give you a little perspective on just how we\u2019re seeing the marketplace. Felicia? Felicia Norwood : Yes. Thank you, Gail, and good morning, A.J. As Gail said, it was certainly very early in the Medicare Advantage annual election period. But we\u2019re pleased with what we\u2019ve seen so far around our competitive positioning. When we think about our supplemental benefits, they really compare favorably with our competitors, and we really lead the industry in terms of our everyday extras, our over-the-counter offerings, transportation benefits and certainly those things that are focused on addressing the whole health needs of our members and those social drivers of health. Additionally, as you know, we actually improved our footprint by expanding into 145 new counties on the HMO side and then 210 counties from a PPO perspective. So while we\u2019re early in this process based on the feedback we\u2019re getting from our distribution channel and others, we feel very good about how we are positioned as we head into AEP and look forward to continued growth in this business. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Lance Wilkes : Thanks and good morning. Can you talk a little bit about IngenioRx? And what I\u2019m interested in is both progress in cross sales for 2023 that you\u2019re seeing thus far in the self-insured book. And then with the contract with CVS ending in 2024, just wondering if you\u2019re entering into sort of a rebidding process or what the strategy is on a go-forward basis for that. Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks for the question, Lance. I\u2019m going to have Pete Haytaian, who leads that business, give you a perspective on Ingenio. But overall, I\u2019d just say we\u2019re really pleased seeing some really, really strong growth in Ingenio and more importantly, integrating it into our 5 :1 to 3 :1 strategy. So I think Pete can provide you a lot more granularity on kind of what we\u2019re seeing in the market. Pete? Peter Haytaian : Yes. Thanks a lot. I\u2019ll answer that question. We are very pleased with both the operating performance and the growth in Ingenio. Just to put a little bit more color on that. We are, as you know, trying to be a different PBM. We\u2019re talking about the integrated whole health value proposition. And that does continue to play through nicely in the marketplace. This year, we\u2019re seeing as it relates to your specific question on the ASO growth and 5 :1 to 3 :1, about a 300% improvement year-over-year in terms of net new members that we\u2019re selling this year. We\u2019re seeing good RFP activity. I\u2019d say really strong performance in the middle and down market where we perform very, very well financially and where integration actually plays very well. Up market, as you would expect, there\u2019s a little bit more stickiness, especially in light of the economic situation we\u2019re in. But overall, we feel very good about our growth and prospects as we move forward. As we head into next year, we\u2019re already into the 2023 selling season. It\u2019s well underway. We have good visibility on our growth. Again, we\u2019re seeing a lot of activity in the middle market and down market. The feedback we\u2019re getting right now from the brokers from a distribution perspective is our headline rates look really good. The other thing that we\u2019re very focused on as it relates to Ingenio is upselling additional products and services. So things like cost relief programs, specialty condition management programs and digital adherence programs. So it\u2019s moving in the right direction. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Was interested if you could just talk about the competitive environment and managed Medicaid a bit particularly as we\u2019re in a pretty active RFP cycle right now and with a couple of other big states coming up and with a couple of the competitors having \u2013 shown some improved momentum in some of the recent RFP results. So, interested just in the competitive backdrop and then what Elevance is doing right now strategically or tactically to try to keep your competitive edge of Medicaid. Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. I\u2019m going to ask Felicia Norwood to address your question. Felicia Norwood : So, good morning, Scott. In many respects, the Medicaid space has always been competitive, but you\u2019re right, it\u2019s certainly become hyper competitive recently and we continue to be, I think, well positioned around our success. When I take a look at the RFP process, as you know, states really delayed part of the RFP process in the midst of COVID, but things have certainly wrapped up significantly over the past year or so. When I take a look at where we are, our focus has really been around health equity, population health. You heard Gail referenced earlier our NCQA distinction with respect to health equity. And our state partners are certainly looking at health plans who can help them improve outcomes and focus specifically on those health equity areas that we\u2019ve been working on here at Elevance Health. So I feel strongly about our ability to kind of elevate and advance health for our members and address the needs of our state partners at a local level. When I look at the RFP opportunities, we\u2019ve been focused on certainly California was significant, a really big win for us. We won in every county, we were able to win in and we actually picked up a county that was a new county for us, so a very strong performance there. We recently also re-procured our RFP in Puerto Rico coming in first, and that demonstrated to me continued strong momentum in terms of our ability to address the needs of our state partners. And most recently yesterday having the DC City Council approved a new win for us in the district. So I continue to see momentum around our value proposition, being able to respond to the needs of our state customers and meet our Medicaid members where they are as we continue to focus on health equity, improved outcomes and advancing those issues that we know are very important to our state partners. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : Good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on medical cost trend. I think the MCR was flat year-over-year, excluding the accounting adjustment. Last quarter, John, I think you had talked about medical cost trend being elevated in the back half of the year, but it sounds like that might have come in a little bit better than your expectations. So what did you see play out by line of business? And as we think about your outlook for next year, how are you thinking utilization will trend into 2023? And if I could just add a quick clarification on the accounting adjustment, could you provide more details on what costs moved out of benefit expenses? And I guess, importantly, whether future periods will be impacted by this change? Thank you. John Gallina : Thank you for the questions, Nathan. So let me do the easy one first and that was the accounting adjustment. So during the third quarter, CMS provided clarifying guidance on the types of cost that can be included in the quality improvement cost and therefore, considered benefit expense versus those that need to be classified as SG&A. In our GAAP presentations have historically always mirrored the CMS definitions and requirements. So when CMS clarified those definitions, we realigned our reporting accordingly. And so just to be clear, the impact for the third quarter was to improve MOR by about a 0.5%, which would then make the negative impact on SG&A about 0.5% with no impact on the bottom line, clearly a reclass. For the full year, there will be about a 20 basis point impact on each of those. And then in terms, and we always, always try to be fully transparent. So, we wanted to ensure everyone was aware of the nuances in this reporting and what we will see by the end of the year of about a 20 basis point benefit to MLR for this clarification that CMS provided that we aligned with. So hopefully that helped from that perspective. And then in terms of the of the trends and costs and utilization in general, as you\u2019ve stated, you pointed out without the reclassification, our MLR would\u2019ve been flat, which is actually a nice improvement because of a mix on a mix adjusted basis. Since our government membership now is a higher percent of our fully insured membership than it was a year ago. So third quarter did come in better than expected, but the overall cost structure of the health system is still a bit higher than what it would\u2019ve been had COVID never occurred. But I think the most important element of all this is that our trends continue to be in line with our expectations in each of our lines of businesses. So, associated with lines of businesses, Medicaid is doing slightly better than historical levels. Medicare is very much in line. We\u2019re seeing outpatient a bit higher and inpatient a bit lower, helping offset to have a more normalized trend. And then commercial has been very consistent with our last several quarters where outpatient continues to be higher, but even more so than the benefit that we\u2019re seeing in inpatient. And so that\u2019s been all part of the process and all part of the guidance. So, we\u2019re obviously not going to comment on 2023 at this point in time, but hopefully that answers all your questions. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Great, thanks. Good morning everybody. So, I guess just regarding the potential migration in 2023 of the ineligible Medicaid members into commercial and exchange plans, I guess I\u2019m curious whether or not there\u2019s been any evolution in your key states that might allow Elevance to more directly funnel your own ineligible Medicaid members into your own exchange plans. So could this be more of a controlled process for the industry now versus maybe where it stood a year ago? Or would you still just describe the Medicaid market environment for 2023 is really just kind of a big jump ball for all MCOs to try to grab the ineligible Medicaid members next year? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Well, Steve, thanks for your question. I think just a couple of, I\u2019d say clarifications as we go through this process. We\u2019ve been working very, very closely with our states and across our enterprise. And a few things that I think are important that we\u2019ve shared with you in the past. One, we\u2019ve had a long time to plan for this and a long time to discuss this with each of our specific states, and each state will have a bit of a different process, but where we can, we\u2019re sharing data that the states allow us to do that. We\u2019re also working with community organizations to make sure that first and foremost, that everyone who\u2019s eligible for coverage retains eligibility for coverage. And I think that\u2019s probably where we start in this whole process, is ensure that those, just because of administrative things, et cetera, that we ensure that they have the right eligibility for the right program. For those that are not going to be eligible for Medicaid, again, we\u2019re working across our commercial business as well as our Medicaid business to provide, I think the most education and seamless transition. If you start just a little bit of facts for our business. If you think about our 14 commercial states, Medicaid membership in those states grew roughly 7.5 million beneficiaries in those states. We, as part of our exchange footprint, now cover pretty much all of the counties in our footprint of 14 states and also have incredibly strong market share, not only in the exchange, but also in our commercial benefits business. So, we think there\u2019s an opportunity, obviously with our brand recognition our dedication to this membership, our community involvement, and the work we\u2019re doing, again, with community partners, educating our commercial business to be quite frankly, well positioned and don\u2019t see it as a jump ball. We think we\u2019re actually quite well positioned in those states. And in terms of our own Medicaid membership, approximately 2.7 million members \u2013 million of those members came in as a result of the PAG and obviously we know those members well, they know us well, they recognize our brand. And so, again, based on the state rules, and regulations will be working very closely to help that transition. So, I feel like, given the time we\u2019ve had to plan the guidance from the administration, our work with the states, that actually this is going to be a much more organized process than I would call it just to jump all with a real opportunity for those who lead in the market to have an opportunity to move those members and keep coverage, which again, is our primary goal here. So again, thanks for the question. And we look forward to continuing to update everyone on our progress there. Thank you. Next question. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Rob Cottrell from Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Rob Cottrell : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, I just wanted to ask about the negotiating environment with health systems. There\u2019s been some conversation in the market about financial pressures across health systems leading to increased value-based care adoption. Are you seeing that play out across your negotiations and your contracting team? And do you expect that to ultimately have a positive impact for you all over the next year or two? Gail Boudreaux : Yes, thanks to the question, Rob. A couple of things. One, I think it\u2019s been well documented that, our contracts are on a three year-end duration, so we negotiate again about a third of them each year. So that just gives you a little context to the sort of discussions. Clearly, there is more cost pressure in the system. But overall, I would say our deals are coming in within normal range and we continually are proactively managing that contract and our products, obviously to offer affordability, continuing to look at our clinical strategies, ensure we can maintain our long-term trends. While also as we shared with you, maintain our underwriting discipline to price to our forward review of those costs. Ultimately, it\u2019s affordability that\u2019s paramount for our customers, particularly in this economic environment. We take that very, very seriously. Specifically to your question about value-based contracts with our providers, we are having those discussions. And quite frankly, we\u2019ve made a lot of progress on our value-based contracts. We\u2019ve shared with you roughly 60% of our total contracts are in value-based, and our goal is to move a lot more of those at least a third by 2025 to downside risk. I\u2019m really pleased to share that we\u2019ve made really good progress even in this last year and in the last quarter. And in now where we were in sort of low double digits now in high teens in downside risk. So making great progress against our goal to get to more downside risk in our contracts as well as value-based care. So back to your question, we do think that there is an opportunity to continue to move more of these to value-based care. We are seeing progress not just on the hospital side, but across the broader provider care continuum. And the other thing that I think\u2019s important in trying to be a good partner with our care providers is we\u2019re also looking at how to reduce the administrative burden that they face. So how do we accelerate the work we\u2019re doing on data sharing, reduce some of the \u2013 I\u2019ll call administrative care review processes that may not have the highest value. And I think those are big opportunities for us as well, in addition to just trying to increase rates. So we\u2019ve seen progress there and we\u2019re committed to continuing to work with care providers so that, obviously, that we have a good long-term partnership with them. But overall, we\u2019re not seeing anything outside of our normal ranges right now and have been very successful with these strategies. So thanks very much for the question. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much for taking my question. Again, I want to go back to your earlier comment today around Sydney Health and virtual healthcare. So you talked about, 6 million visits per month. You talked about improving outcomes and costs, but I\u2019m really interested in. When we think about 2023, are you offering a product in the marketplace where you have a lower premium, where your primary care doctor is virtual? So that would be my first question. And then secondly, is there a way to quantify when we think about the potential cost benefit of utilizing virtual primary care? Gail Boudreaux : So thanks for the question, Lisa. I\u2019m going to ask Morgan to add some commentary, but just an overview. Yes, we are. So first, Sydney is our front door to healthcare. So we have really embedded all of our capabilities in Sydney. And what I shared with you are a couple things. One, that virtual primary care is one of the elements of our care delivery strategy. And Morgan talk about the product offerings that we have there as well. But we\u2019re also seeing it, and you saw some of the early data around an opportunity to help us manage chronics in a much more efficient way. And so we\u2019re seeing a lot of uptake in that. And it\u2019s also embedded into what our customers are selecting. So we\u2019re adding a lot more capability inside of Sydney. So a couple of very important just quick facts, but let me turn it over to Morgan to share with you a little bit about the product strategy, which is an element of our affordability offerings for the market. Morgan Kendrick : Right, and thanks, Gail. And thanks Lisa for the question. When you think about the commercial group business, you\u2019ve got generational cohorts, four of them with Boomers X, Y and Z that are part of the actual the makeup. And of course the way they engage certainly is indeed different. Various modalities are very important to us. And as such, we have products that we are launching that have a virtual first component where one can elect a primary care physician that would be a digital connection as opposed to a physical connection. But it also allows for the opportunity to move into the physical world within the value-based constructs that Gail described in our value-based network strategies to keep a tight closed loop integration, so to speak, on how this works. One in particular that we\u2019ve already launched for January versus in our Nevada market, which is a combination of a partnership with a single entity, but layered with a digital fresh first front end. The economics of that arrangement are quite attractive in the market, and we\u2019re expecting nice pull through is the enrollment period concludes. But this is the beginning of it. We\u2019ve been adding the virtual components to all of our commercial self-funded business and risk business over the past year and a half. And as such, we\u2019ll continue to build products anchored around those assets. Thanks again for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Yes, thanks, Morgan. And Lisa, just sort of two important concepts that I want to reiterate. One that we\u2019ve embedded virtual capabilities for our customers across the board. And we\u2019re also aligning those with our high performance networks. And we talk about best costs in the marketplace and what\u2019s really driving a lot of our growth. It\u2019s that affordability. And again, it\u2019s not just virtual for virtual by itself, but it\u2019s aligned to our high performance network strategy. And then second, as Morgan said, we\u2019re in \u2013 I would say earlier days, but we have been beginning to launch a number of virtual only products. But again, they have tied to physical assets or high performance network. So again, really trying to drive best cost and quality and outcomes for our members. Next question, please. Thank you. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. I guess I want to go back to a comment that John made in prepared comments about the impact of a recession. I guess, the company historically has talked about the kind of the balanced business mix between Commercial, Medicaid, and how the two businesses kind of offset each other during a recession. So one, I guess first you didn't mention a recession either as a tailwind, I'm sorry, as a headwind. So I assume, does that mean that you don't assume a recession that the guidance or you assume a modest one has no impact? And then what exactly do you mean that if it's a severe recession, how should we think about how that impacts a company like Elevance given your business mix? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks for the question, Kevin. I'll address that, and I think that there's a few things. One, we are mindful of the economic environment under which John in the headwinds and tailwinds, where he talked about one specific known Medicaid. He also did reference the broader economic environment that we're planning for across a whole series of scenarios. But I want to take you back in terms of our business because we are a much more diversified business than we have been at any other time in our company's history. And just putting some facts around that, today that 25% of our premium roughly is in our commercial business, whereas that number was 70% in 2008. And so as you think about that, the diversity of our businesses and in strong, we've been able to perform in both good and bad economic times certainly in stronger economic times. The commercial business continues to grow, but we haven't seen any impact in terms of our commercial business today. And we're still seeing strong growth in ads inside of our fee-based business. But clearly our focus is on, as you just heard in the last question, affordable products driving a differentiated value for our consumers. We've been able to demonstrate that. Just a quick fact that we talk a lot about in our own business. Our growth as you've seen in the fee-based with some of our most discerning customers we have been consolidating business from multi-carrier to single carrier over the last several years. We added another eight additional clients for January of this year that consolidate with us. So these are just a couple of proof points in terms of the, I would say the resiliency right now of our commercial business. And then obviously in more difficult times Medicaid businesses tend to grow well and take on some of that. We're also in a very different environment than we were in the last recession, and that recession we didn't have the ACA and the opportunity for individuals to go in, in a subsidized manner. And as you heard from us, we also now have full coverage in our counties in ACA exchange business. And then we think the Medicare business where we have zero premium plans is also quite resilient. So, across our book certainly we're mindful of an economic downturn. We're planning for it in our businesses. We've been investing heavily in digital and trying to ensure that we can maintain our own cost structure. So those are the kinds of things and playbooks that we have inside of our business. So it's not that we're not planning and thinking about that business, but we do feel we have a much more resilient business and a much more diversified business that one business line is in dominating our company as it had in the past. So, and also I would ask \u2013 I would add that Caroline in times obviously adds, we have a big roadmap for Caroline to add additional opportunities to impact the affordability of our health plan business and take on more risk. Just a couple of the examples I shared this morning between AIM and myNEXUS. We've got a, I think a long runway there, and that again is all about driving affordability. So I guess in short, yes, we're planning for it. Yes, we're being prudent and diligent. And second, we know that affordability and differentiated value is going to be critical in a market where customers are strained. And those are the kind of products that we're putting in the market. And we feel we've got a nice a nice breath of those right now, much more so than we've ever had. So thanks very much for the question. Next question, please. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Gary Taylor from Cowen. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. Had a quick clarification for John and then \u2013 and then maybe a quick one for Felicia. John, just on the re-class of the quality improvement incentives to G&A just wondering if there's any rebate implications retroactively from that? And then for Felicia as we look at the 2023 Medicare benefits offering, I mean one of the key places where it really looks like Elevance stands out as in special supplemental benefits for chronically ill just in your individual MA offering your funding level there really looks substantially higher than many of your competitors. I was just wondering why the focus on that benefit specifically and what percent of your individual MA will avail themselves of that particular benefit? Thanks. John Gallina : Yes. Thank you, Gary. I'll answer the first part of your question, then turn it over Felicia for your second question. But in terms of the impact on rebates, it was de-minimus. The vast majority of the reclassification impact that the commercial line of business and while we do have occasional MLR rebates in commercial, they're not nearly as prevalent as they are in some of our, in Medicaid at this point in time. So there was really de-minimus that's why I said there's virtually no bottom line impact. Felicia? Felicia Norwood : Sure. And good morning, Gary. When I think about our Medicare Advantage business, we've been always very focused on a portfolio that takes a look at individuals who are complex and chronic. And our dual special needs plans have always been an area where we look to grow. Today, I think we represent probably the third largest footprint with respect to dual eligible individuals and within our footprint we're second. We believe that we have the capabilities as we sit within our Medicaid \u2013 Medicare business and certainly as you take a look at Carolina to be able to be able to deliver a value proposition to these individuals that's differentiated. So when we take a look at how we are appropriately priced and competitive in the marketplace is certainly based on our strategy around playing to those stress and being able to partner and look to do those individuals or work with those individuals in a way that's differentiating. So I think our competitive cost structure and the way that we think about our duals products certainly gives us the ability to address their specific needs. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Whit Mayo from SVB Securities. Please go ahead. Whit Mayo : Hey, I just wanted to go back to Carelon for a second. Any way to frame what percent of your post-acute spin for MA today is being delegated to MyNEXUS or any of your other assets? And then kind of what are the targets for that business over time? Just any way to, quantify and put some numbers around it. I think, I may have underappreciated that the tail around this. Peter Haytaian : Yes, thanks Whit for the question. In terms of percentages specific numbers on that, we're not going to sort of get into that. But the goal here is for our post-acute offering via MyNEXUS to cover all of our Medicare advantage business from a post-acute care perspective. We started on this journey in the middle of this year launching in July. We've seen really good success. We also had another integration in September. We will complete all the Medicare advantage markets in early 2023. And so you can assume more broadly that as it relates to post-acute care management for the Medicare business, we will be covering the management of all that population. Gail Boudreaux : Yes, thanks Pete. And a number that we do share more broadly is the percentage of spend that Carelon manages for Elevance Health. And that has continued to increase and it's around 21%. So just to give you a little bit of perspective, and it's obviously a number that, we will we continue to have a bigger impact on. Next question, please? Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dave Windley : Hi, thanks. I wanted to come back to the comments around commercial renewal. And John's prepared, you talked about being even more confident about Jan 1 than July 1, which was successful. Wondered if you could put a finer point on the factors that drive that confidence, and then to what extent do those same factors benefit growth beyond renewal and or help your catchers met for catching Medicaid from redetermination. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. I'm going to ask Morgan to address your question. Morgan Kendrick : Thanks Dave. To \u2013 express confidence, I think that July played out as we indicated exactly as we expected. The renewals that we needed we obtained, and of course there was some attrition in the book that was certainly planned, that same phenomenon we're seeing and in we're the very beginnings of it for January 1. I think the confidence that was alluded to earlier is in the actual position in which we're pricing the business. We sort of got in the spot last year, pricing early for 2021 or 2022 and then things reveal differently in the fall. That's sort of shaping up as planned as we see right now. So the confidence in the numbers, in the market are there. When we think about this concept of a catchers met with Medicaid redetermination, there's business that stays on the Medicaid side. There's business that's going to move to the commercial side, be it group or individual. Gail alluded to the fact that we've done a really nice job in expanding our footprint to cover roughly 95% of the population of the geographies we serve \u2013 from a commercial individual ACA perspective. And then, we have very strong penetration in the commercial risk and non-risk business would also be part of that catchers met, so to speak for the group side. So all in we're confident in A the results from July B how we're [Technical Difficulty]. Dave Windley : Yes. Hi, thanks for sitting in. Just wanted to ask one follow up on the group risk business. I was hoping you could give us a sense of what the in-group membership trends were in the quarter. Are you starting to see those slow a little bit as maybe the economy gets a little bit more uncertain? I guess basically what I'm trying to get a sense of is whether we can attribute all the sequential decline to the attrition on the seven one renewals or whether the impact was larger, smaller than that, and maybe masked by some of those in-group trends. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Yes, thanks for the question. I think in total, I think I shared this in sort of the recession response. We really haven't seen a lot of change in, in-group and actually it's been up a little bit. So I wouldn't necessarily call it a trend, but it's been running fairly stable. And I think as you think about, where employers are, they're holding onto their employees, they've got a number of jobs still open, so we're not seeing any impact yet across any of our commercial business on the attrition side and actually are seeing some net ads. So thank you very much for the question. And thank you, operator. In closing, we're pleased with the broad based momentum across our businesses and are confident that our ongoing execution of our strategy positions us to continue delivering against the financial targets we shared with you at our investor conference last year. We'll keep executing with excellence and discipline to deliver an enhanced value to all of our stakeholders. Thank you for your interest in Elevance Health and have a great rest of week.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, where participants are encouraged to present a single question. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Please go ahead. Steve Tanal : Good morning and welcome to Elevance Health's fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. This is Steve Tanal, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined this morning on our earnings call by Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Peter Haytaian, President of Carillon; Morgan Kendrick, President of our Commercial and Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business division. Gail will begin the call with a brief discussion of some of the highlights of the quarter and year before turning to our recent announcement of the acquisition of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana and a number of other updates on key strategic initiatives. John will then discuss our financial results and outlook for 2023 in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, elevancehealth.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Elevate Health. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks Steve and good morning everyone. Today, we're pleased to share that Elevance Health delivered strong fourth quarter results, closing out another year of growth, consistent with our long-term targets and considerable progress in our transformation to become a lifetime trusted health partner. In the fourth quarter, Elevance Health delivered GAAP earnings per share of $3.93, and adjusted earnings per share of $5.23. For the full year, we reported GAAP earnings per share of $24.81 and adjusted earnings per share of $29.7 and reflecting growth of 15% year-over-year from our adjusted baseline of $25.20 in 2022. 2022 marks the fifth consecutive year in which we grew adjusted earnings per share within or above our 12% to 15% long-term target growth rate. This reflects the focused and sustained execution of our strategy to optimize our health benefits businesses, invest in high-growth opportunities, and accelerate capabilities and services. Elevance Health ended 2022, serving more than 47.5 million medical members, up nearly 2.2 million members year-over-year, including more than 1 million new commercial and over 1 million new government members, investments in enhancing the customer experience, delivering innovative, customized whole health solutions, deepening digital engagement, and prioritizing health equity, all helped to deliver strong growth across customer segments. Membership growth, coupled with expansion in both the scope and scale of Caroline's business with our health plans, helped to propel double-digit growth in CarelonRx and Carelon services. In total, for the year, Elevance Health produced nearly 14% growth in operating revenue and double-digit growth in adjusted operating earnings. Now, I'd like to discuss a number of recent developments, including the acquisition of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana that we just announced on Monday. Like our Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Shield family of plans, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana is deeply rooted in its local community, serving Louisiana for almost 90 years. And like our health plans, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana is committed to improving the health and lives of the people of Louisiana. Our organizations are well aligned in our mission and purpose. And have worked together in partnership through our Healthy Blue Alliance, serving Medicaid and dual special needs plans in Louisiana for a number of years now. Upon closing, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana will be our 15th Blue state, providing us with deep local roots in a new market, while we bring national scale and access to our portfolio of innovative solutions and capabilities to support the community. We're looking forward to accelerating Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana strategy to make an even greater difference in the health and lives of the 1.9 million individuals they serve. Blue Cross some Blue Shield plans are at our best when we collaborate. Together, the Blue system provides health benefits to nearly 15 million consumers across all 50 states. There are many untapped opportunities to leverage our unique scale. One recent example is Synergy Medication Collective. Earlier this year, we became a founding investor in this new contracting organization founded by a group of Blue Cross and Blue Shield affiliated companies. The collective focuses on improving affordability and access to medical specialty drugs that are injected or infused in a clinical setting. Synergy will seek best-in-class medical drug pricing, leveraging our collective industry-leading specialty drug spend to enhance affordability, and drive toward value-based care representing another example of Blue's partnering for progress. Inside Elevance Health, we are also directly addressing fast-growing areas of cost trend. In November, we announced the acquisition of BioPlus, the largest independent specialty pharmacy provider offering a complete range of specialty pharmacy services for patients living with complex and chronic conditions. BioPlus will enhance our ability to deliver on our whole health promise and enable us to leverage our resources and scale to deliver greater affordability and access to critical medications. Over time, it will allow us to bring specialty pharmacy fulfillment for our members in-house, at what is a dynamic time in this field, given the anticipated growth of biosimilars. Upon closing, BioPlus will become part of CarelonRx, our pharmacy services business that we rebranded at the beginning of this year, with the addition of specialty pharmacy, we will expand the scope of the services and capabilities inside of Carelon and by extension, the proportion of overall healthcare spending that we manage or address. The acquisition of BioPlus furthers our commitment to scaling healthcare services to address the needs of health plans beginning with our own. Of Carelon's nearly $41 billion of revenue in 2022, approximately 60% came from partnering with our health plans. Meanwhile, in 2022, Carelon achieved the goal we set at our March 2021 Investor Conference of managing at least 20% of our consolidated benefit expense by 2025. This is three years ahead of schedule, a testament to the growing suite of capabilities within Carelon. Carelon has made significant progress since our last investor conference. And we look forward to providing shareholders an update on our long-range planning at our next investor conference, which will be held on Thursday, March 23, 2023 in New York City. Increasingly, we are evaluating and growing our enterprise through two primary businesses; health benefits and healthcare services. And we're continuing down the path of scaling Carelon by addressing the needs of our commercial, Medicare and Medicaid health benefits businesses. Beginning with the first quarter of 2023, we will evolve our external reporting to better align with this approach and begin to report Carelon split between Carelon Rx and Carelon Services, while we combine our commercial and government health benefits operations for reporting purposes into a single health benefit segment. Our new reporting structure will allow stakeholders to more clearly track the progress we are making against our enterprise strategy and better reflect how we evaluate our business results against our enterprise strategy today. John will discuss this more in his remarks, and you can also find a pro forma view of quarterly and full year 2022 results, the new reporting structure at a supplemental table in this morning's press release. Now, I'd like to touch on a few recent highlights before discussing our outlook for 2023. During the fourth quarter, we were pleased to become the first managed care organization in the nation to earn the full three-year health equity accreditation from the National Committee for Quality Assurance for all of our own Medicaid health plans, covering nearly 90% of our Medicaid membership. This recognition demonstrates that focus and resolve yield results. We have long been dedicated to countering health and equities across our enterprise and through partnerships with care providers. We continue to work toward health equity through policy and practice in pursuit of better outcomes and experiences for all, and ultimately to improve the health of humanity. Our Medicaid team is prepared to uphold that commitment by ensuring access to care for underprivileged populations through continuity of coverage for all beneficiaries eligible for Medicaid, who will be subject to the eligibility redeterminations this year. We look forward to working alongside state partners to help minimize loss of coverage due to administrative challenges and to ensure beneficiaries no longer eligible for Medicaid understand their coverage options. Our ACA exchange plans are now being offered in almost every county in our 14 Blue states. We remain committed and prepared to ensure seamless transitions of those Medicaid members, as they move into exchange plans or employer-based coverage. Across our health plans, we are optimizing our businesses. The pandemic brought with it substantial uncertainties and that resulted in margin compression in our commercial and Medicare health plans in 2021 that we didn't recover in 2022. It has since become apparent that COVID costs are not going to zero. And as we discussed last year, we've been repricing our risk in our commercial business, and we are enjoying improved reimbursement rates risk adjustment revenue and star quality bonus payments in our Medicare Advantage business in 2023. With January 1 renewals behind us in commercial, and the 2023 Medicare Advantage plan year underway, we remain confident in the margin recovery previously discussed and for the improvement in our commercial and Medicare businesses to more than offset anticipated member attrition in our Medicaid business when redeterminations begin on April 1st. Our confidence in operating our Medicare Advantage business solidly inside our long-term 3% to 5% target margin range has been underpinned by our bid strategy, in which we took a balanced approach. While the AEP proved to be somewhat more competitive than we expected, we still expect to grow Medicare Advantage membership relatively close to our prior targeted growth rate in 2023. Turning now to our outlook for 2023. We expect adjusted earnings of greater than $32.60 per share, reflecting growth of over 12%. Our guidance reflects double-digit growth in operating earnings in each of our health benefits and Carelon businesses that will be driven by the focused execution of our enterprise strategy, to optimize our health benefits business, invest in high-growth opportunities and accelerate capabilities and services. Our outlook contemplates a range of outcomes on Medicaid redeterminations coverage shifts and retention and our expectation for commercial and Medicare margin recovery from pandemic aero loans. John will discuss our assumptions in greater detail. The strong growth we achieved in 2022 would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our more than 100,000 associates. Our collective determination to improve lives and communities is unwavering, and we look forward to making a meaningful difference as Elevance Health. I would like to thank them for the important work they do and the impact they make every day. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John for more on our operating results. John? John Gallina : Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. We are pleased to have delivered solid fourth quarter financial results, closing out another strong year of growth for Elevance Health. The focused execution on our enterprise strategy continues to drive progress against our stated long-term targets. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $5.23 was ahead of our expectations and drove full-year adjusted earnings per share to $29.7, reflecting growth of over 15% year-over-year off of our adjusted 2021 baseline of $25.20 and above our long-term 12% to 15% annual earnings per share growth target. We ended the year with 47.5 million members, up $2.2 million or nearly 5% year-over-year, with organic growth having comprised more than 85% of our overall increase. In the fourth quarter, medical membership grew by 248,000 members, led by growth in Medicaid, driven in large part by the ongoing suspension of eligibility redeterminations and the acquisition of Vivida Health, which added 29,000 Medicaid members. For the full year, we added 1.1 million net new commercial members and 1.1 million net new government members. Total operating revenue for the year was nearly $156 billion, an increase of approximately 14% over the prior year, reflecting solid growth in our health benefits businesses and continued momentum in Carelon. We are pleased with the progress made to accelerate our service capabilities during the year as Carelon Rx and Carelon services grew revenue by 12% and 27% over 2021, respectively. The consolidated benefit expense ratio for the fourth quarter was 89.4%, a decrease of 10 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2021. This strong performance includes an improvement in commercial underwriting margin and also benefited from the reclassification of certain quality improvement expenses. These improvements were partially offset by the Medicaid business, which carries a higher benefit expense ratio than our commercial and Medicare health plans. Elevance Health's SG&A expense ratio in the fourth quarter was 11.5% and 11.4% for the full year reflecting an improvement of 20 basis points in the fourth quarter and full year. These positive results include the negative impact on the SG&A ratio related to aligning certain quality improvement expenses with CMS guidelines. The overall improvement was driven primarily by expense leverage associated with strong growth in operating revenue. In 2022, we produced another year of strong operating cash flow of $8.4 billion, representing 1.4 times net income, which was significantly better than our outlook to start the year and was driven by stronger risk-based membership growth and maintaining a prudent balance sheet. Additionally, relative to our initial guidance, a shift in the timing of certain payments to state-based partners added over $500 million to the fourth quarter operating cash flow that we now expect that we will pay in the first quarter of 2023. We ended 2022 with a debt-to-cap ratio of 39.9%, in line with our expectations and within our targeted range. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our stock for $567 million. For the year, we repurchased 4.8 million shares for $2.3 billion, exceeding our initial outlook for 2022, as we took advantage of the volatile periods in the market and opportunistically repurchase shares. Consistent with our approach throughout the pandemic, we maintained a prudent posture with respect to reserves. Days and claims payable ended the year at 47.7 days, an increase of 2.5 days year-over-year, and stable with the third quarter. Medical claims payable grew over 15% year-over-year compared to premium revenue growth of 13.5%. In summary, 2022 was a very strong year. We grew adjusted earnings per share by over 15%. We grew operating gain by nearly 13%. We grew membership by 2.2 million, and we grew revenue by nearly 14%, all with a stable medical loss ratio, a 2.5-day increase in days in claims payable and operating cash flow of $8.4 billion or 1.4 times net income. Before turning to our 2023 outlook, I would like to provide more detail on our decision to adapt our external segment reporting to better align with our enterprise strategy. Beginning with the first quarter of 2023, we will begin to disclose Carelon as a separate business division and provide operating revenue, operating gain and operating margin information separately for Carelon Services and Carelon Rx. Carelon offers a diverse suite of services across behavioral health, advanced analytics and services, complex care, pharmacy services and digital assets, and we remain committed to expanding the scale and scope of services Carelon provides to our own and third-party health plans. As we've continued down the path of scaling Carelon by addressing the needs of our commercial, Medicare and Medicaid health benefits businesses, it's become increasingly apparent that the similarities between our health plans have evolved to outnumber the differences. And we have also decided to combine our employer, individual, Medicare, Medicaid health plans and products into a single health benefits division. The remaining segment, Corporate and Other will include a small amount of revenue and earnings from non-Carelon, non-health benefits businesses, as well as our corporate unallocated expenses. The new health benefits segment will combine the same group of businesses that currently comprises the commercial and specialty and government business divisions. In the Carelon Services segment, reflects the same group of businesses that comprised the diversified business group, now Carelon services, which has historically been included as part of our old other segment. We are excited to begin disclosing the performance of our two primary and distinct businesses in a manner more consistent with how we will grow our enterprise for years to come and to be doing so at the time of strength for our organization. As you can see, our commercial health plan margin recovery is well underway and will extend into 2023, which is reflected in our Health Benefits segment margin guidance provided in our press release this morning. To ensure a smooth transition to our new reporting structure, we have also included a supplemental table in this morning's press release, showing our quarterly and full year 2022 results pro forma for new reporting structure alongside new supplemental performance metrics for CarelonRx and Carelon services that can be used to model revenue for each business. Our commitment to elevating whole health and advancing health beyond health care is unwavering, and our new segment reporting structure will allow our stakeholders to more clearly track the progress we're making against our enterprise strategy. Now, I'd like to discuss our outlook for 2023 in greater detail. We are pleased to have provided initial earnings per share guidance of greater than $32.60, reflecting growth of over 12% year-over-year, putting us on track to produce a sixth consecutive year of growth in adjusted earnings per share, consistent with our long-term 12% to 15% compound annual growth rate target. 2023 will be a year of optimization, but we will also demonstrate the balance and resilience of our health benefits businesses as we execute the planned recovery of our commercial and Medicare health plan margins from pandemic era low's, which we expect will more than offset the impact of membership attrition and margin normalization in our Medicaid business when eligibility redeterminations resume. For 2023, we anticipate growth in medical membership despite commercial repricing and Medicaid redeterminations. Commercial risk-based membership is expected in 2023, up over 200,000 at the midpoint, ending the year in the range of 4.9 million to 5.1 million members. Growth will be driven by individual and small group risk-based membership, partially offset by attrition in our large group risk business, driven by the repricing discussed earlier. Note that we expect commercial risk-based membership to decline by approximately 60,000 in the first quarter, with individual up approximately 100,000 and group risk-based membership down approximately 160,000. We anticipate growth in individual and group risk-based membership over the balance of the year, concentrated in the second half, as consumers transition from Medicaid to commercial coverage. Fee-based membership is expected to grow by approximately 600,000 members at the midpoint to 27.1 million to 27.4 million at year-end 2023. The wider-than-normal range contemplates a variety of scenarios related to coverage shifts out of Medicaid, and into employer-sponsored plans and the relatively uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. We expect approximately one-third of this growth to occur in the first quarter with the balance more heavily concentrated in the back half of the year as consumer's transition from Medicaid to commercial coverage. Total commercial membership will end the year in the range of 32 million to 32.5 million members, up over 800,000 members at the midpoint. Medicare Advantage membership is expected to grow by approximately 75,000 to 125,000 members, with growth in both individual and group pushing our membership over the 2 million member mark. Medicaid membership is expected to end the year in the range of 10.8 million to 11.3 million, driven by the attrition associated with eligibility redeterminations beginning on April 1 of this year. This wider-than-normal range contemplates a range of scenarios on the pace of redeterminations and the prospect of macroeconomic headwinds developing over the course of 2023. And finally, we expect our Medicare supplement and federal employees' health benefits memberships will be relatively stable year-over-year. In total, medical membership is expected to end 2023 in the range of 47.4 million to 48.5 million, reflecting growth of over 400,000 members at the midpoint. The consolidated medical loss ratio is expected to be 87.2% in 2023, plus or minus 50 basis points, an improvement of approximately 20 basis points compared with 2022, primarily driven by the re-pricing of commercial risk-based business and margin expansion in Medicare Advantage, related to the improved reimbursement levels across rates, risk adjustment and star quality performance. The SG&A expense ratio is expected to be 11.2%, plus or minus 50 basis points, a reduction of 20 basis points at the midpoint driven by expense leverage associated with growth in operating revenue, partially offset by continued growth in our Carelon businesses, which carry higher SG&A ratio than our health benefits business. We expect operating gain for the year to be greater than $9.35 billion, reflecting growth of at least 10% over 2022, again, being the primary driver of growth in adjusted earnings per share. Below the line, we expect investment income to be approximately $1.6 billion and interest expense to be approximately $1 billion, both reflecting the impact of higher interest rates. And our effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 22% to 24%. Our full year operating cash flow is expected to be greater than $7.6 billion, including the unfavorable impact of a timing delay on the payment of approximately $500 million to certain Medicaid state partners that we previously believed we would pay in the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusting for timing, our 2023 cash flow outlook will be greater than $8.1 billion or approximately 1.1 times our expected GAAP net income. We expect full year share repurchases of approximately $2 billion, and our weighted average fully diluted share count for the year is expected to be in the range of 239 million to 240 million shares outstanding. Our 2023 guidance does not include the pending acquisition of BioPlus or Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana, which we expect will close later in the year. Importantly, neither is expected to have a material impact on earnings in 2023. At the segment level, we expect the Health Benefit segment operating revenue to grow in the mid to upper single-digit percentage range year-over-year in 2023, with segment operating margin up 25 to 50 basis points year-over-year. We expect CarelonRx revenue to grow in the upper single-digit percentage range with low single-digit growth in adjusted scripts and mid single-digit growth in revenue per adjusted script. And we expect Carelon Services to grow revenue in the low double-digit range organically, excluding all pending or unannounced M&A, driven by growth in revenue per consumer served, as we expect consumer serve to grow in the low single-digit range from 105 million at year-end 2022. Carelon Services operating margin is expected to expand by 25 to 50 basis points year-over-year in 2023. With respect to earnings seasonality, we are projecting similar profitability patterns to historical ranges and expect to earn slightly more than 55% of our full year adjusted earnings per share in the first half of the year with slightly more than half of that in the first quarter, consistent with current consensus modeling of seasonality. Finally, we remain committed to enhancing shareholder returns through capital deployment, including share repurchases and dividends and are pleased to announce that our Board of Directors recently approved a 16% increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $1.48 per share, our 12th consecutive annual increase, which will be paid on March 24 and to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 10. In closing, 2022 was another year of strong growth for Elevance Health as we continue down the path of transforming from a traditional health insurance company to a lifetime, trusted health partner, and we are well positioned to deliver another year of strong growth in line with our long-term targets in 2023. We look forward to discussing our enterprise strategy and long-term financial targets at our upcoming investor conference, which we will host in New York City on Thursday, March 23, 2023. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question, we\u2019ll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Your line is open. Lance Wilkes : Yes. Thanks. And can you talk a little bit about, the growth in the services business, which is really interesting. Both org changes that you're intending to put in place to kind of support the new segment reporting, if any? And then, in the Care delivery aspect of that, can you just talk a little bit about what you've been doing to date with some of your partnerships with Aledade and Privia and how that's kind of being deployed in the market and what your expectations are for care delivery long term? Gail Boudreaux : Well, thanks for the question, Lance. Let me frame a little bit of what you asked, and then I'll ask Pete Haytaian, who leads Carelon to give you a little bit more color on that. First, in terms of org structure, we've actually been building our team over the last 18 months, and Pete's done a really strong job of both, bringing individuals who are in the services industry to Carelon, but also taking individuals from our health benefits business, who have a deep understanding of that business and having them lead. So we feel we've got a really good mix of talent and have been building our bench strength pretty effectively. So we don't envision any structural changes, obviously, as acquisitions come in, they fit into the verticals that we've shared as part of our strategy. So let me just have Pete comment a little bit about -- a little bit more about Carelon and our growth there. Peter Haytaian : Yes. No, thanks a lot Gail. Thanks a lot, Lance, for the question. Overall, as Gail said, we're really pleased with the momentum and performance that we saw in 2022. And as Gail noted, in the year, we did do a lot around restructuring. We obviously went through rebranding, which there was a lot of excitement around. And as she said, we infused a lot of new talent across the organization. And then, in terms of the infrastructure we built internally, we're very focused. As you know, a core part of our strategy is focused on internal growth and serving Elevance affiliated health plans. And so we built the infrastructure to engage, to a much better degree, with our associates and partners internally. And we're seeing really good progress there. I hope you can see that through the numbers and the improvement in the year. We remain keenly focused on whole health and improving the patient experience. That's something else that we're very focused on looking from the outside in, in terms of the patient experience. And I'd say the other thing that we've been really focused on internally, and we're trying to change the culture, and its working, is driving more risk and capitation through the portfolio. And that has really helped in terms of the acceleration of our growth and the innovation that we're seeing going forward. As it relates to your question on some of the care delivery partnerships. We're seeing really good progress there. Again, when you look at the assets within Carelon, it can add a lot of value to our partners. And so, we continue to look to wrap around those services and create incremental value. And as we look forward, we have that in mind as well. When we talk to our provider base partners, where are they feeling stressed, where can we support them. So there's a lot of opportunity that we got going forward. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks, Pete. And Lance, specifically, in terms of how we're deploying, we see those partnerships and some of the investments we've made as part of our overall value-based care strategy. Our penetration has been strong, we're around 63% driven by purposeful collaboration. Those are two really good examples. We continue to learn and improve that approach, and part of that is how we work closely with Carelon to capitate services and actually, I think, impact more of the health care dollar and impact more of overall services. But we feel really confident about the strategy that we've deployed. And as I've shared before on these calls, we know that sharing -- the downside risk is really the most important part of where we need to achieve better outcomes. And so we're continuing to grow those arrangements, Early days still, but we feel good about the partnerships that we have, and we continue to expand them, and we feel on track to deliver on the goals that we've shared previously at our Investor Day, but also in these calls. So thanks very much for the question and next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Congratulations on the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana deal. It's been quite a while since we've seen one of those. My big recollection is the approval process and navigating the regulatory side of things can be a little tricky. Can you give us a sense of any discussions you have with the states at this point and your confidence level? I know you're saying by year-end close. And John, you mentioned that it wouldn't be meaningful to this year's numbers. I'm assuming that's partly due to late closure. But is it -- can we say that it would be accretive? Is there anything you can say financially about it? And then the last aspect of this is, obviously, there's a lot of changing things related to the Blues generally with the antitrust settlement, et cetera. Are you seeing more discussions, Gail, as you're out there, or is there more interest in collaboration, maybe we could see a broader upswing in activity? Gail Boudreaux : Well, thank you, A.J. That was a very comprehensive set of questions, and let me try to kind of go through them. First, we really are excited about the acquisition of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Louisiana. As you said, it's been some time since one of these has occurred. But I think as you think about like the driver for this, this is very much a strategic acquisition. The Board of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana, really wanted to have a greater impact and accelerate the strategy that they put in place. This is a solidly run plan, 4.5-star Medicare plan. And I think those are really important things as you think about this acquisition. The other thing that I think is really important for us is Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana very much aligns with our strategy. They're deeply rooted in their local communities. They -- as we shared, they've served Louisiana for more than 90 years. Our mission and purpose is well aligned. And we've had a healthy Blue Alliance partnership with them that serves our Medicaid and dual special needs plans for a number of years now. So we've worked together culturally, I think there's a great alignment there. And the other thing is we're excited because this brings the 15th Blue state. So we can -- just as we have in our other 14, we've kept our deep local roots in a new market, but we also can bring our national scale and access to our portfolio of innovative solutions and capabilities, again, accelerating what the Blue Cross Blue Shield strategic focus has been, and that supports the community. And I think accelerates their strategy and making an even greater difference in impact on the 1.9 million lives. In terms of closing, this will be subject to the normal closing conditions. And as we shared, we believe that we expect the deal to close in the second half of 2023. So again, not much more there. We do feel the impact that we can have on the community and the citizen in Louisiana with the foundation, accelerate Louisiana really is a strong component of this and helps accelerate health care status, accessibility, affordability as well as health equity, and those are areas that we've been deeply investing and committed to as well. In terms of collaborations, you heard that we've done a number of collaborations and feel good about the Synergy Medical Collective, which is a great example of all of us coming together around medical specialty and again, with an alignment and focus around fundamentally improving affordability. We have 150 million Americans that we serve across this country. And we feel that ability for us to work together to have an even greater impact, again, on access and affordability is really important. And I would just point to that as an example. So, thank you very much for the question. I think we, again, are excited about this. We think it's a great collaboration for us and feel that there's an opportunity for us to work together and for us to obviously use Carelon to help support the advancement of all Blues. So thanks very much. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please, go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to check in, in 2022, you did about 7% margin in that commercial business. I know you're not reporting it specifically anymore. But you had 11% target out there for 2025. I wanted to check in on that target and just find out if that is still what you're expecting to do by 2025. Maybe you could share with us how much progress you're making towards that in 2023? And then give us -- I'm sure there's an offset there in terms of more conservatism on the Medicaid side from a margin perspective. Can you share what you -- where you expect your Medicaid margins to be versus the 2% to 4% target you have out there long term? Thanks. John Gallina : Thank you, Justin. Good morning. And we do appreciate the questions. In terms of commercial, we're actually doing very, very well. We have a repricing effort going on that began on July 1 of 2022. And what we had seen was, the overall cost structure of the commercial market was higher than we had assumed. And so, this repricing was about 25% of the large group block in July. And then we repriced about 50% of the block here on January 1, 2023, and it was really to ensure that the premiums more accurately reflect the underlying cost structure of the book. The result of that would be margin recovery associated with that. We feel very good about the progress that we're making, and we still stand by the commitments that were made in our prior Investor Day to get the commercial margins up to the level that we had estimated by 2025. You have to look at now the health services segment in total. And as you had asked, we have the commercial margin improvement ongoing, we will have Medicare margin improvement, as our risk adjusters are really recovering, risk-adjusted revenue really recovering from pandemic era lows. Also, we do have 74% of our MA membership in 4-star plans or above for the 2023 payment year. And we believe our Medicare Advantage business will be solidly within the target margin range of 3% to 5%. And then, on Medicaid, which was your final question, we've been working very closely with our state partners on Medicaid and feel very good about the rating actions. And that the rates are actuarially sound rates and feel very good about that. However, we were making either at or above the high end of our range here in the last couple of years, which obviously resulted in MLR collars and various other rebates being paid back to the states. We expect that the Medicaid business will be solidly within the 2% to 4% range, closer to the high end, but still with actuarial equivalent rates. So hopefully, that helps clarify all that. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. On Carelon, you mentioned that you hit the target for 20% of benefit expense through Carelon ahead of schedule. Could you talk about how much higher this percentage can go from here with your current capabilities? And then specifically on the outlook for 2023. The revenue guidance for Carelon Services came in a bit below your long-term target. How are you thinking about growth from here just given the progress that you've made? And will more growth come from external customers going forward? Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks, Nathan. I'm going to have Pete Haytaian provide a little perspective. And as we shared earlier, we are going to be updating our long-term planning at our Investor Day in March. So we probably won't go into like where we think our updated guidance is on that, but we can certainly give you some color on how each of the components are playing and feel very good about the progress that Carelon overall is making. So Pete? Peter Haytaian : Yes. No, thanks for the question, Nathan. As it relates to 2023, just to be clear, and John noted this in the prepared remarks, the low double-digit range growth in 2023 is really organic growth. It does not include M&A. I think if you look at our recent history, there's been a lot of M&A that's contributed meaningfully to us. And we're being very intentional about that. We're very focused on it. It's something that we'll continue to do. And I think it's an important part of our growth strategy going forward. As Gail said, in terms of the amount of medical spend that we penetrate, we'll talk more about that at Investor Day, but we're really encouraged with our trajectory right now. We feel like we can continue to grow pretty significantly. There's a lot of white space internally. So a lot of opportunity there. But to your point about external growth, we did establish some new leadership. We've got a new infrastructure in terms of external growth. We're very focused, as Gail said, you've heard a lot about the Blues and Blue partnerships, and we're very encouraged of what we're seeing in terms of the Blue opportunity. So we do think we can see nice growth externally as well. But again, our first focus is on the affiliated health plans and creating value there first. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just I had two follow-ups on the Blues topic. The first is if you can maybe give us some color on the incremental revenue you expect to drive from the BCBSLA Louisiana acquisition because obviously, you already have some revenues that you're generating off of Healthy Blue. Then also maybe just an update on the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota situation, I think that, that relationship on the Medicaid side will term at the beginning of 2024. Just any update on membership or financial impact that you expect from that situation as well? Thank you. John Gallina : Yes, sure. Thank you, Scott, for the question. So associated with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana. As we had stated, we're not expecting that to close until later in [Technical Difficulty] impact on 2023 will not be material, really data line items. However, assuming it does close in 2023 -- in 2024, what we should see is an incremental 1.6 million members after you eliminate the various double counts and you referenced the significant partnership we have with them already. So it's an incremental 1.6 million members. And it's really -- it's an incremental $4.5 billion in revenue on top of what we have now. So that's really about the high-level economics that we would expect to inure in 2024. Gail Boudreaux : I'm going to ask Felicia Norwood to comment on Minnesota. Felicia Norwood : Yes. Good morning, Scott, and thank you for the question on Minnesota. We operate over 27 Medicaid plans across the country with over 11.5 million members. And when you think about what we do, we bring very deep expertise in this business and a relentless focus on our whole health strategy, health equity and improving health outcomes. The expertise we bring to the table has been recognized by our external partners, and we really look forward to continuing to bring that experience to other Blue partners and alliances, not only in Medicaid, but in Medicare as well. When I think about our alliance relationships, each of them is very different. And Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota decided to end our administrative services relationship, which supported about 330,000 Medicaid members and provide back-office services in-house. We're going to work with them to make sure that there's a seamless transition, because at the core of what we do, we want to make sure our members are taking care of, and that's our highest priority. So we continue to value alliance relationships and really look forward to continued growth in this segment, with partners who value the deep expertise that we bring to the table for serving vulnerable and complex populations. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks, Felicia. And Scott, that will be in January 24, just from a timing perspective. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please, go ahead. Lisa Gill : Thanks, very much. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on utilization expectations for 2023. John, you made the comment that COVID is not going away, I agree that, that should be in the baseline. But, as we think about this, do you feel like there's any level of pent-up demand or potentially higher acuity levels as we move into 2023? And would you call out any specific line of business? John Gallina : Thank you for the question Lisa and we're not discussing specific trend assumption for 2023, but really when you look at some of the cost drivers that we have relative to the expectations, emergency room has been favorable, in-patient has been favorable, pharmacy cost actually running a little bit higher than expected. And out-patient is running a little bit higher than expected. I don\u2019t know that we really see any pent-up demand as much as we see -- being as much as the new normal. But just to reiterate. The overall cost structure of the business is higher than if COVID had never occurred. COVID is here and it continues to be a cost driver. What I think is probably most important in all of this is that our pricing now reflects the underlying cost structure and our MLR guidance also reflects this higher cost structure. So we actually feel very well positioned going into 2023. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please, go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. I guess, my question is going to be really on 2024. So if you can make a direct comment on that, that would be great. But if not, at least comment on the 2023 trajectory to give us a little bit of a sense, because it seems like the story here for 2023 is balanced portfolio improvements in commercial and Medicare are offsetting Medicaid. But obviously, the Medicaid pressure is one that builds throughout the year, both from a revenue and I would think, from an MLR pressure perspective, which begs the question about whether it's a bigger headwind in 2024 than it is in 2023 and whether there are similar opportunities in 2024 to kind of to offset that? Thanks. John Gallina : Yes. Thank you for the question, Kevin. And as you indicated in your question, we're not going to provide any specific details we did on 2024. Obviously, at our Investor Day coming up here in a few months, we'll provide a lot more long-term aspirations. But I think the way you've characterized 2023 is correct. It's really -- it's a year of optimizing our health benefits business, while we continue to grow and expand the capabilities within Carelon. And then you talk about, well, gee, could the headwind be greater? As you look at the Medicaid redeterminations, there's certainly a lot of variables associated with the pace and timing, on a state-by-state basis, where they go, which lines of business, they ultimately reside in I think one of the great things about the balance and resilience of our membership base is that we end up with the members somewhere. We have a product offering for every member regardless of age, regardless of employment status, with regardless of health condition, and feel very, very good. So we do expect approximately about half of the Medicaid members to be reverified here in this calendar year and the other half next year. So there is some balance there. But at the end of the day, we are very well positioned to retain much of that membership. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Yes, thanks, John. And Kevin, I think it's an insightful question because as you've heard us talk about, I think there's three core pillars of how we see our business evolving. Optimizing our health benefits business. It's highly scaled. We're very diversified in that business. And again, as you think about 2023, we have an opportunity for margin recovery, which is really we've been intensely focused on. But the other two pillars, I think, are really important about our future growth, which is investing in growth opportunities. And then third, accelerating services and capabilities, particularly through Carelon. And remember, as we think about Carelon, a lot of that is synergistic with our health plan business. We've continued to grow this and that allows the synergy to also occur with Carelon services as well as expanding capabilities that you've seen us, but through organically and inorganically. So overall, I think we've got more levers than we've ever had historically, and those positioned us well for the balance that John just shared. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Hi. Good morning. It'd be great if you could expand a little bit on the dynamics you saw in Medicare Advantage open enrollment this year. And how you think those trends might play out over the next couple? And then specifically, hoping to clarify the enrollment expectations there. I think you said 75,000 to 100,000 membership growth. Is that a sequential Q1 figure or year-end figure just trying to realign versus some of the previous expectations you've shared here. Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Sure, I'll have Felicia Norwood, who leads that business, to share her comments. Felicia Norwood : So, good morning and thank you for that question. When we think about Medicare Advantage, as Gail mentioned in her early remarks, we took a very strategic approach as we thought about our bids for 2023, and we expect to deliver good performance in terms of growth, not just in individual, but also in group. As John referenced, we plan to grow between 75,000 and 125,000. But we did end up encountering a very competitive. On the other hand, we had very solid growth in our D-SNP business, which is where we've had a focus for some period of time. And I think that positions us well for the rest of OEP in the remainder of 2023. As we think about our competitiveness, we have a very strong benefit portfolio, and we believe that we're positioned well in order to continue to grow this business. So at the end of the day, a competitive environment, which it always will be in Medicare Advantage, but still an opportunity to grow in a business that we feel very good about. And most importantly, the opportunity is we are in 2023 to deliver very strong margin recovery and operate squarely within our 3% to 5% pre-tax target margin range in this business, so solid growth and solid margins in 2023. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please, go ahead. Josh Raskin : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could provide an update on some of the trends you're seeing in value-based care. I heard some of the comments earlier. But as you go into 2023, are there any changes in the dynamics of the industry? Any changes specify in contracting terms that either the providers are looking for or that you're trying to push? And then, maybe any updated views on the employment or ownership of physicians or physician groups. Gail Boudreaux : Well, thanks for the question, Josh. In terms of -- a little bit consistent, I guess, with what I shared before on value-based care, I mean, we've been -- we continue, quite frankly, to refine and improve our strategy. We feel we're making really good progress on it. What we're seeing is a lot more interest in sharing up and downside risk. Historically, value-based care was more upside risk and we've gotten about 63%. We've gone -- we've continued to refine that to now include much more downside risk. And also, I think one of the biggest differences is the sharing of data bilaterally and much more timely. So that action can be taken in -- I think, in a much more integrated way. And we're doing a lot of work with that with our care providers. It's embedded. And also, what happens, like, post primary care. So how do we manage all the specialty services? That's a big part of the Carelon strategy in terms of what Pete is doing in his business. So as I think about that, I would say, structurally, we're seeing a lot more interest and a lot more conversation as this takes several years for, I think, physician practices to get comfortable with value-based care. And so, we're building credibility with that. We're getting better at our reporting and our engagement. And we're not only doing it across Medicare Advantage, and I think that is one of the changes. Some of our relationships are specific to commercial, for example, and that's a very different approach, including with some fee-based customers. So that would be a trend. In terms of the ownership of physicians, I think, we've been very consistent about that. We do own physicians in terms of our integrated health plans, and those have performed very well in MMM and health fund in Florida. I think, CareMore is beginning to become even more integrated with the work we're doing. So I think our strategy has stayed very consistent there. So I don't really have any significant updates, other than I think it's all embedded and our ability to drive more downside risk integrate data in a much more real-time basis. And then, really become true partners and train each other and how do we work in a value-based care environment. As, I think, you know well, this doesn't happen overnight, and it takes quite a bit of work for us on both sides to be committed to the long-term partnership, but we feel good, and we're seeing more enrollment in those partnerships. And the results have been good. We see differentiated quality and cost outcomes. So thank you very much for the question. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Rob Cottrell from Cleveland Research. Please, go ahead. Rob Cottrell : Hi. Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. Just on the CarelonRx or PBM, how should we square the high single-digit outlook for 2023 relative to your long-term 2025 low double-digit outlook? And then also, can you provide a bit more color on what Carelon's role will be within the synergy collective? Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : I'm going to ask Pete Haytaian to address that, please. Peter Haytaian : Yes. Thanks. In terms of the short-term, if you're referencing the script growth, overall, we're going to see nice script growth in Medicare and commercial. In terms of the headwind to that, really, that's due to the Medicaid dynamic around reverifications, or redeterminations. And then overall, we're going to see lower COVID vaccination. So that doesn't impact operating gain, but that is really the reason for the difference in the numbers in terms of what you're seeing short-term, long-term. In terms of overall growth, though, we feel really good about how we're doing in the pharmacy business. There continues to be a lot of interest in our integrated value proposition. In 2022, we're coming off a good year. We saw a 300% improvement in net membership growth. So that was good in terms of penetrating our self-funded business. And we're seeing that continue to play through into 2023. We're obviously through a lot of the selling for the beginning of the year, what we did see is we saw a lot more activity and penetration in the 10,000 or less business. We saw RFPs up by about 6% year-over-year. And again, I'll reiterate, but this is a segment an area that we perform really, really well in. I think you referenced a synergy at the end of your question. And again, to Gail's point in our commentary, our focus, a big part of our strategy is overall affordability and choice and this creates an opportunity for us in the context of medical specialty to create more affordability for our members. Again, by working in conjunction with the Blues across 100 million Americans, those that are utilizing specialty on the medical side, we have an opportunity to create much greater affordability. So we look forward to that. That work is in earnest right now in 2023 with value potentially playing through into 2024. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Whit Mayo from SVB Securities. Please go ahead. Whit Mayo : Hey, just on the topic of health plan optimization and commercial repricing initiatives. Can you comment maybe more specifically on stop loss? I think, you guys are beginning to anniversary some of the challenges in the creep and high-cost claims last year, just how you feel about trends in the business margins, just maybe broadly, any comments about the overall stop-loss market? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Sure, Whit. I'm going to have Morgan Kendrick, who leads our commercial business, give you some perspective there. Morgan Kendrick : Hi, there, and Whit, thank you for the question. Regarding the stop-loss business, that's certainly an area that was underperforming priorly and we began that journey to recover the margins in that business back in January of last year. It started with some of our integrated -- our external business rather. And then year progressed further, we had our July cohort, which John mentioned earlier, which was about 25 [ph] to some of our integrated business, both stop loss and risk-based business. Both of those went through a repricing exercise midyear, and then that concluded with January. So regarding the stop-loss market, we feel very good about it. We've got continued strong penetration, but opportunity to continue to grow that, both on our internal integrated business as well as our external. And we feel at this point in time, we have right-priced our business based on risk and we'll continue doing that so very fastidiously as we move through in 2023. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dave Windley : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. You called out a headwind to the MLR this year from the growth, the outsized growth in Medicaid did not call out a benefit to the SG&A ratio in 2022 from that. I'm wondering if there was one. And then more importantly, as that -- as the direction of those books reverses and Medicaid shrinks in 2023 from redetermination. Does that create a headwind? And what levers are you pulling to offset that headwind for SG&A ratio? Thanks. John Gallina : Thank you for the question, Dave. As you can imagine, there's a lot of puts and takes associated with SG&A ratios and by the ability to invest and the fact that we have been investing quite heavily in various digital capabilities, things that are member facing and can actually improve the member experience. The other aspect is that, we've really enjoyed a lot of fixed cost leveraging. Our premiums grew at 13.5% year-over-year, which obviously allowed the SG&A ratio to decline from that aspect as well. So, we do expect a reduction in our operating expense ratio in 2023, driven by the leverage of top line growth, as well as improved operating efficiency, partially offset by the reinvestment and strategic initiatives in support of our growth. So, while certainly, the mix of business does matter. And as we said in the guidance, Carelon services carries a higher SG&A ratio than the rest of the company in general. And we expect Carelon Services to grow faster, a lot of puts and takes. But fixed cost leveraging and investment in capabilities are probably two of the most significant drivers year-over-year. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please, go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Yes. Great. Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate the color on the 2023 membership guidance, particularly in the -- your commercial segment with the repricing strategy. You may have touched on this a little bit, but I guess, you previously talked about your goal of narrowing the profitability gap between the fee-based and risk-based commercial customers. I'm just curious, if you can just provide a little more color on your expected progress on that profit gap in calendar 2023 in particular, just in light of all the pricing and growth trends you talked about for the risk and fee-based books of business in commercial. Gail Boudreaux : Great. I'll have Morgan share his thoughts. Morgan Kendrick : Steven, thank you for the question. And we had a very successful selling season with CarelonRx, as Pete indicated, and we grew our specialty lines of business rather materially, and we continue to make steady progress towards our goal of improving that revenue gap between risk and fee-based business. One thing of note, when you think about in 2022, retrospectively looking back, which will take -- carry us forward as well, admin fee revenue grew nearly 8% compared with 4% in our fee-based membership growth. So this alone is certainly clearly indicating that we've got an expansion in revenue and product per sold member. I would say, this is driven by not only our Carelon assets, but it's also driven by strong growth in our clinical buy-ups. Again, noted specialty products and our aligned incentives Carelon services products. And, again -- so we feel good about that trajectory. We feel good about that gap continuing to close. And as John had indicated earlier, this isn't about any one segment. This is around actually growing that fee-based business. Many -- much of that business is moving to the fee-based schedules, but also the pull-through of the Carelon asset that we're working jointly with Pete and his team on. Thank you for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks for the question. I think, as Morgan just shared, we're making really nice progress on really improving the -- both the revenue per member and the profitability per member in our fee-based business. And the example he gave, I think, helps demonstrate that. And so overall, we feel it's been strong and we have a lot of confidence in that. So thanks again for the question. And it's, again, part of optimizing our health benefits business that we've talked about. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please, go ahead. George Hill : Hey, good morning. And thanks for taking the question. I ask, kind of, a question on the future state of the CarelonRx business, because you guys announced the BioPlus acquisition, you've got the synergy initiatives. You've got the JV with SS&C on DomaniRx. So I guess it's probably a question for 2024 or beyond. But I guess can you talk about how much of the vertical integration of the PBM business that you think that you need to do, given the outsourced relationship with CVS and the other initiatives that you have going on? Thank you. Peter Haytaian : Yes, George. Thanks a lot for that question. And I think it's helpful to sort of step back and think about our overall strategy and where we started in this regard. When we started a few years ago, we always talked about being a different kind of PBM and our strategy has been keenly focused on whole health and integration of medical, pharmacy, behavioral and social. And that's been core to what we've been doing. And we've also said, and we've been very deliberate about this, that we want to own the strategic levers that matter. Those that, quite frankly, drive the greatest affordability choice, and of course superior patient experience. And that's the journey we're going on. I think what you're seeing in BioPlus and what you're seeing in synergy are really good examples of that and what we prioritized. If you look at specialty pharmacy, it's 40% to 50% of the overall drug spend right now. And it's a critical driver of value for patients. And so that's where we started. And we'll continue on this journey, again, through the lens of greater affordability and superior patient experience. So over time, you will continue to see us take ownership of the strategic levers that really matter. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Gary Taylor from Cowen. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : Hi. Good morning. Actually I had a quick question about BioPlus as well. I was just wondering a couple of things. If you could give us a sense of annual revenue there, geographic reach and someone I think Pete earlier said in the future would bring specialty fulfillment in-house. And I thought that's what BioPlus was. So I just want to make sure I understand the business model there? Peter Haytaian : Yes. Thanks for the question, Gary. We feel really good about adding BioPlus to the family. It hasn't obviously closed yet. We think it will likely close in the first quarter. And in terms of their breath, I won't get into all the specifics about it, but they are the largest independent specialty pharmacy out there that remains with a broad range of services. They cover over 100 of the limited distribution drugs. So we feel really good about that. And their footprint is covering all 50 states. So we believe it's a really great platform. The other thing I would say that we're really impressed by two things, quite frankly. One is really great talent over there with a lot of experience, long-standing experience. And then the other real differentiating factor around BioPlus is their differentiated service model. Time to therapy, the speed to which they're providing services is really differentiating and we'd like to build upon that. So we're excited about this. And when it closes, we're obviously going to be very focused on building the scale to be able to take on all our specialty pharmacy. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. We have one last question. Operator : And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Michael Ha from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael Ha : Hey, thank you for the question. Just wanted to dig a little deeper on commercial margins. I know you mentioned you're still targeting 10.5% to 11.5% by 2025 I think John might have mentioned 125 bps better commercial margin in 2023. Was that right? And if so, that would be slightly more than 8% for 2023, which means there's still a considerable gap to your 2025 target. And I was expecting a majority of that improvement might happen this year just given your repricing experts, but if you're seeing 125 bps in 2023 and the following two years, would need at least 225 bps of improvement. So I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the path and progression of that improvement in 2024 and 2025. If you could help us break down the drivers we can better envision that path? Like what percent of that improvement is coming from up-selling your fee based business or the shift to higher margin small group or just any other contributors, maybe potentially more of a pricing efforts beyond 2023? Yeah, thank you. John Gallinan : Yeah. Thank you for the question, Michael. I'm not sure where your 125 basis point comment came from. But that was not part of our prepared remarks. What I can share is that if you look at the press release and you can see on a reported basis, the third quarter of 2022 versus the third quarter of 2021, commercial margins increased by 120 basis points. And then in the fourth quarter of 2022 versus fourth quarter of 2021 on that reported basis, the commercial margins increased by 180 basis points. In terms of the margin improvement, as we have said historically, it is not going to be pro rata. If we've got three more years, 2023 through 2025 to get to those target margins that it will -- there will be far more of the improvement here in 2023 for the reason that you noted. And then there will be continued improvement in 2024 and 2025. Obviously, we're going to continue to optimize our fully insured block together with the fee based selling strategies that Morgan talked about, overall, we're still standing behind that margin target through 2025. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, John, and thank you for everyone for joining us. In closing, we're pleased to have delivered another strong year in 2022 and are confident that the ongoing execution of our strategy positions us well for 2023. We look forward to discussing our long-term strategy in greater detail at our 2023 Investor Conference, which we said we plan to host in New York City on March 23, 2023. Thank you for your interest in Elevance Health, and have a great rest of week. Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, where participants are encouraged to present a single question. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Please go ahead. Steve Tanal : Good morning and welcome to Elevance Health's first quarter 2023 earnings call. This is Steve Tanal, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning on the earnings call are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; and John Gallina, our CFO; Peter Haytaian, President of Carelon; Morgan Kendrick, President of our Commercial and Specialty Health Benefits Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Health Benefits Division. Gail will begin the call with a brief discussion of the quarter and recent progress against our strategic initiatives. John will then discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, elevancehealth.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Elevance Health. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to share that Elevance Health is off to a strong start to 2023 as we continue to execute on the strategy we discussed at our investor conference last month to become a lifetime trusted health partner for the consumers we are privileged to serve by focusing on whole health. At our March investor conference, we provided a road map for how we plan to continue to compound adjusted earnings per share by 12% to 15% through 2027 by optimizing our mature businesses, investing in high-growth opportunities and accelerating the growth of our organization through Carelon. First quarter results demonstrate progress on all fronts. GAAP earnings per share came in at $8.30. Adjusted earnings per share of $9.46 grew approximately 15% year-over-year, and we ended the quarter with 48.1 million medical members, growth of nearly 600,000 in the first quarter spread across Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid. Carelon's momentum also continued, with year-over-year revenue and operating gain up 18% and 21%, respectively. Given the strong start to the year and the momentum in both of our primary businesses, we raised our outlook for adjusted earnings per share to be greater than $32.70 for 2023. Carelon Services continues to expand the scale and scope of services it provides to our own health plans and to external customers. The Carelon post-acute care management expansion with our health plans that we discussed at our investor conference is well underway and will contribute meaningfully to growth in 2023. We are now working to develop more seamless integration between transitions of care throughout all post-acute solutions, including home health and we'll be looking to extend the post-acute management solution beyond Medicare in the future. Carelon Behavioral Health recently extended its leadership position in crisis management, when it began serving as the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline managing entity to the New Jersey Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services at the beginning of this month. The scope of this work includes coordinating across all 988 centers in New Jersey, dispatching mobile crisis teams that provide emergency support and serving as the central integration partner for the unified technology platform. Beyond our work in support of 988, we are leveraging our expertise to improve health outcomes for members proactively. Our suicide prevention program uses a predictive analytics model to identify members at risk for suicidal event. And once those members are identified, we intervene through telephonic case management support crisis intervention or access to a peer support specialist. In a recent study, we observed a more than 20% reduction in adolescent and young adult suicidal events for commercial risk-based members engaged in the program relative to control groups, corresponding to a 30% reduction in per member per month behavioral health spending for engaged members post intervention. We have since expanded the program to cover even more of our members. CarelonRx remains focused on owning the strategic levers that create differentiation to advanced whole health. Since closing the acquisition of BioPlus in February, we have deepened our bench of specialty pharmacy talent and broken ground on the construction of the first of three new dispensing facilities. These investments will support the expansion of dispensing capacity ahead of the planned migration of CarelonRx's Specialty Prescription onto the BioPlus platform beginning in 2024. We have also added BioPlus as an in-network specialty pharmacy for all of our Medicaid and Commercial contracts. Later this year, we will be launching CarelonRx Pharmacy, a modern, differentiated home delivery experience that will be integrated into our Sydney Health app, improving quality, access and consumer experience while creating value for CarelonRx through additional dispensing margin. In our Health Benefits business, we're pleased to report progress on our key commitments. Commercial risk-based margins continue to recover from pandemic-era lows, and we grew membership once again as the distinctive value we provide to the market continues to resonate. As you heard at our investor conference, our momentum reflects our steadfast focus on three things customers value across all segments; affordability, experience, and simplicity. Nearly all of our key experience metrics are at their highest point in years, including Net Promoter Score, customer satisfaction, customer effort, and inquiry resolution. Meanwhile, retention rates across our national accounts business have tracked to historic highs in the past two selling seasons, yet another indication that our product innovation, digital investments, and overall value proposition are resonating. In alignment with our strategic focus on delivering exceptional consumer experiences, we continue to lead the market in advocacy. Our next-generation advocacy solution, total health connection entered the market this year, serving over 600,000 consumers building on the success of our total health, total new [ph] personalized engagement, and clinical advocacy solution, which continues to gain momentum. And in the first quarter, enjoyed a 12 percentage point improvement in its NPS score to 82%. Between these two innovative and integrated offerings, we now serve nearly 5 million advocacy members. We're also pleased with the performance of our individual business, which is poised for another year of strong growth through geographic expansion and strategic product positioning. We've grown membership 19% year-to-date compared with 5% growth for the market across our geographic footprint. We are well-positioned for additional growth when Medicaid beneficiaries begin to transition coverage later this year, whether members of our own Medicaid health plans or with coverage elsewhere. Medicaid membership growth continued in the first quarter as eligibility redeterminations remained on hold. In alignment with CMS requirements and state guidance on renewal processes, we have begun outreach to members to drive awareness about Medicaid redeterminations. We are taking an omnichannel approach to our work, supported by already set for new campaign, ground game educational activities, as well as our innovative digital decision support tool. Through this mobile-friendly web-based platform, we provide personalized guidance for consumers regarding their coverage options and eligibility for additional state and federal benefits based on answers to just a few quick questions. The support tool goes beyond traditional health care to include access to healthy food, child care and housing credits, alongside guidance on how to enroll. Most importantly, it will allow us to reach all effective consumers who are in need of assistance to maintain access to care, whether or not they are members of our health plans today. This approach positions Elevance Health distinctly in the market, and our deep local roots provides a strong understanding of the unique needs of our communities, alongside a diversified portfolio of solutions spanning Commercial, Medicaid and Medicare coverage we are uniquely well-positioned to ensure access to quality health care. Medicare posted strong growth in dual-eligible special needs plan and group members, which more than offset slower growth within individual Medicare Advantage. As we stated at our investor conference last month, Medicare Advantage is a strategically important market for Elevance Health over the long-term. And we were pleased to see CMS move to phase in the risk model revision it had proposed in the 2024 advance notice. This will provide time to help the industry adapt to the changes. Across all of our businesses, the transition to value-based care is a critical imperative, and we continue to make progress working closely with care providers in our network, including by integrating directly into their workflow processes through their own EMRs. Today, we are actively working with multiple leading EMR providers, including Epic, to establish bidirectional data exchanges with care providers that enable seamless prior authorization processes initiated directly within care providers EMR workflow. With this connectivity, our clinical staff can also review patient records and find the information they need to authorize care. In addition to accelerating care approval processes for consumers, this is resulting in substantially fewer requests for additional clinical information and significantly lower provider appeal rates. Recently, we published our first advancing health together progress report, which summarizes how we are promoting whole health by contracting for outcomes, collaborating for success and connecting for health. The report outlines our approach to make meaningful, measurable progress towards that goal by partnering closely with care providers to make whole health a reality, one person at a time. We encourage you to view the report, and we expect to provide annual updates on our progress towards achieving our 2027 target of having at least 80% of our consolidated benefit expense in value-based care with at least 40% in downside risk. While social factors like whole health and health equity will remain core to our business, we are also committed to strong governance and sustainability practices, especially those that drive better health outcomes and result in long-term value creation. We continue to receive strong recognition for our efforts and are proud to maintain sector-leading ratings from three of the most prominent ESG and corporate governance research, ratings and analytics firms. To learn more about how our social and environmental impact work supports our enterprise strategy, we encourage you to reference our recently released impact report for 2022. Now, I'd like to take a moment to thank our more than 100,000 associates for the important work they do every day on behalf of the members who we are privileged to serve. Our commitment to improving lives and communities is unwavering, and it extends to our own associates. And we were pleased to be recognized for the third consecutive year as one of Fortune's 100 best companies to work for in 2023 and to be chosen by Fortune as one of America's most innovative companies. We will continue to prioritize culture and talent in pursuit of achieving our vision for Elevance Health. In conclusion, we are pleased to have delivered a strong start to the year, as John will discuss in more detail in a moment, the balance and resilience of our enterprise will be key in 2023. We are confident in our ability to meet our commitments and remain focused on being a lifetime trusted health partner for those we are privileged to serve. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to John for more on our operating results. John? John Gallina : Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported strong first quarter results, including GAAP earnings per share of $8.30 and adjusted earnings per share of $9.46, representing growth of approximately 15% year-over-year. Our first quarter results reflect the continued execution of our enterprise strategy, as we continue to optimize our mature businesses, invest in high-growth opportunities and accelerate the growth of our enterprise through Carelon, all in service of becoming a lifetime trusted health partner. We ended the first quarter with medical membership of 48.1 million members, an increase of nearly 600,000 in the quarter and over 1.3 million year-over-year. Risk-based membership grew by approximately 1 million members year-over-year, driven by organic growth in Medicaid and Medicare Advantage, dual-eligible special need plan and group members. In our commercial business, our individual membership grew by 124,000 lives or 15% year-over-year and by 19% year-to-date, driven by geographic expansion and strategic product positioning that should enable additional growth when coverage shifts related to medicaid redeterminations began later this year. Membership momentum in these areas was partially offset by attrition in our commercial group risk business, which we expected as a result of the pricing actions we took on January 1 renewals and to better reflect our post-pandemic cost structure and optimize the business for sustainable economics long term. Our fee-based business grew by approximately 370,000 lives year-over-year on top of a record selling season in the first quarter of last year, driven by strong retention rates and another solid national account selling season and with growth in BlueCard members. Overall, these results reflect balanced growth and strong momentum in our diverse health benefits business, and we believe that our well-balanced portfolio of offerings will serve us well when Medicaid beneficiaries begin to transition coverage in the coming quarters. As we discussed at our investor conference last month, growth in medical membership translates to growth for Carelon, which continues to grow both organically and inorganically through expanding the scale and scope of services it provides to our own and other health plans. Carelon's momentum continued in the first quarter, evident in its top line growth of nearly 18% and margin expansion that allowed operating gain to grow by nearly 21%. Now, before discussing our first quarter results in more detail, I'd like to spend a minute on our adoption of the new GAAP accounting requirements for how insurance companies account for long-term future policy benefit liabilities and deferred acquisition costs. For us, this new accounting requirement impacts our Medicare supplement plans. We adopted the new accounting guidelines for the long duration targeted improvements at the beginning of the year and embedded the new approach in our initial 2023 guidance. The change does not impact our previously reported cash flow. Our current cash position or our business strategy and will not materially impact future operating results. However, the new accounting pronouncement required us to restate prior year results. In the GAAP reconciliation table at the end of our press release, we have shown the isolated impact of the new accounting policies on our first quarter 2022 earnings, which we consider to be immaterial. First quarter operating revenue of $41.9 billion, increased approximately 11% year-over-year. Growth was driven by higher premium revenue in Medicaid and Medicare, premium rate increases to cover overall cost trends and strong top line growth in CarelonRx and Carelon services. The medical loss ratio for the first quarter was 85.8%, an improvement of 30 basis points year-over-year, driven by premium rate adjustments in our Health Benefits business to more accurately reflect our post-pandemic cost structure. Our first quarter operating expense ratio came in at 11.5%, flat relative to the first quarter of 2022. Operating gain for the enterprise grew approximately 16% year-over-year in the first quarter as Carelon grew over 20%. And the Health Benefits delivered strong growth in the mid-teens percentage range on double-digit revenue growth and margin recovery of pandemic-era lows as we had expected. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 40.5%, up from 39.9% at year-end 2022. The increase was due to debt raised during the quarter, a portion of which was used to fund our acquisition of BioPlus, which closed in February and refinanced a debt maturity. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $476.66 for approximately $622 million. Days and claims payable ended the first quarter at 46 days, a decrease of 1.5 days sequentially and 0.9 days year-over-year. Declines in DCPs were primarily driven by mix. With the Omicron COVID surge in the first quarter of 2022 and COVID claims generally having a longer cycle time than our overall average, DCPs were elevated a year ago. Medical Claims Payable also included nearly $400 million more of provider pass-through payments related to Medicaid in the first quarter of last year compared to the first quarter of this year. Excluding provider pass-through payments from both periods, our Medical Claims Payable would have grown by 10.1% year-over-year compared with 9.4% growth in premium revenue. As a reminder, we expect our Days in Claims Payable to be in the low 40% range long-term. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $6.5 billion, including the early receipt of a month of premium revenue from CMS. Excluding it, operating cash flow was $3.5 billion or 1.7 times net income. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter performance and the strong start to the year. Momentum in our Health Benefits and Carelon businesses bolsters our confidence in delivering another year of growth in adjusted earnings per share, consistent with our long-term target compound annual growth rate of 12% to 15%. Given the strong start to the year, the balance and resilience of our enterprise and the momentum we have in each of our business segments, we have raised our full year outlook for adjusted earnings per share to greater than $32.70. As we look to the rest of 2023, our focus will remain on execution of our strategy and demonstrating that we have the best catchers met in the industry. We will continue to optimize our mature businesses, invest in high-growth opportunities and accelerate the growth of our organization through Carelon. And with that, operator, please open up the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. I'll use my question on the DCP discussion, given it's a pretty important topic going on across the industry right now. So, John, you talked about seasonality impacts. You talked about type -- different types of claims driving a little bit lower DCP. And then you said low 40s is where we're going. Now, over time, I think everyone in -- every managed care investor looks at DCP and thinks of it as quality of earnings metric, right? When it's going up, it's good and down, it's bad, right? And typically, you just think that there's more or less reserving going on. I know there's a lot more to it. So, maybe you can tell us what's been driving your DCP lower recently beyond what you talked about already? And how are we going to get to the low 40s, meaning is it going to be for lower reserving, or is it going to be the kind of mechanical aspects? And over what time period should we expect that to kind of normalize? Thanks. John Gallina : Thank you, Justin. And I do appreciate you you're taking your question or maybe I should say questions on DCP. But yes, our DCP is down by 1.5 days quarter-over-quarter and 0.9 days sequentially. And there's a lot of things that go into that calculation all the way from the number of days and the denominator can change on a quarter-over-quarter basis to various other aspects. I'll just state at the outset that our DCP will not get lower by reducing reserves. We have a very consistent and conservative methodology associated with our actuarial team. And in terms of coming up with reserves, those reserves are consistent here at March 31st as they were at December 31st and that there is no benefit to the income statement associated with this drop in DCP. So having that behind maybe talk a little bit about some of the mechanics that you asked about. We have a mix in the type of claims is obviously very important. And you look at a year ago, we were in the midst of the Omicron surge with COVID. COVID claims had a longer cycle time than other claims do. That had been the case through the entirety of the pandemic. And when you have a claim type that takes longer, both for the provider to bill us and for our adjudication process, the cycle time becomes longer, DCP just mathematically becomes a little bit inflated. And so with COVID being so much less in the first quarter of 2023 than it was in 2022 or 2021 for that matter, that cycle time is really very important, and so you see a drop. On reserves, and I made this comment in the prepared statements, but I think it's really important on the reserves, we have these retrospective provider pass-through payments that we get from our Medicaid partners, Medicaid states, And the amount of those reserves as of March of 2023 are $400 million less than they were at the end of March of 2022. And if we pulled out from the calculation from our reserves, these pass-through payments, which passed through by definition, have zero impact on net income. Then you would be able to see that our Medical Claims Payable balances have grown 10.1% year-over-year compared to a 9.4% growth in premium. Further, showing that our reserving methodologies are conservative, and our reserves are still very, very strong. So in terms of how long it's going to take to get to the low 40s, be another few years. And there's any number of constructs that could -- will occur. But we are starting to see payment cycles more consistent with pre-pandemic era payment cycles. And as those things are fully baked into the numbers, you should expect DCP to tweak down as a result. So thank you very much for the question and the opportunity to clarify all that. Gail Boudreaux : Yeah. Thanks, John, and thanks, Justin. And I just want to reiterate what John said because I think it is a really important question. We feel we had a really strong start to this year and that, again, reiterating that DCP didn't impact earnings. And as you think about all the factors John talked about really is the mix and the longer tail of COVID claims and entering a more reasonable payment cycle. So thanks very much for the question, the opportunity to provide a little more perspective there. Next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Hi everybody. Thanks for the question. MLR was right in line with expectations on a consolidated basis, at least Street expectations, 30 basis points better year-to-year. Can you comment on any trends you're seeing underlying that with both respect to service categories, areas of care management that are plus or minuses and as you look at your MLR guidance for the full year, any changes in your thinking about the rest of the year there? John Gallina : No, thank you for the question, A.J. We're certainly very comfortable with our MLR guidance and really pleased to report a first quarter medical loss ratio of 85.8%. And maybe reiterating what I stated at Investor Day, the overall cost structure and the overall trends are very much aligned with our expectations, consistent with our pricing methodologies and consistent with our thought process. Now those trends are slightly elevated from what cost trends were pre-pandemic level. But as I said, they're exactly in line with our expectations and exactly aligned with our pricing methodology. So our MLR certainly has improved from the first quarter of 2022. And I think you can see that coming through in the Health Benefits segment margins. But we're pretty comfortable with where trend sits right now compared to our expectations. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please, go ahead. Lance Wilkes : Yes. Could you talk a little bit about cross-sales in the quarter, in particular, I was interested in PBM cross sales and into your self-insured block? And then just in general, what your product strategy is with respect to self-insured as you're looking at your bundling in of some of your services businesses there? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks for the question, Lance. I'm going to ask Morgan Kendrick first to talk a little bit about our fee-based business and then probably, Pete, to share what's happening in Carelon, because I think you hit on a really important point. One, the improvement of services that we're selling through to commercial, it's been a strategy for a number of years, and we've made some nice progress, as you've seen just in the percentage of premium going up and the profit per member. And then, obviously, Carelon is a big part of that, not just with the PBM, but Carelon Services. So, Morgan, please share. Morgan Kendrick : Lance, thanks for the question. When we think about the fee-based business, we've had a really, really strong run in the past several years. And I think that goes back and speaks to the health and the value that we're driving to the market, especially to the employers who are actually spending their own money. To your point, Carelon is a big, big piece of it. We had a really nice selling cycle this year, in fact, with the pharmacy business. We didn't see very many jumbos in the medical side. So thus, that was sort of absent from the actual Rx percentage as well for us. But nonetheless, we're seeing more and more attraction to this idea of the whole integrated delivery model of pharmacy medical together and the value that's delivering. Secondly, you think about the other products that are working with Carelon on, whether it's the behavioral health, whether these are sort of the incentive programs around payment integrity and bill review, things of that nature that are really important to our self-funded customers, that continues to see very strong growth and attraction from the market. That said, at the end of the day, Pete's team and my team are working together to build for purpose things that create value in the market. And again, I'll anchor back to the three things that Gail mentioned in the beginning in her opening remarks. The market is keenly focused on affordability, experience and simplicity. And the more that we can pull together, the better it's going to be for our markets. And I think the connection here between Carelon and the commercial fee-based business is strategically critical to that, continuing to drive growth. Pete, I'll turn it to you. Peter Haytaian : All right. Thanks, Morgan. And thanks for the question, Lance. I'll start with the pharmacy and then I'll go to the services side of things. But as Morgan said, the integrated offerings that we're selling is really resonating in the marketplace. I think our economics are perceived today as being very strong. And we continue to see momentum, and we talked about this in the 10,000 or below segment where Morgan and the business have a lot of strength on the commercial side of the business. We've seen RFP activity, quite frankly, be up in 2023 year-over-year. And another thing that I'll say is that I'm pleased with is retention is improving overall. So that's a really good thing. We're working closely with Morgan right now on the 2024 selling season that has begun. The pipe is building. I would say that we're very interested in niche opportunities, again, where our Commercial business has a lot of strength. So for example, on the labor side as well as with TPAs. So we see continued a lot of opportunity and sort of either niche opportunities or that 10,000 and below. As it relates to services, as Morgan said, we're really building off of where we started. And Gail mentioned in her prepared remarks, things like the post-acute care offering, that's a great example of where we started in Medicare, and we're really expanding that now into Commercial and expanding it not only with for post-acute care services but the things like durable medical equipment as well as social determinants of health. And then in our medical benefits management business, formerly known as AIM, we are in-sourcing a lot of critical services that we're deploying and cross-selling into Morgan's business, things like genetic testing, oncology. So there's a lot of areas that I think are very important to Morgan on the Commercial business that we're driving through over the next year. So I appreciate that question. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thank you for the question. I would just offer one additional proof point. We've shared this before, which is -- the customers who are single sourcing with us that we have many times shared multiple carriers, and we've done 23 of those over the last few years. And I think that's another good example of our ability not only consolidate medical but also to sell additional services, and it shows the value that we're bringing to the market. So again, just another quick proof point on ability to cross-sell. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Ben Hendrix : Hey, thank you very much. Having had a little bit more time to work through the 2024 and a rate update and the RAD B rule, are there any incremental thoughts you can offer on the rate impact to Anthem's plans specifically and the extent to which the risk rebating and audit could impact physicians' willingness to take risk within the Carelon partnerships? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, Ben. And I guess, first, I'll start and then ask Felicia Norwood to provide some perspective. First and foremost, we were pleased to see that CMS moved to phase in the risk model in the final notice. That will give us time all in the industry and with care providers to adjust. So as you know, we're in the midst of the 2024 bids. So we won't talk a lot about that, but I'll ask Felicia maybe to share a little bit more perspective on everything. Felicia Norwood : Yes. Good morning, Ben. And thank you for that question. As Gail said, we're certainly pleased with the phase-in of the risk model changes. This will give us the opportunity to smooth the impact to beneficiaries as well as the providers who serve them. Medicare Advantage for us strategically is a very important business long-term, and we will continue to be very focused on trying to make sure that we have a Whole Health approach and health equity around certainly individuals who participate in this program significantly who have low incomes and are certainly very much underrepresented. As I've said before, the individuals in this program over 40% have incomes less than $25,000. And when we take a look at our opportunity around drivers of health and supplemental benefits, it's important that we're able to balance all of these things as we take a look at our bids for 2024 as well as what we need to do with our provider partners long-term. With that said, we certainly don't believe that we are disproportionately disadvantaged by any of the changes here relative to our competitors. And as we think about our strategy for 2024, we will continue to be very focused on how we grow this very important business for us and equally important, how we continue to deliver value for those that we're privileged to serve. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Good morning and thank you. I really wanted to go back to your primary care strategy. Gail, when you made your initial comments around Carelon and Carelon Services, you didn't talk about that. I was just wondering if maybe you could give us an update on the relationship you have with Aledade or other areas that you're thinking about as you continue to build on value-based care and relationships with primary care doctors? Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thank you for the question, Lisa. I think understanding our overall care provider strategy, it's really important that it's, first and foremost, critical to how we think about our health benefits business. And again, you said it at the beginning of the comments, it's about driving greater value-based care and importantly, increasing the amount of downside risk that we're going to share with providers. A couple of weeks ago, we shared with you, as you know, at the investor conference that our goal is to get to 80% of our consolidated health care reimbursement and value-based care by 27% and 40% downside. And again, we're sitting in the mid-60% right now and a little bit varied by business. But again, as you are thinking about our strategy, you mentioned Aledade and a few others, that's just one piece of it. It's important that we're trying to solve this for all lines of business and across multiple geographies. And so for us, we want it for Commercial, Medicaid, and Medicare. So, one size model isn't going to fit all for us. With respect to Carelon, what we're building and investing in our new enablement capabilities and those are going to allow us to accelerate the management and take more whole person risk from a variety of structures, quite frankly, not just through primary care. And again, I guess I would like to point out what's different about how we're thinking about scaling and leveraging what Carelon has and building across that continuum is that we really see a huge opportunity to enable and integrate specialty for the chronic and complex. That's an area you just heard Felicia talk about the dual population. It's a big population for us, specialized populations in Medicaid. And they're a huge part of benefit expense, and we think that's an area that has been under sourced quite frankly. So, as we think about it, yes, we are in partnerships. As you mentioned, some of those, they're important. They're helping us grow. But it's only one piece of our broader strategy, which, again, is to drive value-based care in our markets. And so we do see this as a big opportunity to drive both more consistency in our health benefits business, but also importantly drive operating gain and earnings inside of Carelon as we increase our capabilities. So, a little bit different than just primary care focused. I think much broader than that and how we're thinking about the overall strategy. Thanks very much for the question. Next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Thanks. Was interested maybe if you could drill in a little bit more on the post-acute care expansion in terms of where exactly things stand in terms of the scaling of that across the platform after the first quarter and then the timing on how you see that rolling out across the client base across Medicare and Commercial? And to the extent maybe just share some of the latest outcomes around that in terms of the key deliverables that you're driving for your clients on that? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Sure. Thanks, Scott, and I'll have Pete Haytaian address your questions. Thank you. Peter Haytaian : Thanks Scott. As we talked about, and Gail mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're really excited about this product offering. I talked about this at Investor Day, but we started on this journey a year, maybe 13, 14 months ago, we were able to fully implement this and finalize the implementation of this in the Medicare business in the first quarter. And that was with respect to the core post-acute care offering. And as we talked about, we are now expanding that with respect to durable medical equipment and social drivers of health. That will happen throughout this year. We are also expanding these services in terms of post-acute care into Medicare and Medicaid, and that will flow through this year and into next year. So there's a lot of runway still internally to drive these services. In terms of your question on key metrics and performance, that also is something that I'm very excited about. I mean, again, what we're trying to really do here is create a differentiated experience for post-acute care providers. So when they are in need of services or approval of services, they're dealing with technology in a portal that's differentiated, and it's a streamlined service so that they can get the approvals they need in the most appropriate fashion. And as we're looking at the different levels of post-acute care, we're seeing our performance play through and meet our original objectives. And that is that where appropriate, going to the appropriate levels of care and sites of care and then ultimately into the home, where cost and quality is most effective. And so we look across a series of metrics in that regard, and we're very pleased at the progress we're making. So in terms of the core product and the performance, very good; in terms of the expansion opportunity into other lines of business, that will happen over the next year into 2024. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Great. Thanks. Good morning everybody. So just a quick question here on your overall commercial membership. Aside from the impact from the repricing strategy that you've talked about for a while now on the risk book, I think it's also kind of noteworthy that US unemployment hasn't really increased so far in 2023. I guess when thinking about both the commercial risk and the fee-based push, just want to get your thoughts on the just seeming lack of negative macroeconomic impact on the commercial membership year-to-date at this stage? And whether that could create any upside bias on the overall commercial membership? I know redeterminations are a big factor at around this year, but just curious on the macro view from your perspective. Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Steve. I'll ask Morgan to provide a little more color. But I guess I would say, if you look at the history of our business, we've had a pretty resilient book of business, both matched a little bit heavily \u2013 more heavily to government business, but we, quite frankly, diversified that and see nice growth in the individual, which you mentioned. From the employer perspective, I would just point to two things. One, we continue, as Morgan said, around those three areas of experience and value affordability to really drive, I think, a distinctive offering in the marketplace. So that served us well, certainly in the fee-based business, but also BlueCard. The Blue system overall, our BlueCard numbers are up, and that shows the distinctive value we add in our network across the entire system. So I think that's another -- in a recessionary whatever kind of environment that you might think about, we actually, I think, managed quite well because of distinctive value, and we're continuing to innovate our products. But I'll ask Morgan maybe to trade a little bit more color on how we see in the marketplace. Morgan Kendrick : Steven, one thing to camp on to Gail's comments there. When you think about our business, we're -- as she indicated, we're certainly not very indexed so to speak, in the hospitality industry, the tech industry. To Gail's point, it's more government business and you think about our downmarket business in particular. It's -- I don't like to use the word resilient, but it certainly is to a degree more so than others that have a different focus of the business. When you think about the recessionary times being negative, of course, it's interesting because the market tends to gravitate to certainty. And I think that's what we're seeing, when we're seeing employers consolidate benefit decisions into single vendor, when employers were having all-time high persistency rates, not only upmarket, but also down market, certainly experienced attrition in the risk-based business downmarket, which was purposeful as we written that book, but feel really good about the progress that we're making and feel really good about the way the assets are being seen and resonating in the market with our customers. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Nathan Rich : Good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to follow up on A.J.'s question on utilization. Could you talk about how you expect cost trends to develop over the course of the year? And I guess, we've seen some data points on increases in procedure volumes. And at the Analyst Day, you had talked about cost pressure from the new GLP-1 drugs. I guess, are you comfortable that if we continue to see higher utilization in areas like these that it would be captured within your MLR guidance for the year? John Gallina : Yes. Thank you, Nathan. Appreciate the question, and I'll start with the end of your question first. We are very confident that the utilization trends that we are seeing are captured on our MLR guidance for the year. So that is not an issue at all as we sit here today. In terms of some of the cost pressures, they said there are cost pressures and there are a lot of areas that are doing better than we had had anticipated. On the GLP-1, that's been talked about quite a bit. We've got a lot of protocols in there. I do want to make sure people are clear that GLP-1 is both weight loss and diabetes. And for weight loss, we do not cover weight loss drugs, with the exception of a few states where it's required by state law. So that's not really has ever been part of the conversation and was never part of any of the commentary. I just want to make sure everybody was clear on that. And then in terms of the diabetes drugs, certainly, we want to making sure that people who have diabetes that need access to those drugs are getting access to them, but to have the appropriate protocol, so that they're not utilized for purposes that are other than medical necessity for diabetes-type folks. And on the other side of the equation, we're still seeing very good trends, maybe in terms of ER is still below pandemic era or pre-pandemic era levels. We've got -- COVID is actually a bit less than we had estimated at this point in time. We had a more mild flu season. The timing of when we pay for the vaccine serum in terms of the boosters has now been pushed out later in the year. There are many, many, many estimates that go into trend. Overall, we are very comfortable with where we sit today. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please, go ahead. Dave Windley : All right. Thank you for taking my question. Good morning. I wanted to go to redetermination with that -- upon us. You talked about working with the states very closely for several quarters now. At the Investor Day, we were involved in some discussions where there was a little bit more detail offered around states prospectively estimating changes in the risk pool from redetermination and factoring that into rates. And so that seems a little bit more supportive, I guess, of margin prospectively and something we would be -- need to be less concerned about as this evolves and the risk pool changes. I wondered if you could add some color to that and perhaps talk about what the composite rate looks like, how much higher it is than normal as a result of that type of activity? Thanks. John Gallina : Thank you, Dave. I'll start out with just addressing the acuity factor is what you were describing, which is now part of a standardized Medicaid rate renewal process associated with what the belief is the acuity of the population will be those covered, which is different than what existed in 2019. And so we feel very good about that. The acuity shifts are now a standard input into the actuarial rating models. And as I said, that was not the case in 2019. We -- this has started here already in 2023 in January. We work very closely with our state partners to ensure that we have actuarially justified rates. And since the acuity factors part of that actuarial assessment, we feel very, very good about it. In terms of the exact percentage, that's not something that we're going to talk about here publicly. Each state is different. Each state has its actuaries. We have our actuaries. We have had very, very good success at having the meeting of the minds with the vast majority of our states in terms of actuarially equivalent rates. So we feel very good about it. But nothing really has changed in terms of our ability to hit our numbers for the rest of the year and where we think are really our great catchers met that we have positions us well for Medicaid redeterminations regardless where the members end up going to seek health insurance coverage. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks, John. And maybe I'll ask Felicia just to give a little bit of perspective on what's happening with redeterminations because the process has started, but it's fairly early in the process. So Felicia? Felicia Norwood : Yes. Thank you, Gail. And Dave, thank you for the question. as we talked at Investor Day, we've been hard at work at this for some period of time with our state partners, all with the goal of trying to make sure that those individuals who have had access to health care coverage continue to maintain that assess, whether or not that's on the Medicaid side or certainly on the Commercial side and an exchange product. So as we think about where we are today, our teams are engaged in almost weekly meetings with our state partners. We have been advancing a lot of thought leadership around outreach and contact with members, being able to shore up administrative processes around addresses, making sure we're able to reach out to members wherever they are and also being able to have processes that help to provide a seamless transition where possible between our Medicaid business and then what happens on the Commercial side. We're very fortunate of the collaboration we've had here with Morgan and his team, and I think that positions us well for how we capture members as they move from Medicaid over to a Commercial product. Gail mentioned earlier, our Ready, Set renew campaign, the mobile initiatives that we've developed, all trying to meet members wherever they are. in this process and then have the ability with our state partners to be able to align around the kinds of ways that we can outreach to Medicaid members in ways that we haven't done before. So we feel fully prepared. We are pleased to see the engagement of beneficiaries as they are reaching out to understand what this process means for them ultimately with the goal of trying to make sure that we continue coverage for as many of those individuals as we possibly can. At the end of the day, we have strong collaboration with our states at this point. Great visibility in terms of how we are positioned around trying to maintain actuarially sound rates through this process and being able to work closely as we move through redeterminations, albeit early, but very vigilantly and diligent with our state partners as we move through this over the next 12 to 14 months. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Felicia. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Please go ahead. Kevin Caliendo : Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. Really appreciated the answer on the DCPs. And I guess just in the commentary that trend is normal and you're not really seeing anything extraordinary there. I guess my question is why are MLRs not really beating anymore. We're hearing trend is normal. We understand Days in Claims Payable and why they're coming down. It just feels like the risk to MLR right now is greater. Is there -- is it a pricing issue? Is it a mix issue? Is it just that this is the new normal, and we're sort of back to where trend and pricing are much more similar and maybe we just got spoiled through the years of COVID? John Gallina : Thank you for that question, Kevin. And I guess the first thing I really do have to say is we feel very good about where MLR came in and where trend came in, and it actually was a bit better than our expectations. So, when I look at what we have been projecting as of the beginning of the year, our 86.8% is actually positive to those expectations. In terms of pricing, our goal is always to price to cover forward trend and then to guide that way. We had said that for Commercial that there were some underlying cost structures associated with COVID that we needed to ensure that our pricing reflected not only forward trend, but also that so that our total pricing reflected the overall cost structure. I think we've done a very, very good job now here at the end of the first quarter of really trying to get -- hit that sweet spot of pricing to really retain a nice large cohort of our membership as well as to see the margin expansion. So, we actually feel very, very good about where the results are and do believe that we're a bit better than we had anticipated even 90 days ago. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. Wanted to ask about the exchange presence. Obviously, you're growing that well, expanding into markets. The market always loves growth, but then there becomes a time when growth could be too much growth. So, I wanted to get a little more color on kind of how membership or equality data you have around what that performance looks like so far? And then how you're thinking about the risk profile of the redetermination population back on to the exchanges? Is that something that you think would have a normal margin, a higher margin, or lower margin than the exchange business overall? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks for the question, Kevin. I'll start and then ask Morgan to share his perspective. I think one of the things about our presence in the exchange marketplace is that we've been very consistent around sort of where we started. We've always been in that business. Quite frankly, we've never lost money in that business. So, we've been very careful about the expansion, and we've done it, I would say, on a very paced way. So, over the last several years, we've added counties as we've understood them, re-contracted, make sure the network was specifically curated. I think we've done a nice job of understanding the risk adjustment mechanisms and all of those things. So, in total, as we -- this year added more counties, that was a very paced and understood expansion. So, we feel very good about it, quite frankly. We feel very good about the performance profile of the members in there because we have a really good handle on who they are and kind of what our expectations are. And as they come in from Medicaid, obviously, we know the Medicaid profile as well because we're big in those states, too. So I guess my answer would be, look, we aren't someone who just came into the exchanges and one big fell swoop and wanted to make a big hit one year. We've had a very paced and measured progression of both our growth as well as our expansion, so feel very good about that. But maybe Morgan, if you want to add a couple of more comments about that. Morgan Kendrick : Kevin, thanks for the question, and Gail. I don't know there's a whole lot to add back to the comment around pace and sustainability of the business, Kevin. We took this very measured approach, certainly, looking at Medicaid redeterminations, we wanted to make sure we were expanding into the areas where we could serve as many members as we could in our 14 geographies. That said, the interesting thing about this cycle, we had a lot of ins and outs in the market with competitors that had come in and then left. So it left a lot of movement in the market that perhaps ordinarily wouldn't have occurred. So back to Gail's comments, we feel good about where we're positioned. We feel good about the economics behind it and are positioned well for when redetermination begins. Kevin Fischbeck : Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you for the question. One last question. Operator : And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Yeah, hi. Thanks. I was hoping to get a quick update on how the government business performed in the first quarter. I think you previously had talked about Medicare Advantage as being a margin tailwind year-over-year for 2023, but I didn't necessarily see that in the release or the prepared remarks as a driver on the MLR line. So I just want to understand that a little bit better. Thank you. John Gallina : Yeah. Thanks, Steve. I appreciate the question. And as you think about the -- some of the tailwinds that we have in 2023, it certainly includes the repricing of commercial to better reflect the overall cost structure. We're still doing fine in Medicaid. And then as you pointed out, the Medicare Advantage we now have a higher percent star revenue than we did the year before, and our risk-adjusted scores are getting back to more normalized levels. So it definitely is one of the tailwinds that we are -- that we do have for 2023. So the fact that it wasn't in the prepared comments, don't read anything into that specifically other than to say that it's really -- it's a very good be a growing line of business for us over the next several years, and we feel very, very good about how well-positioned we are. And then with the three-year phase-in of the rate notice, I think we can certainly manage through that as well. So Medicare Advantage continues to be a very important line of business for us. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Yeah. And thanks for the question. Thanks, John. And overall, I guess, reiterate we do feel the government business performed better than expectations. So we feel very good about to be specific to your question. Gail Boudreaux : Now I'd like to close by saying thank you. We're pleased to have delivered a strong start to 2023, and we're confident that the ongoing execution of our strategy positions us to continue delivering against the financial targets that we shared with you at our investor conference last month. Through a steadfast focus on whole health and our diverse and expanding suite of products and solutions, we will continue to meet the needs of consumers, customers and the communities that we serve, advancing our strategy of becoming a lifetime trusted health partner. We'll keep executing with focus and discipline to bring increasing value to all of our stakeholders. Thank you for your interest in Elevance Health, and have a great rest of the week.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session where participants are encouraged to present a single question. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Please go ahead. Steve Tanal : Good morning, and welcome to Elevance Health's second quarter 2023 earnings call. This is Steve Tanal, Vice President of Investor Relations and with us this morning on the earnings call are, Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Peter Haytaian, President of Carelon; Morgan Kendrick, President of our Commercial and Specialty Health Benefits division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Health Benefits division. Gail will begin the call with a brief discussion of the quarter and recent progress against our strategic initiatives. John will then discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, elevancehealth.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Elevance Health. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we are pleased to share that Elevance Health delivered strong second quarter results, driven by solid execution and continued progress towards our strategy of becoming a lifetime trusted health partner, focused on the whole health needs of the consumers we are privileged to serve. Second quarter GAAP earnings per share was $7.79 and adjusted earnings per share was $9.04, reflecting double-digit growth year-over-year as a result of the strong performance in the first half of the year and momentum across Elevance Health. We are increasing our adjusted earnings per share outlook for the year to be greater than $32.85. The balance and resilience of our diverse businesses provides confidence in our near-term outlook, while the earnings power of our Health Benefits and Carelon businesses position us to deliver on our long-term growth commitments. With respect to the second quarter, our Health Benefits business delivered particularly strong results as we continued to optimize our products, pricing and operations. We are successfully executing against the planned margin recovery of our commercial risk and Medicare Advantage businesses back toward pre-pandemic levels, and we are pleased with the performance of our Medicaid business. With Medicaid eligibility redeterminations now underway, our teams are working tirelessly to promote continuity of coverage for consumers through an omni-channel approach, working closely with our state partners. Our Medicaid and commercial colleagues are collaborating to educate members and communities on the process through in-person and online events, ensuring members know how to renew their Medicaid coverage when eligible or enroll in other forms of coverage, including our own individual ACA plans. To date, we have contacted more than 1.5 million of our Medicaid members. Meanwhile, our web-based digital decision support tool is seeing healthy utilization. The tool assesses eligibility for a wide variety of federal and state programs beyond health insurance to support consumers\u2019 whole health journey, including the federal supplemental nutrition assistance program, state-based programs that assist with food and security, housing and childcare programs, and more, with links that can route consumers to websites where they can enroll in these programs. More than half of the people using our support tool who qualify for commercial or Medicare coverage are clicking through embedded links to shop for plans and more than 60% of consumers eligible for Medicaid are clicking through to their state site for recertification. This body of work is especially important since many of the people who have lost access to Medicaid so far are losing it for administrative reasons. We expect many of these consumer will re-enroll in Medicaid over time. Transitions of coverage are not typically immediate. But emerging data points suggest consumers losing Medicaid are starting to transition onto ACA exchange plans. It's still early in the process and our expectations for coverage transitions remain unchanged. Our deep local roots and diversified product portfolio positions us uniquely well to meet consumers' needs regardless of age or socioeconomic status. Carelon continued to advance its strategy of integrating physical, behavioral, social, and pharmacy services to deliver whole health affordably, with ongoing investments and capabilities focused on serving people across their entire healthcare journey, connecting them to the care, support, and resources they need. Carelon Services delivered solid organic growth led by the expansion of post-acute care management solutions with our Medicare health plans. While Carelon Behavioral Health extended its leadership position through multiple external business wins with new and existing customers, new business awards and successful execution in these fast growing high-cost areas of trend underscore the value Carelon provides to health plans and the expanding earnings power and attractive growth profile of the Carelon Services business. CarelonRx also continued to grow nicely while investing in key value drivers. Specifically, specialty pharmacy and advanced home delivery revenue grew nearly 20% year-over-year and we posted solid operating earnings while absorbing investments in support of our long-term strategy. The integration of the BioPlus Specialty Pharmacy is now tracking ahead of schedule and we expect to begin migrating scripts early next year. Additionally, we remain on track to launch advanced home delivery by the end of 2023. Together, these capabilities will create additional shareholder value while allowing us to deliver even better consumer experiences in specialty and maintenance pharmacy. Expanding and more deeply integrating value-based care across the care continuum is foundational to our enterprise strategy. We are making significant progress in many key areas, including maternal health, where we have continued to expand our obstetrics practice consultants and quality incentive programs to additional markets given outstanding early results. These programs have helped improve timeliness to and adequacy of prenatal care and increased postpartum visit compliance, contributing to a reduction in pre-term births of 12% and low-birth weight deliveries of 20% in participating Medicaid populations. These programs have driven cost savings per delivery and first-year mom and baby costs of 5% to 10% and we are now offering them in 24 Medicaid and 11 commercial markets across the country. We're also working with care provider partners to enable acute care in the home, a patient centered care alternative to traditional care in the hospital that improves cost, quality and patient experiences. For select patients, acute care at home is safe, improves patient satisfaction and provides high value care, resulting in approximately a 20% reduction in cost, a 25% decrease in readmissions and a 50% reduction in time spent in bed. We have partnerships with a number of major health systems in our markets with strong results and have significant interest from other health systems to expand this work. Connectivity with care provider partners is crucial to supporting our value-based care strategy and to enabling personalized hybrid and virtual care. We are continuing to expand bi-directional data exchanges between our systems and care providers EMRs. Across 24 markets, we are now connected with over 1,700 hospitals. In addition to enabling physicians practice value-based care more effectively, these arrangements have simplified common business practices, resulting in more than 60% fewer requests for clinical information and more than 80% less provider appeals. This has not only enhanced operating efficiency for our clinicians and care provider partners, it has also accelerated care approval processes for consumers. Automation remains an area of focus and opportunity across Elevance Health and deep data sets like ours are foundational for generative artificial intelligence. Our data is centralized and cleansed and we are in the process of scaling digital solutions for greater impact and testing the application of new technologies. We're harnessing our adaptive artificial intelligent solution to promote identification and access to whole health services during physical health procedures like surgery. Our approach allows us to cast a broad net to perform initial screenings for depression and other social drivers of health to ensure we are addressing our members\u2019 whole health needs. Our digital chronic concierge care program is a cloud-based care management platform that connects the patient's entire care management team to triage, monitor and engage with patients through convenient digital channels. Fully digital enrollment, engagement and support, alongside key behavioral health components, provides members with highly personalized proactive, concierge-like experiences, while reducing the overall cost of care for members with chronic conditions. We're also using large language models to assist our call center agents, improving their efficiency, accuracy and quality. We're excited about these opportunities and the positive impacts they will have on consumers, care provider partners and the operating efficiency of Elevance Health. Guided by our enterprise strategy, we are fueled by a passion for making a positive difference in the world. Accordingly, environmental, social and governance frameworks are embedded in our enterprise strategy. We continue to lead our sector with respect to ESG ratings from three of the most prominent corporate governance research, ratings and analytics firms. And we were pleased that USA Today recently ranked Elevance Health fifth out of 400 organizations in its inaugural America\u2019s Climate Leaders, based on core emissions reductions year-over-year and core greenhouse gas reductions. Before I turn the call over to John, I'd like to thank our more than 100,000 associates for the works that they do every day on behalf of the members we are privileged to serve. Their dedication is what allows us to advance our strategy and deliver strong operating results in service of our bold purpose to improve the health of humanity. Collectively, our passion to improve lives and communities is unwavering. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to John for more on our operating results. John? John Gallina : Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported strong second quarter results, including GAAP earnings per share of $7.79 and adjusted earnings per share of $9.04. We were pleased to deliver another quarter of double-digit growth in revenue, operating income and adjusted earnings per share, driven by the focused execution of our strategy. Our results exceeded our expectations and the balance and resilience of our diverse set of businesses provides confidence in our outlook. As a result, we have increased our adjusted earnings per share guidance to be greater than $32.85 in 2023, reflecting strong growth consistent with our long-term targeted compound annual growth rate. We ended the second quarter with 48 million members, up 938,000 year-over-year. During the quarter, medical membership declined by 135,000 members as the majority of our Medicaid states initiated eligibility redeterminations. While we are still very early in the redetermination process, at this time, we are seeing many Medicaid members losing coverage for administrative reasons. Many of these consumers will likely re-enroll in Medicaid in the near to intermediate term. In fact, many Medicaid beneficiaries who lose coverage for administrative reasons have 30 to 90 days to re-enroll depending on the state with coverage retroactive to the termination date. Meanwhile, we are seeing encouraging early indications that Medicaid beneficiaries losing coverage are transitioning into ACA exchange plans. But transitions of coverage are not always immediate. And our expectation is that commercial membership growth will re-accelerate in the back half of this year and into 2024. Overall, we believe our prior outlook for coverage transitions remains appropriate. We continue to expect by the end of the initial redetermination cycle that 40% to 45% of net new beneficiaries on Medicaid as a result of the suspension of redeterminations during the public health emergency will stay on Medicaid. But most importantly, we are well positioned to provide people who lose Medicaid coverage with alternative plan offerings. We believe it is essential that these individuals have access to quality healthcare coverage and we are positioned to meet their needs. With respect to our membership outlook, please note that a new entrant into one of our state Medicaid programs will result in a loss of approximately 140,000 members in that state in the third quarter. This was known as of last year and was factored into our 2023 planning and initial membership guidance. Second quarter operating revenue of $43.4 billion increased $4.9 billion or approximately 12.7% year-over-year. Growth was driven by premium rate increases to cover overall trend in our Health Benefits businesses, along with higher premium revenue driven by membership growth in Medicaid and Medicare. Our services business, Carelon, continues to produce strong results with double digit top-line growth in CarelonRx and Carelon Services, as we continue to execute on our strategy of becoming a lifetime trusted health partner. Execution of our strategy is diversifying our revenue streams, creating greater earnings power and consistency, and enabling us to deliver strong growth regardless of the prevailing economic environment. The consolidated benefit expense ratio for the second quarter was 86.4%, a meaningful improvement year-over-year, driven by premium rate adjustments in our commercial risk-based business to better reflect the post-pandemic medical cost structure, offset in part by a charge we took in the second quarter associated with a court ruling in a certain state holding health plans liable for certain COVID costs retroactive to the beginning of the pandemic. We strongly disagree with this ruling and it is currently on appeal, but we've recorded the potential charge in the meantime. With respect to our current performance, we of course are closely monitoring utilization and trend factors which remain consistent with our expectations overall and within each line of business. In the context of our upwardly revised guidance for adjusted earnings per share, we are reiterating our initial outlook for our full year consolidated benefit expense ratio. Elevance Health's adjusted operating expense ratio was 11% in the second quarter, down 10 basis points year-over-year. The decrease was driven by expense leverage associated with strong growth in operating revenue, partially offset by additional operating expenses in support of growth as we continue to execute our enterprise strategy. Operating gain for the enterprise grew 12% year-over-year in the second quarter, led by our Health Benefits business, which delivered double-digit top-line growth and strong margin improvement. Operating margin for our Health Benefits business expanded by 50 basis points year-over-year, consistent with our full year outlook despite absorbing the charge I mentioned earlier associated with the adverse court ruling in a certain state. Carelon delivered a strong quarter as well, with healthy top-line growth for CarelonRx and Carelon Services. CarelonRX operating earnings include investments in support of our strategy, including scaling our recently acquired specialty pharmacy and the build-out of our advanced home delivery business, which is set to launch later this year. CarelonRx also benefited from a favorable out-of-period item in the second quarter of 2022, which had the effect of depressing its year-on-year operating earnings growth rate this quarter. Carelon Services had a strong second quarter, led by organic growth in Carelon post-acute management. Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with a debt to capital ratio of 39.6%, in line with our expectations and consistent with our target range. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average share price $457.34 for approximately $646 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 2.7 million shares for $1.3 billion, pacing ahead of our full year outlook of approximately $2 billion. We expect to remain opportunistic given recent weakness in our share price and the attractive valuation levels offered by the market. We continue to maintain a prudent posture with respect to reserves. Days and claims payable stood at 46.5 days at the end of the second quarter, an increase of 0.5 days sequentially and a decrease of 1.3 days year-over-year. As we disclosed in the second quarter of last year, the timing of certain provider pass-through payments and corresponding reserves had the effect of increasing days and claims payable by approximately 1.8 days in the prior year quarter. Excluding that dynamic, days and claims payable would have increased by 0.5 days year-over-year and medical claims payable would have grown by 11.9%, compared with growth in premium revenue of 10.6%. As a reminder, we continue to expect days and claims payable will be in the low-40 range long term and anticipate normalization towards this range in the coming years as cycle time shortened in COVID-related uncertainty receipts. Operating cash flow was approximately $2 billion or 1.1 times net income in the second quarter of 2023. Year-to-date, excluding an extra payment received from CMS, our operating cash flow was $4.9 billion or 1.3 times net income. Overall, we are pleased with our second quarter and our year-to-date performance. As we look to the second half of the year, we are excited for the pending acquisition of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana, the launch of our CarelonRx Pharmacy, a differentiated digital-first home delivery model and the continued scaling of BioPlus as it prepares to serve more Elevance Health members in early 2024. Given the strong start to the year, the diversity of our assets, and the balance and resilience of our enterprise, we have raised our full year outlook for adjusted earnings per share to greater than $32.85, reflecting growth that is consistent with our long-term target compound annual growth rate. We have consistently delivered on our financial commitments and have the conviction that we will continue to do so. We will remain focused on the execution of our strategy to become a lifetime trusted health partner by serving the whole health needs of the consumers we are privileged to serve. The better job we do serving our members, the better we will do for all of our stakeholders. With that, operator, we will now open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Appreciate the good performance on the medical loss ratio line and that you're benefiting from your repricing in the commercial book, which you've been talking about for a while. You didn't really call out anything that's deviating from your underlying expectations relative to Medicare Advantage, commercial and Medicaid. I just wondered if you would maybe flush that out a little more. Are you seeing any trend changes or anything on the horizon? And how did you think about the MA bids in light of anything you saw there on the utilization front? John Gallina : Thank you for the kind words, AJ, and good morning everyone. And I really do appreciate the question and the opportunity to provide clarity on these issues. We're obviously very pleased with our results for the second quarter, which is really following delivery of strong results also in the first quarter. And related to your question and the issues on trend, and I do think part of the confusion out there is trying to understand what is happening versus what is expected or what was expected. And as we've noted previously, when you combine COVID and non-COVID cost, the overall cost of the healthcare system is more expensive than if COVID had never occurred, something we've been talking about and analyzing and stating for a while now. So given that fact, we had already included the elevated cost structure into our pricing, into our projections and into our guidance. And quite honestly, this is true for all lines of business within the Health Benefits segment. So if you look at the first and second quarter in particular, there really isn't anything all that surprising or all that different from our overall expectations. Cost continued to be higher when compared to a baseline as if COVID never existed. So we obviously are very well positioned. And as you know, based on this morning's call, we raised our guidance by $0.15 to $32.85 per share. And those expectations fall solidly within our 12% to 15% compound annual long-term growth rate target. But I think just as importantly, as you heard in my prepared comments, we reaffirmed our original guidance for the full year 2023 benefit expense ratio. So, anyway, thanks for the question, AJ. And, operator, next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Lance Wilkes : Yeah. Could you talk a little bit about in Carelon, the combination of where you're getting those wins, the types of organizations you're winning with, the self-insured employers or other Blues, and then where you are as far as the build-out of the pharmacy capabilities, the advanced home delivery and how if at all that impacts your re-contracting -- upcoming re-contracting for PBM? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks very much, Lance, for the question. I'm going to have Pete Haytaian address it, but I think you hit a couple of key areas around Carelon on both Services and Rx where we feel that we're advancing the strategy that we laid out at Investor Day and feel really good about the progress. So Pete, why don't you talk about both of those areas? Peter Haytaian : Yeah. Thanks, Gail, and thanks, Lance. I really appreciate the question. And you know this, we've talked a lot about it, but a big part of our strategy is obviously to focus on managing high cost, high trends areas. Gail talked about it today in her prepared remarks. And then obviously, capitating risk down to -- through Elevance -- with Elevance Health first in mind, and we are -- part of our strategy was to drive that value through Elevance Health first and then have that translate externally. And we are seeing that play through very, very nicely. I'll give you a sense of quickly what's happening internally and then, Lance, to your question how that translates externally. Internally, we're working very closely with the P&L. And we continue to accelerate a lot of opportunity. We talked about finalizing the post-acute care initiative this year. That's over 1.2 million Medicare members. We just launched a new durable medical equipment offering as well with our Medicare business and we're expanding that to commercial. And in our medical benefits management, which was formerly AIM, we've insourced a lot of critical services around genetic testing and things like oncology. So a lot of energy around that and then of course the behavioral health, physical health opportunity and assuming full risk on that is a tremendous opportunity as well. And interestingly enough, we are have -- where we're having a lot of success internally, that is actually translating in our external pipeline, and specifically with the Blues. As we talk about the Blues and they see us having a lot of confidence and good performance internally in Elevance, they're interested in some of those same solutions. So I would say at the top of the list, when you look at our pipeline and the growth in our pipeline, the home solutions through myNEXUS, an uphold of Carelon post-acute care solutions, is getting a lot of visibility. The post-acute care offering that we just launched in our Medicare business internally is also driving a lot of excitement in the pipeline. And I would also say that there is a decent amount of interest in some of the innovations around payment integrity. So I think a lot of opportunity, not only still internally, but that will translate as it relates to the Blues. As it relates to advanced home delivery and the launch of CarelonRx Pharmacy, that was the second part of your question, again, really, really excited about this initiative. And as we've talked about overall for our pharmacy strategy, its aim is to source the strategic levers that really matter. And we're doing that both with obviously what we're doing in specialty and in sourcing this activity. But I wouldn't look at this as only in-sourcing mail. I would look at it more broadly in terms of what we're trying to do to get closer to the member and differentiate in terms of our experience overall with our consumers. Think of the capabilities that we're deploying. Number one, this is going to be connected to Sydney, our consumer engagement platform. There's going to be a convenient quick scheduling of medications. If you think about access to pharmacists and how critical that is, we're going to have access to a pharmacist 24/7. So that's a big differentiator. And then importantly, I think a lot of people know that the experience with mail isn't necessarily always smooth. And so we're going to have an easy view of where delivery stands, an Uber-like experience, quite frankly. So you know where your pharmaceutical stand in terms of their delivery. So a lot in that regard in terms of really differentiating ourselves on experience and we're excited about that. And as Gail said, we're ready to launch that heading into 2024. Gail Boudreaux : Yeah. Thank you, Pete. As you can hear from the excitement I think from Pete and all the things we're doing about Carelon Services and CarelonRx, there's a lot going on to really build our strategy and I think execute on it. And I guess I would just punctuate two things that Pete talked about. One, the behavioral health area. We really see ourselves as a leader in the crisis management area as well as we're seeing a lot of internal or external validated -- validity of that strategy. And I think starting to pull through not just in its historic government business, but also on the commercial side where they're integrating physical and behavioral in particular, which is a core part of our whole health strategy. And then on the pharmacy side, again, we're really trying to make sure that the value and strategic levers are coming through and you heard that in what Pete talked about. So thanks for the question, Lance, and next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. First, just wanted to follow-up on AJ's question to see if you can give us a little color. You're saying trend is above normal and you priced for it. We appreciate that color. Just any kind of incremental that you can give us on how much higher and what you've seen in 1Q to 2Q might be helpful? And then my question is just take that to the margin side, right, can you tell us how margins are running versus the expectations coming into the year? I know you had expected improvement in Medicare and commercial and obviously some volatility in Medicaid. Can you tell us how those are running in specifically, anything on Medicare beyond Puerto Rico issues you discussed in the second quarter would be helpful? Thanks. Or how that's trending? John Gallina : Yeah. Thank you for the question, Justin. And I'm happy to provide the follow-up. As I said, I'll start out by reiterating, we did raise our EPS guidance and proactively reaffirmed MLR guidance for the year. So I think that actually has a hoard view of trend inherent in it. Yeah. But having said that, I'm not so sure that we're really seeing anything that much differently than some other folks have been saying. We've been expecting the cost of healthcare to be elevated compared to the baseline as if COVID never existed. I'm not going to provide a specific point estimate, but only to say that we've seen it, we've priced for it and we've included and factored it into our expectations. And this is the second time this year we've raised guidance and reaffirming the MLR outlook. So I think we're in pretty good position. Associated with the margins, commercial is doing very well. I'll start out with Health Benefits in total. That's our Health Benefits segment. Margins improved 50 basis points year-over-year and are on track to hit the guidance of greater than -- improvement of 30 basis points to 60 basis points. I do want to note in my prepared comments, I had a comment about a court ruling that we disagree with that we took a charge. Without that charge, the margin improvement would have been higher than the high end of the 30 basis point to 60 basis point improvement year-over-year. So Health Benefits margins are going quite well. Commercial repricing effort, Medicaid is very much in line with expectations and Medicare Advantage is actually relatively in line with expectations aside from the one geography that have been pointed out that really is not all that material or significant to the overall results of Elevance Health. But it's an area that we're focused on and there will obviously be improvement opportunities for 2024. So, all in, we are very pleased with our performance and very bullish on our expectations for the rest of the year. Gail Boudreaux : Yeah. Thanks, John, and thanks for the questions, Justin. I think it's important we've been very consistent all year. We haven't changed our view of how we see MLR and feel very comfortable as John said in the guidance that we gave and where we're heading on margins. So thanks again for the question and opportunity to comment. Next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Michael Ha from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael Ha : All right. Thank you. Regarding Medicaid redetermination, fully appreciate -- understand how it's too early to really extrapolate any current results. But thus far, number one, how's the acuity mix shift tracking relative to your expectations? Number two, how do you view this enrollment so far? Florida looks positive, but the recent Texas data, does that concern you at all? Number three, with the number of states going through mid-year rate renewals, are you seeing acuity adjustments in these draft rates and would that represent upside to your guidance? Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : I'm going to ask Felicia Norwood, who leads our Government business to comment on Medicaid. Thanks. Felicia Norwood : So, Michael, good morning. Appreciate the opportunity to talk about redeterminations where our teams have certainly spent quite a bit of time trying to make sure that individuals who are eligible for Medicaid continue to maintain their eligibility. So it is still very early. And it's important that we don't draw conclusions based on a few months in, because the redetermination cycle is going to extend well into 2024. And with that said, I will say what we have seen so far is certainly relative -- consistent with our expectations, albeit with a great deal of variability as you go from state to state. At the end of the day, however, we still believe that the guidance that we provided is certainly appropriate. As you know, CMS gave states guidelines to really do this over a 14-month period. But at the end of the day, states are taking their own approach, and some of those have certainly front-loaded or accelerated the redetermination process based on members that they believe are no longer eligible. As we take a look at this today, we do expect that many of these members will return to Medicaid once we continue our outreach, and they're able to provide the documentation to the states that they need. So when we look at where we are today, those members could come back over a 30 or 90-day period and we are very much focused on advocacy with our community-based organizations, our care provider partners, the federally qualified health centers, all of those entities that impact our members every single day. With that said, I will say that some of the front-loading that occurred, has happened in some of the states where we don't have Elevance Health in terms of a Blue state platform. And so we haven't fully seen the appreciation of our catcher's mitt, but we are fully prepared in collaboration with our commercial partners to be able to do that. In terms of your question with respect to rates, we are always fully engaged with our state partners in terms of the rate setting process. At this point, we have visibility into almost all of our rates for 2023 and many of them for \u201824. What we are seeing so far is in line with our expectations. States are certainly taking acuity into the rate setting process that we see. And certainly they have the ability to work collaboratively with us if we see things that they don't see. But our early reads on acuity for our kind of leavers versus our stayers is in line with the expectations that we've seen so far. So at this point, we feel good about where we are from a rate perspective for 2023. The collaboration with our state partners remains strong. Shifts in acuity are now our standard input into the rate setting process. So we've been very much pleased with how that's going with our state partners. And we will continue to work very strongly to make sure that individuals who are truly eligible for Medicaid continue to have access to coverage. And those who aren't, that they are able to have coverage through one of our exchange or commercial based products. So thank you for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Yeah. So Michael, as you heard from Felicia, there's a lot there and there's incredible work across our enterprise going into this. But overall, it's aligned very closely with the expectations we set. So thank you for the question. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. The margin pressure in Carelon year-over-year I saw on the press release was attributed to higher medical cost trends and the non-recurrence of an out-of-period favorable adjustment last year. Could you just explain the higher medical cost and maybe what specific line items that is, if that's behavioral or Rx or something? Peter Haytaian : Yeah, thanks for the question, Josh. It's Pete Haytaian here. First of all, in terms of Carelon\u2019s overall -- the Carelon Services overall performance from an operating perspective, we're very pleased. Op gains saw a nice improvement year-over-year. And just to be clear, as it relates to our margin profile for the year, we're very confident in achieving the 25 basis points to 50 basis points guidance that we gave in terms of margin improvement over the year. In terms of the variation there, a lot of this has to do with seasonality and as seasonality continues to evolve, we are sort of seeing differences there. This year, what's different than previous years is we're driving a lot more business through the government business. So as I talked about in my earlier comments, in terms of the post-acute care initiative with our Medicare teams, as well as the durable medical equipment opportunity, these are examples of things where we're driving a lot more business through the government business and that's translating into earnings really being weighted to the back half of the year. So that's where the difference is. In terms of the one-time issue, I think you're probably referencing pharmacy. And in the case of pharmacy again to speak about how we're performing there, we're very pleased overall with how that's going in terms of our margin performance. The 6% to 6.5% range in terms of margin performance for the year and guidance that we gave, we still feel very comfortable with that. The one-time issue that occurred in terms of the year-over-year difference, Q2 \u201822 versus this year, was a one-time favorable positive impact that we experienced in pharmacy last year that we're not seeing this year. But overall, pharmacy is performing very, very well. And we feel very comfortable with the 6% to 6.5% guidance for the year. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Yeah. Good morning, guys. As it relates to Medicare Advantage, I'm wondering if we can kind of revisit an old topic, which is the changes to the risk model that CMS announced at the beginning of April. I guess as you guys have had more time to kind of digest the proposed risk model changes, can you talk a little bit about how it makes you guys think about \u201924 just as some of your peers have kind of talked about the risk model kind of driving meaningful changes to kind of both benefit design and the bid process? We would love any update you could provide around that. Felicia Norwood : Good morning, George. It's Felicia Norwood. If we take a look at the risk model changes for 2024, they certainly were an integral part of our strategy as we thought about our bid process. But let me start by saying that we feel good about our bids for 2024. I believe when we step back and take a look at where we are, we continue to recognize the importance of stability in our offerings to seniors. And I think that we have submitted bids that take into consideration both the risk model changes as well as the importance of having those benefits that are critical to seniors as we go forward. It's always going to be a very highly competitive environment in Medicare Advantage. We always expect that. But from our perspective, this is something that we've had the opportunity to be very thoughtful about. And as we put our bids together each year, we're always taking a very balanced approach between our aspirations for growth as well as with respect to margins. And I think that we have landed in a place where we're going to be offering attractive plans for our seniors that provide sustainable economics for us for the long term. So thank you very much for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much and good morning. I just want to go back to a comment that John made. And that's around higher cost if COVID never happened. And so, one, I just want to understand, is there a pent-up demand because of COVID? Is that the reason for that comment? And then secondly, both at your Analyst Day and I think at another conference, you called out GLP-1s is running higher. Can you maybe just put that into perspective for us as to how much that can add to a medical cost trend? And does that benefit your pharmacy side of your benefit business as you see that higher utilization? John Gallina : Thanks for the question, Lisa, and good morning. Yeah, associated with trends and COVID existing versus not existing and what the baseline might have been, it's really not a lot of pent-up demand for care. There certainly can be small pockets of that. But in general, the healthcare system was pretty much open for business quite significantly in 2022. There may have been some staffing shortages that impacted that ever so slightly, but not all that significantly, we don't believe. And we just think that it's really -- it's an overall increasing in cost structure. COVID is not gone. It still exists. It's just no longer the big significant driving force that it had been for the past several years. And so as we look at things in total, we see a higher cost structure in general. And then associated with GLP-1 drugs, that is one element of a multitude of elements as part of an overall trend conversation. And as I said, trend overall is consistent with our expectation. So we feel very good about that. And can there be an upside on CarelonRx? Well, certainly a small one, but not enough to really change the trajectory at this point. So thank you for the questions. Gail Boudreaux : Next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. I just want to go back to redeterminations and how you're thinking about that. I think you said that you expected to keep about 40% to 45% of the Medicaid redetermination growth, which I think is something close to about a 4% CAGRs into 2019, which seems a little high to me given that total employment is up about 3 million over that time period. So can you just maybe refresh how you're thinking about keeping those people, why they'll stay on and then maybe the other 55%, if you can kind of give an update on anything you're seeing there about how those people re-enroll and through the year how we should expect then to come on? You mentioned some delays. Is there a way to think about Q2 disenrollment, when do they show up on either employer coverage or the exchanges? Thanks. John Gallina : Yeah. Thanks, Kevin. Appreciate the question. Associated with the 40% to 45%, I'm not positive about the CAGR you're looking at from \u201819 and exactly what's in the baseline and what all the thought processes are versus qualifications and eligibility requirements. But as we do our review in our work and certainly access a lot of independent studies as well, we feel very comfortable that we believe that 40% to 45% will stay on. And that's really a projection for what will be the ultimate result a year from now after the entire redetermination process occurs and things shake out. So I think it's a very reasonable expectation and we feel very good about it. And then in terms of the overall coverage patterns, everything else, one thing to point out that might be inherent in your question is as we look at the second quarter of 2023, actually many of our states, Medicaid states that are not Blue states, actually went a little bit earlier on in the beginning of the redetermination. So everybody will have started redeterminations by now. But when you look at who started in the April, May timeframe, for us, it was more heavily weighted to the states that are not our Blue states. So we still feel very good about our overall catcher's mitt and the fact that we think 20% to 25% of these folks will ultimately end up on employer sponsored plans, 20% to 25% will ultimately end up in an individual ACA product, 40% to 45% will stay on Medicaid. And that's what we're tracking to and we actually have some insights into the states that are starting in June, it looks very promising that our thought process is going to be validated. So thank you for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks. And the only thing I'd add to that is, again, there's a timing lag here, but we feel our expectations are very much aligned. And we are seeing, particularly in the individual change, that -- early states that our applications are up at a much higher rate than they were prior to redeterminations, which you would expect and given our commercial market share in our Blue states. So very well positioned in the ACA market for those that will ultimately not keep Medicaid coverage. But again, as I shared in my early remarks, we're working really hard to make sure that everyone who's going through this process in conjunction with our state partners understands the options that are available to us. And that's been very positive. We're seeing a lot of really good uptake and we're actually contacting, having great success rates in contacting individuals where we have the information. So those are very encouraging early signs to us. And again, we'll continue to update as we get through this process because many of the states are really just in the throes of it, certainly our Blue states. But, thanks very much for the question. Next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Hi, thanks. I was hoping first you could just maybe touch on the EPS split expected for 3Q versus 4Q. And then my main question is just sort of taking the discussion we're having on the cost structure for medical costs in 2023, just interested in how you're thinking about that rolling forward into 2024. We're already starting to capture a lot of early data points on commercial premium pricing and it looks like the environment is hardening quite a bit in terms of pricing trends. And so just interested in how you're sort of thinking about sort of pricing for cost trends for \u201924? Thanks. John Gallina : Yeah. Thanks for the question, and good morning. In terms of our EPS, guidance, as you know, we raised it to $32.85 or greater than $32.85. And I think that would assume that a little bit more than 56% of our earnings will have occurred in the first half of the year. So when you look at the last six months of the year, we are actually pretty comfortable with what the current consensus estimates have associated with the third quarter and with the seasonality that the current consensus estimates have inherent in it. And that is that the third quarter will be a bit more profitable than the fourth quarter which is very consistent with the typical seasonality of our business. And then for \u201824, as you know, it's just really premature to go into a 2024 conversation at this time. We'll provide a lot more insights on that at the end of the year, a little bit more in the third quarter and a lot more at the end of the year and have a more robust conversation about 2024 at that time. Gail Boudreaux : Yeah, thanks again for that question. And again on just your pricing question, we've got a very consistent approach to pricing and we're going to keep that discipline as we project our forward view of cost. So I don't think anything has changed though. There's not a whole lot more that's new, but we're very disciplined about our projection and how we see that and that's how we price to. So thanks for the question and next question. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Thanks. Good morning. This was touched on a little bit with your comment though that commercial membership growth should re-accelerate in the back half of \u201823 and into \u201924. Just curious if you could remind us whether or not that's due almost all to the potential tailwinds for redetermination or are there other factors that are just -- either such as a more favorable market dynamics related to low unemployment or any potential expectation of market share gains for Elevance for \u201824 that might help your commercial membership growth acceleration outlook? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Sure. I'll ask Morgan Kendrick, who leads Commercial business maybe to comment a little bit about commercial and what we're seeing in the marketplace. Morgan Kendrick : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Steve. Morgan here. I wanted to address -- I\u2019d say that our expectations for membership growth are in line with what we projected and discussed at other instances. One of the things that's interesting though is we're wrapping up our national cycle. And so that's almost complete. One thing notably this year, it felt like the receipts were coming in slower or later and the actual decisions were made longer, which isn't terribly inconsistent with what we see during an economic shift if you think of things and where the affordability really matters. Our local market right now, we're just now getting into 4Q when we think about our business, and 3Q, 4Q and then [1,1] (ph), all of which look promising. We've gotten into some of the bigger lower market wins for next year and we're pleased with how the assets are resonating. And when go back and speak to national, we've had just an unbelievable run for the past several years. That's not different this year, but we've talked many times about each one of these cycles have nuances. There are three things that I think are important to note. Number one, this cycle for us when we think about our largest employers that will be in the end of the year into next year, there was a very, very large cohort of in force business. So this was a very strong retention year for our company that's been quite successful, which again reinforces how the assets are being resonating with some of the most discerning buyers in the country. Secondly, our win share continues at the rate that we've seen, albeit on a lower pipeline and smaller case count. But then lastly, I think the notable conclusion of the notable piece that we've shared in the past several years, we're continuing to see strong growth internally where employers are consolidating their benefit partners from one vendor -- from multiple vendors to one. So that's continuing with us. So all in, we feel good about our continued trajectory in the business. And as noted earlier our pricing activities continue with our forward view of trend. So we're quite optimistic at this point. Thank you again for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks, Morgan. And again, just reiterating something that Morgan just said, I think is important is the consolidation trend where we become single source has been accelerating in the last few years and we continue to see that. That's a notable trend this year. And I think what's important is we're also seeing it not just in medical coverage but beginning to consolidate with Carelon Services as well. So that's a very positive trend for the strategy around whole health that we laid out. Thank you. Next question. I think this will be our last question. Operator : Our final question comes from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : Great. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on the CarelonRx margins. I think they were down sequentially from the first quarter. Could you maybe just elaborate a bit more on what drove that margin step-down? I know you had BioPlus rolling in. But do you still expect margins to be flattish for the full year? And then on biosimilars, how has the pricing of biosimilar Humira come in relative to expectations? And is that a significant swing factor to kind of in the outlook for that segment? Peter Haytaian : Yeah, Nathan. Thanks for the question. This is Pete. Again, when we think about our operating performance in CarelonRx, I'll just say upfront, we're confident in our pharmacy business. And if you exclude BioPlus, we will come in at that 6% to 6.5% range. So flattish as we talked about. And as Gail mentioned in her prepared remarks, we're continuing to invest and things like BioPlus and advanced home delivery. BioPlus, our original guidance did not include BioPlus. And so that as we talked about that, that's had a bit of dilution. But again, outside of BioPlus, we're very confident in coming in into the 6% to 6.5% range. As it relates to your question on Humira and biosimilars, again, as we said, we're very excited about biosimilars coming into the marketplace and how that's going to drive overall cost and affordability down the road. We and CarelonRx have been very, very focused on driving lowest net cost. We obviously were well aware of what occurred in July in terms of the launches and we've been staying very, very close to that. And as we've said before, we have historically supported biosimilars alongside our reference brand. On Humira, we do expect to include a biosimilar or biosimilars in a similar formulary position as Humira this year. We're not going to go into more specifics in terms of timing or specifically what we're going to do, but we will do that. And I would finally say that with the addition of BioPlus in our portfolio, I think we're now in a much better position to directly manage specialty pharmacy more holistically. So appreciate your questions. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Pete. Now I'd like to close by saying thank you. We're pleased with our performance year to date and we're confident that the ongoing execution of our strategy positions us well for the balance of 2023 and in the years to come. Through a steadfast focus on whole health and our diverse and expanding suite of products and solutions, we'll continue to meet the needs of clients, consumers and communities we serve, advancing our strategy of becoming a lifetime trusted health partner. Thank you all for your interest in Elevance Health, and have a great rest of week.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session where participants are encouraged to present a single question. [Operator Instructions] These instructions will be repeated prior to the question-and-answer portion of this call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Please go ahead. Steve Tanal : Good morning, and welcome to Elevance Health's third quarter 2023 earnings call. This is Steve Tanal, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning on the earnings call are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; and Peter Haytaian, President of Carelon; Morgan Kendrick, President of our Commercial and Specialty Health Benefits business; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Health Benefits business. Gail will begin the call with a brief discussion of the quarter and recent progress against our strategic initiatives. John will then discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, elevancehealth.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Elevance Health. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to share that Elevance Health delivered another solid quarter of financial and operational performance, reflecting the strength and resilience of our diversified portfolio of businesses. Third quarter GAAP earnings per share was $5.45, including a charge we took during the quarter that I will discuss in detail in a moment. Adjusted earnings per share was $8.99 and reflecting growth of approximately 20% over the third quarter of 2022. Our results demonstrate our ability to execute on our enterprise strategy of delivering whole health solutions that are affordable, personalized and simple. Based on our strong year-to-date results and confidence in our outlook, we are increasing our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to be greater than $33 for 2023, which includes incremental investments planned for the fourth quarter that will accelerate our strategy and enhance the performance of our Medicare Advantage business. It is the strength and resilience of our diverse businesses that provides comfort in our outlook, while the earnings power of our Health Benefits and Carelon division provides us the confidence to reiterate our commitment to our long-term target compound annual growth rate in adjusted earnings per share of 12% to 15%. Let me now turn to some highlights from our business segments. Starting with our Health Benefits division, which delivered robust third quarter results as we continue optimizing our diverse set of businesses, while responding to a dynamic and evolving business environment. In our Commercial Risk business, we are successfully executing on our goal to deliver operating margins in line with pre-pandemic norms. Retention has been consistent with our expectations, and we're pleased with our progress, which we expect will extend well into 2024. In the employer market, we're delivering differentiated value where it matters for employers, affordability, experience and simplicity. Over the past three years, we've become the sole source medical benefits provider for 32 of our national clients, including nine additional customers who will be consolidating their coverage with us effective January 2024. For large employers, we continue to deliver differentiated value and are seeing employers move away from point solutions and slice offerings to selecting Elevance Health as their strategic partner for the integration of all of their medical benefits. Consistent with these results, our advocacy solutions business, which provides personalized guidance and support to help members both navigate the complex healthcare system and optimize their health and well-being will add 37 new clients in 2024 covering more than 550,000 members. This includes two large employers who are returning to Elevance Health after previously testing third party advocacy vendors. In the individual market, we are seeing strong growth in plans that offer affordable and comprehensive coverage designed around the needs of consumers in our communities, including those transitioning from Medicaid to individual ACA coverage. Year-to-date, our individual membership has grown by 27%. Through the first half of this year, the latest period for which industry data is available, our individual ACA membership growth rate more than tripled that of our competitors in our 14 Blue states. Our government business also posted a strong quarter. In our Medicaid business, rates are actuarially appropriate, but we are absorbing a membership headwind related to the pace of Medicaid redeterminations, especially in states that have adopted accelerated time lines. Nearly three-quarters of all Medicaid beneficiaries terminated in our markets to-date have less coverage for administrative reasons and 37% of the attrition from our own health plans has been driven by individuals under 18 years of age, many of whom may still be eligible for Medicaid benefits. We are doing all we can to ensure continuity of coverage for as many consumers as possible, working closely with our state partners to ensure individuals eligible for Medicaid retain coverage while also offering affordable ACA exchange plans in nearly all of our Blue counties. We are seeing encouraging signs in some of our Blue states where we offer Medicaid and commercial coverage. We have seen 30% or more of our Medicaid members who were terminated prior to the end of June, return or retain coverage with Elevance Health, albeit with gaps in coverage that can extend for several months. We expect re-enrollment to accelerate in the coming quarters as we continue with our omni-channel approach to outreach and engagement, ensuring our members are aware of their options. Accordingly, we anticipate the rate of membership attrition associated with redeterminations will slow considerably in the coming quarters. In Medicare, we continue to offer high-quality plans that provide seniors access to comprehensive and coordinated care, and we are committed to doing so for the long-term. We're disappointed, however, with our Stars performance for measurement year 2022, which is the basis for Star ratings that will impact the 2025 payment year and specifically, with our decline in consumer survey scores and the way in which CMS applied a new statistical methodology that resulted in significant increases to many star measure touchpoints. To improve our performance in future periods, we have already commenced investments in four primary areas : service, product, network access and operations. For example, in July of this year, we built on the success of our innovative advocacy model in the employer market by adapting it for the unique needs of Medicare eligible consumers. This new program, My Health Advocate is a comprehensive, personalized and relationship-based customer service model that enables our members to effectively navigate the health care system, their benefits, and ultimately, to improve their overall health and well-being. Furthermore, we have enhanced our core and supplemental benefits to reduce member's out-of-pocket costs for prescription medications, simplified our dental benefits and strengthened our grocery and over-the-counter benefits. We're also simplifying consumer and provider experiences through the automation and elimination of certain prior authorizations, accelerating our work with value-based care provider partners and improving clinical decision appeal rates. Collectively, these actions and the ongoing investments should enhance our performance in key star measures and ultimately increase member satisfaction with our plans. We are actively pursuing all our options and exploring actions to mitigate the direct financial impact on payment year 2025, including through contract diversification, operating efficiency, and capital deployment alternatives. We will provide updates on our action plans and progress in future engagements in advance of 2025. Moving to Carelon. We are pleased with our momentum in the business as it continues to advance its strategy of integrated physical, behavioral, social and pharmacy services to deliver whole health affordably. Carelon Services delivered particularly strong growth in operating earnings, led by the expansion of our post-acute care management solutions. We also extended our service offerings in adjacent areas, including durable medical equipment and wound care, further enhancing our customer value proposition and differentiation. CarelonRx continues to make significant progress towards the near-term rollout of multiple new capabilities that will enhance the affordability and experience of pharmacy for our members and CarelonRx customers. One of these capabilities is EnsureRx an integrated benefit for commercial pharmacy members. That compares the benefit cost for over 50 covered generic medications to our network of multiple cash discount cards then automatically applies the lowest cost at any pharmacy. The program launches early next year, and we will save our customers money while enhancing their experience EnsureRx will also capture claim data to ensure full safety checks and maintain the integrity of our data. We're also pleased with the integration of BioPlus, which continues to track ahead of schedule, and we expect to begin migrating specialty scripts from our legacy pharmacy platform early next year. Finally, we remain on track to launch our advanced home delivery capability in the fourth quarter. Together, these businesses will allow us to deliver even better consumer experiences and enhance affordability while creating additional shareholder value over time. Now I'd like to address the actions we took during the quarter to transform our cost structure and enhance our operating efficiency. With affordability of health care, a paramount concern for all of our customers and more uncertainty in the business environment heading into 2024, we took proactive and decisive action in the third quarter to increase our financial and operational flexibility and to ensure we will remain well-positioned to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. Specifically, we completed a strategic review of our operations, assets and the investments we've made over the years to identify opportunities to increase efficiency and enhance focus, all while driving greater impact from our programs at scale. This resulted in workforce and asset optimization that will make us more nimble, focused and efficient and allow us to concentrate our resources on the most promising programs while further optimizing our physical footprint. The pace of technological innovation is rapid and accelerating, and we are committed to keeping pace. As we pivot away from some legacy projects including those tied to systems that are being replaced with cloud-based models, we are also scaling key digital programs for greater impact. One example is HealthOS, a key enabler of our strategy that is helping to change the way care providers deliver care, while reducing administrative burden. HealthOS is our digital platform for health that allows us to exchange data bi-directionally with providers in real time and essential to a number of our priorities, including our approach to value-based care. We are also in the early stages of rolling out new AI capabilities and large language models that are helping us personalize member experiences and automate administrative tasks. We're excited about the possibilities of the rapid technological innovation that is underway and are committed to continuous improvement, innovation and the ongoing optimization of our processes reengineering much of what we do while delivering more personalized experiences to our members along the way. Before I close \u2013 and are committed to continuous improvement, innovation and the ongoing optimization of our processes, reengineering much of what we do while delivering more personalized experiences to our members along the way. Before I close, I'd like to note that we remain confident in our ability to close the acquisition of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana. We're actively working with local regulators and stakeholders to address any remaining questions. The deal offers tremendous value and opportunity for the people of Louisiana, including through the creation of a multibillion dollar foundation focused on improving their health and lives, and we look forward to the privilege of serving as their lifetime trusted health partner. As you will hear from John in just a moment, the balance of our diverse set of businesses, the momentum of our enterprise strategy and the decisive actions we have taken to enhance our operating efficiency, give us confidence in our ability to deliver strong growth in adjusted earnings per share in 2024. In closing, I want to thank all of our associates around the world for their dedication and hard work. In the third quarter, we were also pleased to be named one of America's greatest workplaces by Newsweek and the number one best large workplace in health care by Fortune. It is the work our associates do every day on behalf of the individuals we are privileged to serve that allows us to deliver strong operating results in service of our bold purpose to improve the health of humanity. Collectively, we are fueled by passion for having a positive impact on our communities, our members and the environment. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John to provide more on our operating results and outlook. John? John Gallina : Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported strong third quarter results. Given outperformance against our initial expectations year-to-date, we have increased our outlook for adjusted earnings per share in 2023 to be greater than $33, reflecting growth consistent with our long-term compound annual target of 12% to 15%. Our outlook includes incremental investments we have planned for the fourth quarter to support growth in Medicare Advantage in 2024 and beyond. Based on our updated guidance, our five-year compound annual growth rate in earnings per share is expected to be 16%, which makes Elevance Health the only company in our sector to have exceeded 15% over that time frame. We ended the third quarter with 47.3 million members, an increase of 42,000 members year-over-year driven by growth in BlueCard and ACA membership. During the quarter, medical membership declined by 664,000, driven by attrition in Medicaid due to eligibility redeterminations and a new entrant into one of our state programs in July, which resulted in a loss of approximately 140,000 Medicaid members. We are now three to four months into redeterminations of most of our states, and this enrollment in many appears to be front loaded with approximately three quarters of those terminated from Medicaid having lost coverage for administrative reasons. We are seeing many consumers return to Medicaid after being temporarily disenrolled, while others are experiencing gaps in coverage before transitioning on to ACA exchange plans. Given the patterns we have observed to-date, we expect reenrollment in the Medicaid and transitions to ACA exchange plans to accelerate. Operating revenue in the third quarter was $42.5 billion, an increase of 7.2% over the prior year quarter. Growth was driven by rate increases to cover overall trend in our health benefits business, coupled with double-digit top line growth in CarelonRx driven by growth in pharmacy customers and the acquisition of BioPlus. The consolidated benefit expense ratio for the third quarter was 86.8% an improvement of 40 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year, driven by premium rate adjustments to cover medical cost trend and solid performance within our government business. Now I would like to spend a moment discussing the business optimization charge we announced as part of our results this morning. As Gail mentioned earlier, we took decisive action during the quarter to position our company for long-term success by enhancing operating efficiency, refining the focus of our investments and optimizing our physical footprint. These actions will ensure we stay well positioned to provide affordable products while delivering on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. As a result of this strategic review, we incurred a business optimization charge of approximately $700 million, comprised of write-offs and write-downs of internally developed software and related assets, severance and leases associated with optimizing our physical footprint. These actions will result in gross annual run rate operating expense savings of approximately $750 million per year, a portion of which will be reinvested in growth opportunities, including Medicare Advantage and the accelerated rollout of certain digital capabilities. We are committed to doing even better and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance operating efficiency further. Elevance Health's adjusted operating expense ratio in the third quarter was 11.1%, and a decrease of 30 basis points over the prior year quarter. However, the third quarter last year included additional out-of-period quality improvement expenses due to the accounting realignment we announced then. Excluding out-of-period quality improvement expenses in the third quarter of last year, our adjusted operating expense ratio would have been unchanged. Adjusted operating gain for the enterprise grew 12.6%, led by our Health Benefits business, which delivered double-digit growth as we continue to optimize premium rates and products while enhancing operating efficiency across the segment. Operating margin for our Health Benefits improved by 30 basis points year-over-year consistent with our expectations. Carelon also delivered a strong quarter with growth in pharmacy growth in pharmacy customers and the acquisition of BioPlus propelling CarelonRx to 17.5% revenue growth. CarelonRx operating earnings included investments to support the build-out of our specialty pharmacy and advanced home delivery capabilities both of which will ramp up in the coming months. In addition, comparisons to the third quarter of 2022 have been negatively affected by the out-of-period fee-based revenue realized in the third quarter of last year. In Carelon Services, strong growth in operating earnings was driven by expansion of Carelon post-acute solutions and growth in our behavioral health business. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with debt-to-capital ratio of 39.2%, in line our with our expectations and consistent with our target range. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock for $480 million. Year-to-date, we repurchased 3.8 million shares of common stock for 1.7 billion, pacing ahead of our full year outlook of approximately $2 billion. We will remain opportunistic with share repurchases, especially considering the share price and recent volatility in the market. As noted in our earnings release, we ended the quarter with $5.1 billion of board-approved share repurchase authorization remaining. We continue to maintain an appropriately prudent posture with respect to reserves. Days and claims payable stood at 48.6 days at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 2.1 days sequentially and an increase of 0.9 days year-over-year. As a reminder, we continue to expect days in claims payable to be in the low 40s range over time and anticipate normalization towards this range in the coming quarters as cycle times shortened and COVID-related claims uncertainty recedes. Operating cash flow was approximately $2.6 billion or two times net income in the third quarter of 2023. Excluding the impact of the business optimization charge I discussed earlier, operating cash flow would have been 1.4 times net income. Given strong performance year-to-date, we are planning to make planning to make incremental investments in the fourth incremental investments in the fourth quarter in Medicare Advantage marketing and retention and in capabilities and services that we expect will enhance customer satisfaction, supporting our growth in 2024 and beyond.  While we are disappointed in the outcome of the recently released Star quality ratings, we remain committed to this important line of business for the long-term and are exploring all options to mitigate the financial impact on 2025. Turning to 2024. Although we are not planning to provide specific guidance on this call, I would like to review some of the tailwinds and headwinds that are known at this time, starting with our tailwinds. We continue to optimize our health benefits business, including by executing a multiyear margin recovery in our commercial risk-based margins to return to pre-pandemic levels and expect margin improvement will continue next year. We also anticipate improvement in Medicare earnings, driven in part by corrective actions taken in our 2024 Medicare Advantage bids to improve financial performance in Puerto Rico, where we experienced significant challenges this year. We expect continued momentum in Carelon, including growth in Carelon services, driven by new product launches and opportunities for meaningful external growth across businesses and the ramp-up of BioPlus and the launch of Carelon Advanced Home delivery both of which to supplement ongoing momentum within Carelon Rx. We also expect to enhance operating efficiency as a result of the actions we took during the third quarter and we'll continue to look for opportunities to drive efficiency as we transform our cost structure over the long term. And we expect today's higher interest rate environment to drive growth in investment income. Our tailwinds will be partially offset by our headwinds, which all relate to the Medicaid business, where we anticipate membership attrition associated with ongoing eligibility redeterminations and the net loss of approximately 930,000 additional members associated with changes in our footprint. While Medicaid rates remain actuarially sound, we're also mindful of the risks associated with evolving risk pools. And we'll continue to monitor and manage these dynamics closely. Beyond 2024, Medicaid offers attractive long-term growth opportunities, notably in specialized populations, and we anticipate a return to growth in 2025 and beyond. Most importantly, the balance and resilience of our diverse businesses provides confidence in our near-term outlook while the earnings power of our Health Benefits and Carelon Divisions, position us to deliver on our long-term growth commitments. At this point in time, we believe the current consensus estimate for adjusted earnings per share of approximately $37 in 2024 is appropriate. And we anticipate delivering another year of growth consistent with our long-term compound annual growth rate target next year. We look forward to providing more specific guidance, on our fourth quarter earnings call. Finally, as many of you know, this will be my last earnings call as CFO of Elevance Health. It has been a pleasure to serve this organization for more than 29 years, including the past seven in my current role. I have been involved in 88 quarterly earnings calls since Anthem went public in 2001, including 30 of them as Chief Financial Officer. Every year has had its opportunities and challenges and 2024 is no different. We serve our members while furthering our mission and will continue to meet and exceed our shareholder commitments. The balance and resilience of our businesses has created numerous tailwinds and has allowed us to overcome various headwinds, and I'm confident we will continue to do so. I feel fortunate to have been part of what I believe to be the best leadership team in the industry and to be leading the finance organization in an even stronger position than when I took over. I've enjoyed engaging with all of you over the years. I want to thank you for your support. I look forward to supporting Mark Kaye, as he assumes the role of CFO, ensuring a smooth transition before retiring, to spend more time with my family in the first quarter of next year. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Hi everybody. Thanks and John, I wish you the best and the retirement. It's been great working with you, and I really appreciate all the help over the years. I want to maybe just ask on the commercial at margin improvement story and what you've been doing there, is if you ex-out that the year this quarter, what was the underlying cost trend for you? Did you see any pockets of variance and utilization that are worth calling out? And you guys have said on the recorded or the message so far, several times that you have that there will be some additional benefits on the commercial margin improvement story into next year. Is there any way to size that that or talk about relative to how much gain you had this year from that repricing and the other things you're doing to improve the margin on the commercial side? John Gallina : Good morning, A.J. and thank you for the kind words at the beginning. In terms of answering your question specifically though, we're certainly obviously very pleased with the performance of our health benefits businesses in the third quarter as well as year-to-date. As you know, we've increased margins quite significantly. And the health benefit segment margins, we guided to improve those 30 to 60 basis points year-over-year, and we're very much on track to deliver that. From a line of business, in particular, we're not providing specific margin information and specific detail on commercial versus Medicaid versus Medicare since we are operating this as a holistic health benefit segment. But we do expect continued improvement in the commercial margins into '24 as we continue to work on our strategy of ensuring that the pricing truly reflects the underlying cost structure, as well as additional penetrations in the fee-based businesses what we used to call the 5 to 131 strategy. So, we feel very good about where we're heading and our trajectory into 2024. So thank you for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks for the question, A.J., and I'll just reiterate John's comments on commercial. I think the team has done a really nice job as we shared, this is a multiyear journey in terms of the commercial business, and we feel like we're right on track. And as -- the team has done a really nice job of balancing both membership retention, as well as getting our margins in line where we believe they need to be. So thanks for the question. And next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : Great. Good morning, and thanks for the question. And let me just echo my congratulations, John, on your retirement. I wanted to ask on the Medicare business. Could you talk about the goal for improving Star scores? Are you investing to kind of get back to the level that you are out with 65% of members in 4-star plans? And over what period are you thinking? And how should we think about the magnitude of the incremental investments planned for the fourth quarter as well as into next year. And any comment on the kind of how long it would take to reach the run rate of optimization savings, the $750 million that you talked about would be helpful as well. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, Nathan. Let me -- I anticipate a number of questions around star. So perhaps I'll just address that topic holistically. Improving stars for us is an enterprise priority. So I want to start with that. And we have a long-term commitment to the MA business and are committed to offering high-quality plans for seniors. But as I said in my opening comments, we're extremely disappointed on the recent results of the Stars and the decline that we saw in the number of our members in 4-star plans for payment year '25. Just a little background, I think, might help. We experienced some declines in the CAP survey scores, which were the most heavily weighted measures. And we were also impacted by that new CMS statistical methodology, which caused some significant increases in cut points. As you think about our performance, we improved in about half of the star measures, but those were not enough to offset the impact of the heavily weighted measures and higher cut points, therefore, having three of our largest contracts suffered in our star ratings, which you've noted. As I shared, we have already started making those investments and earlier this year, we were specifically addressing areas around the heightened focus for CAHPS that drove the decline. One of the very specific examples is scaling the My Health Advocate model, which again I shared a little bit about that in my opening remarks. The model is unique and highly personalized customer service and it's tailored specifically to help members with problems central to CAHPS improvement. It's a model that we've had in place in our commercial business and has been incredibly successful. Other areas that we saw in the data were about enhancing our core and supplemental benefits to reduce members out-of-pocket costs, which showed up in our start results, and also simplifying how those members use our over-the-counter benefits. We've gone on a journey around value-based care, as we've shared with you and we're going to continue to accelerate that and embed some of those results as well into our contracting process. And we also made tech steps last year to improve the processes around clinical decision appeals, which was also an area around the higher cut points. In terms of financial impact, we expect a reduction in 2025 quality bonus revenue of approximately $500 million after offsets from our contracting provisions. As John and I both shared, we've already aggressively begun to mitigate that headwind for 2025, and we do have a number of levels at our disposal, including contract diversification, operating expense efficiencies, capital deployment and looking at targeted network and product enhancements. Overall, we're going to continue to work on that. Our timelines have already begun on this I feel we have a very, very good line of sight to the opportunities that we have. And again, because of the diversified business model that we've talked to you about, we feel that the earnings power of our combined businesses between health benefits and Carelon allow us to continue to feel comfortable about our adjusted earnings for share growth annually of 12% to 15% over the long-term. So thanks again for the question. Appreciate the opportunity to holistically address what we're doing about STARS. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, hi, good morning. This is [Kyle] on for Lisa. Just want to add my thanks to John. I'm wishing all the best. Switching to Medicaid, appreciate all the color on the redeterminations and the front-loaded disenrollment trends. Can you talk about how membership is trending relative to what you expected earlier this year and how acuity mix is trending? And then related on the commercial side, how membership growth is tracking it in the employer group and individual businesses? Are you guys getting the growth you anticipated? And is there anything to call out on the margin side? Is there anything about this year and the 2024? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you for the question, Kyle, and certainly appreciate all the commentary. First of all, on Medicaid, the Medicaid disenrollment, as we said, has been very much front-loaded. And in terms of how that compares to our expectations, our expectations were as it would have been more normalized over a 12 to 14 month process. What we are seeing is that there's administrative churn and that a lot of people are losing Medicaid coverage temporarily and then they're coming back on. We're reenrolling folks 30, 60, 90 days after they were disenrolled and that was, that dynamic was not part of the original thought process but it's certainly part of the reality. I'd like to say September 30th or December 31st for that matter is just going to be one point in time over a 12 month to 14 month process. What we have not seen, and maybe the most important element is that at the beginning of the year, when we discussed that we think that we're going to going to retain about 40% to 45% of all Medicaid members who received coverage during the PHE, we still believe that is a very good estimate. And by the time the dust settles in the third quarter of 2024, we feel good about that estimate. It's just going to be a little bumpier or rockier along the way because of the gaps in coverage and because of the administrative churn. And on the commercial side, we're actually seeing really excellent growth in the individual ACA. Once redeterminations began in a particular state, the level of applications on the ACA products were up three times the amount that they were prior to that. And so that really does point to the fact that we do have the catcher's mitt in action. The employer-sponsored side that's actually going maybe a little bit less than we had anticipated. So individual ACA is going a little bit faster, employers sponsored a little bit slower. But all in, we really do believe that by the time we get through this entire process, which won't be completed until sometime in the third quarter of 2024, that the estimates we provided at beginning of the year will prove to be pretty good estimates. So hopefully, that helps. Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Hi, thanks. Wanted to follow-up on the Medicaid redeterminations question there. So I appreciate all that commentary you just made. Would it be fair to say that at this point in part driven by the fact that you've got seemingly good and actuarially sound rate updates from your states that you haven't really seen all that much normalization of your margins in 2023. I believe you came into the year thinking that you performed in 2022 above your long-term targeted range, and there might be some pressure. I would love to just get an update on how that's performed in 2023 and how you're thinking or potentially considering that in your comments on 2024? Thank you. John Gallina : Yes, sure. Thank you very much for that question. And actually, I think Kyle did ask about Acuity as well. So hopefully, I'll address both of those here with this answer. Medicaid continues to be doing very well very much in line with our expectations and in line with what we saw coming. The one thing that I will reinforce is that in the rating formulas in the future or currently now is an acuity factor that's supposed to take changes in acuity into consideration. That factor was not in place in 2019. So comparisons to 2019 really aren't all that relevant at this point in time for that purpose. What we've seen thus far though is very little change in the overall acuity of the book. We are taking a very close look at that. And as I stated in my prepared comments, we're going to be monitoring that extremely closely and working with our states. So I'm very happy to report that all of the renewals that we've had with the discussions we've had with the states thus far, we have been provided actuarially sound rates. And we believe with actuarially sound rates, we can continue to deliver on Medicaid consistent with how we have in the past, providing a lot of benefits to beneficiaries and providing returns to the shareholders. So, thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks, John. And I think as -- just to put a, sort of, summary on that, we feel we've got great visibility into the rest of this year. And the discussions around 2024 have been incredibly productive with about 50% of our premiums with good visibility there. So we think that those conversations are going well, and things are tracking according to expectations. So thanks for the question and next question please. Operator : Next we'll go to line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Ben Hendrix : Thank you very much. I just also want to reiterate congratulations to John and thank you for all the help. Just wanted to circle up with a quick follow-up on MA. Appreciate all the questions on my health advocate and efforts there. I just wanted to know if there's any early thoughts on how much of the headwind you can mitigate with contract diversification/ And then kind what the time line is for getting all those approvals at the state level to carry that forward. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks for the question, Ben. As we think about that, as I said, we've got a number of levers at our disposal. And so I would focus on that. But in terms of contract diversification, about a third of the members affected were in group contracts. So we'll look at moving those potentially to a 4-Star contract. But again, I just want to reiterate, it's just one lever in our toolbox, and so we're not just looking at that, but we're looking across all of the things to have a mitigation for 2025. So thanks again for the question. And again, a lot happening in our enterprise around the efforts there to make sure that we remediate and stay very focused. This is an enterprise priority for us. Next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. And I was add to my congratulations to John as well. I guess far as the cost cutting -- this cost cutting was quite large. And I guess I just want to get a little more color because exactly kind of what was driving this? It sounds like this was all before your new stars was going to be off for 2025, because it sounds like it was more a 2024 issue. I think in the comments, you said something on the line so that's going to help you deliver lower cost to customers but also addresses some of the uncertainty in 2024. So, I just want a little more color on that, how much of this is going to improve benefits in MA versus, I think you made technology investments. Just a little more rationale for the move why it's so big? And then, if you're doing it this move now, how do you think about your ability to find significant savings to offset Stars in 2025? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks for the question, Kevin. I think let me put this in a little perspective because it's important to note, we're always evaluating our cost structure. And as we headed into 2024, we took very proactive and decisive action in the third quarter. We wanted a couple of things; one, increase our financial and operational flexibility and also ensure that we're positioned to deliver on our commitments to stakeholders. So, if you look at the charge in total, I mean, it really is kind of focused in three areas of cost management. And I think it's prudent to continue to always look at your cost structure, something we've been doing is, obviously, as we've been looking to manage that. And let me go through the three pieces because I think it's important. First, as you know, and we've talked about quite a bit on these calls, we've been investing over the past several years in modernizing our infrastructure, particularly around digital capabilities and migrating a lot of our applications to the cloud, consolidating our systems and our data and now most recently, use cases on using AI to drive greater efficiencies. The pace of technological innovation has changed and it continues to accelerate. And again, as I said, we're committed to deploying those responsibly quickly in our company. So what you're seeing in that first bucket is the write-down of some of those legacy processes that have now been replaced with our support -- that support our long-term goals with digital and AI and other things. And we've gone through that first phase that we've been talking about over the last several years on consolidation, data aggregation, et cetera. The second adjustments were really to our workforce. And that, again -- last year, we aligned our structure on benefits and services. This gave us an opportunity to look at redundancies across our business and our processes and eliminate handoffs, streamlined, very focused on ensuring that members because of our large benefit businesses can move between those businesses. It's an integral part of our strategy. And so that's been an important part of streamlining our work processes, simplifying our member experiences. And so as you think about the investments that we've been making in technology, particularly our front-door applications and things that automate some of our work, this was an opportunity for us to make sure that we had the right scaling of our workforce. And again, in the bigger scheme, these are not significant numbers. But again, I think it's really important that we constantly look at our cost structure. Then the last part is we went to a hybrid work environment. We've been evaluating the size and locations of our work sites, and we took the opportunity to further optimize those to make sure that we were located in the right places and had the right footprint. So as you think about all those, it's an approximately $700 million of charges, and it results in a run rate of about $750 million. Again, as John said, it doesn't all drop to the bottom line but that we think is important to support our long-term growth in our enterprise strategy. So that gives you a bit of a sense of how we thought about these as an ongoing opportunity to continue to optimize our cost, which we think is important for affordability in healthcare. So thanks very much for the question, and next question. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Sarah James from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Sarah James : Thank you and echo my congratulations to John. I was hoping that you guys could give a little bit more context around the recapture rate of the terminated Medicaid lives. So are you seeing recapture within Medicaid from the appeal process yet? And then on the ACA side, how do you think about the 30% recapture maturing into 2024 with your members, but then also potentially there's more people looking for ACA plans in 2024. John Gallina : Thank you for the question, Sarah. So in terms of the Medicaid redeterminations, as I stated, we're three to four months into the process. And it's a little early to have definitive in a very specific data points, but we do have certainly the bias. We've seen at 10% to 20% of the members who lost coverage in Medicaid in June reenrolled with us in the third quarter. So we certainly expect trends like that to continue. That's just one data point. And certainly, there's more time, but there are gaps in coverage. And then on the individual ACA, we are seeing by the time that folks leave Medicaid, there's typically a couple of month gap before they become enrolled an ACA plan. So, some of the membership this enrollment is temporary and there's gaps in coverage. So we've seen that throughout but we think we have a great opportunity in our 14 Blue states. You look at the number of members that were added to Medicaid in our 14 Blue states, that was about 8 million people across all 14 states, about 1.5 million of those were enrolled in Elevance Health Medicaid plans, which means that those other 6.5 million that went to a different carrier if that different carrier is able to retain 40% to 45% of those Medicaid similar to us, which I think is a reasonable expectation, that means that over half of the $6.5 million are in play. And we have leading market share in virtually every market we operate in, both in employer-sponsored as well as very strong in the ACA products. And so we do believe that you will see an acceleration of individual ACA membership in the early 2024 and mid-2024 for Elevance Health so hopefully, that answers your questions. Thank you for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks, John. And Sarah, I think just to sort of put a bow on this, I think it's really important just to frame it, almost 75% are administrative disenrollments and then over almost 37% are children under 18. So those are two areas, obviously, we're intensely focused on and there's a timing issue associated with this. So there's some delays in coverage and some coverage gaps, and we've been working really closely with our states. But as John said, we are seeing some encouraging signs where that 30% or more of our Medicaid members who are terminated prior to the end of June are now returning and retaining coverage with Elevance. So we expect that reenrollment to accelerate in the coming quarters. So I think that's important to keep in mind as we're all working through this process And certainly, the states are working through this process, and we have been continuing to adapt how we get to these members particularly the ones that were just enrolled for administrative reasons. So again, we feel pretty comfortable with the numbers that we shared and the guidelines we showed, and we are seeing pickup certainly in the individual business as this progresses. So thanks again for the question. And next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Michael Ha from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael Ha : Thanks and congrats to John as well. I wanted to ask a quick question first regarding BioPlus. I wanted to confirm, did you mention you're going start migrating specialty script away from your legacy platform early next year. Would that imply you've made the decision to in-source your specialty drug spend away from CBS? And then my real question, just regarding MA and STAR ratings, in terms of the improvement efforts for CAP specifically, how much of the overall underperformance would you attribute to the providers pivot? And how can you fix those results for that without actually having ownership of providers? I mean how can you effectively drive your provider network to make the necessary changes to improve your results? Curious what the plan is there. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, Michael. I'll have Pete start, and then I'll address your question on MA. Peter Haytaian : Thanks for the question, Michael. Yes, to answer your question directly, we are beginning the migration to BioPlus starting January 1. And again, just to reiterate, we've been very, very focused on the last year with regard to implementation and integration of BioPlus as it relates to our specialty strategy. A lot of the focus this year has been building the infrastructure and the team. So that we have the appropriate scale and capacity to take on the Elevance Health volume. And we feel very good about that.  As Gail noted in his prepared remarks, we are accelerating the time line in that regard, and we are moving forward with that for January 1. And again, this is all a part of our strategy in pharmacy, just to reiterate, and that is to in-source the strategic levers that matter. Specialty pharmacy is very critical to that as well as what we're doing in advanced home delivery. So again, excited about that. And yes, it is launching January 1. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. And to the second part of your question is we have delved in and really looked deeply at sort of what the drivers especially around the three contracts and sort of what the cut points were. I guess I would say there's a couple of things. One, has been easier navigation for our members. So I would not say it's because of ownership or lack of ownership, but I will address sort of value-based care. Remember, this was measurement around year 2022. We've made significant progress around moving a lot of our contracts to value-based care and embedding that into the way we do it. We've also worked closely with aggregators and have been building quite frankly, the numbers in that. So we do feel that our strategies are intensely focused, and our health navigator will significantly help them. The other area, quite frankly, around the cut points that impacted us was appeals and grievances, in some of our processes back in 2022. Those were very high performing contracts in the past and the cut points, while still good performance for us, were below the cut points. So I think those are very specific things that we can address. I want to take a moment, though, I think, to talk about where we are in value-based care because I think it is important to Medicare Advantage it's an area that we've been intensely focused on. As I mentioned on the primary care side, we've been working with a number of aggregators, plus increasing the amount of value-based care, but more importantly, embedding in those contracts quality and outcome measures as well as access and service. And I think those will have it, continue to, I guess, have an important impact on those. The other opportunity that we have is around specialty care. And we have been doing quite a bit of work on aggregation of specialty care, and particularly carving in high complex areas on specialty medical spend. That's an area where we see significant opportunities and don't see that as a really mature part of the market today. For example, Carelon is launching in January an oncology specialized care model with our affiliated health plans and it's allowing us also to more broadly commercialize that opportunity. We also see opportunities in musculoskeletal, renal and more. And I think this is a really differentiated focus because as we think about where members are very focused on access to surround specialty care, and I think we have a unique opportunity from both our innovation, our technology and the clinical expertise we offer to run that through Carelon with our health benefits, particularly in Medicare, but also across all of our lines of business. And that's going to be an important strength for us, and that's an area that I think in the specialty enablement will help our Medicare Advantage stars, but also help our patients get better access to that care. So that's -- we think it's a differentiator. But overall your question, I think we're very focused on the areas that drove some of the areas within those three contracts, and we feel we have very good line of sight to what they were and a lot of them were easier navigation for our members and making sure that it was a much more personalized experience than we've had in the past. And then again, ensuring that our supplemental benefits and over the counter are simpler and easier to use and we shared a little bit of that and we made those changes actually in our bids over the last couple of years. So thanks very much for the question, Michael, next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks. I'll add my congrats for 88 quarters for John as well. My question, can you speak to the strategy of how Carelon and benefits segments aim to really work together over time? I'm specifically interested in how you tie sort of the various companies within Carelon together and then also on that care delivery side as part of the answer. And then lastly, are there certain any capabilities, certain capabilities that you think are missing or would be helpful for Elevance in terms of putting together that totality of strategy? Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks for that question, Josh. We'd love to share more about our strategy. I'm going to have Pete Haytaian talk about it as you know he leads that part of our business. Peter Haytaian : Yes. No, thanks for the question. I really appreciate it. I think it is a good opportunity to talk about our strategy holistically. As Gail mentioned in her prepared remarks, we talk about whole health and integrated care and driving affordability. But I really want to tag off of what Gail just talked about because I really do believe it's what we're focused on and differentiating ourselves on. And that is looking at high cost, high spend areas of healthcare. We face off with our health plan partners. We identify those areas. Specialty care is a tremendous opportunity and a real differentiator. Gail mentioned some areas that are critically important to us as we move forward and this is across all lines of business. Not one particular line of business, but when you think about high spend areas like oncology, like MSK, like renal, we have a wonderful opportunity to manage the member holistically and take full risk on those members. Now importantly that's - it's a big part of our strategy in terms of assuming full risk on those categories, driving earnings through Carelon, our unregulated entity and also focusing on areas and profit pools that are growing where we have a wonderful commercialization opportunity. And how this all plays together is we face off with Elevance Health. We identify these areas. We drive capitated full risk in many of these instances, and then we deploy those capabilities externally. This is really playing through in a nice way, and we're seeing that play through in terms of our growth trajectory. To just, again, reiterate what Gail said in January of this year, we're going to be launching an oncology program at full risk. We are also looking at taking full risk on the seriously mentally ill in behavioral health, where we're not only managing the behavioral health, but the physical health side. And this is all the type of thing that is playing through into our external pipeline, which we're seeing grow nicely. So I really appreciate the question, Josh. I think -- oh yes, and by the way, you did ask questions around additional capabilities. I would say that M&A also is an important part of our strategy as we move forward. And when you think about these highly specialized areas of care, we're not naive to think that we have the capabilities internally to handle all of it. When you think about MSK, when you think about renal, even what we're doing around the seriously mentally ill, we will be looking to not only partnerships, but acquisitions that can help us in that regard. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks, Pete, and thanks for the question. And I think if just summarize everything Pete said, we're really working in Carelon across kind of four major areas. Obviously, pharmacy with CarelonRx and then three pillars inside of our Carelon services business, care delivery, our insights and our behavioral health and all of those come together in all of Pete said. And we have a great opportunity to provide greater certainty and cost management to our owned health businesses, but externally commercialize that and seen a lot of momentum going into '24 on that, prove it on ourselves and then show the market the capabilities, particularly around the Blue system. So, thanks again for the question, Josh, and this will be our last question. Operator : And our final question, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks for squeezing me in, and I'll ask it my thanks to John for everything over the years. Really appreciate it, bud. Along those lines, Gail, maybe you can give us a little color around the CFO search and what you expect Mark to bring to the organization. And then just curious, if you have any early views on 2024 Medicare Advantage membership growth, both for Elevance and the market overall? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Well, thanks for the question, Justin. And first of all, I will also offer my appreciation to John for his guidance and his counsel and honestly, our partnership over the time that I have been CEO. John and Mark has been here now for about a month. We're excited about having Mark Kaye join us. As you know, he was the CFO of Moody's. Mark brings -- he's an actuary by training, brings an incredible insight to our business. He and John have been working hand-in-hand on the transition, and John will be continuing as an adviser to me through the first quarter, as you heard in his opening remarks. I think we're at an incredible time in our business. We have great growth. We have a very diversified business and I'm excited about Mark joining our team and excited about the whole team. And thank John, we will all miss him, but he deserves time with his family and an opportunity to do things and work on his golf game, as you know, Justin. So, from that -- and I'm going to ask Felicia to comment a little bit about Medicare Advantage as you know, AEP has just started. So, it's really very early in days, so maybe Felicia can share a few comments about her thoughts on what we expect. Felicia Norwood : So good morning, Justin, and thank you. We are actually very excited about AEP. As Gail referenced, we are only three days in, but we're actually very pleased with the response we have from our brokers regarding the competitive positioning of our benefits and we believe that will be able to grow membership above the market in excess of some strategic decisions that we made around targeted market exit. So I want to point out that we made the very intentional and discrete decision to leave some markets that have been underperforming for us some period of time. Strategically, it was the right thing to do so that we can make sure we are focused on those markets where we have an opportunity to be very successful, deliver strong benefits for the members that we're privileged to serve. So as we think about where are today, we feel good about our positioning. As I said, we're very early in terms of where we are. But we believe as we head into 2024, we're going to be able deliver solid growth. As I said, I believe that will be above the overall market rate, based on where we're positioned. So thank you very much for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Well, thank you, Felicia. And thank you to all of you on the line for your continued support and for joining us. Through a steadfast focus on whole health our diverse and expanding suite of products and solutions, we will continue to meet the needs of clients, consumers and the communities we serve, advancing our strategy of becoming a lifetime trusted health partner, while delivering on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. Thank you for your interest in Elevance Health. And have a great rest of the week.

We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Elevance Health. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to share that Elevance Health delivered a strong end to 2023, demonstrating our ability to execute with agility and the balance and resilience of our enterprise. In the fourth quarter, Elevance Health delivered GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.63 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.62. For the full year, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $25.22 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $33.14. 2023 marks the sixth consecutive year in which we grew adjusted diluted earnings per share within or above our 12% to 15% long-term target growth rate with a compound annual growth rate exceeding the high end of the range. This reflects the ongoing execution of our strategy to accelerate capabilities and services, invest in high-growth opportunities and optimize our health benefits business. In 2023, we made significant strides building upon our flywheel for growth. Carelon has and will continue to add attractive capabilities that we can scale rapidly and sustainably over the long term. For example, just a few weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of Paragon Healthcare, a company specializing in infusible and injectable therapies. The acquisition expands our capabilities catering to consumers with complex and chronic needs, who can benefit the most from our approach to whole person health. Infusion Services will complement our suite of pharmacy services, which today include a fast-growing specialty pharmacy business and our advanced home delivery service, which launched at the beginning of this year. Carelon Services is poised for strong growth in 2024 with the on-boarding of new clients and continued expansion of services provided to Elevance Health medical members, including the rollout of risk-based oncology products and Carelon Insights, as well as the launch of comprehensive Carelon Behavioral Health Management Services to address the whole health needs of Medicaid beneficiaries living with serious mental illness. Turning to our health benefits business, 2023 marked another strong year despite a dynamic operating environment. Performance was led by the optimization of our commercial business where our operating margins continue to recover from pandemic-era lows which will continue into 2025. Commercial customers prioritize affordability, experience, and simplicity. And we're delivering on all fronts. In 2023, we launched a series of initiatives designed to improve and simplify the customer experience, including our associates' ability to better serve our members through the integration of AI support and natural language processing, which has significantly improved first call resolution. In addition to enhancing our claims auto adjudication rate, we're also broadening the use of AI to automate certain aspects of our provider directory and other administrative processes, which have improved data accuracy in consumer and provider experiences. Momentum in our national accounts business is a direct result of the unique and differentiated value we offer to large employers. We continue to consolidate business with existing clients, achieving excellent retention and winning over 75% of employers who ultimately switch carriers despite a smaller pipeline of new accounts for 2024. In our individual business, we positioned our products thoughtfully to drive profitable and sustainable growth, and we're pleased with our performance in 2023. We're looking forward to even stronger membership growth this year as we focus on maximizing access to care for re-determined Medicaid beneficiaries. Our relentless focus on affordable products, superior customer experiences, and simplicity is yielding strong results. After growing commercial membership by over 400,000 members last year, we are poised to grow by another 750,000 in 2024. Medicaid eligibility re-determinations remain ongoing and in many states have accelerated the re-determination processes. To date, over 70% of our members who lost Medicaid coverage were un-enrolled for administrative reasons. This is a challenging reality for many families, but we're encouraged that we are nearly two-thirds of the way through the process, with close to 30% of those un-enrolled before September 1st having re-enrolled in an Elevance Health product. Our research indicates that many un-enrolled members are facing barriers to re-enrollment, including awareness of the process and required actions to maintain coverage. To address this, we're executing an extensive renewal campaign and have reached over three million people with our omni-channel approach as we remain committed to supporting them as their trusted health partner. Despite accelerated membership attrition from re-determinations to date, our Medicaid business is performing well. Rates remain actuarially sound for the members we are privileged to serve, and we are innovating to meet their needs. For example, in 2024, we will expand our community connected care model into eight additional states. This program assists Medicaid members with their health-related social needs by identifying gaps and connecting members to support services in their communities. We will also launch a program in alliance with the affordable connectivity program, major wireless carriers and Samsung that will help increase equitable access to digital and virtual health tools. The program will provide eligible Medicaid members with a curated selection of digital and virtual health tools via smartphone with no data cap at no cost along with training materials and ongoing guidance on how to use these tools. Strong performance in 2023 allowed us to invest for the long-term. In the fourth quarter, these investments were concentrated in Medicare, where we remain intensely focused on building a strong foundation for sustainable long-term growth. This includes improving our star quality ratings and driving profitable growth in markets where we know we can win over the long-term. Unfortunately, pockets of the Medicare Advantage market have remained hyper competitive despite a more challenging funding environment. While our plans continue to offer attractive and valuable benefits, we took intentional actions as part of our 2024 bid strategy to address product sustainability, and as such, we experienced greater-than-expected attrition in certain markets. As a result, we expect our Medicare Advantage membership to be roughly flat in 2024 on an organic basis, but earnings to improve. Importantly, cost trends in our Medicare Advantage business continued to develop as we expected, and we are confident that the assumptions underlying our bids for 2024 are appropriate. With respect to Stars we have now fully implemented My Health Advocate our comprehensive personalized customer service model for Medicare. This has improved experiences for our members, helping them to easily navigate the health care system and their plan benefits. Early proof points reflect an improvement in first call resolution, a key indicator of future quality performance for our Medicare Advantage plans. We are confident that we have a solid foundation in our health benefits business, from which we will grow Carelon for the long-term with many of the building blocks in place to accelerate our enterprise flywheel for growth. We are positioned to deliver another year of strong earnings growth in line with our long-term target in 2024, while continuing to invest in our future. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be greater than $37.10 this year, reflecting growth of at least 12% over 2023. Finally, advancing Health Equity is foundational to our efforts to improve the health and lives of the individuals and communities we are privileged to serve. Our industry-leading approach received renewed recognition when the National Committee for Quality Assurance awarded its newly established Health Equity accreditation plus to 20 of Elevance Health affiliated Medicaid health plans covering over 90% of our Medicaid members and making us the only national plan to have received this distinction-to-date. We also saw excellent progress on our ambitious goal to improve maternal health equity by reducing the disparity in preterm birth rates between black and non-black communities, improving the disparity gap by 5.2% relative to our 2022 baseline. In closing, I want to express my gratitude to our extraordinary team of over 100,000 associates. It is their collective passion and hard work that enables us to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. This past year alone, our associates logged over 225,000 volunteer hours in our communities, a record high for Elevance Health. This remarkable achievement reflects our deep dedication to making a tangible positive impact on the lives of the people we are privileged to serve and for the communities we call home. As we move forward, we will remain focused on serving our members as their lifetime trusted health partner. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our new Chief Financial Officer, Mark Kaye. Mark? Mark Kaye : Thank you, Gail, and good morning. I am pleased to join you for my first earnings call as CFO of Elevance Health. As Gail shared, we delivered strong results every quarter of 2023, including in the fourth quarter, which was marked by solid top and bottom line growth and significant progress in the execution of our enterprise strategy to accelerate capabilities and services, invest in high-growth opportunities and optimize our businesses. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.62 and full year adjusted diluted earnings per share of $33.14 were ahead of expectations. Since 2018, Elevance Health has achieved a compound annual growth rate of nearly 16%, surpassing our long-term target range of 12% to 15%. Operating revenue exceeded $170 billion in 2023, up 9.3% year-over-year driven by growth in both our health benefits and Carelon businesses. The benefit expense ratio was 89.2% for the fourth quarter and 87% for the full year, representing an improvement of 50 basis points and 60 basis points respectively, compared to the prior year periods. This was primarily driven by premium rate adjustments in recognition of medical cost trend, most notably in our commercial health benefits business. The adjusted operating expense ratio was 11.6% for the fourth quarter, up 20 basis points compared to the prior year period, driven by accelerated investments made in the quarter, notably in network quality, value-based care and customer experience initiatives designed to address key priority areas for Medicare Advantage stars. For the full year, the adjusted operating expense ratio was 11.3% flat year-over-year. Operating cash flow was $8.1 billion in 2023 or 1.3 times GAAP net income. This includes the benefit of approximately $300 million of state-based payments for 2024 dates of service that we received in the fourth quarter and which will correspondingly impact operating cash flow in 2024. We ended the year with a debt-to-capital ratio of 38.9% in line with our targeted range. Giving confidence in our outlook, we took advantage of market volatility during the fourth quarter to accelerate share repurchases, specifically, we repurchased 2 million shares of our common stock for $929 million, bringing total share repurchases for the year to 5.8 million shares at a total cost of $2.7 billion. Our health benefits business ended the year with approximately 47 million members, a decrease of around 570,000 year-over-year, driven by attrition in Medicaid associated with eligibility redeterminations, partially offset by growth in our commercial fee-based membership. Today, we are seven to eight months into the Medicaid redetermination process. And while there is significant variability by state, we believe that nearly two-thirds of our members have had their eligibility evaluated. Of those unenrolled, approximately 70% have lost coverage due to administrative reasons. And we have also seen an elongation in the time some beneficiaries have taken to reenroll into Medicaid, while others have transitioned on to an ACA exchange plan. As Gail noted, we are executing an extensive renewal campaign to maximize continuity of coverage. Accordingly, we expect reenrollment into Medicaid continue through at least 2024 and for growth in ACA exchange plans to accelerate. This has been incorporated into our membership guidance ranges for 2024. Turning to our financial outlook for 2024. We are pleased to provide initial guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share of greater than $37.10, reflecting growth of at least 12% year-over-year. We are focused on optimizing our health benefits business, including through the ongoing margin recovery of our commercial risk-based business, the strategic repositioning of our Medicare Advantage plan offerings in certain markets and the transformation of our cost structure. Further, we are investing in high-growth opportunities with a focus on establishing a foundation for sustained long-term growth. We will scale Carelon's existing capabilities and add new ones in 2024 and driving incremental earnings growth and accelerating our enterprise flywheel for growth. The momentum in our commercial health benefits in Carelon businesses is partially offset by the Medicaid membership headwinds included in our guidance. We anticipate total medical membership to end 2024 in the range of $45.8 million to $46.6 million, down approximately $750,000 year-over-year at the midpoint. Medicaid membership is expected to end the year in the range of 8.8 million to 9.2 million members with attrition driven by the net loss of approximately 930,000 members associated with changes in our footprint discussed on our third quarter earnings call and ongoing eligibility redeterminations. Commercial membership is expected to grow by over $750,000 at the midpoint, ending the year in the range of 32.4 million to 32.8 million members. This includes over 300,000 net new risk-based members and approximately 400,000 net new fee-based members, collectively driven by new business wins and strong client retention reflecting our resolute focus on customer affordability, experience and simplicity. Medicare Advantage membership is expected to end the year approximately flat. As a reminder, we took intentional actions as part of our 2024 bid strategy to improve the sustainability of our product offerings. And given unexpected competitive dynamics in certain markets experienced greater-than-expected attrition. Nonetheless, these actions will help establish a strong foundation for profitable and sustainable growth over the long-term. And we remain confident in the outlook for utilization and medical cost trends embedded in our 2024 bids. Finally, we expect our Medicare supplement and federal employees' health benefits membership to remain relatively stable year-over-year. On a consolidated basis, operating revenue for 2024 is expected to be flat to up low single-digits. We project operating earnings for the year to be at least $10.3 billion, reflecting 9% growth with contributions from both our health benefits and Carelon businesses, disciplined benefit management, and the successful execution of our 2023 business optimization initiatives. Please note that our guidance metrics do not include the impact of pending M&A, even though we have several transactions we expect to close this year. Earnings seasonality is expected to be relatively consistent year-over-year with slightly more than 55% of our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share in the first half of the year and more than half of that expected in the first quarter. Finally, I'm pleased to announce that our Board of Directors recently approved a 10.1% increase in our regular quarterly dividend, raising it to $1.63 per share. This marks our 13th consecutive annual dividend increase, underscoring our commitment to delivering strong results for our shareholders and the value of our balanced and resilient business model. In closing, 2023 was a strong year for the company, and I'm looking forward to working alongside the talented and dedicated team at Elevance Health to deliver on our financial targets. I look forward to meeting all of you in 2024. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Welcome on board, Mark. Congratulations to the company for another year of meeting the growth targets and I know it's early to talk about this, but maybe you'd have to take some steps today to ensure your positioning. With 2025, you'll have the Star ratings impact overcome. When you think about that, will the company do anything differently? How do you think about the levers you have to push to offset what appears at least on the surface to be a couple percentage points of headwind from that Star ratings impact? We step up share repurchases, accelerate investments in Carelon, how do you think about that at this early date and the ability to sustain that 12% to 15% even into next year? Gail Boudreaux : Well, thanks for the question, A.J. There's a lot in there. And as you know, 2025, it's a little early to opine on 2025, but I'd like to give you at least a little bit of color on how we're thinking about some of the things that you mentioned. Let me start first with Star ratings. So because as we shared on the last we are intensely working. Medicare Advantage is a very important business for us, and we're strategically committed to the long-term. And I will reiterate this year, we felt we took very prudent actions for a long-term sustainable business and feel good about our bid. So that positions us well for 2025 in particular. In terms of the Star ratings, again, a few things going on there. We shared on our last call that on the group business, we have a number of levers at our disposal that we are able to pull, and we're still moving forward with that. And then in terms of overall Star ratings, we do think that, that's going to be a multiyear initiative. But I wanted to share, as I shared on my early remarks that we have invested at the last part of the year, and we were investing actually prior to even the announcement, we have been successful at moving all of our business into our Health Advocate model, and we do know that we're seeing some early signs. We don't know where the points are going to come out, but we do feel good about the investments we're making. And again, we feel really good about where our bids have come out. Broader, let me take a little bit step further back because I think your question around 2025 is broader than just Medicare Advantage and Stars. As I think about 2025 again, not giving guidance on 2025, but we do expect to accelerate growth in 2025 and we've talked quite a bit in recent calls about our flywheel for growth, which is in our improvement in both the health benefits business and our Carelon segment. We anticipate that our health benefits business is going to continue to grow in 2025 after a reset year in 2024. We should see an accelerated impact to that growth, which will drive revenue for Carelon. And then Carelon also has been independently scaling its multiple new capabilities, and we'll share, I assume even more of those on the call today. And then finally, as you know, we took some actions at the end of last year around our disciplined operating cost efficiencies, and we expect to see even greater benefits from those as we digitize and use AI in our investments. So honestly, I think we feel that we've positioned our business very prudently and that the balance and resilience of our enterprise and our earnings power of our health benefits in Carelon together gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to achieve our long-term targets. So just a little bit more color on where we are. Thank you very much for the question. Next question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. I guess I wanted to ask about the MLR guidance for 2024. It sounds like you guys are expecting margin improvement in MA, your repositioning commercial and Medicaid is dropping pretty meaningfully. But why is MLR only flat? I would think that we'd be seeing MLR improvement? Is there some offset in there? Mark Kaye : Good morning and thank you very much for the question. Maybe let me start with the 2023, just to set the context here. So 2023 benefit expense ratio end of the year slightly better than our initial expectations at that 87%. And just to remind you, that represented the 60 basis point improvement year-over-year as well as falling in the lower half of our initial 2023 guidance range. As it relates to 2024, we are guiding to a flat benefit expense ratio of 87%, plus/minus 50 basis points. And our outlook here reflects a consistent approach to reserves and a prudent thought process around utilization, given the dynamic operating environment, especially for our government businesses. If I take a deeper look at the underlying businesses themselves, the health benefit expense ratio reflects that intentional management action we're taking in commercial. It will continue on through into 2024 around the disciplined underwriting practices and part of our margin recovery efforts. And then certainly, on the Medicare the advantage side, continued appropriate expectations around utilization and Medicare -- medical cost trends. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Mark, and thanks, Kevin, for the question. Next, question please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could speak a little bit more specifically around the growth in Medicare Advantage to start this year. It sounds like a little bit lower than expectations. And I'm curious specifically in the commentary you made around pockets of competition, maybe where you're seeing that, what you think is driving that? And then any specific comments on retention relative to expectations for this year. Gail Boudreaux : Well, thanks, Josh, very much for the question. And just maybe a couple of overarching comments because I think it's important that I'm going ask Felicia Norwood who leads our government business to comment more specifically. And I think it's important to frame that we made some very specific discipline decisions and feel really good about our bids entering into this. And Felicia, we actually exited some markets very specifically that were underperforming. So I think you have to take that into account. But she'll just provide a lot more detail on kind of where we landed this year and the perspective on the market. So Felicia, please. Felicia Norwood : Sure. Good morning, Josh, and thank you very much for that question. As we headed into 2024, we made some very disciplined decisions that we were going to enhance the financial performance for our Medicaid Advantage business. You know, in the mainland, we exited as Gail noted specifically certain markets that had been underperforming for us for years. And with the impending risk model revisions, we really saw no path to long-term attractive, sustainable economics in those markets. And that really represented a decline of about 84,000 members. I also want to note that, we reduced supplemental benefits in Puerto Rico, both to turn around their performance after a very challenging 2023 and to position us for the 3-year phase-in of the risk model revisions, which will have a material adverse impact on Medicare Advantage on the island, in part due to the higher mix of duals that we have in Puerto Rico. So, we've reset our supplemental benefits there, and in the midst of a very highly competitive bid environment, we will see membership declines of somewhere in the neighborhood of about 90,000 in 2024 in Puerto Rico. Now, while the decline is larger than we expected, it certainly has bolstered our confidence in the anticipated improvement in our benefit expense ratio in Puerto Rico. At the end of the day, what we wanted to do was to establish a very strong foundation from which we can grow in Puerto Rico long-term, sustainably, and profitably. Back to the mainland. Selling activity for AEP was actually very strong for us, as we expected. When we exclude the planned attrition on the island that we mentioned - on the mainland that I mentioned earlier. Our net mainland Medicare Advantage membership would be on track to grow by high single-digits this year, despite encountering greater dis-enrollment in certain markets, due to very aggressive offerings by select competitors. At the end of the day, I think that we've made very thoughtful decisions around how we're going to position our business for long-term sustainable growth going forward. And we've done the things that we've always committed to do. We expect to do very well in our Blue markets. We are performing better in our Blue markets than the overall growth rates, and we're very much focused on a combination of balancing that perspective between margin, and membership growth. So, we feel good about how we're positioning our business going forward. And as we said earlier, in light of all of these dynamics, we'd expect to have flat membership in 2024. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question please? Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Sarah James from Cancer Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Sarah James : Thank you. Do you guys have some really nice margin expansion guided to for Carelon in 2024? I was wondering if you could unpack it a little bit for us, as we think through the major buckets that are causing the expansion. And then also the pacing, if it's ratable as we think about the margin expansion due 2024 and then I guess, further out as we get to 2027? Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Sarah. I'm going to ask Pete Haytaian, who leads Carelon to comment on that. And as you know, we're excited about the real flywheel opportunity that we're seeing in Carelon. So, Pete? Peter Haytaian : Yes. Let me - thank you, Sarah, for the question. Let me talk about Carelon Services growth. And we are very excited about the opportunity and the progress that we're making with respect to services growth. I think you saw that play through in 2023. We committed to double-digit increase on revenue, which we achieved. And as it relates to our 2024 guide, you saw that we're talking about high teens, low 20s growth. And it's really playing through our strategy that we talked about focusing in on complexities in healthcare, high-cost spend areas, and really driving capitated risk in key areas, to support our health plans. In 2023, we did that with our post-acute care initiative, DME, wound care. And as we move forward into 2024, I mean Gail mentioned this in the prepared remarks. We have new offerings that are whole health full risk opportunities like oncology, assuming full risk in oncology, as well as in Medicaid with behavioral health with the seriously mental ill population. So, these are significant initiatives that are really propelling the trajectory of our business. I would also say that as it relates to external growth. We're also seeing really nice improvements from that perspective and really nice momentum. Our pipeline in 2023 or 2024 growth was much more significant. In terms of our sales this time versus last year, we've seen a real nice trajectory in our growth. And we've had a couple of really nice notable wins with the Blues. I would say that as it relates to that and the opportunity with the Blues. They are doing exactly, what we've talked about in the past, and looking closely at some of these full risk comprehensive offerings that, we're delivering in Elevance Health and then very interested in that in terms of the opportunities to create predictable stable cost of care for them. So, very pleased with where we are in the trajectory of growth in Carelon. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question please? Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Yes. Hi. Thank you. I just want to come back to the Medicaid redetermination process. So entering 2023, we're expecting some normalization of the Medicaid outperformance that you saw in years prior. Can you give us an update on where that landed in 2023, compared to your initial thinking? And then just a little bit more color on, what your guidance assumes for Medicaid in 2024. Does that put you back at historical norms for margins? Or should we think - should we be thinking about something else there? Thank you. Mark Kaye : Stephen, thanks very much for the question. On Medicaid membership, our outlook reflects the footprint adjustments we spoke about on our third quarter earnings call and the continued attrition due to redetermination. We believe Medicaid redeterminations are approximately two-thirds complete across our Medicaid markets. And in general, we've seen more front-loaded disenrollment. Notably in a few large states that have elected to adopt accelerated processes. And then based on the trends that we've observed relative - or related to these market-wide coverage shifts. We have adjusted our Medicaid retention assumption, to be approximately 30% of our PHE related growth. We're not planning to provide point estimates for coverage transitions generally. We do, however, believe that ACA will pick up more than initially expected, while employer group coverage will gain a little bit less than initially expected. But most importantly, these updated projections are factored into our membership guidance that we provided this morning. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please? Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Lance Wilkes : Yes. Thanks. Could you talk a little bit about your value-based care strategies? And what I would be interested in is, from a contracting standpoint, how are you approaching that for 2024 and like MA? Are you doing any sort of renegotiation to kind of hold those value-based care providers - more stable in that year given the risk adjustment changes? And then how is the priority for owning those sorts of assets in Carelon change? And what's your current outlook there? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Well, thanks for the question, Lance. It's quite a bit there. But I think let me start with our value-based strategy, we've talked about on this call a number of times, and I think I would say it's remained really consistent, but we're making a lot of very good progress on that. Overall, more than 60% are in value-based care. And in Medicare, it's even more. Specific to your question on renegotiation. We have multiple-year arrangements with our value-based providers, and we're always looking at a couple of things. One, quite frankly, to make sure that it's a win-win and we're aligned, both on cost quality outcomes and Stars. So, we spend a lot of time focusing on some of the ways that, we can get data back and forth more simply. We use our - we've integrated the way we share data back and forth. And that's really around closing gaps in care and quite frankly, simplifying the process under which we work with those providers. Our goal is to make that ubiquitous across all of our value-based providers. And so, we made a lot of progress there, and dramatically improve sort of the time, to action with those providers. And I think that's important because, honestly, that gives them data to act and that improves their outcomes. We have seen our value-based providers perform better in the circumstance, and we think that, that's going to remain important. In terms of our strategy around ownership. We've talked about that. We - as you know, we do have assets inside of Carelon. I guess where I would focus you more is around the specialty high-cost complex areas of specialty, because that's where we think that there's a huge differentiated focus between our technology, our clinical domain expertise and our ability to drive trend. Again, we don't need to own the providers, but we do need to have a significant role in the enablement of those care providers, and we have spent time doing that. We launched a number of new products this year with oncology, serious mental illness, and we're getting into other areas like musculoskeletal, renal and more. And I think - that's where you see the significant spend area is accelerating and Carelon with its assets has a great opportunity. So, we expect Carelon's care provider enablement platforms continue - to contribute pretty significantly Carelon's revenue meaningfully over the longer-term, and we're building those assets. And again, I'll keep going back to my flywheel, where we think that will improve the performance of our health benefit plans. There's a lot of interest in externally in these. And Pete mentioned, we saw some nice traction in a few of these offerings this year. So overall, I'd say very consistent focus around our value-based care - care enablement, and we feel like we're getting a lot of traction. And I would focus you a lot on the specialized care Specialty Care, particularly on the Carelon growth opportunity. So, thank you very much for the question. Next question, please? Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : Great. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Two on the Medicare business. First, you talked about Medicare cost trend developing as expected in the fourth quarter. I guess, I'd be curious if there are any areas that came in higher or lower than expected and what the benefit expense guidance for 2020 - for assumes for Medicare cost trend? And then I guess, higher level, as you reposition the Medicare business, and I understand there's several moving pieces over the next couple of years. What's the company's current view, I guess, first of the Medicare Advantage market longer term? But then second, the membership growth and margin potential for Elevance, specifically within that market context? Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you for the question. I'm going to ask Mark to address your first question, and then I'll come back and share our long-term views on Medicare. Mark Kaye : Nathan, overall utilization in the fourth quarter developed largely in line with our expectations. And that's evidenced by our reported benefit expense ratio, which came in favorable, as you know, to consensus and really to the midpoint of our initial full year 2023 guidance range. We did see pockets of high utilization, specifically in Medicare related to orthopedics such as knee and hip replacements and other outpatient procedures. But this is broadly planned for as part of our underlying cost trained assumptions. Similarly, we saw a seasonal up-tick in respiratory elements, including the flu and COVID as well as increased RC vaccinations. But again, utilizations were aligned with what we planned. We'll continue to monitor our claims trends closely, including prior authorization data. We remain confident that our Medicare Advantage bids for 2024, and our pricing commercial do reflect appropriate projections for utilization and medical cost trends. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Mark. Nathan, in terms of your broader question, let me just provide a little bit of perspective. As I think about the market, we still think Medicare Advantage is a very good long-term market. And as I said, we're committed to driving sustainable performance for the long term. Medicare Advantage delivers really strong differentiated value for seniors. I think you have to start there. And as you look at the aligned incentives across the system to deliver better outcomes and better care - it is very - it's a very strong marketplace, and it continues to grow. And importantly, it's incredibly popular with seniors with greater than 50% of seniors selecting Medicare Advantage today. So that's - against that backdrop, we know seniors value stability in their benefits year-over-year, and the items that are most important to them. And so, we have, as you heard from us earlier, look to make sure that we are in this market for the long-term, balancing that stability. So with what we know is happening in this market, we can make the right benefit decisions and again, feel that we positioned ourselves, and are making the right strategic investments, to improve our performance. We see this business maturing, as Mark shared in his comments as well. And again, been very intentional about our desire, or decision to exit certain programs or markets and plans where we didn't think, we had a long-term sustainable path to performance. And that combined with the risk models, made that choice and then again, reposition Puerto Rico, which we believe is still a very good market, but there were some actions that we knew, we had to take. So as we look at those decisions for the long-term, as Felicia shared, our business performed when you look at the mainland and take out those exits. We had very strong selling season. Again, I think that's a testament to the value of the benefits and our position. And importantly, we do believe we can grow this business profitably even in a year with hypercompetitive markets in certain cases where we outperformed the growth in our Blue markets, which, again, has always been a strategy we've had, is to go deeper in our Blue markets and to gain more share with the value of our brand as well as in other places. So again, we think it's a good market. We know we have some work to do in that market, but we feel we're positioning for the long-term and think that we can add distinctive value for seniors as part of our focus on whole health and continuation of coverage to stay Blue for life and all of their coverage. So, thank you very much for the question. Next question please? Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much and good morning. I want to focus on margin drivers. Can you maybe just spend a little time talking about the progression in 2024, getting to those targets that you have in 2025? And then secondly, when I think about the margins in CarelonRx, you talked about them improving by 40 to 60 basis points. Can you talk about what the drivers are there as well? Is that Paragon Health and BioPlus, which I would assume carry better margins? Or is there something else that's really driving that improvement as we move into 2024? Mark Kaye : Lisa, thank you very much for the question. I'll talk about health benefits, and I'll pass it over to Pete in a couple of minutes to talk about Carelon. On the health benefits side, we are seeing operating margins expand, or expect to expand by 25 to 50 basis points in 2024. And I think about this has really being driven by three primary categories. First is the continued underwriting discipline and the pricing actions that we're taking in commercial. 2023 really marks the end of the first full year of our efforts to recover margins from the pandemic era lows, and we expect those supporting initiatives really to continue through 2024, and then possibly into 2025. Second one, I'd call your attention to here really relates to the Medicare margin expansion. And here, as you've heard us talk about, this is about building that strong foundation for sustainable long-term growth in 2024. And striking that balance between growth and margin. And in 2024, we leaned a little bit more towards the margin and the growth and you see that come through in some of our outlook projections this morning. And then the third one, I'd call your attention to, is really the operating expense leverage, you see that we are gaining additional incremental leverage in 2024 with our guide down to 11.1% for the operating expense ratio. Peter Haytaian : Thanks Mark. And Lisa, your question was on the trajectory of the margins in pharmacy. So, you'll recall that this year, in 2023, we made pretty significant investments as it relates to the acceleration of BioPlus and Advanced Home Delivery, and that puts some pressure on our margins in 2023. That will not repeat itself in 2024. We did go live with BioPlus on January 1 as well as with respect to Advanced Home Delivery. We're really excited about that, and it's moving in the right direction. And over time, we've built those products for scale. And as that business builds and progresses, we will continue to see margin improvement. So that is, what is - delivering an improvement in margin in 2024. Gail Boudreaux : Next question please? Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Hi thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could - just on the commercial risk enrollment guidance, if you can break that down for us, between group and individual? And then on the individual piece, I'm curious in terms of what you're thinking in terms of how much of that growth comes from the catchers - from Medicaid. And then, how you're thinking about the acuity of those lives that are coming into the exchanges from Medicaid. We know that in Medicaid, that acuity is generally rising as the re-determinations continue. So I'm curious, though, in terms of those lives that are transitioning into the exchanges - are you thinking about those as being sort of higher, lower, or in line acuity with the legacy population in the exchange market? Thanks a lot. Gail Boudreaux : Well, thanks for the question, Scott. I think we've got about four or five in there. So, we'll try to hit the high points of your question. Let me ask Morgan and then Mark to comment on your question. Morgan? Morgan Kendrick : Yes, Scott, thanks for the question. As we think about the ACA business, we've talked about it for a while now. We're quite bullish on that segment. And as we've remarked in other quarterly reports, we operate in all rating areas in our 14 geographies where we can. And certainly, we've seen an expansion in the actual market share, and the market growth actually in these geographies. In fact, it's certainly a big driver is Medicaid re-determination. As we've indicated earlier on the call today, we've concluded about two-thirds of those. We expect that to continue in 2024. And also, as we've noted in the past, we've seen an elongated period of time from when someone is re-determined and when they actually join Medicare or come on an ACA product moving along. That said, quite pleased that our growth this year is outpacing our market growth. So clearly, we're picking up our fair share and more, quite honestly, of the Medicaid re-determined members. So at the end of the day, this will continue. We've had a very steadfast and steady approach around the right economics, and the right network strategies, to draw in these members. It's very important for the business to continue. And I'm going to turn that over to Mark to speak a little bit about the margins and the separation of the various pieces that you asked the question on. Mark Kaye : Yes. If I think about Medicaid rates and acuity, the conversations with the states are ongoing. We'll continue to work with them and their consultants really to ensure that all adjustments are reasonable and reflect the risk associated with ongoing re-determinations in 2024. Our outlook for 2024 does assume a normalization of Medicaid margins. We already have line of sight into about 70% of Medicaid premiums for 2024. And we are comfortable with the actuarial soundness of the underlying rates, especially understanding the acuity for leaders versus stayers. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. And thanks, Scott. And I think you also asked about the acuity in the individual exchange marketplace. So I wanted to just put a fine point on that. Our risk profile of the members we're picking up certainly in 2023, obviously, early in 2024 very much aligns with the expectation of what we've historically had. So, we feel it's actually rolling out, to our expectations. Thank you for the question. Next question, please? Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Ben Hendrix : Thank you very much. I just wanted to follow-up on the Carelon margin question. On Carelon services, slightly down margins in the guidance. Just wanted to see if that - the degree to which that is associated with new risk-based arrangements, or membership, or to the perhaps to the new behavioral benefits and kind of what are the prospects for that, kind of ramping up beyond 2024? Thanks. Peter Haytaian : Yes. No, thanks, Ben, for the question. First of all, we're very pleased with the operating performance of Carelon. You saw that play through in 2023. I think we committed to 25 to 50 basis points of improvement. You saw 70 basis points of improvement year-over-year. So that it's performing really well. You answered the question already, as it relates to 2024, quite frankly. We are, as Gail talked about, and as I talked about earlier, launching some very significant at-risk product offerings, both oncology, seriously incrementally ill population as well as others, and that comes with a lower margin in the earlier years, but then improves over time. So that is precisely what was creating, the pressure on the margin in '24. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. And just to sort of put a finer point on it, we do remain confident in our long-term guidance that we gave in mid to upper single-digit operating margin. So as Pete said, we think the business we're bringing on, is really good. We're committed to bringing in more risk business. But in the early years, that does have a little bit lower profile. But overall, we feel very good about the long-term. Next question, please? Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but a couple of numbers here. First, you reported $200 million plus of positive prior year development in the quarter, materially more than I think the company has ever seen in Q4. Just curious, given the MLR was generally in line. Can you tell us whether there were any pressure areas that work to offset the benefit of the PYD in the quarter? And then with the benefits repositioning of Medicare Advantage, which we've clearly done, do you expect to be within your 3% to 5% target margin here for Medicare Advantage in 2024? Thanks. Mark Kaye : Justin, thank you very much for the questions this morning. We are confident that our year-end reserves are prudent and have been set consistent with historical practice. In the quarter, you're correct that we saw positive prior year development on a gross basis, and that was indeed favorable. It's worth pointing out here that that was largely offset through premium rebates, and colors as well as the reestablishment of reserves for the current year. An alternative way to think about this is that our full year days in claims payable decreased just 0.2 days year-over-year. And that's noteworthy in the context of the fact that we have observed cycle times to have actually decreased more than three days since the end of December 2022. And that should give you a feel for our comfort level around reserves. On your second question, just relative to the long-term target margin ranges, commercial is on track to achieve our long-term goals. Let's say, Medicaid is normalizing, but continues to perform well. And then Medicare Advantage for now is below our long-term target margin range. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please? Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Gary Taylor from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on enrollment. I kind of thought the story for 2023 was that with the intentional commercial repricing, which has been pretty successful this year, you lost some commercial risk enrollment because of that? And I'm just trying to figure out on the 1 million plus decline in risk enrollment for 2024, how much of that is commercial risk versus the expected Medicaid redeterminations? Mark Kaye : We're all pleased with the performance of our commercial business in the fourth quarter in 2023. We did make meaningful progress towards our margin recovery goals in the year. I'd say January renewals have gone well. We certainly experienced to date higher retention than we did at the same period last year. Repricing actions, as you would expect, do continue to impact membership growth, but this is expected. And so, we're really continuing to expect approximately flat membership growth overall in our group risk business this year, while continuing to improve margins in line with our stated goals. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. And just again, to put a fine point, most of the loss in risk membership, is driven by both the Medicaid redeterminations and the adjustment in the footprint that we've shared with you in the past. So, that really is the key driver. Next question please? Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of David Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Windley : Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I wanted to go to CarelonRx on the revenue growth side. High growth in 2023 low single-digits, I think you're expecting in 2024. I suspect the BioPlus acquisition inorganically would have contributed to some of that growth in 2023, but I don't think it bridges the full change. So maybe you could add some color around the slowdown in growth, the lower growth expectations for CarelonRx in 2024? Thanks. Peter Haytaian : Thanks David for the question. As it relates to 2023 and the growth of around 18.6% that did exceed our initial guidance and as you alluded to, that was driven primarily by the BioPlus acquisition and including BioPlus and our results to a lesser extent, drug mix and trends. But I would say as it relates to 2024, I would say we have tremendous momentum in the business. And we're really excited about how our strategy is playing through. We've talked about assuming the strategic levers that really matter in our business. We've done that with Specialty Pharmacy and BioPlus. We've done that with Advanced Home Delivery. You heard about the recent announcement of Paragon and infusion, which we're really excited about. And then there are several new product launches that are resonating in the marketplace that we've talked about previously, like EnsureRx as one of the examples. And this momentum is playing through in our sales in 2024. We are having a good season. Obviously, that activity occurred in 2023. Our retention remains strong. Our sweet spot does remain in that 3,000 to 10,000 range in terms of the business that we're attracting. And as you know, there's a little more reticence in terms of the larger jumbo accounts moving. But I would say that a couple of notable wins there. We saw a couple of wins in the 20,000 to 50,000 range. So, we're really excited about the momentum in Carelon and what we're doing strategically, and how that's playing through in the marketplace. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Pete. Our next question will be our last question. Operator : For our final question, we'll go to the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Yes, good morning guys and thanks for squeezing me in after Dave. I'm going to come back to MA margins one more time. And I'm going to ask you if you could expand a little bit if there is a way to disaggregate kind of the MA margin expansion thinking about your pricing initiatives versus utilization expectation versus mix, and kind of the market exits that you guys have targeted. Just trying to figure if you can kind of maybe rank order the contribution on margin expansion in MA from each of those four initiatives? Mark Kaye : Thanks very much for the question, George. We are not looking to necessarily provide individual margin guidance within the Health Benefit segment. Certainly, we feel comfortable with where we're guiding to in aggregate for 2024 in the 25 to 50 basis point range. And we think that the qualitative commentary that, we provided in the call today should give you enough to get a feel for how the management team is thinking about this. Given this is my first earnings call, I just want to spend a minute on capital deployment before we close out here. And I just wanted to make the point that, I expect to continue with Elevance Health's existing strategic policy around capital deployment. As I believe it really strikes the right balance between growth, and the return of capital to our stockholders. And just as a reminder, we are going to target 50% of our free cash flow towards M&A, or organic reinvestment and approximately 50% is a return of capital to our stockholders, either via the 30% for share repurchases, or the 20% for dividends. And each year may differ. But over the years, we expect to allocate capital consistent with this framework. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Mark, and thank you to everyone who joined us. In closing, we're pleased to have delivered another strong year in 2023, and we're confident that the ongoing execution of our strategy and the balance and resilience of our diverse set of businesses positions us well for 2024 and beyond. We're very excited about our future, and we look forward to sharing more on our progress with you in the coming year. Thank you again for your interest in Elevance Health, and have a great rest of your week.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session where participants are encouraged to present a single question. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Please go ahead. Steve Tanal : Good morning, and welcome to Elevance Health's first quarter 2024 earnings call. This is Steve Tanal, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning on the earnings call are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; Mark Kaye, our CFO; Peter Haytaian, President of Carelon; Morgan Kendrick, President of our Commercial Health Benefits Business; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Health Benefits Business. Gail will begin the call with a brief discussion of the quarter, recent progress against our strategic initiatives, and our updated outlook for the year. Mark will then discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, elevancehealth.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Elevance Health. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining today's earnings call. I'm pleased to report that Elevance Health delivered first quarter GAAP earnings per share of $9.59 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $10.64, reflecting growth of 12.5%. These results reflect disciplined execution of our strategic initiatives during a dynamic time for our industry. Given the solid start to the year, we have increased our guidance for adjusted earnings per share by $0.10 to be greater than $37.20. We are making significant progress on our enterprise strategy in 2024 to accelerate capabilities and services, invest in high growth opportunities, and optimize our Health Benefits business. On Monday, we announced the next step in our journey to expand access to high-quality patient-centered value-based care in our local markets. After years of experience working closely with care providers to advance value-based care, we are confident that our hyper-local approach, which aligns the right incentives, real-time patient information and clinical decision support tools, delivers better health outcomes, improved consumer and provider experience, and greater affordability. Accordingly, we entered into an agreement to form a strategic partnership with Clayton, Dubilier & Rice to build a payer-agnostic advanced primary care and physician-enablement business, serving consumers across commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid health plans, consistent with the diversity of our own medical membership. Upon formation, the combined company will serve nearly 1 million consumers. The new venture will bring together the strengths of three innovative care provider entities, including certain care delivery and enablement assets of Carelon Health. Importantly, we have worked closely with these companies and their management teams and are confident in the value they deliver for our Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial health plan members and employers. We're excited to collaborate with CD&R and a broad range of care provider partners to accelerate innovation, enhance healthcare experiences, and improve health outcomes for consumers. The collaborative development of the business will advance our enterprise strategy by accelerating the provision of value-based care for our members and consumers more broadly, with our Carelon businesses providing capabilities to integrate and personalize the care delivered. In time, Elevance Health will have full ownership of what we expect will be a leading platform for value-based care delivery and physician enablement at scale across commercial group, ACA, Medicare, and Medicaid health plans, advancing our role as a lifetime trusted health partner for the consumers we are privileged to serve. In the first quarter, we made tangible progress on our strategic initiatives, notably in Carelon, where we continue to scale our flywheel for enterprise growth. Carelon Rx closed its acquisition of Paragon Healthcare, a leading provider of infusion services. We are looking forward to expanding its geographic reach and therapeutic coverage to serve more consumers and Elevance Health members for years to come. As Carelon Rx furthers our enterprise commitment to address the whole health needs of our members, notably those with chronic and complex conditions, we are accelerating the buildout of our own specialty pharmacy. For example, we recently entered into an agreement to acquire Kroger's Specialty Pharmacy business, the sixth largest specialty pharmacy in the country. The acquisition will bolster the growth of our existing pharmacy and infusion businesses while increasing Carelon Rx's access to limited distribution drugs. Carelon Services is also off to a strong start this year as we implemented and were awarded multiple new contracts, a testament to the value Carelon services provides. For instance, Carelon Behavioral Health was selected by the Maryland Department of Health to provide behavioral health management services to more than 1.7 million Medicaid members starting in 2025. And in California, our team will partner with the public school system to expand behavioral health management services for students later this year. This initiative represents a major step forward in addressing the critical need for mental health support in educational settings and demonstrates our commitment to improving the health and well-being of our communities. Momentum with external clients is building and underscores the value Carelon Services is creating for health plan customers through better consumer experiences and improved affordability. Our health benefits business is similarly off to a solid start. Commercial margin continues to recover from pandemic era lows, and we are enjoying momentum in membership growth, notably in our individual ACA plans and among large self-insured employers. Existing clients are demonstrating their confidence in our offerings by consolidating their business with us after years of offering our solutions side by side with those of our competitors. In our Medicaid business, we were pleased to be selected in Florida and Virginia to serve beneficiaries across traditional and complex populations statewide, including those with serious mental illness in Florida and sole source foster care in Virginia. These awards and their pull-through opportunities for Carelon services underscore the distinct value Elevance Health delivers. In the first quarter, our Medicaid business performed in line with our expectations. We estimate that nearly 90% of our members have had their eligibility redetermined. Further, our team continues to work tirelessly to maximize access to care for Medicaid members subject to eligibility redetermination, helping them to understand their options in the face of ongoing logistical and operational challenges. Holistically, we are proud of the work we have done in contacting more than 4.5 million Medicaid beneficiaries through our omni-channel approach. Nonetheless, a majority of members who have lost coverage for administrative reasons have not yet returned. We're seeing a gradual increase in Medicaid re-enrollment and anticipate continued upticks in rejoiner rates as more Medicaid beneficiaries recognize their need to re-enroll, aligned with the trends that we have observed in recent months. Turning to Medicare. We were pleased to announce last month that CMS updated the Star scores for four of our contracts, which increased the percentage of our members in four star or higher-rated contracts to nearly 50%, up from 34%. While this will improve our star quality bonus revenue in 2025, our goal is to have our star quality ratings at the high end of all plans in our local markets, which will be a multi-year journey. Funding for Medicare in 2025 will be challenging for the entire industry. We are disappointed that CMS has decided to cut Medicare Advantage rates for the second consecutive year, which will negatively impact seniors, notably those at the lower end of the income spectrum who rely on the program for their health and wellbeing. While we remain committed to serving seniors through plan offerings that focus on their unique needs, we will also continue to demonstrate discipline in our Medicare Advantage bids seeking to balance growth and margin while continuing to deliver exceptional value for seniors. Across the enterprise, our focus on delivering whole health for the consumers we are privileged to serve remains steadfast. We recently released our 2023 Advancing Health Together progress report, which underscores the strides we are making through value-based care. The report showcases examples of our success, facilitated by the unique partnerships that we've created with care providers across the healthcare ecosystem. I'd like to highlight a particular achievement that underscores our innovative approach to improving quality and value in healthcare. Recently, Elevance Health was honored by the NCQA with its Innovation Award, featuring quality accelerators in healthcare for leading-edge strategies that improve quality and value, specifically for our obstetrics specialty provider enablement program. The impact of these value-based partnerships and clinical interventions has led to consistent improvements in health outcomes and costs, including reducing preterm birth rates by 12% and low birth weight babies by 20%, all while improving access to timely prenatal care and postpartum follow-up. For those interested in learning more about these transformative initiatives and other examples of our progress, I encourage you to visit our Advancing Health Together website. In closing, I want to extend my deep gratitude to our 100,000 associates who embody our purpose of improving the health of humanity through their tireless commitment. It's also heartening to see their efforts recognized externally. We were honored to be named to Fortune magazine's 100 Best Companies to Work for list for the fourth year in a row. We were also included in their World's Most Admired Companies and America's Most Innovative Companies list. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Mark Kaye to provide more on our operating results and outlook. Mark? Mark Kaye : Thank you, Gail. As you heard earlier, our first quarter results reflect solid performance under a dynamic operating environment. We ended March with 46.2 million members reflecting Medicaid attrition, partially offset by ongoing momentum in our commercial business. During the quarter, we added nearly 400,000 commercial fee-based members, driven by strong retention and a successful national account selling season, and over 200,000 individual ACA members, given our attractive product positioning and coverage transitions away from Medicaid. Medicare Advantage membership declined slightly, as expected, given select market exits and the collective actions we continue to take to establish a strong foundation for profitable and sustainable growth over the long term. Operating revenue for the quarter was $42.3 billion, in line with our expectations. The consolidated benefit expense ratio of 85.6% improved 20 basis points year-over-year due to disciplined premium rate adjustments to reflect medical cost trends and the ongoing recovery of commercial margins from pandemic era lows. The adjusted operating expense ratio was 11.4%, consistent with the first quarter of 2023, indicative of our commitment to disciplined expense management and investment prioritization. Solid performance and growth in operating gain for both our health benefits and Carelon segments of $138 million and $72 million respectively, led to growth in consolidated adjusted operating gains of over 7%. Carelon Services had a particularly strong start to the year with revenue and operating earnings growth driven by risk based service line expansions and effective cost management, especially in our Carelon Insights and Carelon Behavioral Health businesses, further accelerating our enterprise flywheel or growth. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $2 billion, or approximately 0.9 times net income. With respect to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a debt to capital ratio of 39.4%, in line with our target range, preserving ongoing capital allocation flexibility. We repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock for approximately $566 million during the quarter, underscoring our confidence in the intrinsic value of our shares and the long-term value proposition. We maintained our prudent and consistent approach to reserving. Days in claims payable stood at 49 days as of March 31st, up three days from the prior year quarter. This increase was largely driven by higher reserves associated with slower claims receipts due to an industry-wide disruption that impacted a major claims clearinghouse. As a reminder, we expect our days in claims payable to be in the low 40s range long term. I'd also like to take a moment to provide additional color on our strategic partnership with Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. We are excited to partner with CD&R to scale what will be a best-in-class, payor agnostic advanced care delivery and enablement platform catering to the unique needs of consumers, regardless of their form of coverage. This collaboration will allow us to advance our local-oriented approach to care delivery based on the unique needs of the communities, consumers, and employers we are privileged to serve. At the onset, Elevance Health will hold a significant minority position in the combined business with a clear path to first majority and then full ownership in approximately five years. The formation of the strategic partnership includes our capital contribution in the form of cash and our equity interest in certain care delivery and enablement assets of Carelon Health as well as the conveyance from CD&R of our pre-health in Millennium Physician Group, and is subject to customary regulatory approvals. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter performance and the solid start to the year. Momentum in our health benefits and Carelon businesses and the balance and resilience of our enterprise underscores our confidence in delivering another year of growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share consistent with our long-term compound annual growth rate of at least 12%. As we look forward to the rest of 2024, our focus will remain on successfully executing our strategy as we accelerate capabilities and services, invest in high growth opportunities, and optimize our health benefits business. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we'll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Lance Wilkes : Great. Thanks so much. Let me ask a little bit about the value-based care strategy and the execution that's obviously a really big step forward. Could you talk a little bit about kind of the vision and scope of this? Is this going to be more focused on enablement or in particular markets, is practice ownership going to be important? Then maybe if you can kind of color in the picture a little bit as far as leadership, names, which Carelon assets are going to be contributed. And near term, do you see which areas of leverage across the membership base of Elevance, do you see this being able to penetrate most effectively? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Well, great. Thanks so much for the question, Lance. First, as I shared on in my opening comments, we're very excited about this partnership with CD&R, because it is very much the next step in our journey to bring value-based care to more consumers, specifically about partnering closely with care providers. And we see it as absolutely consistent to driving greater risk adoption and advancing our specialty enablement strategy as well. So it's very much a first step there. And as you said in your question, this aligns very closely with our strategy and our broad partnership focus to work directly with care providers in our local markets. And our goal again remains to increase more downside risk sharing in our value-based arrangements. I think, to take a step back, what makes this approach unique is that we're enabling value-based care across all lines of business. So, as I shared, the combined company is going to be payor-agnostic, and it's focused on enabling advanced primary care locally. And from the get-go, it's going to serve nearly 1 million consumers, and that's going to be across our commercial, Medicare and Medicaid health plans upon formation. Another thing I think is important is that it provides the opportunity to pull through Carelon services to support those patients and accelerate that specialty enablement for complex and chronic patients. We have been working with these management teams and these assets for some time and feel very confident about the alignment of our goals to serve as a lifetime trusted health partner. The goal gets back again to focusing on whole health, the needs of consumers, driving greater affordability, and fundamentally differentiate a consumer experience. A few things about the partnership too, and again, what makes it different for patients. They're going to have access to integrated teams. We're looking at personalized navigation, expanded digital assets, and specialized services. The primary care model is going to be built to be very distinctive, including community practices, purpose-built clinics, high-risk clinics, and digitally-enabled care models. So, as you can see, it's a fairly comprehensive approach. And the last thing I'd say is that employers in the market have not historically had access to a lot of these capabilities. And we have seen through the work that we're already doing, that this dedicated primary care capacity that integrates the clinical and benefits navigation with their specific health and wellness strategies is truly differentiating. So again, this is being purpose-built to work across all of the aspects of [Medicare, Medicare] (ph), commercial, not just a single business. So very much excited. We see this as an opportunity to accelerate innovation in the space and improve healthcare outcomes and consumer experiences. So thanks very much for the question. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of AJ Rice from UBS. Please go ahead. AJ Rice : Hi, everybody. Thanks for the question. I appreciate Mark's comments about the buildup, a little bit in days in claims payable, but just maybe to flesh out a little bit more the impact of the Change cyber-attack on results. Do you have a census of what percentage of your claims that you normally see in the first quarter may still be out there? Do you feel like you've got a good handle on that? And anything when you address that in terms of your normal IV&R, maybe you've got a significantly higher level of IV&R because you're allowing for the Change and if you can break out what you're actually seeing a little bit on cost trends versus needing to sort of provision for the unknowns of the Change cyber-attack. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, AJ. Let me maybe provide some broad-based comments and then I'll turn it over to Mark to provide a little more specificity on your questions. Now, I want to say first and foremost, I'm really proud of our teams and how they responded to this issue that occurred with Change quickly and effectively, first to protect our members and their data, and also help our care providers maintain their operations and cash flow. Importantly, I think it's important to note that from a perspective, we were not as significantly impacted by this and we are back to normal operations in terms of claims flow. Importantly, another thing that's really important to understand is our prior authorization provider payments and pharmacy claims were not materially impacted as well because they don't go through Change. We don't use Change significantly for those. So with that, I'll turn it over to Mark to provide a little more comments. But I think framing it overall, we feel that our teams acted quite quickly and really proud of our ability to work in the ecosystem to help support them. Mark Kaye : AJ, as you just heard from Gail, we acted quite responsibly to sever our network connections to Change Healthcare and to protect the data of both our members and providers. While we initially observed a 15% to 20% reduction in the daily volume of electronic data receipts from providers, most of which were claims related, in recent weeks our extensive efforts have led to a significant catch-up in outstanding claim volumes. And for the quarter, we are effectively caught up on claims receipts and are now working to complete all necessary claims adjudication and processing activities. As such, as part of the normal reserving practices, we've reflected the appropriate impact of the industry-wide disruption related to Change Healthcare in the reserves we've reported for our first quarter financials, and that ensures both consistency with historical practice and prudence. And then to your specific question, the impact here was to increase our sequential days in claims payable quarterly result by approximately 1.7 days. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please, go ahead. Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to get back to the partnership with CD&R and specifically what alternatives did you evaluate and consider before coming to this arrangement? And I think in the past, you were stressing more and I've heard it today as well that focus on specialty care. So how does that fit in and sort of get bolted on, on top of this? And maybe where does this fit into your longer term national approach? And then how important was it that you could serve multiple memberships inside not just Medicare Advantage? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Yeah, thanks for the question, Josh, because I think it very much aligns to the strategy that we've laid out. I guess first and foremost, it's payor-agnostic, and it was really important. We've always said that our goal, given the diversity of our business mix, serve all members across all business lines, given the depth and density of our membership on our local markets, that is very important. We had a partnership already working with many of these assets. So as I said, we know the membership -- we know the leadership teams, we know the value that can be created. And so, we have been working with them and feel quite good about what we can create. This is payor-agnostic, which we also think is very important. And again, this will help us continue through having a focus on advanced primary care, it's still very much focused on our chronic patients and complex patients. And we are still building specialty care enablement, which is, again, another very important component of what we're trying to probe through. So I think from that value-based care across all lines of business, a critical part of our strategy, very consistent, driving value-based care, continuing to drive much more downside risk, which means that we needed strong enabling capabilities to help practices work their way through that. We know that it takes time. It is also a technology-driven model. So one of the nice things about this partnership is that there are embedded technology assets to digitally-enabled care as well. And then we have a focus on patient access and experience in the adoption of next generation models. So again, consistent with the strategy that we've had over the last several years, not really a diversion, I think, from that. And I think the timing for us was right because we have been experimenting with multiple models and have a lot of experience in the space right now. So thank you very much for the question. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Ben Hendrix : Hey, thank you very much. Just another question on the CD&R partnership. To what extent are these primary care platforms taking risk currently? Is that something that we will need to see develop as we kind of get more of these digital enablement abilities from Carelon? Just wanted to see if over the five-year horizon to full ownership, if we can expect to kind of get the full capitation on those platforms over that time period? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks, Ben. I'm going to have Pete probably provide a lot more context. But just quickly, about a third of the membership is under risk arrangement now. So with that, Pete, why don't you give a little more color into the relationship and how we see it evolve. Peter Haytaian : That's great. Thanks for the question, Ben. And I'll give you a little bit more color on the assets and the capabilities. They really all have their distinct strengths. We see great opportunities, quite frankly, to cross-pollinate. When you think about MPG to your question on risk, they really are a leader in managing Medicare and commercial risk. And they've also got a very strong chassis I think, for future growth and a proven model in that regard in terms of acquiring and providing practices. So very strong at managing risk and a lot of capabilities in that regard. What's really interesting about apree and Gail referenced this is they've got a differentiating technology and navigation capabilities with a real strong focus on the commercial business. So a really nice entry point for us. We've been working on relationships already in this regard. And I'm really excited about that because we, obviously, as a company, have a really strong commercial footprint, a really nice entry point for us. And then, of course, Carelon Health advanced primary care which is a leader in managing the complex and the chronic and largely takes risk today. We see a tremendous opportunity in a variety of ways for that. One, from a technology perspective, state-of-the-art EMR that we can upgrade as well as from a growth perspective in terms of partnering with MPG and apree. And then finally, and Gail mentioned this, but I'll reiterate it, a tremendous opportunity to wrap around existing Carelon services to this arrangement that will create value for all three assets. So, appreciate the question. Mark Kaye : And then 1 quick financial remark just at the end of Pete's comments there. We do expect the consolidated entity once formed to have over $4 billion in annualized debt revenue. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dave Windley : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll switch topics over to Medicaid. Your redetermination enrollment impacts seem to, maybe pick up some momentum in the quarter. I think you said 90% of members have now been redetermined. I wondered If you could give us some view of kind of how you expect that to gate out over the next several quarters? And then from a risk pool and rate adequacy standpoint, could you update on how that looks now that the membership is whittling down? Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. I'm going to have Felicia Norwood address your questions. Felicia Norwood : Good morning, Dave, and thank you for the question. Frankly, right now we're at a point where our Medicaid business is actually tracking very much in line with our expectations. As you referenced, we believe that about 90% of our members have had their eligibility redetermined. So as we go through the next few months, you certainly see this tapering down as we really wrap up the unwinding process as we get through June. One of the things I want to make sure you understand, the downward trend in membership in the first quarter resulted not just from re-determinations, but footprint changes as well. So it's really the cumulative impact of those two things in terms of the first quarter. When we think about the work that we will continue to do is we will continue to outreach to Medicaid members. Many members who have lost their membership at this point did that as a result of really procedural reasons. So the team will continue to be very aggressive around continuing the outreach that's been going on. And we're really proud of the work that we continue to do to really reach out to over 4.5 million people, as Gail referenced in the opening comments, to make sure that individuals who are truly eligible for Medicaid have access to Medicaid and, if not, are able to transition to an exchange product and continue coverage. In terms of where we are today with respect to, the acuity and mix of that membership, the acuity is in line with what we expected. And I will also say that at this point we have visibility into 75% of our Medicaid rates and premiums for 2024. The vast majority of those are in line with our expectations and they're actuarially sound. As you know, we have ongoing conversations with our state partners as we go throughout this process and we expect those rates to continue to be actuarially sound. So we're going to continue to work with our state partners. We're going to continue the advocacy with our members in terms of making sure they have access to care and coverage. And we're going to make sure that we go through this process with a lot of discipline and rigor, understand the mix of our membership and the levers versus [payors] (ph) as we go through this process. Thank you for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Hi, good morning and thank you. I was wondering if maybe you could talk about utilization trends by line of business and what you saw in the quarter versus your expectation. Mark Kaye : Lisa, thanks very much for the question. So utilization in the first quarter in our health benefits businesses was in line with our expectation and that was reflected in our reported benefit expense ratio of approximately 85.6%. In the commercial business, specifically inpatient and outpatient authorization levels year to date were aligned with our expectations and our internal year-to-go trend remains unchanged. On Medicare, as expected, we saw utilization related to both the two midnight rule for inpatient stays as well as pockets of outpatient authorizations around, for example, at radiology and cardiovascular procedures. And importantly, these trends were broadly planned for as part of our underlying cost trend assumptions. Medicaid, as you heard Felicia talk about a moment ago, did experience increased but state-specific utilization attributed to the redetermination, mix impacts, and we remain very comfortable with what we're seeing there given those ongoing constructive dialogues with the impacted states. And so overall, we remain confident that both our MA bids for 2024 and our commercial pricing really reflect the appropriate projections for utilization and medical cost trends. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. Just wondering if, it's not a huge increase in guidance, but would love to kind of hear what was driving the increase in guidance. Is it something on the health plan side? Is it on the Carelon side? And I guess just thoughts about how you thought about providing increases in guidance. It sounds like you believe that visibility is relatively high in claims, but obviously there's some concern there. So I don't know if there's any conservatism or thought about pace of raises versus what you're actually seeing in the core business today. Thanks. Mark Kaye : We were pleased to report our adjusted deleted EPS this quarter, which came in slightly better than our seasonal expectation. And that was led by solid performance in both our health benefits and Carelon divisions, where operating margin increased by 30 basis points and 20 basis points respectively, highlighting what we see as disciplined execution of our initiatives during a dynamic time for the industry. Of specific notes, and you referenced this in your question, was the favorable performance in the first quarter benefit expense ratio and that was driven by commercial margins that continue to recover from pandemic era lows. We're very pleased with the Q1 results. It's still early in the year and given our business is subject to some variability around medical cost trends, we're intentionally remaining thoughtful and prudent in our outlook and that led us to increase our guide for adjusted EPS by $0.10 to be greater than $37.20. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Whit Mayo from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Whit Mayo : Hey, thanks. Just wanted to hear any comments on the external revenue growth with Carelon Services. Did that grow faster than the overall segment? You did, I think, reference some strong external growth. So curious what might be gaining traction in the market. And then just a quick question on guidance. Mark, you've averaged maybe 55% to 56% of earnings in the first half. Any reason that would be different this year? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Great. Why don't I have Pete address sort of the Carelon questions and then Mark will talk about the earnings percentages. Pete? Peter Haytaian : Yeah, thanks for the question. As it relates to Carelon external growth, we continue to see a really nice momentum in our build. I mean, for 2024, from an overall sales perspective, we've already this time of the year, exceeded what we did in all 2023. And you heard Gail mention in her prepared remarks several new wins, which we're really excited about, really growth across the portfolio with some notable wins in behavioral health. She mentioned winning a statewide account in Medicaid for Maryland, which we're really excited about, and then some new innovative solutions with large employers as well as wins in the state of California. And on the behavioral health side, also some select wins in the crisis space, so areas that we've been really focused on. In addition to that, we've had some notable wins with the Blues related to our insights business. We've talked about this before, but it's really critical that we prove some of our risk arrangements and our differentiated capabilities in Elevance and then port those to the Blues. And we've seen that play through with several notable wins. Lastly, I'd say we're excited about the \u201825 pipeline. We're obviously actively in the selling season, our pipeline is very rich. And again, I would say a large focus on our insights businesses, as well as our behavioral health businesses. Mark Kaye : On your second question, the seasonality of the adjusted diluted EPS in 2024 is expected to be consistent with the past several years with approximately 55% of earnings in the first half of the year. I also want to call out that workday seasonality, given it is a leap year, did result in a smaller than historically normal impact in the first quarter. But we expect the workday seasonality to put slightly more pressure on the third quarter MLR with an offsetting favorability than in the fourth quarter as those workdays normalize. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks, Mark, and thanks for the question, Whit. And I just want to add to Pete's comments about just the momentum that we're seeing inside of Carelon. First, our proof points are within Elevance Health, and then secondarily now seeing some really nice momentum and traction externally. So thanks for the question. And next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : Great. Good morning, and thanks for the questions. Gail, I wanted to follow up on your comments on the Medicare business and the goal of balancing growth and margins. Could you maybe just elaborate on that, given the tougher rate environment that you highlighted? And I think the companies prioritize margin improvement in Medicare this year. Does that kind of remain on track for 2024? And do you expect to plan for further improvement in 2025? Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, Nathan. As I shared in my opening comments, first of all, the Medicare rate announcement, as you've heard, represents the second year of consecutive cuts to the program that we know will result in increased premiums and reduced benefits for seniors with disabilities and particularly those that have really needed this program. Our approach is very consistent. We're going to continue to be disciplined in our approach to the Medicare business. Our focus is to get consistency, high-value competitive benefits, and balanced growth and margins. We're focused on building a sustainable, attractive, long-term business. It's too early to provide specifics for the 2025 bid at this stage, but again, I'm going to repeat, we're looking to really balance growth and margins. As we talked about in our Investor Day, our focus is on keeping our members Blue for life and there we\u2019re focused on particularly our 14 Blue states and continuing to prioritize the very significant business we have in DSNP where our unique competitive advantage is serving the needs of those consumers with complex conditions. So overall, we're in the midst of the process right now, so we'll have more as we get through the bid process, but thank you very much for the question. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Hi, thanks. Just interested. It seems like now you're talking about an at least 12% EPS CAGR as your long-term expectations in both the slides and the prepared remarks. Like obviously in the past, you've talked about a 12% to 15% EPS growth CAGR target. Just wondering what if anything, we should be reading into that? Thank you. Mark Kaye : Thank you very much for the question. You should see these two targets as synergistic. We remain firmly committed to achieving a long-term adjusted earnings per share CAGR of 12% to 15% through 2027 as we communicated at our Investor Day event last year. And then as we think more broadly around the long-term, we have confidence that through business cycles and over time, the earnings power of our health benefits and Carelon flywheel will generate the momentum and the foundation that's needed to sustain a long-term compound annual growth rate of at least 12%. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Sarah James from Cancer Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. And Sarah, your line is open. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Andrew Mok from Barclays. Please go ahead. Andrew Mok : Hi. Good morning. Hoping you can give us an update on your transition of specialty scripts to BioPlus and help us understand the contribution that that's expected to have this year. Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks. Let me have Pete address your question. Peter Haytaian : Yeah, thanks for the question, Andrew. Listen, the integration of BioPlus is going well. As you know, we remain on an accelerated calendar regarding this. I'll just reiterate, we spent last year building out the infrastructure and the team, and we did begin migrating scripts in January of this year. And we're doing so really on a staged basis. So we'll continue to do the migration throughout \u201824 and into 2025 as it relates to the Elevance Health book of business. I'd say overall things are going well. The infrastructure build is going well in addition to the BioPlus dispensing facilities that are in place. We're live with one additional facility now as we speak and we have two more going live this year. So we feel very good about the capacity, not only with respect to the Elevance Health business, but business beyond that. So we're excited, we're on a path, and again it will be staged throughout \u201824 and \u201825. Gail Boudreaux : Yeah, in addition, I'll just add to what Pete said, to BioPlus, as you know, we also announced the acquisition of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, and that is also well aligned to Carelon\u2019s effort to control those levers that matter. So thank you for the question. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I -- Gail, first I'd like to follow up on Dave's question on Medicaid and I guess can you talk about where you think we are in the kind of where, in -- I guess, in the calendar and the mix of rate determinations versus acuity mix and kind of I guess I'm trying to get a sense for how far behind do you think the kind of the rate repricings are versus the changes in acuity mix from redetermination? And given that you just talked about specialty, I'd love if you could just add a comment on the Kroger deal and if you expect those scripts to transfer over to BioPlus and how you think about the stickiness of those scripts? Gail Boudreaux : Yeah, George, I think Felicia pretty much covered your question, which is, we think things are quite aligned at this point. So in terms of the acuity and the mix, everything, we have visibility into 75% of our Medicaid premiums. We've had very constructive discussions with our states. So, overall, we feel things are lining up. They're actuarially sound, and our conversations are ongoing. So, I feel very good about our Medicaid business, just to sort of put a finer point on that. In terms of Kroger, I'm going to ask Pete to comment on Kroger and how that's going to align with our broader pharmacy business. Peter Haytaian : Yeah, George, thanks for the question on Kroger. And as Gail alluded to it, we're excited about this deal. It furthers the Carelon and the pharmacy strategy. It certainly is a natural extension of our recent arrangement with BioPlus. And just to give you some background, Kroger Specialty Pharmacy is the largest non-payer-owned specialty pharmacy. They do about 500,000 scripts a year, And it really is a natural complement to what we're doing with both BioPlus and Paragon, quite frankly. To give you a sense of what this is going to do for us, it's going to add meaningful scale. It increases our access to more LDDs, limited distribution drugs, which is very important. Certainly strengthens our relationship with manufacturers, enabling us to really provide greater affordability and quality. And in fact, it has a nice presence in Puerto Rico, which could be very helpful to our MMM business. As it relates to your question on transition of scripts, we feel very good about that. I mean, obviously, in this case with specialty pharmacy, providers and members have choice, but we feel very good about the execution model. We feel very good about the stickiness of the scripts, and we believe the integration and the transition will be straightforward. We expect the arrangement to likely close in Q3 and Q4 this year. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line up Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Hi, thanks. Just interested if we could double-click on the Carelon Services margins in the first quarter with the 90 basis points of expansion. Anything specifically that you would call out there, and then that pacing does seem to be quite a bit stronger than the full-year guidance where you had sort of called for a flattish to down 30 basis points. So, curious whether you have any updates for us just on how you expect Carelon Services margins to trend for the full year. Thanks. Mark Kaye : Thank you very much for the question. Margins were better than expected in the first quarter, and that aligned very well to very strong revenue growth in the quarter, given the launch of several new internal risk deals, which we expect to accelerate as the year goes on. We're not seeking to update our full year guidance at this time, given that both the seasonality of the business continues to evolve as we expand our risk-based revenue and the timing of new product launches is anticipated to result in some transitory quarterly volatility. But let me turn it over to Pete for a couple of minutes to talk about what we're doing. Peter Haytaian : Yeah, no, it's appreciated. And Mark's really covered it. But think about it this way. We are launching some pretty significant risk arrangements this year. We've talked about it, but a full risk arrangement in oncology, a full risk arrangement with the seriously mentally ill. And you should think about this as a natural cadence to launching this throughout the year, and that's what's going to impact the margins. So, for example, with the seriously mentally ill, we're doing this largely with the Medicaid business. It's not a big bang across all the Medicaid states immediately, as you'd expect. It's more methodical state by state in \u201824 and \u201825. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. There are some significant changes coming in the Part D space for 2025. I was curious as to your view on what that could mean for premiums. Just maybe you could tell us where you think kind of industry premiums are this year and where how significant that increase could be for 2025. Gail Boudreaux : I'm going to ask Felicia to address that. Felicia Norwood : So, good morning, Justin, and thank you for the question. There are significant changes coming for 2025, and I'll say this, it's early to provide specifics around what our 2025 strategy is going to be. But as Gail mentioned before, we are going to make sure that we have a very balanced approach as we think about the margins around our Medicare business and focus on those things that we believe bring the highest value to our members as we really work to make sure we have a competitive product in-market that meets the needs of those members that we're trying to serve with a lot of dynamic changes that are going on in the Medicare environment for 2025. So thank you for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Ann Hynes from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Ann Hynes : Yeah, thank you. Congrats on retaining the Florida contract, but it looks like you're actually gaining market share. Can you let us know the membership growth? And also looking ahead over the next couple of years, is there any big state renewal risks for Elevance and alternatively, is there any big RFP opportunities for you? Thanks. Felicia Norwood : So, good morning, Ann, and thank you. We are certainly very pleased with the results in Florida. It's a state that we have been partnering in for a long period of time, but certainly the win here allows us to expand our footprint and additionally serve some complex populations, particularly SMI, which will be very much kind of a collaboration with our Carelon Services business, so very excited about that. We are also very focused on our Virginia go-live, which is coming up in July as well. So a lot of work happening there. Outstanding at this point is certainly Georgia, where we will be defending our procurement with respect to our core business, as well as our foster care business in the state of Georgia, and feel very good about the work that we continue to do there in partnership with the state. In addition, we are very much focused on a couple of new geographies where we are bidding this year and look forward to hearing those results. But on top of that, the states are very much focused on specialty populations, and we see that as the opportunity for growth as we go forward. Medicaid is a very important business for us. Our recent RFP wins, I think, demonstrate the value that we bring to our state partners, but more importantly, the improvement in quality of outcomes that we are providing to Medicaid beneficiaries. So thank you very much for the question. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Gary Taylor from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : Hi. Good morning. Two quick ones for me. I just wanted to come back to Medicaid for a second. I mean, it's obvious your commercial book is doing very well, but you had expected Medicaid margins to come down this year, but you're saying the rate adjustments you're getting are actuarially sound for the acuity changes. So should we think about the lower Medicaid margins this year primarily just the deleveraging the OpEx impact of losing the revenue and enrollment and that MLR is going to be fairly stable? And then just my second question was, Mark made this comment, John made this comment for years about how days claims payable would eventually come down into the low 40s. That's a lot of inherent or embedded earnings power that could come through the P&L at some point over time. Can you give us any sort of sense of what long-term means in terms of seeing the reserves move lower? Mark Kaye : Gary, good morning and thank you for the questions. Let me start maybe with the margins and let me bring it up to the health benefits business segment to talk about first. So in terms of health benefits, the margins this quarter were very much in line with our expectations. It puts us squarely on track to achieve our guidance for the full year of an increase between 25 basis points and 50 basis points. I'm not looking necessarily to comment on a single business' margin, but you could expect Medicaid margins to normalize, given we already have line of sight, and you heard Felicia talk about this, into approximately 75% of the Medicaid premiums for 2024, and that we are comfortable with the actuarial soundness of the rates that we are seeing. Over the long term, Medicaid continues to normalize as we spoke about last quarter, and it is performing as expected. On the DCP, for 2024, if we look out through the end of the year, we're anticipating remaining in the mid to upper 40s range given Medicaid membership is expected to decline to within our guidance range of 8.8 million to 9.2 million members. And as you know, Medicaid has a slightly lower relative DCP compared to commercial, for example. And then over time, to reiterate the guidance, we do expect over the long term, DCPs to return to that more normalized range in the low 40s. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Mark. One more question, please. Operator : And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Sarah James from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Sarah James : Thank you. Just wanted to clarify a couple of things. One, on the reserve boost, are you saying the 1.7 days is fully related to conservatism via Change? Because that seems like about a $600 reserve boost to us, so I wanted to see if there was any other factors in that 1.7 days. And second, could you give us a sense of your Medicaid rate seasonality? Like, what percent of your book renews in 1Q versus 2Q versus 3Q? Mark Kaye : On your first question, the sequential increase in days in claims payable at quarter result of 1.7 days is primarily related to the Change Healthcare. I just want to -- -maybe one clarification around this. It's worth noting that neither the decrease in claims receipts that we saw during the quarter or the reserve accrual that we took related to Change Healthcare had any discernible impact on our benefit expense ratio or P&L. And that's because we believe the reserve represents an amount we would otherwise have paid had there been no disruption. So you should think about this as overall for the quarter, incurred claims are completely consistent with our expectations. Given some of the notes that came out this morning, I also would like to just reiterate that we do expect operating cash flow to be at least $8.1 billion for the full year, reiterating our earlier guidance. Felicia Norwood : And, Sarah, just on your question with respect to our Medicaid states and when our rates are up for renewal, we have roughly 10 states that renew in January, another state that renews in April, another nine that renew in July, and then the last two renew in the back half of the year in September and October. Gail Boudreaux : Well, thank you very much for your questions. Just in some closing thoughts, we're very pleased to be off to a solid start this year, and we're confident, as you heard in the ongoing execution of our strategy and the balance and resilience of our diverse set of businesses positions us well for 2024 and beyond. We're very excited about the future and look forward to sharing more on our progress with you in the coming year. Thank you for your interest in Elevance Health and have a great rest of your week.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session where participants are encouraged to present a single question. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Please go ahead. Steve Tanal : Good morning, and welcome to Elevance Health's second quarter 2024 earnings call. This is Steve Tanal, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning on the earnings call are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; Mark Kaye, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of Carelon; Morgan Kendrick, President of our Commercial Health Benefits business; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Health Benefits business. Gail will begin the call with a brief discussion of the quarter and recent progress against our strategic initiatives. Mark will then discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, elevancehealth.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Elevance Health. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining today's earnings call. This morning, we reported second quarter results, including adjusted diluted earnings per share of $10.12, reflecting 12% growth year-on-year. These results reflect thoughtful execution in a dynamic operating environment as well as the unique strengths of our enterprise, including the power of our diverse set of businesses. We have reaffirmed our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance of at least $37.20, which represents 12% growth year-over-year. We have prudently maintained our full year outlook, given industry-wide dynamics we are navigating in our Medicaid business and the investments we are making to support business transformation and deepen capabilities within CarelonRx. Our Health Benefits segment demonstrated balance and resilience in the quarter. In Commercial, we continue to make progress on our margin recovery initiative and are delivering solid membership growth, notably in our individual ACA business which has grown substantially year-over-year. We've also extended our momentum in national accounts where the business is tracking to historically high retention levels and new customer acquisition remains strong. Year-to-date, we've consolidated business with additional existing employer group clients who previously only worked with us on a slice of their business, a testament to the unique value we deliver to the market. In Medicaid, we are pleased with our recent new business wins and re-procurement success, positioning us for future growth. We launched the Indiana Pathways for Aging program just weeks ago and are proud to be the largest payer in this important program in our home state, serving nearly 40% of all eligible Hoosiers. Indiana Pathways plays directly to our strengths, serving populations with chronic and complex needs. We were also privileged to be awarded the KanCare Kansas Medicaid RFP this quarter, working in partnership alongside two Blue partners as Healthy Blue. Turning to Medicaid redeterminations. While nearly all of our members have had their eligibility redetermined since the process resumed last year, our work is not done. With approximately 70% of coverage losses attributable to administrative challenges, we continue our proactive outreach to members to maximize access to care and minimize barriers to whole health. We expect disenrolled members to re-enroll throughout the year, albeit on a longer lag than expected when redeterminations resumed last year, We are seeing the percentage of returners steadily increase, especially in our Blue states where we offer both Commercial and Medicaid health plans. As a result of redeterminations, our Medicaid membership mix has shifted, resulting in increased acuity and we are working actively with our state partners to ensure rates remain actuarily sound. In Medicare, we were pleased with the recent ruling regarding our challenge of the initial 2024 Star ratings. As a result, our enterprise weighted-average rating has increased to 4.0 Star and we now expect approximately 56% of our members will be in plans rated at least 4.0 Star or in contracts too new to be rated that will be reimbursed similarly in payment year 2025. This outcome will help offset funding cuts to the Medicare Advantage program for the second consecutive year, which we believe will result in increased premiums and/or reduced benefits for seniors and people with disabilities who rely on Medicare Advantage for their health and wellbeing. For our part, we maintained our disciplined approach to 2025 bids. We will be offering highly valued and competitive benefits as we seek to balance growth and margins and remain focused on building an attractive and sustainable Medicare Advantage business for the long term. In our Health Services businesses, we are making progress on our key strategic priority to scale our enterprise flywheel for growth. Carelon Services delivered robust growth in operating revenue and earnings in the quarter as we gained traction with external clients both through new business wins and the expansion of risk-based services to existing customers. For example, we recently secured a significant win with an existing Blue Cross Blue Shield partner and deployed new behavioral and medical benefit management services to state and third-party payer clients. These awards are a testament to the value we deliver and an affirmation of our strategy of proving value internally before driving growth externally. Turning to CarelonRx. We are integrating recent acquisitions and scaling key value drivers as we invest to control the levers that matter to deliver greater value and enhance consumer experiences for our members. Our margin performance in the second quarter reflects elevated investment, specifically around infrastructure and service levels as we remain committed to providing best-in-class home delivery and SpecialtyRx services. We see significant opportunity to grow and scale these assets and remain excited about the growth potential of CarelonRx. We are making progress on our enterprise strategy in 2024 to accelerate capabilities and services, invest in high-growth opportunities and optimize our Health Benefits business and have robust long-term growth potential embedded in each of these imperatives. We are delivering strong and accelerating growth in Carelon Services with a long runway ahead. Meanwhile, our guidance for 2024 embeds significant investment in growth, notably in CarelonRx and government health plan operating margins below their long-term average with meaningful upside to our targets. Our focused execution reflects our confidence in Carelon as our flywheel for enterprise growth and the embedded earnings power of our businesses, which together will enable us to deliver strong growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share over the long-term. In closing, I want to thank our community partners who share our purpose and dedication as well as our associates who work hard every day to make Elevance Health a lifetime trusted health partner for the members we are privileged to serve. Their collective passion is reflecting a recent external recognition, including as one of America's Greatest Workplaces in 2024 by Newsweek where Elevance Health earned five out of five stars as well as our inclusion among the Best Companies to Work For for 2024 by US News and World Report. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Mark Kaye, to discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail. Mark? Mark Kaye : Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail shared, we reported second quarter results, including GAAP diluted earnings per share of $9.85 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $10.12, representing growth of 12% year-over-year. We ended the second quarter with 45.8 million members, principally reflecting attrition in our Medicaid membership. Our commercial fee-based business grew by 354,000 lives year-over-year, reflecting the distinct value we provide to self-insured employers and the strength of the Blue Cross Blue Shield brand. Additionally, the thoughtful positioning of our individual ACA products has proven effective in ensuring robust and profitable growth. Total operating revenue for the quarter was $43.2 billion, approximately flat year-over-year. As we approach the tail-end of Medicaid redeterminations, we anticipate growing operating revenue in the second half of the year, driven by growth in premiums and CarelonRx product revenue related to higher external membership and the acquisition of Paragon Healthcare. Carelon Services' momentum accelerated in the quarter. Operating revenue grew by over 26% and operating earnings increased by more than 30% due to growth in risk-based services provided to internal and external clients, prudent pricing and strong execution. The consolidated benefit expense ratio was 86.3% for the second quarter, an improvement of 10 basis points year-over-year. This improvement was driven by several factors including premium rate adjustments in recognition of medical cost trends, disciplined medical management and a shift in our mix of business towards commercial. This was partially offset by our Medicaid business where acuity has increased due to attrition of healthier members. Elevance Health's adjusted operating expense ratio was 11.5% in the second quarter, an increase of 50 basis points relative to the second quarter of 2023. We absorbed elevated investment costs notably in CarelonRx and this along with other strategic initiatives will position our company for long-term sustainable growth. We anticipate significant improvement in our operating expense ratio in the second half of this year. Adjusted operating gain for the enterprise grew approximately 6% year-over-year, led by Carelon Services. We have maintained a prudent posture with respect to reserves. Days and claims payable at the end of the second quarter stood at 45.3 days, above our long-term target range in the low 40s. As a reminder, days in claims payable in the first quarter included approximately 1.7 days related to the industry-wide delays in claims receipts. With respect to our outlook, we are closely monitoring acuity and cost trends, notably in Medicaid, and are working collaboratively with states to ensure rates remain actuarily sound. We are, however, expecting second half utilization to increase in Medicaid and as a result, anticipate our full year benefit expense ratio will end the year in the upper half of our initial guidance range. Nonetheless, we expect to achieve our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance of at least $37.20. Before I close, I'd like to briefly talk through our enterprise growth algorithm which we have included in the supplemental earnings presentation provided this morning. Our commitment to growing adjusted diluted earnings per share by at least 12% annually on average incorporates upper single-digit growth in operating revenue, underpinned by membership growth, geographic expansion and momentum in Carelon as we scale our enterprise flywheel. Our commitment to disciplined underwriting and operating expense management across all lines of business will drive the improvement inherent in our enterprise operating margin target of 6.5% to 7% by 2027. Taken together, we are targeting growing operating earnings in the upper single-digit to low double-digit percent range annually on average over time. Finally, we expect capital deployment to consistently deliver one-third of our targeted adjusted diluted earnings per share growth rate. Overall, our results in the first half of the year are consistent with our initial guidance, and we will maintain a steadfast focus on execution and operating efficiency over the balance of the year. And with that, operator, please open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Maybe just to kick it off here. I know you've laid out your long-term growth objectives and all. I wonder if at this early date, you're prepared to comment a little more on any plans you have to accelerate growth in '25. I know the topline has had redeterminations and other things this year. What's your thought about ability to get back to that growth trajectory that you're seeking long-term in '25? Gail Boudreaux : Great. Thanks, A.J., and thanks very much for the question this morning. I think let me start with what Mark outlined as our enterprise growth algorithm because I think that really frames for everyone how we are thinking about our business. And also as you think about 2024 and our results, the balance and resilience of our complementary businesses that has allowed us to grow in multiple ways in many type of different macroeconomic environments. While it is early for '25, I'd like to at least frame sort of how we're thinking about 2025. We do expect to accelerate revenue growth across all of our businesses. Specifically in our health business, we see a lot of really strong momentum in commercial and that's been ongoing. Part of that's through the targeted expansion of our individual ACA footprint and in some cases, adding new geographies that help support what's happening in the Medicaid redeterminations. In Medicare Advantage, as we said in our opening comments, we feel that we've positioned ourselves for sustainable growth in margins and look at that as a very good long-term business. And then in Medicaid, we're nearing the end of the redetermination cycle and we do anticipate a return to growth. And you've heard about some of our early wins this year which we are very pleased with. We also do believe that some of those that were redetermined based on administrative reasons will be coming back, albeit it's taken a little bit longer than we originally thought. And then I'd like to kind of close these comments about our excitement around Carelon and the growth that we're seeing and how we progressed. You saw some of that come through in the second quarter. In Carelon Services, we are seeing some very strong external growth in the quarter and we see expanded opportunities as we continue to build our capabilities, particularly in the risk market. And what we're seeing here is our ability to prove it on our own businesses first and then take it to the market commercially has been a really strong selling point for us and we're very excited about that. And then finally, CarelonRx is our ability to scale, especially on the specialty side, including the integration of some of our recent capabilities such as Paragon Healthcare, BioPlus Specialty Pharmacy. And we're looking forward to adding the Kroger Specialty Pharmacy business as well as we continue to diversify. So overall, as we think about acceleration of revenue growth in '25, we do expect it across all of our business and are extremely positive about what we're seeing inside of our business. So, thank you for the question. And next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : Thanks for the questions. I wanted to ask on Medicaid. I think about a quarter of your book is due to set rates in the back half of the year. Could you maybe just talk about what your guidance assumes for these rate updates? And maybe anything you've seen kind of so far as you think about the updates for July or October to the extent you have visibility? And I guess, Mark, on your comment on Medicaid utilization, have you seen the level of care on a same member basis increase or is the issue really just the timing dynamic between where state rates are and the level of acuity that you're seeing in your population? Gail Boudreaux : Well, thanks for the questions, Nathan. A lot in there. So let me ask Felicia Norwood, who leads Government first and then have Mark respond to the second part of your question. Felicia? Felicia Norwood : So, good morning, Nathan. You are absolutely right. The way our rate timing works, we have about half of our states where we have rates in the first half of the year and the other half in the back half of the year with a -- our core group certainly in fourth quarter. At this point, we have visibility into nearly all of our Medicaid Premium for 2024 and the rate conversations with our states are very constructive. With that said, not all of our rates are final. We are in constant conversations with our states and providing them with information, updated information that we see in terms of the experience almost weekly to make sure that they are seeing what we are seeing from an overall change perspective as we wind down redeterminations which certainly has been one of the largest transformative things that have happened in Medicaid for some period of time. I will say that the conversations are ongoing. We fully expect our rates to remain actuarily sound, but we acknowledge the potential for a short-term disconnect between the timing of our rates and the emerging acuity in our populations and that's certainly been reflected in our updates for the year. I will say that we continue to make sure that states and their actuaries have the most recent data that we have and we will continue to have that engagement as we go through the fourth quarter rate process with a few very large states that remain in negotiations with us. And with that, I will turn it over to Mark to talk about the rest of the issues around utilization. Mark Kaye : Thanks very much, Felicia, and good morning. Medicaid utilization in the quarter, as you heard from Felicia, reflected higher acuity as expected. We are also seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures. I just wanted to add here, just as we noted in our prepared remarks, the full year outlook does allow for both this shift in acuity and increased utilization in the second half of the year, including the rate timing mismatch that Felicia spoke to. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Lance Wilkes : Yeah. Could you talk a little bit about CarelonRx, and in particular, interested in the contracting approach and scope for the CVS contract that underlies parts of that as you're insourcing things? And then just if you could give a quick update on the status of the integration rollout to the Anthem members and other members of BioPlus and Paragon and the status of Kroger? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Great. Well, thanks, Lance. I'm going to ask Pete Haytaian, who leads Carelon to address your question. Pete Haytaian : Yeah. Thanks. Thanks a lot for the question, Lance. We feel very good about the overall strategy as it relates to pharmacy. I'll start with how we're performing on the core and growth in the core. Our strategy is resonating in the marketplace. There continues to be a lot of interest in what we're doing as it relates to the strategic levers that matter and how we're insourcing and diversifying our business. And I think our value story is really resonating -- the integrated value story and that's really playing through with highly competitive pricing. And again, we continue to perform very well on the core PBM down-market and middle-market. So we feel very good about that. As it relates to our diversification and your question on our assets, things are going very well. As we talked about with regard to specialty, we spent the last year building out our infrastructure to be able to handle the capacity -- to have the capacity to handle the Elevance scripts and we feel very good about that. We began to migrate scripts at the beginning of this year as it relates to specialty and we continue to move forward in that regard. And importantly, we are preparing right now and continue to make investments around the Kroger close and assuming those scripts as well. Right now, we're projecting that to close Q3, Q4 of this year and again, a lot of preparation and investment to make sure that we do that really well. And then finally, as it relates to Paragon, again, just to reiterate the opportunity there because we feel very, very good about that. We're talking about $16 billion of infusion spend as it relates to Elevance Health with about 50% of that being in the hospital setting. So again, a great opportunity for us to have care be provided in a more appropriate setting, be it in an ambulatory site or in the home and we feel very good about our positioning and the density that we have in our markets as it relates to that. And importantly, as part of that strategy, we are targeting at a zip code level, the stand-up of ambulatory sites to be able to provide that care. We're launching one imminently and then we are preparing and building out strategies to launch others into 2025. So, overall, we feel very good about our strategy of insourcing the strategic levers that matter and the growth opportunity that exists. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks, Pete, and thanks again, Lance, for the question. And just I think this is a great example of our flywheel for growth and our ability to scale these assets which we're very excited about. And again, thinking about this as the opportunity to drive a differentiated cost of care for our health plans within Elevance Health, but also better experience for members and support our partners across the ecosystem. So again, a really important part of our flywheel. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, great. Thanks. I guess in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that the results here were somewhat burdened by, I guess, three things. One, your investments in Carelon for growth and then you had below average margins in Medicaid and below average margins in Medicare Advantage. Can you help size those things? How should we think about where those margins are today relative to kind of where they should be from a target perspective? Thanks. Mark Kaye : Thanks very much for the question. We're not going to comment on in detail where single lines business operating margin may land, given our combined Health Benefits reporting segment. But however, to your question, let me give you a little bit of color. We do expect the Medicaid margins to compress year-over-year. There are key factors driving this, including or beyond the industry-wide dynamics that we're navigating. And those include what we spoke to a moment ago around the timing mismatch of rates relative to acuity and the higher acuity itself associated with the Medicaid membership mix. Importantly, as you heard us talk to you just a moment ago, we are holding very constructive conversations with the states to ensure those rates remain actuarily sound. In Medicare, we do continue to expect margins are going to improve in 2024 compared to 2023. They will still remain below our long-term target margin range. And then finally, we are very pleased with the progress of our 2024 commercial repricing initiatives and our disciplined pricing practices. And we've spoken about this before, but it's worth emphasizing 2023 really marked that first -- or the end of that first full year of our efforts to recover margins and you're seeing some of that benefit together with the action that we're taking in 2024 come through our numbers. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. What are your expectations for market-level growth in MA for 2025? And I know it's early, but maybe any headwinds, tailwinds and how we should expect Elevance to grow market-share relative to the overall market in MA for 2025? Gail Boudreaux : I'll ask Felicia to comment on that, Josh. Thank you. Felicia Norwood : So, good morning, Josh, and thank you. It's an incredibly dynamic time in Medicare Advantage. And now more than ever, we think it's important to be very thoughtful and rational as we plan for 2025. Despite this environment, Medicare Advantage enrollment is at an all-time high and over 50% of individuals are still choosing MA. And that means there's still a clear value for what MA offers and we're committed in the long-term to having and operating a profitable and sustainable MA business. It's a little early to talk about 2025 in terms of growth expectations. Our bids were recently submitted to CMS and frankly, we are still getting feedback on that. In addition to that, the industry-wide submissions aren't known yet. We feel encouraged by commentary from peers that everybody is going to kind of price rationally and have benefit rationalization as we head into 2025, but we still have to wait and see what emerges once we have greater information from our competitors. So at this point, there's a lot of unknowns. I will tell you we maintained a very disciplined approach, offering competitive benefits while we are balancing growth and margins. I think we were very thoughtful in the plan designs that we put out there to make sure that we were focusing on profitable growth and the sustainability of this program for the long term. We are very focused on our DSNP business, which is where we believe that we have a strong advantage when we think about our Medicaid and Medicare positioning. And we also did prioritization around our products in terms of our local market dynamics. So it's still early to determine what growth is going to look like for 2025. We feel very good about how we position our business on the heels of our strategy in 2024 to make sure that we have a sustainable long-term business in Medicare Advantage. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much and good morning. I really want to stick with Medicare Advantage for a minute. Can you talk about what you saw specifically in the quarter around trend? And then, Felicia, maybe you can comment on what you included around trend assumption in your MA bids as we think about 2025? Gail Boudreaux : Great. I'll ask Mark to comment on your question. Mark Kaye : Thanks very much for the additional questions here on Medicaid. First, we are seeing a larger than typical pull-forward effect and that's really driven by the increased numbers of Medicaid members who are losing coverage. You can think about this as beneficiaries who are facing an imminent loss of coverage, in the month or so preceding that coverage loss, picking up additional benefits. Second, member mischaracterization among the core expansion in specialized population has caused some localized revenue pressure as some members expect to regain coverage after previously being determined as ineligible. And third, on this topic of Medicaid, elevated outpatient trends in elective procedures. Steve just flagged me, he said to talk about Medicare. So I apologize for that. On Medicare, the answer is very short. Trends developed in line with expectations. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Mark. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. Appreciate the question. First, can you size the Medicaid trend increase that you're seeing here? And then second, I just wanted to follow up on Kevin's question on government margins. Understand you don't want to give us specific absolute margin levels, but I was wondering if you could share your expectation of the trajectory of margins in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid for 2025 versus 2024? Thanks. Mark Kaye : Thanks very much for the question. Segment margins in the quarter improved by 20 basis points year-over-year. And I'd argue that the first half results here are consistent with our initial guidance range. And we expect full year margins to end within our initial outlook, up 25 basis points to 50 basis points, primarily driven by the ongoing recovery of our Commercial business. From a seasonality perspective, there are two key comments I wanted to draw out here. For modeling purposes, second quarter revenue growth is going to mark the low point for the year and we expect third and fourth quarter operating revenue and premium revenue growth rates to improve. And then secondly, just on the MLR that ties directly to your question, we now expect the third quarter MLR to be near the high end of our full year guidance range. And I note this specifically, Justin, as the current third quarter consensus estimate does not appear to capture the calendar day shift associated with the Leap year and that's going to have approximately a 70 basis point impact on the third quarter MLR. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Erin Wright from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Erin Wright : Hey, thanks for taking my question. Can you talk a little bit about the investments you're making around CarelonRx and how you're thinking about the timeline in terms of scaling specialty? And are there ample opportunities out there for you like Kroger and Paragon out there? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Well, thanks. Thanks, Erin, and welcome to our call. I think this is the first time you've been on our call. So it's great to hear from you. I'll ask Pete to comment. Pete Haytaian : Yeah, no, thank you. We feel very good about our specialty strategy, and I appreciate the question. I'll try not to repeat what I said before and give you a little bit more context. But as I noted, as it related to our specialty strategy, we acquired BioPlus last year in 2023. And again, we spent a lot of time last year in building out the infrastructure and the capacity to be able to assume Elevance scripts. And our focus as it relates to the near term is being able to migrate Elevance scripts, which will occur through this year and into 2025. As you noted, we're going to be opportunistic and we have been as it relates to things like Kroger, that provides additional scale for us. To give you a little bit of color on Kroger, it's about 500,000 incremental scripts. They also give us access to additional LDDs as well as having a presence in places like Puerto Rico, which could help us as well. And so we'll continue to be opportunistic as it relates to our specialty strategy and really on our focus to deliver whole health. We are anticipating, as I noted earlier, that Kroger would close Q3, Q4 of this year, and we're preparing for that and continuing to make investments around that. And then I'd say as we move forward more broadly and Gail touched upon this as it relates to our specialty strategy, there's a real focus on patient differentiation in Whole Health. We have a wonderful opportunity as we move forward to really drive Whole Health and capture all the value of Carelon, including things like integrating behavioral health and other services. And so that's going to be our goals and focus moving forward. We feel very bullish about it. We feel very bullish about our growth. We feel very bullish about delivering on the Carelon strategy and Whole Health as we move forward. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Thank you, Pete. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Michael Ha from Baird. Please go ahead. Michael Ha : Thank you. Just wanted to ask about your long-term growth targets. In your deck, you now had a slight decline in health benefits long term growth CAGR. And apologies if I missed this in your comments, but could you provide some color on what's driving that? Is that MA, Medicaid, presumably not Commercial? And then I also think you reaffirmed long term targets on Carelon. But over the past year since your Investor Day, CD&R partnership, BioPlus, acquisition of Paragon, pending Kroger, the business seemingly has taken very positive steps forward in its evolution. So would it be fair to say your prior targets at Investor Day, most of those assumptions within your guide or long-term targets did not contemplate all these new developments. And specifically, Carelon Services revenue per consumer serve the 50% growth target by '27 now appears like there's much, much higher runway. So just overall taking a step back, even though you're reaffirming your targets. Is it true that now today, there's significantly greater potential embedded earnings power within Carelon versus last year that could be unlocked in future years? Thank you. Mark Kaye : This quarter, we are pleased to introduce our growth algorithm which underpins our adjusted diluted earnings per share target of average annual growth of at least 12% over time. You asked a little bit about the revision, and we have revised our enterprise revenue growth target from the high single to low double-digits to high single-digits percent range and that's primarily to reflect Medicaid-related attrition that has occurred to date and the impact of the prudent actions that we're taking in our 2024 and 2025 Medicare Advantage bids in response to the risk model revisions. Accordingly, our health benefits segment revenue CAGR should now be in the -- will now be in the mid-to-upper single-digit percent range. But the key point here is our path is much the same. And that really means that we're expecting high-single-digit to low double-digit percent growth in operating earnings. And the key point here to the second half of your question, with approximately one-third contribution from capital deployment and that capital deployment can come through in the form of inorganic activity to support our Carelon businesses. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Andrew Mok from Barclays. Please go ahead. Andrew Mok : Hi, good morning. Wanted to follow-up on some of the Medicaid comments. It sounds like you're optimistic that rates get better in the back half, but also acknowledge a temporary disconnect that persists and expect higher Medicaid utilization in the back half. So if we translate that into MLR expectations, does guidance assume that Medicaid MLR peaks in 2Q and gets better from here with potentially better rates or do you expect it to peak at some point in the back half of the year? Thanks. Mark Kaye : Great question. And the opening comments there are completely consistent with the way that we're thinking about it. You should really think about this as we now expect our full year benefit expense ratio to be in the upper half of that initial guidance range, i.e., 87% to 87.5%, principally because of the Medicaid dynamics that we're navigating. We're not looking to provide specific quarter-by-quarter guidance. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Ryan Langston from Cowen. Please go ahead. Ryan Langston : Hi, good morning. Just a quick one for me. Prior year development was a bit more favorable than we expected. Can you maybe give us a sense on if that's just mostly from the fourth quarter, and if so, any kind of particular pockets of utilization you'd call out is maybe coming in better than expected? Thanks. Mark Kaye : Thanks very much for the question. Let me put the prior development in the context of the medical claims payment change this quarter. I think that's more instructive to understand the dynamics here. And you saw medical claims payable in the quarter go down by approximately $1.3 billion versus the first quarter. And there are really several factors that drove this and then ultimately drove PYD development. And they include the reserve runoff due to Medicaid membership decline, the catch-up in claims paid associated with elevated reserves for industry-wide claim receipt delays in the first quarter, and then the improved operational environment that's reflected through our shorter cycle times. And the key point here is that MCP, which is why it's more instructive, remains at historically high levels, both in aggregate and on a fully insured PMPM basis. And that indicates the continuity of our historical prudent reserving practices and our strong balance sheet. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Mark. And, Ryan, welcome to our call for the first time. It's great to have you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to come back to the Medicaid utilization comments, I think you were making in response to an earlier question. I'd love to expand a little bit on that. Could you comment perhaps on how much of the pressure is geographically isolated in some of your markets versus maybe more broad-based? I think you're speaking to also some utilization of care from people that were expecting to lose coverage. Would you be expecting that dynamic to slow a little bit as redeterminations end, or is that potentially offset by rejoiner dynamics or factors like that? Thank you. Mark Kaye : Thanks for the question and appreciate the opportunity to provide additional clarification here. Certainly, we expect the larger than typical pull-forward effect that we've seen in the second quarter to abate as the year goes on, principally because we're through the tail end of redeterminations at this point. We are obviously working with the states to ensure that the timing and rate mismatch is appropriately adjusted. On the member miscategorization, this is really ensuring that those members who are initially categorized, for example as TANF are put in the more appropriate and -- cohort for purposes of rates to think about ABD, for example. And then what we are really seeing elevate as the year goes on is the outpatient trains and elective procedures, and that's something that we fully accounted for in our MLR guide for the full year. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could drill a bit more into the $4.3 billion of timing items that impacted operating cash flow. And then just wanted to see whether you expect all those to reverse in the back half of the year and whether you're comfortable reaffirming your full year CFFO target of at least $8.1 billion and if not, where you expect operating cash flow to land for the year. Thanks. Mark Kaye : Appreciate the question this morning. Year to date, operating cash flow is $2.4 billion and to your point, that is a decrease of approximately $6 billion year-over-year. The key point here is that this includes $4.3 billion of timing-related items and approximately $1.3 billion of net cash outflows that are primarily associated with the runoff of our Medicaid reserves and the improvement in the operational environment, which is reflected by a short -- shorter cycle times. The timing-related item reflects a $3.6 billion impact from an additional month of premiums that we received from CMS in the year ago period, and so not a concern from our perspective. On a full year basis, we do expect operating cash flow outlook to be slightly north of $7 billion, and that really reflects the year-to-date reductions in working capital and specifically, as I mentioned a moment ago, that decrease in MCP driven by Medicaid membership attrition. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Sarah James from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Sarah James : Thank you. So in the prepared remarks, you guys mentioned a significant win with a Blue Cross Blue Shield partner. I was wondering if you can help us size your pipeline there and give us any clarity on how penetrated you are into that market. So how many of your Blues brethren do you currently have contracts with and what's the opportunity look like to expand this? Gail Boudreaux : Great. Thanks, Sarah. Pete? Pete Haytaian : Yes, Sarah, thanks a lot for the question. Appreciate it. And yeah, we're really pleased with how services growth is going. We mentioned 26% growth in the quarter and a clear path of achieving our long term objectives. So we feel very good about that. As it relates to your question, again, our focus is, as Gail said earlier, building capabilities internally and importing them externally, and we're seeing that play through. And your reference to Blues, I would say that we are currently engaged with most of the Blues, and our strategy with regard to that is really landing and expanding, to be quite frank. And this is a great example of that where we had an existing relationship with a client, we continue to grow those services with that particular Blue. They see the value in that. We were able to convert some of those capabilities to risk. And I'll remind you that, that is a very big part of our strategy, assumption of risk, both on a category of service basis as well as a full risk basis. And so, you'll see that continue to move forward. As it relates to the pipeline, this year, we're doing very well. '24 growth year-over-year is very, very strong. So you'll see really nice improvement from that perspective. And as you would expect, we're already selling into 2025. A real focus in 2025 on our behavioral health capabilities, our post-acute capabilities and then some of our Carelon Health businesses. So I appreciate the question, Sarah. Gail Boudreaux : Yeah. Thanks, Pete. Thanks for the question, Sarah. As you heard from Pete, it's an -- we have exciting opportunities to deepen our penetration because we do work with most of the Blues -- other Blues today and also other payers, quite frankly, and state partners has been a great opportunity for Carelon more broadly and you're seeing that come through. So thanks for the question. We're excited about the opportunity there. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Hey, good morning, guys. And I appreciate you taking the question. I guess, Mark, I was just going to ask if you could bridge a little bit when we think about the 2027 OP margin targets in the MCO segments. Kind of like how you think about the sources of the margin expansion there. And I'd be interested in particular if you would talk about what your expectations are around the exchange subsidies and the growth of the exchange business. Mark Kaye : Thank you very much for the question, George, and certainly happy to talk through the algorithm at a little bit of a high level. So you can think about this as being driven by upper single-digit growth in revenue, enterprise operating margin expansion to 6.5% to 7%, and then the balanced approach to capital deployment, inclusive of share repurchases and strategic M&A. On the revenue side, revenue growth is going to be driven by increased membership in the health benefits business, geographic expansion efforts, and then prudent pricing to cover cost trend. And then similarly in Carelon, key drivers are going to include the expansion of risk-based revenue in Carelon Services and the continued growth in CarelonRx membership. On the margin side, expansion is going to reflect the disciplined operating expense management and the transformation of some of our business processes, leveraging new technologies, including AI. And that coupled together with -- or at least the way I think about it, effective medical management and underwriting disciplines really going to enable us to achieve the enterprise operating margin target. And then finally, consistent with our 2023 Investor Day guidance, we do expect to achieve approximately a third of our adjusted diluted EPS growth rate through capital deployments. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Mark. And to your second part of the question around our exchange business, as you have heard us talk about, we have been, I think, very disciplined in our approach to expanding that business. We have had very strong results individually, up 30% -- 35% year-over-year with the ACA growing almost 40%. So as you think about that, our goal is to serve our members throughout their coverage transitions. We see a significant opportunity to continue that expansion, including geographic expansion, particularly for members that were historically in Medicaid and now need other coverage. So, again, a really nice opportunity. But you'll see that same sort of disciplined approach that we've shown throughout in the ACA. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Whit Mayo from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Whit Mayo : All right. Hey, thanks. Just quickly, on midyear renewals, just remind us how much of the commercial risk book renews in the second half of this year and just how you're thinking about retention, membership, ability to take the required price action that you need. And just as a clarification, is it fair that Commercial is performing better than expectations on margin with government, worse, at least in the first half? I just wanted to make sure I properly got this. Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : All right. Thank you. I'm going to have Morgan Kendrick, who leads our Commercial Business, address your questions. Morgan Kendrick : Yeah. Thanks for the question. As we think about it, that cohort of business that we renew in July is about 25% of the risk-based large group business. And to camp onto that, it performed as expected. In fact, we're seeing persistency up a bit. We talked about attrition in the large group risk business with our January cohort on the first quarter call, That's abated and we're seeing persistency improve, and we're seeing the margins coming through. So we feel really good about how we're positioned for continued growth and expansion in that business moving forward. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dave Windley : Thanks for taking my question. I believe you have a cost savings plan targeting around $750 million. That's maybe a relatively nearer term initiative. I'm wondering if you could describe your progress against that. And then also, should we think about the benefits of those savings dropping through? Or are you mostly reinvesting those savings in some of your growth initiatives? Thank you. Mark Kaye : Dave, good morning. Thanks very much for the question. In terms of the 2023 business optimization activity, we are on track to realize the gross run rate expense efficiency improvement of approximately $750 million that we committed to do. And that's going to benefit both our operating performance this year and it's going to help to establish the strong foundation for growth in 2025 and beyond. If I step back just for a moment, and we covered this a bit in our prepared remarks, we do anticipate significant improvement in our operating expense ratio in the second half of the year as we continue to take additional steps to enhance operational efficiency, and we'll begin to see and realize those incremental run rate improvements over time. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Mark. And Dave, I might maybe just spend a moment because I think it's a great opportunity to share a little bit about how we're going about this. We, first of all, have been very disciplined about our expense management. More importantly, we believe the opportunity around Generative AI for our business is expansive and it's going to materially impact all parts of our organization. We've been focusing on a couple of things, and I know I've spoken about this before, enhancing experiences while driving costs down, but also fueling future expansion. And I would say over the last few months we've really accelerated those internal efforts. And again, this has been a journey. So it's not new, but we are going to start seeing the absolute impact of the AI technology and digitization around our significant operational areas. And just a couple of things maybe to make this real as we transform. And there's kind of three areas around the engagement model that we think about members, providers and our own associates who are critical to this journey with us. On the member side, we look at each interactions of our members and we're using AI to make those much more unique and personalized and integrating it across our member touchpoints. Oftentimes there's disconnects in those touch points and that's a huge opportunity for us to take really personalized digital service and enrich that experience. And what does that do? I mean, the real impact you see it is improved access to care, better times processing, less error rates, reduction of our calls, use of chat. So those are some very tangible ways that we're deploying that and have been over the last year. And you're going to start seeing that come through based on what Mark just shared. The provider side is an area that I'm particularly excited about because we're looking at reimagining and streamlining all of our admin tax -- tasks rather on an end-to-end basis with the provider lifecycle. And that's a lot. But as you think about the impacts there, we touch not just providers but also members and some very specific things like automating the onboarding process of how they come into our plans, refining roster management specifically around data and how that drives downstream to claims, also enhancing contract administration. And we think those interactions are going to improve our member experiences, but also improve our relationship and our ability to work in value-based care with our care providers and more seamlessly. And then I'll end with associates because we know that they need to be part of this journey. It's also a cultural journey on AI that's going to drive, I think, greater efficiency. And we rolled out our spark, which is our internal ChatGPT tool to over 50,000 of our associates so that they can harness the capability, use it and improve their own productivity. And we're seeing really nice results from that. So again, I wanted to just share that because I think our expense, focus and efficiency is driven a lot by the impact we're going to see from that. And while we have a lot of opportunities, we're trying to look at the end-to-end impact of where we can take friction out of the system and fundamentally improve what we're doing. So hopefully that gives you a sense of how we're going about achieving the goals that we set, and we see huge opportunities going forward and embedded into our growth algorithm for the future. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Ann Hynes from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Ann Hynes : Hi, good morning. I just want to focus on Specialty. I know that Elevance is -- with your acquisitions, you're insourcing more specialty, not only on the dispensary side but also the distribution side. So I'm just curious about your strategy longer term. Do you think there's more opportunity for specialty on the distribution side? And if you think there is, is there any therapeutic area you're focused on? Thanks. Pete Haytaian : Thanks for the question, Ann. We think there's a tremendous opportunity as it relates to specialties. I said, earlier, our priority in the near term is the Elevance scripts, and absorbing the Elevance scripts effectively. And then also, as we talked about what we're doing with Kroger. We continue to see opportunities to cover more LDDs. And then in addition to that, as it relates to Whole Health, we are very focused on the patient experience. We are very focused on centers of excellence and how we can care for the members in a differentiated way by wrapping around additional assets. Longer term, again, we will be opportunistic, but right now, we have a lot in front of us and we want to execute against that effectively as it relates to specialty. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks, Pete. And Ann, I just want to highlight one point that Pete said, it's really an integration strategy. Specialty has a long runway for us, but the integration to our Carelon Services and what we do to deliver better value for our health plan members is really critical to our strategy. And I think that is unique, our ability to take both the Specialty pharmacy, but all the Specialty services around these disease categories we think is differentiating. So, thank you. Last question we're going to take now, please. Operator : For our final question, we'll go to the line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Ben Hendrix : Hi. Thank you very much. I just wanted a quick follow-up on Felicia's comments on MA bids for next year. I realize it's too early to talk about growth, but I think earlier in the year, you had talked about long term MA growth focused toward Carelon markets. And I just wanted to see if you could provide any color on how your bids contemplate your geographic footprint evolving and also your density towards Carelon markets in 2025. Thanks. Felicia Norwood : So, Ben, thank you for the question. We've always been very strategic around where we want to see our MA growth as we go forward. If you recall this past year, we made very deliberate decisions around markets that we wanted to exit because we wanted to make sure that we positioned ourselves to long term growth and performance. When we think about our strategy today, it's certainly in those areas where we have Medicare and Medicaid business, because the DSNP business is incredibly important for us. And if you think about where things are going long term, having alignment around Medicare and Medicaid is critical for us. But ultimately, it's absolutely about being able to deliver for the Carelon flywheel as well. The members that we are focused on, particularly in D-SNP and other SNP products, are very complex populations. And as we think about Whole Health, we've been working very collaboratively with Pete and the team to make sure that we are able to deliver Whole Health for those that we are very privileged to serve. So the footprint really is focused on density, certainly in our Blue markets, but being able to be focused on our Medicaid markets as well, in places where we see opportunities to grow strategically with Carelon in the future. And that's the pathway and framework that we've established when we think about the long term growth for our Medicare Advantage business which we continue to be incredibly excited about as we think about being a lifetime trusted partner for those we serve. So thank you for the question. Gail Boudreaux : So, thank you for your questions, everyone, and thank you for all of you for joining us today, for your interest and your support. We look forward to sharing more about our progress that we're making on our enterprise strategy with you in the coming quarters and are confident that the balance and resilience of our diverse set of businesses positions us well. Thank you for your interest in Elevance Health, and have a great rest of your week.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session where participants are encouraged to present a single question. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Company's management. Please go ahead. Steve Tanal : Good morning and welcome to Elevance Health's third quarter 2024 earnings call. This is Steve Tanal, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning on the earnings call are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; Mark Kaye, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of Carelon; Morgan Kendrick, President of our Commercial Health Benefits Business; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Health Benefits Business. Gail will begin the call with a brief discussion of the quarter and our revised outlook for the year and recent progress against our strategic initiatives. Mark will then discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, elevancehealth.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Elevance Health. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our earnings call. Today, we will review our third quarter financial results, discuss our outlook for 2024 and provide an update on the operating environment. During the call, we will also highlight fundamental drivers of long-term growth for Elevance Health, which remains strong. For the third quarter, adjusted diluted earnings per share were $8.37 which was below our expectations, primarily due to elevated medical costs in our Medicaid business. The impact on the third quarter and our full year outlook are being partially offset by focused medical management, the work we are doing with states to reflect the acuity of our members in rates and proactive actions we are taking to enhance operating efficiency, which will strengthen our business for the long term. We are navigating a challenging and dynamic operating environment and have reduced our full year outlook to prudently reflect these challenges. Given third quarter results and our expectation that timing disconnects between Medicaid rates and acuity currently facing the industry will continue. We have reduced our outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share to approximately $33. Importantly, we are not leveraging the future to achieve short-term gains. We are investing to position Elevance Health for strong growth over the long term. The issues impacting the Medicaid business are time-bound and our state partners are working constructively with us on rate renewals. We're confident that rates will ultimately reflect the underlying acuity of our members albeit on a lag as states often use data that is more than a year old in setting rates. These short-term headwinds are a byproduct of the large scale and unprecedented mix shifts associated with the end of the public health emergency. Over the long term, Medicaid managed care is an attractive business that is integral and complementary to our other Health Benefits and Carelon businesses and offers significant growth opportunities, notably serving specialized populations where we provide distinct value with our unique capabilities. Across our health benefits business, we are diligently executing on our growth strategy. Our Medicaid team is working tirelessly with our state partners, and we appreciate the collaboration. While the rate increases we've received are the highest in the past decade, they are still inadequate to cover 2024 cost trend that we now expect to be 3x to 5x historical averages. We're confident that rates will reflect the acuity of our members as enrollment continues to stabilize, and we're acting with urgency to deliver significant operational efficiencies and appropriately manage the cost of care. Partnering with states as they expand managed care to beneficiaries with chronic or complex conditions aligns well with our specialized whole health solutions and is an important part of our growth strategy. In partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina, we're pleased to be expanding our service to North Carolinians through the recent award of a sole source foster care contract covering nearly 60,000 new members. This marks the second sole source foster care win in 2024. In Medicare, we're taking deliberate steps to ensure the long-term sustainability of our business. We are now two days into the 2025 annual election period and are pleased with our positioning overall. We remain disciplined in our approach to 2025 bids, building on the actions we took to position our Medicare Advantage business for sustainable performance heading into 2024. For 2025, we took a balanced approach to margin and membership, prioritizing the benefits seniors value most to mitigate the impact of CMS' rate cuts on beneficiaries and promote access to high-quality, comprehensive and coordinated care for our members. Given the benefit reductions and meaningful market exits we made heading into 2024, we maintained greater stability in our offerings for 2025. And as a result, we expect to grow individual Medicare Advantage membership in line or slightly better than the broader market in 2025, led by products where we have strong, sustainable market position. Medicare Advantage Star quality ratings remain a key enterprise priority, and we're committed to our long-term goal of achieving and maintaining star ratings at the high end of all plans in our markets. For payment year 2026, we improved our own performance across nearly 60% of star measures and are pleased to be the only large payer to offer multiple five-star plans. Unfortunately, we will see the percentage of our members and plans rated four stars or higher decline due to significantly higher cut points. The entire decline in our four-star member mix was due to one of our larger age contracts narrowly missing a 4-star rating by 0.0004. We have challenged our initial scoring with CMS and are considering all of our options. Our commercial businesses are performing well and are on track to achieve their financial targets. We anticipate further growth in 2025 to be driven by increased penetration of our best-in-class products and services, given momentum in both of our individual exchange and national account businesses. For the largest employers, we offer differentiated value in innovative and attractive solutions and our focus on whole health in partnership with Carelon is resonating. In our individual exchange business, we're delivering particularly strong growth with membership up more than 30% year-to-date. As we look to 2025, we're expanding our individual and family ACA plans in three states : Florida, Maryland and Texas, under the WellPoint brand, which will complement our existing presence in these states while driving growth for our Health Benefits and Carelon segments. Focused geographic expansion enhances our ability to serve as a lifetime trusted health partner to consumers and our communities. Turning to Carelon. We're making significant progress in scaling our enterprise flywheel for growth. CarelonRx continues to expand its customer base while diversifying its value proposition. Earlier this month, we closed the acquisition of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, which is aligned with our strategy of controlling the levers that matter in delivering whole health affordably. Meanwhile, innovative solutions such as our SpecialtyRx Savings Navigator, weight management solutions and EnsureRx continue to gain traction and drive savings to clients. Growth in Carelon Services remains strong, and we are on track to exceed the upper end of our initial outlook for low 20s percentage revenue growth. This includes external growth above our initial targets for 2024, a proof point in first demonstrating our value proposition internally before driving growth externally. Carelon also recently entered into an agreement to acquire CareBridge, a value-based manager of home and community-based services for chronic and complex members that will serve as the foundation for Carelon\u2019s home health business, and we're excited to continue to serve all its customers and members. Carelon Services is expanding its capabilities to manage a growing proportion of health care spending, supporting the long-term growth of the business and by extension, the value it creates for health plan customers. Despite the challenges of the current environment, we're investing to position Elevance Health for sustained growth over the long term, including through the application of AI-driven solutions that are enhancing member and provider experiences, reducing costs and driving more efficient processes. We expect to realize operational and financial benefits in 2024 and greater impact in 2025 and beyond. For our members, we're integrating AI across touch points to provide personalized digital service, improve access to care and further increase satisfaction. We're also improving provider interactions and reducing costs by streamlining administrative tasks, automating onboarding and enhancing contract administration. And for our associates, we're investing in tools that increase productivity, reduce manual tasks and enhance efficiency across the organization. These are just a few of the AI applications we anticipate in the coming years as we focus on programs that can have the greatest impact guided by a mission to provide unmatched value to our members, providers and associates. In summary, our businesses remain fundamentally strong and we remain confident in the flywheel for long-term growth we're building with our complementary businesses. The issues impacting Medicaid are time bound, and we're acting with urgency to improve performance, and ensure adequate rates that reflect the acuity of our members. We are confident that we're making the right investments to position Elevance Health for strong and sustainable growth over the long term in service of consumers across all age and income levels and that we will emerge from this period of unprecedented change, stronger and even better positioned to serve the growing need for care management and cost containment in our health care system. Before closing, I would also like to thank our dedicated associates for their tireless commitment to our mission and for the work they do each and every day to deliver for all of our stakeholders. It is their dedication and passion for those that we're privileged to serve that is reflected in our ongoing recognition as a great place to work for the fifth consecutive year. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark Kaye, our CFO, to provide more details on our operating results and outlook. Mark? Mark Kaye : Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail has shared, we reported third quarter results, including GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.36 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $8.37 which came in below our expectations. We ended the third quarter with 45.8 million members, flat sequentially. Growth in commercial was largely offset by the loss of approximately 85,000 Medicaid members due to a specific footprint change that took effect at the beginning of September. Year-over-year, Commercial membership has grown by nearly 600,000 driven by strong fee-based and individual ACA health plan growth on the distinct value we deliver to large employers and the targeted local positioning of our product. Total operating revenue for the quarter was $44.7 billion, up over 5% year-over-year, reflecting strong reacceleration in growth from the low point last quarter. The consolidated benefit expense ratio was 89.5% for the third quarter, an increase of 270 basis points year-over-year, principally due to Medicaid cost trend developing worse than expected. While Medicaid rate increases will reach record levels this year, they remain inadequate to cover cost trend that is in the range of 3x to 5x historical averages. We are working closely with our state partners to ensure they fully capture the acuity of our Medicaid membership in future rates. During the quarter, we mitigated the impact through disciplined medical management and took further proactive actions to enhance operating efficiency across the enterprise. As a result, Elevance Health's adjusted operating expense ratio was 9.6%, an improvement of 150 basis points. Adjusted operating gains for the quarter was $2.4 billion and $8.3 billion for the year-to-date period, primarily reflecting declines in our Medicaid business. We maintained a consistent and prudent posture with respect to reserves. Days in claims payable at the end of the third quarter stood at 42.8 days which remains slightly above our targeted range in the low 40s. Given third quarter results and our expectation that cost trend in our Medicaid business will remain elevated through at least the fourth quarter, we have reduced our full year outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share to approximately $33. We now expect our 2024 benefit expense ratio will be more than 100 basis points higher than we anticipated last quarter, bringing the full year to approximately 88.5%. Full year operating cash flow is now expected to be approximately $4.5 billion. It's important to keep in mind that the issues impacting the Medicaid managed care industry are time bound, and we are confident that rates will ultimately reflect the underlying acuity of our Medicaid membership. It's also notable that in 2024, businesses representing more than half of our revenues will be operating at margins below the long-run potential. We expect margins will return to appropriate and sustainable levels over time. Turning to 2025. We expect continued momentum in our commercial business, bolstered by the expansion of exchange offerings into three new states, in the alignment of our value proposition in national and large group markets. We will deliver balanced growth in our Medicare Advantage business and stability in Medicaid as redeterminations return to a normal cadence. And we will further scale Carelon, our enterprise flywheel for growth with notable contributions from the expansion of specialty pharmacy dispensing capabilities in CarelonRx and continued momentum in Carelon Services as we drive greater product adoption internally and externally and build out our home and community-based business. Finally, we are undertaking bold actions to modernize and transform many of our core processes through the application of new technologies that will create structural efficiencies and long-term value. There is much to be excited about in 2025, and we expect strong acceleration in revenue growth, at least in line with our long-term growth algorithm in the high single-digit percent range. While we are confident that the issues impacting the Medicaid managed care industry are time bound, at this point in time, our outlook for 2025 adjusted EPS growth is at least in the mid-single-digit percent range. This reflects our assumption that the timing disconnect between Medicaid rates and acuity will continue. We will navigate this backdrop with the same focus and discipline that has been central to the long-term success of Elevance Health. Importantly, the earnings power of our diverse and complementary businesses remain strong, and we are confident in our ability to deliver at least 12% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share annually on average over time. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. For our first question, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: So, in the slide deck, you're reiterating your expectation of 12% earnings growth from 22% to 27%. Which of that 22% base would suggest you get something like $51.27? But you're also saying off of the new base this year, you'll grow 5% next year which would give you something like 34%, 65% something in the high 34s. I guess the question is -- and it sounds like all of the short-term issues are around Medicaid is getting the right rates going to be sufficient to get you the kind of accelerated earnings growth in '26 and '27 that would get you back on track to hit that multiyear 12% CAGR target? Or should we rebase that given what we're looking at in '24 and '25? Gail Boudreaux : Thank you for the question, A.J. Let me provide a little bit of high-level perspective around that because I think there's -- you have a lot of math in that question, but I think it's important certainly appreciate the dynamic environment that we're currently operating in. I think to really start that, first, we believe that the earnings power of our diverse and complementary businesses remained strong. So, feel good about thinking about at least 12% over the long term and an adjusted EPS of time. So, I think that's important. As you heard, and we're thinking about what's happening in our business right now, I'd like to sort of reiterate some of the things that Mark shared in his opening comments. First, strong acceleration in revenue growth, at least in line with our long-term algorithm in the high single-digit percentage. So, there's a lot I think to be excited about in our business, momentum in our commercial business going strong. We're entering several additional expanded ACA footprint next year. We feel good about the Medicare Advantage business, which we focus to be sustainable long-term growth. And Carelon is going to deliver even greater value as we look at the internal and external growth we're seeing in services and the robust pipeline in CarelonRx. And then, the last piece of that is continuing to realize substantial operational efficiencies. However, given the dynamics that we spoke about in the environment that we're in, we anticipate that Medicaid margins in '25 are going to remain belong our long-term target. But again, this is a timing disconnect between rates and acuity, which we do believe is time bound, but think that can persist through 2025. And also, it's really important that we are going to continue to make ongoing investments in '25 because we think that there's a powerful opportunity across our business. So taken together, we think that we're being prudent in how we think about '25 and our expectations at this pace and timing and that our guidance will give you a lot more detail in the fourth quarter. But I think you can rest assure, we're going to continue to navigate '25 with the same focus and discipline that has been central to our long-term success. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Just wanted to come back to the Medicaid discussion. Obviously, the magnitude of the revision that's implied there is alarming, particularly given that we're at the end of the membership impacts from redetermination. Just trying to understand better how things got so much worse so quickly. I guess how much of this is actually new to the third quarter versus not having a good reading on where things were last quarter? And to the extent there are new developments in the third quarter, can you better help us understand perhaps what some of those are? Gail Boudreaux : Let me ask Mark Kaye, our CFO, to address your question. Thank you. Mark Kaye : Stephen, good morning. Let me start off by noting that we experienced accelerated cost trends in Medicaid throughout the third quarter. And additionally, we saw unfavorable prior period development related to the current year specifically in our Medicaid business. If I step back for a moment, the Medicaid cost trends accelerated in the quarter, they restated negatively for the current year. And as such, we're tracking in the range of around 3.5x -- 3x to 5x the historical average depending on the state. The elevated level of cost trend is driven -- and you heard us just in our prepared remarks, primarily by the higher overall membership acuity given the redetermination cycle is now substantially complete. And we are continuing to work with the states. We very much appreciate the collaboration. And while rate increases to-date have also been higher than the historical average they remain insufficient to fully cover the claims trends that we're seeing. And so, it's important to keep in mind that the state processes themselves typically rely on reference periods that lag current experience by as much as one to two years and while we are sharing more recent experience and trend information real time with the states, it's going to take time before that's fully reflected in their rate schedule. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Ben Hendrix : I just wanted to kind of drill in a little bit more on the pacing of the cash up of rates to acuity that you may expect over the coming year, probably you don't have perfect visibility into it, but are there any pockets, something Mark mentioned, the big bolus of members that kind of came off recently. Just -- are there any pockets of areas where you see a large bolus of members come off, acuity increase and then have a state renegotiation that could be kind of a catalyst for creating some accelerated recovery? Or how do you think about pacing of the recovery throughout next year? Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks for the question, Ben. I'll ask Mark to comment on this as well. But I remember, this is one of the largest and unprecedented mix shifts. We've seen in Medicaid as the PHE has unwound over the course of the year. And again, as Mark said, what we saw was this acceleration through the third quarter. So, I think putting that in perspective is really important. We have not had an environment like this before in Medicaid. So, it's a very unusual time frame for us. But let me have Mark give a little bit more color on that. Mark Kaye : And then, I think the only thing I'll add to Gail's remarks is that as we think about 2025, we do expect that mismatch between rates and acuity to narrow. Especially as the state rate updates increasingly reflect the underlying member acuity. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Ann Hynes from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Ann Hynes : Can you just give us a little bit more detail on the utilization trends like what is increasing more than your expectations? Is it inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy? Any color you could provide would be helpful. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks. I'll have Mark address that, please. Mark Kaye : Maybe let me take this briefly from two perspectives. I'll do a little bit of Medicare then I'll do a Medicaid. So, Medicare in the quarter was slightly elevated. It was manageable overall reflected some incremental pressure related to the two-midnight rule. We also saw a late summer surge in COVID. On Medicaid, as I spoke about trends a minute ago, we are seeing some ongoing pockets of elevated trend. They're most notable in the behavioral health area. Overall that we do expect margins to continue to remain pressured through the rest of the year. And certainly, for those two businesses will remain below our long-term average in 2025. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks. And again, our results were predominantly driven by Medicaid. And as Mark said, we did see some slight pressure in Medicare, but feel very comfortable about where we positioned our bids for 2025. So, thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Andrew Mok from Barclays. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : This is Tiffany on for Andrew. It looks like the 200 basis points of 3Q enterprise MLR miss like translates to about 500 basis points of Medicaid pressure in the quarter. One, is that the right ballpark to think about? And two like just given the apparent like 100s of basis points of incremental pressure, is the Medicaid book profitable today? Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. I'll ask Mark to respond to that as well. Mark Kaye : Thank you very much for the question. The ballpark is about right for 2024. And as I think about the Medicaid business, it is expected to be profitable this year albeit below our target margin range for the year itself. It's important to note that you really can't look at the Medicaid marginal business in any particular single quarter. There are normal quarter-to-quarter dynamics of the business. But importantly, over the long term and we do expect the Medicaid managed care business to be a profitable and an attractive one for us and it's integral and it is complementary to either Health Benefits and Carelon businesses. Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for that, Mark. And again, I just want to reiterate that we do believe this is time bound, and we also believe that Medicaid is a very good business, particularly the specialized populations where we have unique capabilities. But again, thank you for the question. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Erin Wright from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Erin Wilson : And I wanted to ask on Medicare Advantage. Just based on the analysis of sort of the MA landscape now and the latest kind of benefit design details. Is there -- is the competitive environment playing out as you would expect in terms of being fairly rational with a focus on kind of profit versus growth? Is it playing out according to plan there and driving some of that assumption in terms of your at or above market growth in MA next year? Gail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, Erin. First, I think it's really important to realize -- we feel well positioned in MA and we took a number of actions, prudent actions last year at the beginning of the year to position the business for long term. Importantly, we had a number of market exits of markets where we didn't think we saw long-term sustainability. And this year, we continue to look for stability and make sure that we are in this business for the long term. So, I'm going to ask Felicia to comment now that we're a few days into AEP and give you a perspective of our thoughts on the market. Felicia Norwood : Thank you, Gail, and thank you, Erin, for the question. Our strategy, as we look at Medicare Advantage, really didn't start this year around our approach to balancing membership and margins. We started last year to real take strategic actions in order to create a sustainable foundation for growth in our Medicare Advantage business, and that included exiting several underperforming markets, and that represented about 85,000 members. In addition to that, we made significant reductions in our supplemental benefits in Puerto Rico on the heel of some losses in 2023. So, as we put together our bid for 2025, we started the work with the foundation and wanted to make sure that we maintain stability where we need it to, but we want to be very focused on a balance between growth and margin, particularly in attractive and sustainable products and performance for us as we went forward. Specifically, we focus very much on our D-SNP business in our high-priority markets, where we have the assets and the cost structure to really support leading market share. Additionally, I want to note that our products are predominantly HMO, not PPO, and we were very prudent in our positioning, overlaying our local market dynamics and consumer preferences with our own market prioritization framework. So, when we look at where we are now only two days into AEP, we feel very good about how we're positioned in terms of our key products and our target market. We prudently navigated the environment and as we sit here today, as you said, we really expect to grow in line or slightly better than the market. But competitively, still, we're very positioned well as we head into this AEP. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : I wanted to follow up on your comments around Medicaid trend accelerating through the quarter and being 3x to 5x typical. To your point, I don't think anyone on this call has ever heard of trend being discussed in terms of multiples of typical. And given it got worse through the quarter, just curious if you could give us some color on what's going on through the quarter? Is it that you're seeing people come back on the roles that are sicker given the redeterminations themselves should have been, give or take, run out at this point? And then given it looks like the exit rate in the quarter is the lowest margin, the highest cost, it sounds like. Can you tell us where you were ending the quarter and where you expect to be for the fourth quarter versus that 3% to 4% margin target that we all think about? Gail Boudreaux : Justin, thanks for the question. Just a couple of thoughts, and I'll ask Mark to provide a little bit more perspective. Remember, again, this was the most significant change we've seen in membership in Medicaid probably as long as I've been in this business, coming off of the PHE. And again, the driver was this acceleration that we saw through the third quarter. And we did plan for accelerated acuity in our business, which I think is important. But again, none of us when you're planning for 3x to 5x the cost structure. We've been working very diligently with our state partners in terms of understanding those rates and where we need to be. And again, they are looking at data oftentimes a year in arrears and have been responsive to changing their process, but it has not kept pace yet, and we think it will take them some time. With that, let me ask Mark to give a little bit more perspective on some of the other questions that you had embedded. Mark Kaye : Yes. Justin, just to add additional color here as you heard from Gail, we definitely planned for an elevated level of trend in 2024 relative to the historic average Medicaid trend, which has run in the low single-digit percent range. And to the point we made earlier, that trend is now running around 3x to 5x historic average levels, of course, depending on the states and meaningfully above our expectations. And that's really driven by this unprecedented redetermination related activity which has resulted in several downstream changes in membership mix, membership count, acuity program adjustments, et cetera. I'd also like just to reiterate sort of that long-term target for Medicaid is in that 2% to 4% range. Gail Boudreaux : And finally, Justin, to your point, we've also not been standing still. Obviously, we've been very active in managing the things that we can control around cost structure and acceleration of initiatives that we had in place around AI and making our business sustainable for the long term. And again, very active with our state partners, proud of our teams for the work that they've done to bring this forward. But again, we do think this will take time to work with our state partners to get the match at the appropriate level. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Gail, one of your peers talked about accelerating Rx trends in specialty. We've seen changes to IRA around catastrophic coverage. The one you haven't called out anything around Rx as far as cost trend goes. Are you seeing that how did you price for that going into 2025? And then just on the flip side, CarelonRx had very strong results. Is that a key driver of what we're seeing, especially on the specialty side and growth in specialty? Gail Boudreaux : So, thanks for the question, Lisa. Let me go a little perspective directly on your question. I'll ask Pete Haytaian, who leads our pharmacy business to provide some more context. So year-to-date, we have seen an increase in Medicare Advantage Part D specialty drug utilization. But the trends in unit costs have been in line with our assumptions. So, we don't see it as a significant impact to what we've been talking about. Let me ask Pete to give you a little more perspective about what's happening in terms of overall pharmacy. Pete Haytaian : Yes. Thanks, Lisa, for the question. As you said, we're very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of our CarelonRx strategy and growth. We continue down our path of in-sourcing the strategic levers that matter down our path of specialty pharmacy and infusion. We're making really good progress there. And as it relates to growth, our story is resonating in the marketplace. We're beginning to see a lot of pull-through in that regard. And we've had some nice wins going into 2025 upmarket as well. So that is all proceeding as planned. In terms of our overall performance from an operating margin perspective, though, as Gail said, we did expect what we saw in the specialty pharmacy trends. We did see that increase, but it was really as expected. When you look at our overall margins, the outperformance in the quarter was largely due to a onetime favorable revenue adjustment that was in for year. And when you even that out or spread that out through the year, the full year still remains on track in terms of our initial guidance around the 6%, 6.5% margin profile. So, we feel overall very good about where we are and where we are where we expected to be. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Lance Wilke : Yes. Just a quick follow-up on the rate outlook for Medicaid. If you could just give some color on what you observed as far as rate increases maybe historically or in the first half of the year? And then what you're seeing in the second half of the year and what your outlook is based on how far you are along in early '25? And then the broader question was just are you anticipating making any strategic moves as a result of these pressures that again are time bounded? And as part of that, does this make any change in how you might in-source all of the functions of your PBM? Gail Boudreaux : So, a lot of questions here, Lance. Thank you. Let me just address your question on strategic, then I'll ask Felicia specifically talk about Medicaid. We feel we've laid out a very comprehensive strategy around the growth drivers. And the opportunities, as I shared in the first question, really how we see acceleration in revenue and strong commercial business. We believe the time-bound issues around Medicaid, and we think we will work through those with the assets we have and then Medicare being well positioned. And Carelon is a real accelerator for us. And as you saw we announced an additional acquisition this morning as part of CareBridge that gives us home-based care and another pillar inside of our growth strategy for Carelon Services where we can take significantly more pass-through of the type of medical expense, we're managing inside of Carelon. So, I would say we're very focused on the long-term growth drivers in our flywheel for growth inside of Elevance Health and feel very positive about the fundamentals of our business. So strategically, I think we're moving forward in the exact same path that we've laid out. And in the pharmacy side, taking more control of the levers that matter for us, and you've continued to see us integrate the Kroger Specialty Pharmacy acquisition, our advanced home delivery. So, feel very good about that progress, and we're dealing with the time-based issues in Medicaid right now. But let me ask Felicia to address the Medicaid specifically. Felicia Norwood : So, Lance, thanks for the question. As you can imagine, the rate negotiations with our state partners are ongoing. And when you take a look at how our portfolio of business is spread out across the year, we have about half of our states that a January state and the other half that are July state than in the back half of the year. The work that we started with our states, certainly around the July states and rates certainly took a look at the '25 rates that they were working with us on. But we also put a lot of work into work with our states on understanding the trends that we're seeing in the first half of the year. As you heard earlier, the reference period for most of our states are 2023 when you think about the 25 rate setting process. So, there will certainly see that misalignment and that timing mismatch as we talk about. When we look at the work that we're seeing with our state partners, some states have certainly been more receptive to going back and taking a look at those and addressing those rates now. We've had certain states that have given us midyear rate adjustments and more of those will happen as we go through the back half of the year and early next year as well. But as you heard earlier, this is a process which you clearly understand that will take some time to actually get total alignment between our rates and the acuity of the membership that we're seeing on the heels of an unprecedented change in mix with respect to this business. But I will tell you, we are going to continue our strong advocacy working with our state partners, sharing up-to-date information around the changes that we're seeing, and we have full confidence that we will ultimately have rates that are aligned with the acuity of the membership in our population. So, thank you for the question. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Sorry to stay on the topic, but I'm still struggling with why the acuity rate mismatches accelerating now why this cost trend is accelerating now. My understanding is that most of the redeterminations have been done, right, that started over a year ago. So, it felt like there was less redetermination activity in the most recent quarter than previously. And I think -- last quarter, there was this conversation around higher utilization from members that were about to lose coverage. And so, you would have expected that to slow. So, I guess I'm still confused as to what's causing this big acceleration in this trend. Why is that happening so late in the process? Mark Kaye : Josh, thanks very much for the question. Two key points I'd like you to keep in mind here. First, we've modeled a prudent view of costs for the fourth quarter. And you could think about that as us holding Medicaid trend approximately flat relative to where we were in September. And the second key point to keep in mind here is that we had unfavorable development related to the current year in the quarter. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Michael Hall from Baird. Please go ahead. Michael Hall : Just to add on Medicaid topic. So based on your '24 guide, if I'm not mistaken implied 4Q impact actually seems to be larger than your third quarter MR pressure. So, it sounds like it's the case, but -- is this basically assuming the acuity rate mismatch worsened in the next quarter, even though you have all your September, October rate increases? And at this point, I guess, in mid-October, do you think you now have enough data and visibility into your own acuity mix that you can pass along to these states in time for Jan 1 renewals? Or just -- I presume draft rates are pretty already there? So, could they open that back up and adjust? Or is it too late? Gail Boudreaux : Yes. A couple of things, just a high level one. You also have to factor in seasonality into the fourth quarter. So make sure you're doing that, and I'll ask Felicia to talk a bit about Medicaid and the process that just goes on a rate setting. Felicia Norwood : Yes. So thank you so much for the question again. At this point, we have about 55% of our rate visibility for premium for January. However, those are draft rates. So, we spend a lot of time with our states right now, making sure that they understand the experience that we were seeing in the second and third quarters as we head into the rate setting process. So yes, when we have draft rates, the process is still iterative and ongoing and we are continuing to make sure that the states have visibility around that information. So, we have 55%, as I said, visibility into the January renewals, but those are early discussions, Michael, and expect a lot of work to happen between now and the end of the year in terms of the work between us and our state partners. Mark Kaye : And maybe one comment just to add on to Felicia's remarks. Just to reaffirm, Medicaid trend is not expected to accelerate in the fourth quarter. It's primarily seasonality that's resulting in these numbers. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Ryan Langston from Cowen. Please go ahead. Ryan Langston : It sounds like you expect on the exchange side into 2025. So, I guess in that context, how should we think about the margin profile for maybe just the exchanges in the overall commercial business. I think you can [indiscernible] you're running this year? Gail Boudreaux : Thank you very much for the question. We'll have Morgan Kendrick, who leads our commercial business to respond to that. Morgan Kendrick : Ryan, thank you for the question. We feel really good about our commercial business in aggregate. And certainly, the individual ACA is a big, big piece of that. We've taken a very disciplined approach over the last 36 months in gradually expanding our footprint and our competitiveness in our 14 geographies. As Gail mentioned in the prepared remarks upfront, we're expanding that in other markets. So, this year, we're expecting to have nice growth in our markets, probably improving share in the markets that we serve by about 2 points moving forward. That said, when I think about next year, we're positioned really well in the geographies where we've already served. We're in the process of sort of determining the positioning in the markets that we're moving into but are really excited about that business and it also being in line with our expectations on the economics. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. And just another thing to remember, those are states where we also have Medicaid and Medicare business. So, it aligns with us knowing those states well. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Just a sort of if you can maybe dimension for us and discuss some of the downstream impacts from the Medicaid environment to the Carelon Health businesses, you know that there's quite a bit of leverage or exposure in those businesses to Medicaid. So curious on how those businesses are performing and how you're positioning them around some of these dynamics we're seeing in Medicaid? Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks for the questions. I'll ask Pete to address your questions. Pete Haytaian : Yes, Scott. No, I think it's a great question. I appreciate it. First, just stepping back and thinking about Carelon overall. And as you heard in the prepared remarks, overall, very pleased with the growth trajectory of Carelon Services, exceeding 30% growth in the quarter. Quarter year-over-year, not on a path to exceed initial guidance of the high teens to low 20s. So, we feel very good about that. And as it relates to growing internally and externally, I'll say that we're continuing down the path that we've been in with regard to proving out our solutions internally and then growing externally. I did want to point out that -- and as Gail mentioned in the prepared remarks, seeing really nice traction externally. I'd say 4x improvement in terms of growth in 2024 and good visibility on 2025. As it relates to your question specifically, yes, we do have products oriented to Medicaid, Medicare, we are taking full risk. And as it relates to our performance overall, we are seeing some of those behavioral health trends play through. So, when you look at the margin profile in the short term, we are being impacted by the behavioral health trends. We are also being impacted by the acceleration in some of the risk arrangements that we're deploying. And as you recall, I think I've said it in the past, early on when we launched these risk arrangements, the margin profile is a bit more compressed and then as it evolves, it improves. So, the combination of those two factors is what's been affecting us in the short term. We feel very good about the long term and continuing to grow within the government program business as well as in the commercial business. We are pursuing a diversified approach just like the rest of Elevance Health. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Whit Mayo from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Whit Mayo : I just wanted to go back and follow up. I think it was Justin's question, not sure I actually heard the answer. Are the rejoiners coming back negatively impacting cost trends, like are they increasingly gaining access through the point of care through presumptive eligibility in the hospital or something like what does the actual care activity look like on the rejoiner population? Mark Kaye : It's Mark here. Thank you very much for the follow-up here. There are a number of trend factors that are remaining to various degrees. And certainly, some have improved over the past quarters, think about like the pull forward effect to think about member mischaracterization and certainly some that are ongoing. What\u2019s really important here is that the state actuarial rate process and our ongoing discussions with them really aim to capture the overall cost of the members in ensuring the adequacy operates over time. On your question specifically, you could think about a portion of trained is being attributed primarily to the acuity mix shift versus -- I think we spoke about last quarter, so that same-store type trade utilization. And you could think about approximately 60% of the trend as being related to acuity mix. And the key point, as I'm going to sort of end here is that our embedded Medicaid outlook really does include prudent assumptions for cost trend in the fourth quarter, inclusive of all the underlying factors. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Sarah James from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Sarah James : Mark, when you said Medicaid is profitable in '24, is that across all states? Or is it a mix of some profitable and some not? And then, can you just help us understand the actuarial soundness protection? Is that a two-year or a three-year period because we look at '24 and '25 as below target margins. But I think '23 was a good year for you guys on Medicaid. Does that still give you a position to pursue retroactive rate increases on top of the midyear rate updates you're targeting? Mark Kaye : Sarah, thank you very much for the question here. I'm not going to talk about states specifically. But simply just to note, Medicaid margins on the whole are expected to compress significantly this year. And we started out this extensively. This is the industry-wide timing disconnect between rates and acuity. Our long-term expectations are unchanged. And that's because we are continuing to proactively collaborate with our state partners on integrating acuity into the rates that we're seeing. We know that's going to take time based on the state processes, the collection of data et cetera. And so, we're very confident that over time, rates will certainly appropriately on an actuarial and otherwise basis reflect the underlying acuity that we're experiencing. And so, I would certainly say that we are confident in our long-term targets that we have set out and we're committed to achieving them. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. And just reiterating, I think we do believe Medicaid is a long-term very good business for us. It's complementary to our other health benefits business and particularly around other specific populations that we think we have very unique skills to serve those. So again, thank you very much for your questions. We see Medicaid as a long term in this being an industry time-bound issue. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dave Windley : I wanted to try to understand, respectively, the comments about kind of the cadence of rate recovery or achievement in caid and Medicaid, and then the confidence in MA bids for Medicare and with the question being in your mid-single-digit EPS growth for next year. Do you expect margins in caid and care, respectively, to be up, flat or down? Gail Boudreaux : So, thank you very much for the question. Let me ask Mark, first to address your questions on margins. And then obviously, at this pace, we'll give you some directional commentary because it's still early in the year for '25 but we'll give you at least a sense of how we're thinking, Mark. Mark Kaye : Overall, we expect for 2025 margins to continue to remain strong in commercial. Let me start there. On the Medicaid side, here, margins will remain below our long-term margin range and that's really predominantly related to the timing match that we've spoken about. You could think about them as effectively being stable year-over-year. And then on Medicare, because of the sustainability around our 2025 product positioning, we actually expect margins to improve in 2025 compared to 2024. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Joanna Gajuk from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Joanna Gajuk : So just last question, I guess, on this Medicaid commentary, and I guess the margin commentary you just made in terms of margins being stable to be in next year. Is that, I guess, confirmation that you assume that by the end of '25, the Medicaid rate mismatch will be fully restored? Is that the way to read by the end of the year, it's going to be restored? Mark Kaye : Thanks for the question. Let me actually step back for a second and think about MLR guidance for 2025, and we're not looking to provide that necessarily today, but let me share a few modeling considerations that might help you. First, again, with respect to the third quarter, we had some out-of-period items, including unfavorable into your development for the Medicaid business, and we do not expect that to repeat. As we progress towards and through 2025, you could think about that as a first half, second half story, where we expect the rate versus acuity mismatching Medicaid to narrow as the year progresses and as rates continue to improve. It's also important when you think about the modeling for the business to remember that January 1 is a major renewal base in our commercial business, right? And that marks the beginning of an end, we also marked the beginning of a new plan year for Medicare. So, we're remaining intensely focused on the appropriate medical management, and that's going to continue through 2025. I would say otherwise, it's too early to provide specific individual line of business guidance as we head into next year. Gail Boudreaux : Right. And thanks, Mark. And just to reiterate that, we're taking a prudent view of the timing on the mismatch in Medicaid and want to be respectful of the safe process and the work we're doing, we feel that it has been a very good process with the states. But again, they have to get their data from prior periods. And so, we're trying to update them on what we're seeing. So again, it's early in the timing, but we wanted to give some our confidence in the long term of our business and the fundamentals. But again, I want to take a prudent view of what's happening in Medicaid, particularly on the state rate. We'll have one more question, please. Operator : And for a final question, we'll go to the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : And just kind of a couple of quick follow-ups here on the Medicaid again. I guess number one, Mark, could you provide more color on what drove the PYD in the quarter? And then I guess from a state concentration perspective is kind of -- is the discrepancy between rates and acuity broad-based? Or is -- are there state concentrations here that we should be concerned about, like that could speed the resolution of the issue? Gail Boudreaux : So, in terms of your overall question, clearly, we manage a portfolio of states, and we don't get into specific states. But every state is a little bit different based on the population we serve and the programs that are in place. So, I wouldn't make it generalized across all states. I know that we are working very diligently with each of the states to make sure -- and again, this is industry-wide, not just unique to Elevance Health, and we see this across everything. So, thank you very much for the question. And now we'll turn, I think, to, first of all, say thank you, operator, and thank you for all the interest and support of everyone who has been on the line. I just want to reiterate, we're confident that we're making the right investments position Elevance Health for strong and sustainable growth over the long term and that we are confident we're going to emerge from this period of unprecedented to change even stronger. Thank you, everyone, for your interest in Elevance Health, and thank you for joining us on this call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, where participants are encouraged to present a single question. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : Good morning, and welcome to Elevance Health's fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. My name is Nathan Rich, Vice President of Investor Relations. With us this morning on the earnings call are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; Mark Kaye, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of Carelon; Morgan Kendrick, President of our Commercial Health Benefits Business; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Health Benefits Business. Gail will begin the call with a review of the progress we've made against our strategic initiatives and a discussion of the quarter and our 2025 outlook. Mark will then discuss our financial results and guidance in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, elevancehealth.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Elevance Health. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Nate, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to extend our deepest sympathies to the millions of people affected by the Southern California wildfires. With over 9 million members and over 6,000 Elevance Health associates in the State of California, we are especially grateful to the first responders who are working tirelessly to support the ongoing recovery efforts. At Elevance Health, our teams quickly mobilized to facilitate access to essential health resources and provide much needed aid to the communities impacted by this devastating event. This moment underscores our shared humanity, reminding us that above all, we are a community dedicated to supporting people's health and well-being. Our purpose as a company of improving the health of humanity remains absolute and we will demonstrate steadfast leadership in health care marked by compassion, dedication and a profound commitment to improving the lives of the people we serve. For our members, we play a critical role in ensuring simple, affordable and accessible care. We recognize that the health care ecosystem is grappling with significant challenges, including rising costs, administrative complexity and disparities in access to care. These issues are compounded by evolving consumer expectations and the need for a more integrated approach to physical, behavioral and social health. In collaboration with our partners across the industry, we're addressing these challenges with great urgency, focusing on streamlining processes, reducing costs and improving the overall experience for our members. We are reimagining how we connect with consumers to personalize experiences, tailor recommendations to meet their specific needs and simplify the health care journey. Targeted digital interactions through our Sydney app closed critical gaps in care and saved members an estimated 1.5 million hours in 2024, time they would have otherwise spent trying to find the care they needed. Health insurers play a vital role in keeping health care affordable by ensuring our members have access to high quality care at reasonable costs, and designing benefit structures that encourage preventative care and early intervention. Through the value based partnerships we have with care providers, we reduced inefficiencies, drive better health outcomes, and lower overall cost for members. In our Medicare Advantage portfolio for 2025, 90% of our plans have no monthly premium and nearly all plans offer $0 co-pays for primary care visits and access to supplemental benefits. These innovative plan designs demonstrate how we align affordability with improved member health. Our data demonstrates that duly eligible members who utilize supplemental benefits are 40% more likely to access preventative services and nearly 15% less likely to have an inpatient admission. Solutions like our Total Health, Total You advocacy program enable personalized outreach through digital channels and address whole person care before complex health needs arise. Employers recognize the value this program brings, reflected in a Net Promoter Score of 82. For our care providers, we create a real impact on health by going beyond the contract, and we strive to be an active partner in the care of our members. Our value-based programs account for nearly two-thirds of care today, with over 35% taking downside risk compared to less than 20% just three years ago. Over the past year, we broadened our capabilities through the launch of Mosaic Health in partnership with CD&R. Mosaic Health serves nearly 1 million consumers across 19 states and provides the foundation for us to expand our advanced primary care and physician enablement solutions to serve a growing number of people in the years to come. We have invested significant resources in partnering with hospitals and physicians to provide real-time insights and tools that ease administrative burdens and allow care providers to devote more time to caring for patients. In cases where we have aligned data sharing with the health system, we have nearly eliminated claims denied due to incorrect or incomplete information, significantly easing the administrative burden for these systems. We are making good progress in expanding the solution to more partners. When health plans and care providers have access to the same information, we make the same decision. We are working in concert with our many vital partners across the health care ecosystem to promote solutions that enhance outcomes and empower healthier communities. With this unified voice, we can more effectively advocate for holistic solutions that address the physical, behavioral and social drivers of health. We are on a promising path and will work tirelessly in the coming years to achieve our bold purpose to improve the health of humanity. Now turning to our results. Today, we reported fourth quarter GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.81 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.84, consistent with the expectations we shared back in October. These results reflect the immediate actions we took in response to unprecedented cost trends in our Medicaid business. Our Medicaid business serves as a cornerstone in advancing health outcomes for individuals managing chronic and complex conditions. Our complex care management programs provide the support of a dedicated care team and digital resources that have led to a reduction in inpatient emissions by 7%. We are uniquely equipped to drive better health outcomes through complementary capabilities of our integrated Health Benefits and Carelon platforms. Fourth quarter Medicaid cost trend remained elevated at levels aligned to the outlook we provided last quarter. We are grateful for the continuous and constructive collaboration of our state partners. While rates today remain insufficient to cover the elevated level of cost trend we are experiencing, we remain confident that rates will ultimately reflect the underlying acuity of our Medicaid membership over time. In Medicare, benefit reductions and market exits in 2024 create a strong foundation for profitable growth. During annual open enrollment this year, seniors value the stability in our benefit offerings, evidenced by improved retention. We anticipate Medicare Advantage membership growth in the range of 7% to 9%, consistent with our prior expectations and inclusive of new wins in group MA. We remain confident in our ability to balance growth and margin performance in 2025. We are pleased with the performance of our commercial businesses in 2024. Our integrated medical and pharmacy offering is resonating in the market. We welcomed 18 new national accounts who chose Elevance Health for 2025, including several who selected us as the sole source provider to manage their medical and pharmacy benefits, continuing a trend we have seen in the last few years. We also saw record retention in our national accounts business for 2025, a testament to the differentiated value we provide, the market's largest and most sophisticated clients who value simplicity and affordability. Our individual exchange business experienced strong growth of more than 30% in 2024. We delivered innovative, affordable products that resonated with consumers. And as we enter 2025, we anticipate another year of strong growth in this market. Turning to Carelon. In 2024, we made progress against our strategy to further scale our enterprise flywheel for growth. In the fourth quarter, we closed on the acquisition of CareBridge, which will bolster our home and community based services for chronic and complex members and serve as a foundation for Carelon\u2019s home health business. CareBridge's innovative approach aligns well with our enterprise focus on whole health, utilizing technology and comprehensive clinical support to improve care quality and efficiency, while enhancing patient outcomes and independence. The expanding breadth and diversity of our pharmacy, advanced primary care, and home and community based solutions will serve members and drive greater alignment with our health plans. Carelon Services experienced impressive internal and external growth in 2024, and we are positioned for revenue growth above our long-term target range for this segment in the year ahead. Shifting to our expectations for 2025. We are providing guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $34.15 to $34.85. We will navigate 2025 with the same focus and discipline that has been central to the long-term success of Elevance Health. We will continue to manage cost trend for our clients, deepen the impact of our Carelon assets and execute on the growth opportunities ahead of us. The actions we are taking now will enhance the long-term earnings power of our enterprise and underscore our confidence in returning to at least 12% adjusted EPS growth annually on average over time. Finally, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to our extraordinary team of over 100,000 associates and their unwavering efforts during this dynamic period for the industry. Our associates went above and beyond last year, logging over 280,000 hours of volunteer time in our communities, setting a record for Elevance Health. This remarkable dedication underscores our collective commitment to improving the health of humanity by making a tangible positive impact on the people we are privileged to serve and the communities we call home. As we advance our mission, we remain focused on being our members' lifetime trust and health partner and ensuring our work elevates health beyond health care. I'll now hand over the call to our CFO, Mark Kaye, who will provide more details on our financial results and guidance. Mark? Mark Kaye : Thank you, Gail, and good morning, everyone. As Gail noted, we reported fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.84 and full year adjusted diluted earnings per share of $33.04, with fourth quarter results consistent with our October expectations. Our disciplined operational execution helped us navigate an elevated cost environment, primarily within our Medicaid business. We concluded the year with 45.7 million members, a decrease of 1.1 million year-over-year, but roughly flat sequentially. This annual decline was driven by membership reduction stemming from Medicaid redeterminations and changes in our geographic footprint, partially offset by continued growth in our employer group fee-based offerings and our ACA health plan products. These areas of growth demonstrate our ability to deliver compelling value in competitive market segments. Turning to revenue. We generated $175.2 billion in total operating revenue for 2024, up approximately 3% from the prior year. This top line growth reflects premium rate adjustments in recognition of higher cost trends as well as expanding customer relationships within our Carelon businesses, partially offset by lower Medicaid membership. We also benefited from acquisitions that further our goals in pharmacy services and home health, enhancing our enterprise flywheel. A priority for the coming year will be integrating these assets to unlock greater value for the members we are privileged to serve, particularly as we drive ambitious growth in Carelon. Our consolidated benefit expense ratio for the fourth quarter was 92.4%, bringing our full year ratio to 88.5%, in line with our guidance. As noted previously, we continue to see elevated cost trends within the Medicaid population, which remains stable at the levels we experienced exiting the third quarter. We are encouraged by the rate adjustments from our state partners, which are helping to better align premiums with current care costs. As these adjustments become more fully reflected, we expect Medicaid margins to improve over the course of 2025. Elevance Health's adjusted operating expense ratio stood at 9.9% for the fourth quarter and 10.6% for the full year, an improvement of 170 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively, versus the prior year. This reflects our continued focus on disciplined expense management and operating efficiencies. For the year, operating cash flow was $5.8 billion or approximately one-time GAAP net income. Our year end days in claims payable was 42.9 days, essentially flat compared to the third quarter and aligns with our long-term target range in the low-40s. In the fourth quarter, we opportunistically repurchased 4.5 million shares for a total of $1.8 billion, bringing full year repurchases to $2.9 billion and exceeding our initial forecast. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders while also investing in our strategic initiatives. Looking ahead to 2025, we are introducing a range for our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $34.15 to $34.85 to provide greater specificity around our view of expected performance for the year. We project total Medical membership of 45.8 million to 46.6 million by year-end 2025, driven by expected growth in our commercial fee-based membership, ACA exchange plans and Medicare Advantage. Following an annual enrollment period in line with our expectations, we anticipate ending 2025 with Medicare Advantage membership of 2.2 million to 2.25 million, reflecting planned growth in group MA and high-single digit expansion in individual MA. In terms of top line performance, we anticipate operating revenue to grow in the high-single to low double-digit percent range, bolstered by acquisitions like CareBridge. We expect our consolidated medical loss ratio to be around 89.1%, plus or minus 50 basis points, roughly a 60 basis point increase at the midpoint. This incorporates the persistence of elevated cost trends, particularly within Medicaid, as well as impacts from recent acquisitions and Medicare Part D benefit redesign changes. Our adjusted operating expense ratio is expected to be 10.4%, plus or minus 50 basis points, implying a slight year-over-year improvement as we pursue targeted actions to enhance our cost structure. For 2025, we anticipate a more normalized operating cash flow of roughly $8 billion or 1.1 times GAAP net income. We plan to allocate approximately $2.3 billion towards share repurchases with a bias towards the first half of the year. Regarding earnings seasonality, we expect to earn just over 60% of our adjusted EPS in the first half of 2025, with slightly more than half of that first half figure coming in the first quarter. I'm also pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.71 per share, a 14th consecutive annual increase. This speaks to our commitment to delivering strong shareholder returns and reflects the balance and resilience of our business model. We remain confident in our ability to execute on our strategic priorities in 2025, while meeting our financial objectives. With continued investments in our diversified business model and the expansion of Carelon's capabilities, we are building a strong foundation to deliver even greater value to our members, providers and shareholders and position Elevance Health for long-term sustainable growth. Thank you for your time today. I will now turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Thanks for the comments. Maybe, I know it's not your biggest business, but there\u2019s certainly been a lot of discussion in the financial community about your Medicare Advantage business enrollment. Looks, like, you're targeting sort of mid-7% to 8% or so for the year. Is that fully reflective of which you've got the full view of open enrollment at this point? So you think from here, it's just agents largely? And what are you seeing as you drill down in that demographic of the types of members you've attracted in the open enrollment? And then just so -- I think the comment on the third quarter was that the Medicare Advantage margin in '25 might step up modestly, but still be below your long-term targets for Medicare Advantage. Is that still your thinking? Gail Boudreaux : Well, thank you, A.J. I have just a few comments. First, we feel very good about and confident in the enrollment guidance that we gave for Medicare Advantage. It did come in line with the expectations that we set, and we had very good member retention which we think is a huge positive for us. So overall, I'll ask Felicia to maybe give you a little bit more detail about it, but really good in terms of the positioning of product and geography and overall, and we do think that's where we'll end the year. So Felicia, maybe a little bit more guidance on that. Felicia Norwood : Good morning, A.J., and thank you for the question. As Gail said, we are very pleased with the outcome of our annual enrollment period. Performance was really aligned with our expectations, driven predominantly by strong member retention and really stability in our offerings amid significant disruptions in the market this year. The enrollment trends that we saw in our core markets really reflect the value that seniors placed on our balanced approach. And we were very focused on our local strategy to ensure that we were effectively capturing growth opportunities where they were most favorable for us. We are very pleased with the product and the geographic composition of our growth. We saw very strong HMO growth, by design, and less PPO growth in the markets that we were looking for that growth. So with AEP results in hand right now, we are confident around our 2025 Medicare Advantage guidance of 7% to 9%, which from a member growth perspective, it's right in line with our expectations that we provided last year. We are obviously going to continue to be very vigilant around how we manage growth throughout the rest of the year. As you said, there will be predominantly agents and some individuals that come in as a result of dual eligibility. But we are confident in the actions and strategies that we have to maintain growth within the guide that we provided. Thank you. Mark Kaye : And then A.J., on your margin question, we are positioned well to achieve a margin stability in 2025 through many of the factors that Felicia mentioned, including disciplined cost management and a strong retention. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Mark, A.J. and Lance, next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Lance Wilkes : Great. Thanks so much. Could you talk a little bit about what you were seeing in terms of utilization? In particular, perhaps you could talk to what you're seeing in trends by product like, MA and commercial? And how you're thinking about that in terms of your assumptions for \u201825? And if you can give any commentary on categories of medical cost trend as far as like inpatient, outpatient, etc., that would be great. Thanks a lot. Mark Kaye : Lance, thanks very much for the question this morning. Cost trend in the fourth quarter developed largely as we anticipated with stability, I would say, across our lines of business. Specifically, Medicaid trends remained elevated. They were stable, particularly, as we've called out in prior quarters in behavioral health and inpatient services. And we think it's primarily because the ongoing impact of the membership mix changes following redeterminations is really stabilized at this point. In Medicare, cost trend similarity in the fourth quarter were elevated. They were manageable. We saw notable drivers here, including some of the post-acute care services. Again, very consistent with prior expectations and the way that we've priced our bids for 2025. On the commercial side, I would say, performance remains strong in line with the disciplined pricing approach that we've adopted to-date. And so as we think about 2025, we do expect these elevated trends really to persist in the first half of the year, particularly in Medicaid. On the Medicare side, they're similarly expected to remain stable at the current levels. And so I would say, our outlook for '25 really incorporates these dynamics. We're taking a prudent approach to guidance to ensure again we deliver sustainable long-term value. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Mark, and thanks for the question, Lance. And again, I\u2019ll just reiterate, I think what you\u2019re seeing from us is a very prudent approach in terms of very consistent to what we\u2019ve shared on where utilization is. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Hi. Thanks. Just a follow-up on that. You mentioned that Medicaid is an influencer of the higher year-over-year MLR that you're expecting in 2025. I think your previous expectations, you discussed last quarter were for something more stable than that. And it sounds like potentially the conversation around 1/1 (ph) rates has been pretty constructive. I love to just get a better sense of what explicitly you're embedding for Medicaid full year MLR change in this guidance? Thank you. Mark Kaye : Stephen, thanks very much for the question. Maybe let me start with the fourth quarter Medicaid trend in a little bit more detail. So in the fourth quarter, Medicaid cost trends, developed in line with the expectations we communicated during October. So specifically, trends generally remain consistent with the elevated levels we observed in September. And again, that reflects just the stabilization of our membership base, given again, redeterminations materially completed. As we look forward to 2025, we expect these higher than typical Medicaid cost trends, particularly, as I mentioned a moment ago in behavioral health and inpatient care, really to persist into the first half of 2025, and why does that matter? Well, it matters because current rates have not yet fully caught up to these cost trends, and so we're maintaining a prudent stance on how quickly the Medicaid margins are going to rebound in 2025. And this simply reflects both the elevated level of cost trends we expect to continue in the first half, but also the incremental rate adjustments that we're working on with our state partners. And so you could think about Medicaid as really being a tale of two-halves, stabilization in the early part of the year, followed by improvement in the second half of the year as rate adjustments begin to more fully reflect the heightened cost pressures. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Good morning. Just really want to understand two things. First, would be the comments around the Part D redesign. Mark, can you talk about the specific impact to MLR? And then secondly, just understanding the performance in CarelonRx going into 2025, you talked about mid-teens growth. Can you talk about how much of that is organic? The investments that you're making when we think about the margin improvement that you're talking about for 2025? Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Lisa. I'm going to have Mark address your first part of your question, then I'll ask Pete to talk about the growth, which we are really pleased with and excited about, the strategies and execution Carelon has. So Mark, please? Mark Kaye : Lisa, thanks very much for the question this morning. So for '25, we're guiding to an MLR of 9.1%, and that's approximately 60 bps higher than the prior year at the midpoint. There are three primary factors that are driving the increase here. First is the impact of our strategic growth mix in Medicare, including the Part D changes. Second one is recent acquisitions. And then third is really a prudent view towards medical cost trends. So specifically, the business mix changes are really driven by CareBridge running in the 20-ish basis point range, and that's expected to run at a higher MLR than our organic businesses; as well as stronger relative growth in our Medicare businesses inclusive of, to your point, the changes in the Part D the benefit structure, which has increased the direct subsidy. In addition, I\u2019d say the MLR guidance does reflect elevated but stable cost trends that you heard us talk about a couple of minutes ago, because we're operating in a more dynamic cost environment than historical norms. Gail Boudreaux : Pete, maybe share your thoughts on Carelon. Pete Haytaian : Yeah. That\u2019s -- appreciate it and thanks for the question. I'll talk broadly about Carelon, what we're really excited about what's going on in Carelon and the growth opportunities. We came off a very, very strong 24%, as I think you saw in terms of our growth. We had another strong quarter of growth and very balanced with respect to internal versus external growth. We continue to expand a lot of our risk arrangements internally across oncology, across behavioral health, post-acute solutions. And then externally, last year, we have one of our best years ever in terms of external growth, doing about 4x in terms of revenue growth versus '23. And by the way, one of the other key points that we've talked about historically, we're seeing really nice penetration as it relates to the Blues, that momentum will continue into 2025. You'll see very significant growth in our services part of the business with over 50% growth. As Mark mentioned, we're excited about the addition of CareBridge, that certainly adds to it. But then importantly, even outside of CareBridge, our organic growth, both internal and external on the services side is well above 20%. So very pleased with that. I think you also referenced Rx, Lisa. And I feel very good about our story in Rx and how our growth story is resonating in the marketplace. Momentum really does continue to build. We're working very closely with Morgan and the commercial team. And one of the things that I'll say that's really resonating in the marketplace and has actually enabled us to win some large accounts, upmarket and national account is this real focus on high touch customer service and advocacy. We are really doubling down on the patient experience and making sure that they have a strong experience across both medical and pharmacy. It's what we talk about in terms of whole health and we're really pleased about, how that's playing out. And then importantly, we continue to do well in our sweet spot, mid-market market and down market. So I think overall, a very small story in terms of Carelon growth. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks, Pete, and thanks for the question, Lisa. And I\u2019ll just punctuate maybe a couple of things. We're really excited about the momentum, both internally and externally in Carelon. And as you heard from Pete, a couple of things. One, deepening our capabilities inside of Carelon, so we can advance our strategy around more whole health risk, and you can see that in the numbers that we're sharing and plus what happened in '24, and then external validation with additional clients, both two areas that we\u2019ve talked about strategically. So thanks very much for your question. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Andrew Mok from Barclays. Please go ahead. Andrew Mok : Hi. Good morning. I think there's still some confusion around your Medicare Advantage membership growth for 2025. So I was hoping you could clear some of this up and tell us what your actual AEP growth is, and how much of that accounts for the full year outlook? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : I'll have Felicia share her thoughts on that. Felicia Norwood : So Andrew, thank you very much for that question. Our AEP growth is certainly very strong, and that reflects a lot of group membership growth that came in, a particular group account that, frankly, we're pleased with, that was a commercial account that we had a long-standing relationship with. So very familiar, with a lot of the demographics and dynamics associated with that group. And then in terms of our Medicare -- individual Medicare Advantage growth, it's right in line with the expectations that we provided. So in total, we are right in the range that we left you with, which is the 7% to 9% growth, which we expect overall this year. And we'll continue to have in place actions to manage appropriately growth throughout the rest of the year around our Medicare Advantage business. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thank you, Felicia and Andrew. Just to be clear because I don't want any confusion. That 7% to 9%, we essentially don't expect significant growth. We've expect minimal growth for the rest of the year, which -- with strong retention. So just to give you some sense of our confidence in that, that's how we're projecting and that\u2019s aligned similarly to what we've seen, for example, in '24 just given the market positioning. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Ryan Langston from TD Securities. Please go ahead. Ryan Langston : Hi. Thanks. I know you stepped back from the Blue Cross of Louisiana acquisition a little while ago, but I believe there's still a potential to revisit that deal. I guess is that true? And then just maybe more broadly on the environment. You closed Kroger Specialty, you closed Paragon, you closed CareBridge. Maybe just remind us on your priorities going forward into '25 and beyond on potential acquisition targets? Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Yeah. Thanks for the question. We really don't comment on acquisitions or our posture on that. I mean, we have a good partnership actually with Blue Cross Blue Shield Louisiana. We work with them closely in Medicaid and some of the duals in Medicare and a number of products in Carelon. So with many of our Blue partners, which you've heard us talk about, we continue to provide services because we have some really unique capabilities. Let me ask Pete to comment on your CareBridge question. Pete Haytaian : Yeah. No, thanks a lot. I think your question in terms of what we're interested in, I always like to talk about strategy in terms of framing where our interest reside. And again, we've talked about that the strategy overall of Carelon is to deliver whole health. We're really focused on affordability and empathy, and we face off with our health plan partners and really identify areas of complexity in health care and try to solve those with differentiated solutions and doing so at risk. And you've seen that really play through on our transactions, be it on the pharmacy side or on the services side, and we'll continue down that path. So there are many areas of interest when you think about where specialty trend is, how that impacts the different lines of business. We continue to sort of evaluate that. We'll be opportunistic on the pharmacy side. We think there are additional ways to enhance the whole health experience. And importantly, we think with -- what you're seeing in health care today, the fragmentation of data and the patient experience and enabling a much better whole health experience, as Gail said before, we see a tremendous opportunity around technology and data and enhancing the overall experience. So those are areas that we're very interested in as we move forward. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. A question on the health care benefits business. First, hoping you can talk to your expected seasonality for 2025, including how Q1 should look versus the full year? And then on the Health Benefits 2025 up margin guidance, looks like it's down year-over-year. You've talked to Medicaid being flat, Medicare being flat. Is that coming in commercial? And maybe you can talk about what's driving that and the magnitude of it on the commercial side? Thanks. Mark Kaye : Justin, thanks very much for your question. Let me go ahead and start with the seasonality, and then I'll talk a little bit about operating margins, the Health Benefit level after that. For seasonality, as you heard during our prepared remarks this morning, we do expect adjusted EPS to be weighted more towards the first half of the year, with slightly more than 60% of full year earnings occurring in that period. And then within the first half, we anticipate a little bit more than half of those earnings to then show up in the first quarter. And that reflects two things. One ism typical seasonal dynamics, and then two is, sort of our evolving business mix. As I think about seasonal dynamics, if you can think about the commercial business here typically contributing a larger share of earnings in the first half of the year, and then with continued strong retention and disciplined pricing, we expect that's going to continue to be the same pattern in 2025. On Medicaid, margins are more back-end loaded, especially as rate updates from state partners take effect, that's our first half, second half story. And then, of course, we've also reflected the Inflation Reduction Act Medicare Part D changes and the benefit of the leap year in the first quarter. So a lot going on with seasonality, but let me point you to those early comments I made. On the operating margin expectations, we do expect a 25 basis points to 50 basis points decline year-over-year. And there are a couple of discrete impacts outside of core operating performance, but in line with our expectations that I would call out for you. The first is that we're going to be cycling the non-recurring expense benefits that we had in 2024. Second, we're going to get a little bit of membership mix impacts through the slightly stronger relative growth in our Medicare lines of business compared to commercial, inclusive of the Medicare Part D design change. And then, I would make the point sort of excluding those discrete impacts, the margins across the health benefits businesses would have been stable. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just within the 2025 guidance, can you speak to your expectation for commercial trend and what you priced for? And I just want to make sure I understand, are you still expecting margin improvement in commercial? I thought that was a previous expectation. And then just on the MA side. I know the CMS data got rescinded, but it looked like your growth was already above -- slightly above the midpoint of full year guidance. I heard not a lot of growth the rest of the year. Could you just help us with the actions you've taken on the distribution side and maybe why you've taken some of those actions, and if that's what's slowing the growth? Mark Kaye : Josh, thanks very much for your question. On '25 commercial trends, looking ahead, we really do anticipate commercial cost trends to stay above those historical averages. But most importantly, this is something that we've expected and we've accounted for in our pricing strategy. Morgan and team has taken a very disciplined approach between competitiveness and underwriting discipline to ensure that those are priced for. It's a hard market. It's a very rational market. We feel very good about our balance of pricing and our forward-looking view of trends here. So on the commercial side, certainly, retention is strong, pricing is strong, margins remain robust. Gail Boudreaux : Yeah. Thanks, Josh. I'll take the second part of your question, which is kind of our view. Part of this is, as you think about AEP, we expect the data to settle out over the next few months. So I think you'll have a better view of what AEP actually looked like. And then secondarily, just looking at our trajectory and our placement of our products in each of the businesses and, as you note, just duals and sort of that pace, that's why we feel very confident of the rest of the year growth. We still expect strong retention, but we don't expect any significant growth of new sales, for example, but other than a normal cadence. And we saw that cadence in 2024 as well. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Windley : Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Question on pricing, kind of a two-parter. The guidance in commercial for ASO revenue or fee revenue, flat. Your membership, I think you're expecting up. Is there no pricing there? And in Medicaid, I hear you saying kind of stable MLR, stable margin as we move into the early part of 2025. I think 50% of the book reprices on Jan 1. And so I'm just curious about the benefit or lack thereof from that price to actually move you into an improving pattern in your Medicaid margins, so pricing on Medicaid and ASO. Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : Okay. We'll try to address -- there's a lot embedded in that question. Maybe Mark first, and then I'll ask some of the other colleagues here to join in on the rest of the answers. Mark? Mark Kaye : Dave, thanks very much for the question. The first one is relatively simple on the service fee revenues guide of approximately flat year-over-year. This is primarily because one of the main business drivers here is we're targeting a shift from fee-based to risk-based contracts, meaning, within Carelon Services, we're expecting a portion of our new wins and contract expansions really to convert from a fee-based arrangements to risk-based arrangements. And so we'll record that premium rather than necessarily through the service fee line. Gail Boudreaux : Next will be Felicia to answer the other parts of your question. Felicia Norwood : Yes. Dave, thank you for the question. Certainly, let me start by saying that we continue to be very focused on working tirelessly with our states partners to make sure that we are getting actuarially sound rates. When we take a look at our rating cycle, we have about 41% of our members tied to January, but then we have the rest of the rating year for the rest of our membership. At this point, we have visibility into about 70% of our premium on the Medicaid side. And as you heard Mark mention earlier, January came in line just with what we expect it, insufficient but very constructive conversations and good work with our state partners. And then, the July rates will be critical as well as we continue to close and narrow that gap and expect to see strong improvement in the back half of the year in Medicaid. Gail Boudreaux : Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Joanna Gajuk from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Joanna Gajuk : Hi. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. So I was just looking at your slides and the slide that when you talk about the long-term CAGR targets, I noticed that you no longer seem to be targeting to get to your margin, 6.5%, 7% by 2027. So is that the way to read it? And also, I guess, if that's the case, when should we expect that to be achieved and what would need to happen really for the margins to get to that target? Thank you. Mark Kaye : Joanna, great question and a very sharp eye. Let me maybe start by emphasizing, we remain committed to the long-term financial targets that we introduced at our 2023 Investor Day. We've not changed our target ranges or our expectations for either revenue growth or operating margin. And our goal is to deliver at least 12% average annual adjusted EPS growth. In other words, nothing has changed about our conviction in the significant embedded earnings power of our businesses. What has evolved is that the faster than projected and, I'd say, very positive growth that we've delivered across our Carelon businesses versus what we shared when we set these -- those targets in 2023 has changed. And specifically, Carelon growth is exceeding those original expectations. And we're very pleased that the deliberate actions we've taken to enhance and deepen our risk taking capabilities has led to an acceleration of this business. So putting it in numbers. With today's 2025 revenue guidance, we anticipate Carelon services to grow at over a 30% CAGR since 2022. And that's significantly above our original target range of high-teens to low-20s. And that's very positive for the earnings growth of Carelon, but it also shifts the near-term margin dynamics for those newer capabilities, right, just given the normal time it's going to take for new deals to reach, for example, mature margin levels. So in other words, our earnings power remains strong, but the business mix and timing have changed. So I'd probably end here with, look, we remain confident in the embedded earnings power of the businesses. We'll provide a couple more details at our Investor Day later this year, but this is really representative of the change. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Erin Wright from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Erin Wright : Great. Thanks. A follow-up on Medicare Advantage. I wanted to hear your thoughts on the advanced rate notice and where it can go from here in terms of incorporating a catch-up period in the final rate notice. And just bigger picture in light of that and the broader political environment seems to be more supportive of MA. But how are you thinking about regulatory implications, I guess, across the rest of your business and mainly in Medicaid, where, I guess, there's a lot of questions and maybe there's no answer? But wanted to hear your initial thoughts. Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Again, a very fulsome question, Erin. We'll try to address that. Maybe directionally, we think it's positive. Obviously, it's preliminary, not final. I'll have Felicia share some more details on that, and we'll talk about sort of kind of how we're heading. So Felicia? Felicia Norwood : Sure. Erin, thank you very much for that question. We all have to keep in mind that beneficiaries choose Medicare Advantage for the value that it provides and it delivers. And over 34 million people in this country, older adults and persons with disability, have proactively chosen MA. Rate stability really helps us to continue to be able to provide the benefits that deliver high quality care that seniors value and depend on. Regarding the advanced notice, after two consecutive years of cuts to the MA program, we are very pleased to see the direction of the advanced MA rate notice that came out earlier this month. Now while the base rate reflects progress, I think, towards more adequate funding in the program, we still believe that it's insufficient in light of the cost trends that we've seen over the past year. So we look forward to working very collaboratively with the new administration in terms of our proposed recommendations on changes in the advanced notice, particularly with respect to some of the reforms in the Part D risk model and other policies, which we believe will improve the program long term. So we look forward to working with the administration over the next few weeks and months to make sure that the final notice advances a program that seniors in this country have certainly come to rely on. Gail Boudreaux : And Erin, just briefly on your comments around sort of Medicaid and the environment there, just a couple of things. I mean, I think as you think about the deep expertise and the years that we've worked in this space, we have a long history across multiple administrations of providing critical benefits to our members and deep expertise, particularly in working with the states. What I'd say, we're really looking forward to is the public private partnership where we can work with our states and the government to bring innovative programs that we think can really benefit these members and I think provide even better value. So we're -- again, it's early. There are no firm proposals. There's a lot of different discussion. But I think we're approaching this in the public private partnership and also a long history of working across this for many, many years. Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Sarah James from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Gabrielle Ingoglia : Hi. This is Gabie on for the line -- this is Gabie on the line for Sarah. Could you just speak a little bit more to the commercial cost trends you saw in the fourth quarter and overall for 2024, maybe more by product, inpatient, outpatient, and then just reiterate what's assumed in guidance for how commercial cost trends evolve in '25? Mark Kaye : Gabie, welcome. And I'm going to apologize in advance, this might be a little bit of a short answer. So I'd simply note that commercial performance remained strong in the fourth quarter. Trends were elevated throughout the year. They were stable. And most importantly, they were priced for. We see continued driver of the elevated cost trend come from a couple of key categories, for example, some of the inpatient medical, a little bit of outpatient ER. But for the most part, developed exactly in line with what we expect. And I'd say the same for 2025. Our pricing initiatives are ongoing. We'll look to continue to expand margin via mix and penetration of some of the specialty products, but we feel very good about how we're positioned. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Mark. And just reiterating, we feel very good that we priced. It's a hardened market in commercial and have seen really strong results across our commercial business. So thank you for that question. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Yeah. Good morning, guys and thanks for taking the question. It's kind of a two part here on the exchange business. I guess, number one is, do you guys have an expectation for what happens to the enhanced subsidies as part of the upcoming political cycle? And then part two, Mark, is kind of a nuanced one. What percent of your exchange members have actually paid the January premiums relative to what you guys have experienced last year given that the government turned the income verification back on, kind of expecting a change in like what people actually show up and pay the premiums there? Any color would be helpful. Gail Boudreaux : Let me have Morgan address your first question and then Mark your second. So Morgan? Morgan Kendrick : So George, thanks for the question there. First of all, we're really pleased with the commercial ACA performance, that business has turned out to be quite a good one. And as you've noticed over the past several years, we've taken a very prudent methodical approach to getting into various markets and actually growing that slowly. It's one where we've seen the trends as they are. They've been priced for. This year, we're particularly pleased with the fact that we've expanded into non-Blue geographies in three additional markets. So we really look at this as an overall white space. Certainly, there's the opportunity to have a reduction in the actual subsidies or elimination, which would certainly shrink the market at some sorts, if indeed that occurs. That said, we absolutely believe that this is a really, really solid market for us. We like the business. It's a complementary business for us in taking risk, and it certainly created a promising white space for long-term growth as we continue to kind of create that harmonious connection between care, caid and ACA. So it brings together both government and health benefits -- or commercial benefits. And I'll pass it to Mark for the balance of your question. Mark Kaye : George, thanks. At this time, there's really no change in our effectuation rates being a little bit conservative in the assumptions. I'd say the effectuation has been very consistent with what we've observed in the prior years. And our guidance for membership growth that we released this morning incorporates those assumptions. Gail Boudreaux : And one thing about -- just in terms of where the federal government. Obviously, there's still a lot of discussions. There's no final policy. And I think one of the things to consider that -- there's a lot of flexibility that Congress has when considering an extension of a subsidy, so it doesn't have to be an all or nothing decision. Adjustments can include full extension or partial. So just as we go through this process, we're obviously sharing the value that these subsidies have for our members and the impact it has to them. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to just get a clarification and then a question. Just the clarification would be appreciate Mark's comments on the operating margin dynamics for Carelon by '27. I was hoping maybe, Mark, if you could also just elaborate on Health Benefits and whether those margin targets are still intact for '27 or have evolved. And then also, I was just curious if you guys can give us the breakdown in the commercial risk enrollment growth guidance between commercial group and the exchanges? Thanks. Mark Kaye : Thank you very much for the question this morning, Scott. Just on the Health Benefits margin, so again maybe just to reiterate some of the important points from my prior commentary. So our long-term vision and margin objectives for Health Benefits business haven't changed. And we do remain confident in the earnings power that's embedded in these health businesses and the growth they continue to drive for Carelon. In the interim, the change we made this quarter based in part on investor feedback was really to reflect these faster than projected, and I spoke about this a minute ago, the positive growth that we've delivered across the Carelon businesses. So concurrent with that, we also want to stay prudent about the pace at which our evolving Health Benefits business mix and investments come together to support those long-term target margins. We'll provide more details at this year's investor conference about where we stand with that. And you'll hear more about the growth opportunities at that time. Gail Boudreaux : Yes. Thanks, Mark. And again, I guess, our key message is, we believe that there's really strong embedded earnings power, and Carelon has really accelerated that as well. So that's really the message that we are trying to share today. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Michael Hall from Baird. Please go ahead. Michael Hall : Thank you. Wanted to revisit A.J.'s question and ask it in a bit of different way. So regarding your '25 MA growth guide, healthy growth in line with expectations, averting the worst case high growth scenarios that investors had. With that said, for the investors who may still push back and say, okay, Elevance only achieved this healthy growth level through aggressive plan suppression tactics, and that the company still mispriced the business. Curious to hear your response to that. I know you're still very confident. But given this context, I'm trying to get a better sense in your level of conviction and confidence on MA margins this year? Thank you. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you for the question. I guess, sort of just to level set kind of our view, I mean, obviously, we were very specific around wanting to target certain types of growth by marketplace, geography and product, as well as continue our growth in our strong duals business. So I guess, I would reframe, the answer to your question is, we had really good retention. And that in our individual Medicare Advantage book, I think, has positioned us quite well for sustainable long-term growth. So we feel all of this actually plays into our long-term strategy. We're being prudent around where Medicare is going, as Mark shared in sort of our guide around trend, and want to make sure that we position that business the right way. The other growth that we saw, which is also, I think, a significant positive is in our group growth. And that's from a large client that we have significant experience with and have worked with. And I think that is an inherent part of our strategy in group MA is to convert those members over. And we did that this year, and we're really pleased with. And we saw some stronger growth because of the strength of the brand that we have with that customer. And again, the strong service and delivery we've delivered to this customer for many, many years. So I guess, my positioning is we feel quite good about where we said we were going to guide for growth. We were ending on growth, and it is the right alignment of product and geography to match where our capabilities are. Next question, please. Operator : And for our last question, we'll go to the line of Whit Mayo from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Whit Mayo : Thanks. I just wanted to get a quick update on the performance of your Puerto Rico MA business. How did that perform last year versus your targets? And what are you thinking about growth in margins this year and whether or not that's driving any contribution to the views on stabilization in overall MA margins? Thanks. Gail Boudreaux : I'll let Felicia address that. Thank you. Felicia Norwood : So, good morning, Whit, thank you so much for the question. As you know, as we headed into AEP of 2024, we made some strategic decisions with respect to our Puerto Rico business, making significant reductions in our supplemental benefits to make sure that over time, we were balancing margin and membership. And I will say that the success of that was very solid. We demonstrated our ability to be able to get to a place we needed to on stabilizing that environment. It worked very well in '24, and we continue that same strategy as we headed into 2025. So we feel very well about how we are strategically positioned in Puerto Rico and look forward to continuing to make sure that we deliver value to the residents of Puerto Rico in the MA program. So thank you very much for that question. Gail Boudreaux : Thank you, Whit. And that will be our last question. I want to thank everyone for joining us on the line today and for your continued interest and support in Elevance Health. We entered '25 resolute in our efforts to make the health care system simple, affordable and accessible for our members. And we're confident that our actions will ensure meaningful impact in 2025 and position the business to return to our long-term growth algorithms over time. Thank you so much again for your interest in Elevance Health, and have a great rest of your week.
