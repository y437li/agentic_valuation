All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks there will be a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) Claudine Prowse, VP Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Claudine Prowse : Welcome to Biogen Idec\u2019s first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the investor\u2019s section of www.BiogenIdec.com to find the press release and related financial tables including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures that we\u2019ll discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in tables one and two. Table three includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results which we believe better represents the ongoing economics of our business and reflects how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussion related to this call.  I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult our SEC filings for additional detail.  On today\u2019s call I\u2019m joined by our Chief Executive Officer Dr. George Scangos; Tony Kingsley, EVP of Global Commercial Operations; Dr. Doug Williams, EVP of Research and Development; and our CFO Paul Clancy. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to George. George A. Scangos: Biogen Idec had an excellent start to 2014 with successful milestone accomplishments and solid financial performance. We secured approval for TECFIDERA in the EU, launched in Germany, and some other countries. ALPROLIX was approved for hemophilia B in the US and Canada. We continued to move two of our late-stage pipeline candidates, ELOCTATE for hemophilia A and PLEGRIDY for MS, through the registration processes towards anticipated approvals this year. We strengthened our pipeline through new collaborations with Eisai and Sangamo in areas that fit within our strategic therapeutic focus, and first quarter financial performance reflected 51% growth in revenues and 25% growth in non-GAAP EPS year-over-year. So, this month marks the one-year anniversary of the US introduction of TECFIDERA. It\u2019s introduction has dramatically shifted the US market for MS therapy. We\u2019ve seen an expansion of the MS market and within that TECFIDERA is the number one oral MS therapy in the US, achieving over $1 billion in revenue during the first year of launch. We launched TECFIDERA in initially European countries, beginning in February and already there appears to be broad interest among physicians and patients. Based on the continued strong demand in the US and the encouraging early signs in the EU, we believe that TECFIDERA\u2019s attractive product profile positions it well for the long run. The approval and anticipated launch of ALPROLIX marks an important milestone for our company as we expand into the hemophilia market. ALPROLIX is the first hemophilia B therapy to reduce bleeding episodes with prophylactic infusions at least a week apart. We believe that this therapy has the potential to change the standard of care in hemophilia and significantly improve patients\u2019 lives. As we\u2019ve done for so many years in multiple sclerosis, our goal is to bring a diligent patient centric approach to addressing the hemophilia community. Our keen focus on patients permeates everything that we do from our direct interactions with patients, to our assistance programs, to our continuing R&D efforts. We remain focused on making decisions that are right for patients. Last month, the FDA extended the PDUFA date of PLEGRIDY, our subcutaneous peginterferon beta-1a candidate for relapsing forms of MS to allow additional time for review of the application, while obviously not the news we were hoping to hear, a three-month PDUFA extension is not uncommon, particularly for applications involving MS therapies. We look forward to the potential launch of PLEDGRIDYin the second half of the year.  We\u2019ve continued to make strides to expand our global presence beyond Europe and the US. In Japan, we obtained marketing approval for TYSABRI and filed a marketing application for ELOCTATE. Japan is the second-largest pharmaceutical market in the world with attractive dynamics, and it is an important long-term priority for the company.  So in summary, I think we\u2019re off to a great start for 2014, and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Doug. Douglas E. Williams: We\u2019re excited about the approval of ALPROLIX. ALPROLIX is a recombinant DNA derived long-acting coagulation Factor IX concentrate indicated in the US for both adults and children with hemophilia B. In the US, ALPROLIX is indicated for the control and prevention of bleeding episodes perioperative management, and routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes. Starting dosing regimens for prophylaxis are 50 international units per kilogram once weekly or 100 IUs per kilogram once every 10 days. Dosing can be adjusted based on individual response.  The safety and tolerability information including in the US label is consistent with data from the Phase 3 Study. The most common adverse reaction observed were headache and oral paresthesia. In summary, we\u2019re pleased to have obtained what we believe is an attractive and differentiating product label for ALPROLIX.  Earlier this month, we along with our partner Sobi, announced topline results from the ELOCTATE Kids A-LONG Phase 3 study in pediatric patients with hemophilia A. These data demonstrated that twice weekly prophylactic dosing with ELOCTATE maintained low bleeding rates in children. We believe these results support the potential for ELOCTATE to address a significant need for children with hemophilia A by providing prolonged intervals between scheduled prophylactic infusions to protect against bleeding episodes. The tolerability, safety, and relative half-life were consistent with those observed in previous clinical studies and no inhibitors were detected. These data support applications for pediatric indications globally and are a necessary step to obtaining marketing authorization in Europe. The ALPROLIX Kids B-LONG study remains ongoing with data expected in the first half of 2015.  Transitioning to our neurology programs, we continue to generate new data to support our products and better understand our pipeline candidates. At next week\u2019s American Academy of Neurology Meeting, we\u2019ll be presenting important new data for several of our programs. Specifically, we\u2019ll present TECFIDERA data that demonstrates strong efficacy in various patient subgroups including those with more active disease. Results from the TECFIDERA managed study show that GI symptoms experienced by some patients are often transient in nature. For PLEGRIDY, we\u2019ll present post-hoc analysis from year one of the advanced study demonstrating a higher proportion of patients taking PLEGRIDY to achieve freedom from measured disease activity. We\u2019ll also present final two year data providing further support for this product candidate\u2019s efficacy and safety profile.  Finally, new TYSABRI data demonstrate its efficacy benefits in patients switching to TYSABRI versus maintaining the use of alternative therapies. This quarter, we also completed a number of transactions that provide Biogen Idec with access to promising new clinical candidates. Our collaboration with Sangamo BioSciences is focused on an innovative gene editing technology with the potential to treat sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia.  Our agreement with Eisai expands our efforts to develop disease modifying therapies for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In recent years, meaningful advances have increased our understanding in both trial design and target selection for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The optimal therapeutic approach for AD remains uncertain, and we believe it\u2019s prudent to evaluate multiple therapeutic methods for treating the disease. With the Eisai transaction, we\u2019ve gained access to two-mid stage clinical candidates for AD, a small molecule BACE1 inhibitor and a monoclonal antibody targeting beta-amyloid. Combined with BIIB037 and our anti-tau program in preclinical testing, we now have four potential Alzheimer\u2019s disease candidates with three different mechanisms. Looking forward, we also anticipate data from several clinical studies including the Phase 3 Daclizumab HYP DECIDE study in relapsing MS patients. Rather than a placebo controlled study design, the DECIDE study sets a higher standard with a compelling two to three head-to-head design versus interferon beta treatment. The primary endpoint is the reduction in annualized relapse rate. We remain on track for obtaining DECIDE data around the middle of this year.  I\u2019ll now pass the call over to Tony. Tony Kingsley : During the quarter we continued to grow total MS patient share across our franchise. Starting with TECFIDERA, performance in the US remains strong and the global introduction is under way. After one year on the market, over 65,000 patients have been treated with TECFIDERA globally. In the US, we continue to be pleased with how broadly neurologists have adopted TECFIDERA. As of Q1 approximately 7,000 physicians have written TECFIDERA in the US and we\u2019re also encouraged by deeper usage among writers as approximately 75% of all TECFIDERA prescribers have written multiple subscriptions. According to our market research TECIFDERA is the leading therapy for newly diagnosed MS patients. One year into the US launch we believe TECIFDERA is continuing to stimulate higher switch rates. While we anticipate the patient start and switch dynamics to remain strong, we continue to believe that the overall market growth rates will moderate towards historical levels during 2014. Outside of the US, we believe TECIFDERA is also performing well in other launch markets. In both Canada and Australia, our market research suggest the TECIFDERA is outpacing the other orals on the market when comparing the initial months of launch. In Germany, we\u2019re encouraged by the early signs. In addition to driving strong execution on promotion and education, we\u2019re actively engaging with reimbursement authorities across multiple markets. Australia gained full year reimbursement in December and we expect to gain government reimbursement in Canada later this year. In year up we have secured full reimbursement, in [doorway] and Scotland. Our local market access teams are executing well and we continue to expect the series of reimbursement decisions across European markets in the latter half of the year.  AVONEX continued to perform well globally in the first quarter. In the US as the injectable class continues to decline, the demand for AVONEX is softening as we anticipated. But within the injectable class we believe AVONEX is emerging as the interferon of choice. Outside the US we are maintaining strong AVONEX promotional efforts in advance of anticipated TECIFDERA launches and we remain committed to maintaining strong relative position for AVONEX among the platform therapies as that segment of the market declines. We continue to believe the convenience remains the key differentiator for this segment.  Moving onto TYSABRI, in the US demand for TYSABRI remains solid as physicians continue to choose this therapy for patients requiring higher efficacy treatment. We\u2019re also encouraged by a recent uptick in patient retention rates. Importantly, in patients who have discontinued TYSABRI, approximately 70% have stayed within our franchise during the first quarter. In Europe we believe that as TECIFDERA is launched across individual markets TYSABRI may experience similar dynamics that we saw in the US. Overall, we continue to believe in TYSABRI as a leader in the high efficacy segment.  Now turning to our new hemophilia business. We\u2019re currently in launch mode for ALPROLIX in the US and anticipate having patients on commercial therapy starting in early May. Based on NHF guidelines, traditional hemophilia B therapy requires prophylactic infusions two or more times a week. Given the clarity of our label, we believe our value is very clear for the majority of patients. 50 international units per kilogram will cover a patient for a week, or 100 IUs per kilogram starting every 10 days and adjusting the dosing based on individual response. Our market research suggests that reducing infusion frequency is the largest unmet need for this community and we expect ALPROLIX will directly address this burden.  With the approval of ALPROLIX in the US, we are focused on two immediate objectives : first, to initiate comprehensive education to physicians, payers, and advocacy groups; and second, to facilitate access to patients starting on ALPROLIX. Our commercial team is actively establishing contracts with specialty pharmacies, finalizing the supply chain, and establishing the financial and patient support programs which we believe will enable a smooth launch. We believe that patients and physicians are anticipating the entry of long acting therapies to the market and we are excited to be first. Our commitment is to transform the care of people with hemophilia and facilitate expanded use of prophylactic treatment. A successful launch will require extensive promotional and educational efforts and our commercial organization is executing on this strategy. Our goal is to become market leaders in the mid to long term and we believe in the product and our ability to execute.  Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with the performance of the commercial organization. Across an expanding portfolio of therapies we are demonstrating strong execution and good results. I\u2019ll now pass the call to Paul. Paul J. Clancy : Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.02 in the first quarter and our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.47. Before I walk through the P&L there are a number of items to remember with respect to the year-over-year comparisons. These include : the TYSABRI asset purchase which impacted revenue and COGS; the RITUXAN arbitration charge in Q1 last year; and an unusually low effective tax rate from Q1 2013. Also, this quarter\u2019s results were impacted by $118 million R&D expense related to our Eisai transaction as Doug reviewed. This agreement impacted EPS in the quarter by approximately $0.35. Now, walking down the P&L I\u2019ll start with revenues. Total revenue for the first quarter grew to approximately $2.1 billion. First quarter AVONEX worldwide revenue was $761 million. In the US, Q1 AVONEX revenue decreased 3% to $476 million and outside the US Q1 AVONEX revenue was $285 million. TYSABRI worldwide revenue net of hedging was $441 million in the first quarter. These results were comprised of $234 million in the US and $207 million internationally.  Global TECFIDERA revenue was $506 million in Q1. US TECFIDERA was $460 million. We ended the quarter with approximately five weeks of inventory in the channel which includes specialty pharmacies and wholesalers. We estimate that US TECFIDERA revenue includes an incremental inventory build of approximately $45 million versus the end of last year. International TECFIDERA revenue was $46 million in the first quarter with Germany being the primary contributor. We estimate approximately $10 million to $15 million of Germany sales in Q1 were related to inventory build. Turning to our anti-CD20 franchise, RITUXIN and GAZYVA US profit share was $275 million for Q1. Royalties and profit share in sales of RITUXIN outside the US were $22 million. The result was $297 million of net revenue from unconsolidated joint business.  Now turning to the expense lines of the non-GAAP P&L. Q1 non-GAAP cost of goods sold were $279 million or 13% of revenue. The increase year-over-year was primarily driven by TYSABRI contingent payments and royalties. Q1 non-GAAP R&D expense was $527 million or 25% of revenue. The increase year-over-year was primarily driven by our recently announced agreement with Eisai where we recorded a $118 million R&D charge. This amount consisted of a $100 million upfront payment and $18 million reflecting the value of options for certain programs and geographic rights. Q1 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $509 million or 24% of revenue. We continue to make significant investments associated with TECFIDERA and the upcoming hemophilia launches. Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 27%. Weighted average diluted shares were 238 million and we ended the quarter with almost $2 billion in cash and marketable securities of which approximately 70% is within the United States. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which were $2.47 for the quarter, an increase of 25%. Now, turning to our updated full year 2014 guidance. We now expect total revenue growth between 26% and 28% an increase from prior guidance owing to AVONEX and TYSABRI buoyance compared to our prior expectations. Our 2014 guidance continues to exclude the impact of a settlement with AIFA as the timing of the final approval of this agreement remains uncertain.  R&D expense is expected to be between 20% and 22% of sales unchanged from prior guidance. Our full year R&D forecast continues to earmark approximately $200 million for new early stage business development opportunities of which the Eisai transaction is included in this amount. SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 22% to 23% of total revenue also, unchanged. We anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results between $11.35 and $11.45 and GAAP EPS to be between $9.85 and $9.95.  Now, over to George for his closing comments. George A. Scangos: In closing, we\u2019re off to a strong start for the year and looking forward we have several crucial milestones and activities that require our intense focus. First, expanding TECFIDERA into new markets as we seek to serve more patients with MS. We\u2019re launching three additional products ALPROLIX for hemophilia B and other potential launches this year including ELOCTATE for hemophilia A and PLEGRIDY for relapsing MS. We\u2019re advancing the next wave of new potential medicines. In the coming 12 to 18 months we anticipate a number of data readouts including Phase 3 results for Daclizumab HYP in relapsing MS and for TYSABRI in SPMS, as well as, early and mid stage data for a number of compounds in the pipeline including LINGO. Continuing to focus on innovation we believe that Biogen Idec scientific acumen and robust pipeline program give us the opportunity to not only expand our leadership position in MS but also contribute to new treatment options for patients with other series diseases. These activities are at the very core of our mission and require determination and perseverance. We believe that our team is ready to meet these objectives and we look forward to providing updates on our progress throughout the year. I\u2019d like to thank the patients and physicians who are involved in our clinical development program and our employees who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patient\u2019s lives, and all of you, for joining us this morning. Operator, we can now open up the call for questions. Operator :  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra \u2013 Credit Suisse. Ravi Mehrotra \u2013 Credit Suisse : Congrats on the progress, especially TECFIDERA\u2019s launch. It's obviously not Sovaldi launch, but it is okay. My question regards biomarkers in MS, can you just remind us of the work you\u2019ve done or are doing to look at the potential of biomarkers to predict response rates for treatment selection in MS patients? Specifically, on LINGO, is there any clinical data historical or ongoing to support the hypothesis that LINGO expression where activation is increased in MS patients? Just a very quick follow on, on the hemophilia, how should we think about gross-to-net revenues? Douglas E. Williams: I\u2019ll take the first two and then let either Tony or Paul handle the gross-to-net question. Biomarkers, obviously that\u2019s very important part of the ongoing research activities here. There\u2019s really two major questions that we\u2019re trying to approach with the biomarker activity that\u2019s part of our clinical trial program. One is really trying to characterize patients who have either a more or lesser, in terms of aggressiveness, disease course to really try to match them up with certain therapies that may have greater activity and a higher level of disease activity, so for instance, with TYSABRI-like molecule in patients with more aggressive disease. So, we\u2019re looking at things like RNA profiling, we\u2019re looking at all the laboratory tests that are collected in these patients, we\u2019re looking at MRI activity, clinical relapses, EDSS progression, and really looking across those data sets to try to see whether or not there\u2019s a signature and that signature can be one or more of those parameters that I just named that correlate with a greater level of disease activity. That information, at the time of diagnosis, may help physicians choose the appropriate therapy for their patients at the time of diagnosis. The sort of bigger question we\u2019re trying to get at with respect to our own portfolio of drugs is, can in fact we use similar types of algorithms to predict patients who will have a greater or lesser response to our therapies or potentially may experience a safety event that we want to steer them away from. So, all of our studies have very extensive sampling embedded in them now, that\u2019s true of our MS studies, it\u2019s actually true of all of our clinical studies now, probably not unlike all of our compatriot companies out there as well. Again, the idea here is to try to match up the appropriate patient with the appropriate drug either in terms of the best response to therapy or steering them away from a potential safety event. A lot of work still to be done, but I think there\u2019s progress being made and you can expect that we\u2019ll have data reading out over the course of the next months and years that will be presented at major medical meetings to describe what we\u2019ve been finding. With respect to LINGO, a lot of the hypothesis around the use of LINGO is based on some data from several years back that was based on autopsy specimens from patients with MS showing that in lesions there were in fact pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes, so the cells that are capable of re-myelination are actually present in the lesions, but they are blocked from maturing by one or more factors. LINGO is clearly one of them based on the experimental data that we\u2019ve accumulated.  I don\u2019t know that there is specific data in autopsy specimens that show an increased level of LINGO versus what\u2019s present in sort of normal brain tissue but it\u2019s clearly present. If you think about what\u2019s happening, we\u2019ve got essentially a targeted delivery of the drug because of the breakdown of the blood/brain barrier in and around those lesions. So, where we\u2019re going to be able to reverse the inhibition of myelination and allow the maturation of those oligodendrocyte precursor cells is specifically in the area where the blood/brain barrier has broken down. You can see this very clearly happening in the animal models, so our expectation is that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen in the human situation as well; and the targeted delivery of the anti-LINGO molecule releasing the block on myelination and hopefully a sufficient level of re-myelination taking place to show clinical benefit in these patients. Tony Kingsley : On your question about channel discount, look it\u2019s steady state. Our research suggests that the gross-to-net in the hemophilia space tend to run higher, probably meaningfully higher than what we\u2019re used to seeing in MS. There\u2019s really two big pieces to that. One is the channel, so you have specialty pharmacies, specialty distributors, and home health. The second is there\u2019s a meaningful portion of the patients that go through 340B designated hemophilia treatment centers. We\u2019re going to have to see how that evolves, it will depend a lot on the mix of the patients, and I just think we\u2019ll have to look over the next handful of quarters. I think mix will be a big driver. Operator :  Your next question comes from Michael Yee \u2013 RBC Capital Markets. Michael Yee \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : You just launched TECFIDERA in Europe and I\u2019m just trying to understand, based on your feedback so far or your research, whether you think there\u2019s different demand dynamics in sort of the three different pools : newly diagnosed versus switchers versus the quitter pool versus say the US, and are there differences there that we should consider obviously other than price versus the US? Then just as a follow up to that, you\u2019ve mentioned now multiple times in slides and your 10-K about BIIB061, so as I think about the trajectory and longevity of your oral franchise that you\u2019re working on, can you say anything about that drug as to whether it\u2019s remyelinating or anything about BIBB061 that would keep down the suspense? Tony Kingsley : On Europe look, I think I\u2019ve said before we continue to believe in the product and are looking forward to launching it. We highlighted a couple of differences in general in Europe which were third oral to market. The other orals [inaudible] more traction perhaps less clear in participation by the community given the uncertainty and the regulatory delays. Like we said before, that\u2019s going to take hard work. We\u2019re working hard.  If I look at Germany, we\u2019re getting great execution, we\u2019re getting reach and frequency, we\u2019re getting access to customers and we\u2019re seeing interest and we\u2019re getting patients on therapy so we\u2019re encouraged by the signs in Germany. In terms of talking about the trajectory and the mix across pools it\u2019s probably a little early to make that call. As I think you know, in Germany the data is more lag driven IMS basis, we\u2019re looking at shipments and various things like that so probably a little early to make a more specific mix but I think the message is getting access to customers and seeing interest and encouraged by the early signs. Douglas E. Williams: BIIB061 that is an oral remyelinating drug in much the same way disease modifying therapies are moving towards an oral platform approach, we see the same thing happening in the remyelinating space. So, as LINGO is the biologic and is the first generation of what we hope will be a successful remyelination franchise, BIIB061 is working through a different mechanism which we\u2019re not prepared to disclose at this point but does very much the same thing that LINGO does in the experimental models so we\u2019re quite excited about initiating the clinical program with the molecule. Operator :  Your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group. Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group : A couple of questions, one maybe for Paul, I just thought I\u2019d take this opportunity, you guys choose to include the upfront R&D payments in your non-GAAP EPS numbers. A couple of other companies out there don\u2019t do that, I\u2019m just wondering why it? It creates volatility on a quarter like this. That\u2019s an old school CFO question so I appreciate it. Then also, if they\u2019re already BG-12 contingent payments that were made in the quarter, would it be possible for you to tell us what they were? Then Doug, how does the base inhibitor from Eisai differ from Merck or AZ\u2019s drug which I think are already in Phase 3 so you guys are pretty far behind I guess and I\u2019m just wondering why you think you still have got a shot at being competitive? Paul J. Clancy : The delineation we generally make is purchase accounting items are in our GAAP P&L but not in our non-GAAP P&L so that has been a practice. Essentially what we view as these upfronts and milestones are part in parcel to the business, they come in lumps as we saw in this quarter, as we\u2019ve seen in last quarter but it\u2019s essentially part and parcel to the business but we do make that kind of delineation. Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group : Did you make a cash payment to Fumaderm in the quarter? Paul J. Clancy : We did. It was a cash payment that was earned in the fourth quarter and paid out technically in the first quarter of 2014. Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group : Do you have the amount? Paul J. Clancy : Gosh, off the top of my head I don\u2019t. I believe it was $25 million. Douglas E. Williams: With respect to the base compound, we did very extensive diligence on the compound before we licensed it in and actually thought the profile was very favorable from a safety perspective with the caveat that there\u2019s still a ways to go on development to really understand that completely. I would say the same thing is true with both the Merck compound and the AZ compound, nobody has actually gotten there yet so the opportunity is still very much there. We like the profile of the compound. We also like the ability, potentially, if the compound is successful in the clinic to start thinking about combinations between the base inhibitor and one or both of our anti-beta amyloid antibodies or potentially the anti-tau antibodies. So, we\u2019re looking at this from sort of a portfolio approach in addition to just the individual compound which we like the profile as we saw it. Operator :  Your next question comes from Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Company. Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Company: I was a bit surprised that AVONEX is doing so well within the interferon class. What do you scribe that to? Is there some kind of beneficial franchise effect going on there with TECFIDERA? Then for Paul, was there also an R&D upfront to Sangamo in the quarter? Tony Kingsley : A very good question. I think the short answer is yes, I think TECFIDERA has probably taken disproportionally from the high dose high frequency interferon\u2019s relative to AVONEX. I think that makes sense when you take into account those tend to be more [switch two] products relative to AVONEX. So, if TECFIDERA gets in front of that switch I think you\u2019re seeing a positive manifest. But, I would also add with an increased focus on promotion we think we\u2019re putting some very good effort to see the continuation of the story behind AVONEX so a little of each. Paul J. Clancy : Eric, there was a Sangamo payment in the first quarter that was for $20 million, upfront payment. That was actually in our original press release with Sangamo. The Eisai, if you recall, the financial terms weren\u2019t disclosed until today just because of the partnership at the time. Operator :  Your next question comes from Geoff Porges \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein. Geoff Porges \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein: Just a follow up on first of all the Eisai, Paul could you confirm whether if the products are successful you will report the revenue or whether that will simply be a profit sharing that reports below the line? Then further to the $200 million that you allowed for BD activity, with what you\u2019ve spent in the first quarter should we assume there\u2019s only 50 to 80 left for the balance of the year? Then lastly, with your step up in your revenue guidance and keeping the expense guidance the same it certainly applies that your expenses are going to be higher than you previously anticipated. Is that the right way to look at it and should we be expecting this higher level of SG&A spend to be the baseline going forward? Paul J. Clancy : All good questions. With respect to the first part of the question, Eisai essentially is about $118 million of the $200 earmarked and so what is the balance is exactly as you noted and we obviously had an eye towards the Eisai deal when we set up the original guidance. We actually continue to work on business development transactions but I mean, quite frankly, the pipeline was far more advanced right before the Eisai transaction than it is right now. I think it\u2019s much closer to an earmark. I don\u2019t know if it will be 100, or 60, or 80, but we\u2019ll update people along the way as we go.  The Eisai transaction is essentially a 50/50 split with the exception of certain geographies that are really dependent on Eisai. Specifically, the Japan geography of whether or not they want to bring that into the collaboration or not. From a perspective of development 50/50 with a respect from a commercialization and 50/50 in terms of profits assuming one or two of the products get to market. We haven\u2019t yet determined who would be taking the lead on different geographies and I think at this point in time that would probably guide our revenue model. So, it\u2019s a little bit early to tell how the geography lands in the P&L but it is in essence a 50/50. Then you\u2019re last part of the question yes, I think you\u2019re right is that implicit is a little bit of increase. It\u2019s probably in the $30 million, $40 million, $50 million range for SG&A spending. We have consciously over the last 12 months in this year made the decision on SG&A spending not to be penny wise and pound foolish. We\u2019re kind of at an unprecedented period of time in what we\u2019ve gone through in 2013 in launching TECFIDERA in the US. We\u2019re very excited to be launching TECHFIDERA in Europe after a lot of hard work in the back end of the year and the same thing on hemophilia. I think that what we\u2019re doing right now is making sure we really appropriately fund all these launches and as we move into 2015 we\u2019ll take a much more critical eye towards really trying to get SG&A leverage which we\u2019ve talked about. I can\u2019t really exactly tell you the amount at this point but we\u2019re going to be taking a much more critical eye. So, I think we pivot mentally from really thinking hard about making sure we fund these critical launches to kind of pivoting towards looking to making sure we\u2019re not over funding and over expensing on the items in the P&L. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Matt Roden \u2013 UBS. Matt Roden \u2013 UBS: Tony, you mentioned the five weeks of inventory for TECFIDERA, we understand that weekly demand is still growing but are we getting to the point in the launch in the US that we need to think about normalization of that inventory as we think ahead to second quarter and second half of the year? Then also, you guys have recently commented on the pricing approach for ALPROLIX which on a net basis looks to be about parity, just wondering if we should assume you\u2019ll adopt the same philosophy with ELOCTATE as well? Paul J. Clancy : I\u2019ll take the first part of that. I think that\u2019s overall correct is that we will probably likely see not as much increase in terms of inventory in the channel. We keep a watchful eye on that. We are a bit of a player in that but certainly what\u2019s most important is to make sure the specialty pharmacies have product for the patient and the wholesalers don\u2019t have any kind of excessive product. I think if you just look at the run rate I think there may be a little bit of upward inventory over the next few quarters but I think it certainly moderates in terms of the impact. Tony Kingsley : On the ALPROLIX pricing as you know, the math can get complicated but I think your read of the basic intent is right. No comment at this point how that might translate to [other CPD]. Operator :  Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham \u2013 JP Morgan. Geoff Meacham \u2013 JP Morgan : A high level question for you Tony, when you look at US TECFIDERA you\u2019ve obviously been in the market for the year, what types of MS patients are coming on today and how does that compare to when you launched? Then a question for Doug, I know it\u2019s tough on the LINGO opportunity to say specifically, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a lot of data out there, but how does a compromised blood/brain barrier correlated to disease severity, or say progression, or say relapse frequency, things like that that try to correlate that outcome to the clinical benefit or worsening? Tony Kingsley : Look, I think the interesting thing is there\u2019s not a dramatic change in the [inaudible] and it speaks a little bit more to the start the product got off too. As I think we pointed out early days, we got a meaningful portion of newly diagnosed pretty much out of the gate and captured a nice portion of the switch pool at a broad level. I think those dynamics are still true today. There\u2019s probably a little shift in the switch pool in terms of the nature of what patients were getting and what reasons between tolerability and efficacy but it\u2019s actually a little bit more the same.  The only other wrinkle I\u2019d add to it, which is interesting, is we think TECFIDERA is keeping people from leaving the market. The market has a group of people that quite therapy every year and a group of people that return, what our research suggests is that there are fewer patients who might have quit the market absent this alternative who are staying in the market and I think that\u2019s encouraging. Douglas E. Williams: As far as the LINGO question and the relationship with the blood/brain barrier, what happens when there\u2019s a new lesion that develops, a relapse if you will, is that you get local breakdown of the blood/brain barrier. That\u2019s because the release of all the inflammatory mediators that takes place locally. The point I was alluding to is that because of that localized impact on the blood/brain barrier you\u2019re going to get a relatively higher concentration of the drug in those lesions at the time the barrier breaks down which is not to say that you\u2019re not going to get drug to other older lesions, that should happen as well and in fact, the Phase 1 data confirms that we are getting sufficient quantity of drug to match the sort of IC90 level in the animal models in patients with MS in their cerebral spinal fluid. So, we know we\u2019re getting drug into the brain in quantities that sort of match up with what we saw to be efficacious in the animal models, but on a relative basis, just because of the physiology of the blood/brain barrier with a new lesion, you\u2019ll get relatively more delivered locally to a new lesion. Operator :  Your next question comes from Terence Flynn \u2013 Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn \u2013 Goldman Sachs : First on just the top line raise, I was wondering if you can give us anymore color behind the drivers there? Is that solely TECFIDERA or anything else you\u2019re seeing? Then the kind of follow up question to Eric\u2019s on AVONEX\u2019s resiliency on the US, is there anything different on the European side that we should consider as we think about that franchise and its resiliency in Europe? Paul J. Clancy : The color on the raise that I give you, and this is versus our expectations and our kind of original guidance, is around the buoyance seen in AVONEX and TECFIDERA. So, it isn\u2019t per say that we see a different forecast on TECFIDERA. I think the US in TECFIDERA is kind of marching along our expectations is really five to six weeks into Europe and to Germany. So it\u2019s a little early to call for that on TECFIDERA. But, what we have seen kind of just one quarter in is just AVONEX and TECFIDERA not being as impacted as much in the last 90 to 120 days. Tony Kingsley : On AVONEX the answer actually differs market-by-market. There are some markets where we have higher dose high frequency interferon have lower share, etc., so I think it\u2019s going to be the sum of Europe is the sum of a bunch of different parts. We believe similar to the US that AVONEX should do as well or better on a proportional basis as the injectables proportion of the market declines. Again, that will differ market-by-market on average, that remains our belief but we\u2019ll have to see as TECFIDERA rolls out across market-to-market what the individual impacts are. Operator :  (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Matthew Harrison \u2013 Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Just two quick ones for me, one on TECFIDERA in Europe you told us you\u2019ve gotten reimbursement in Norway and Scotland and that you expect reimbursement in a bunch of other geographies. I was wondering if you might be willing to help us think about what those geographies are. Then second, on TYSABRI the sequential growth in the US looks when I looked over the last couple years, what you saw this quarter was actually the second worst and the first worst was sort of when TECFIDERA launched? So I\u2019m just wondering if you can help us in terms of units? I\u2019m just wondering if you can help us think about what was going on there and was it TECFIDERA driven or something else? Tony Kingsley : So we haven\u2019t laid out a very specific schedule of what sequence we think the countries will get reimbursement in. As you know, it\u2019s multiple independent events. We\u2019ve said a lot of these markets it\u2019s a kind of 12 to 18 month timeframe and the generalization is the northern European markets tend to move on a little faster pace, the southern European markets then move on a little slower pace. But we think towards the end of the year and around the turn of the year we\u2019ll start to see some meaningful reimbursement decisions if you look at where [inaudible] national reimbursement processes typically goes on a timeline. Paul J. Clancy : I would want to point out there\u2019s a little bit of noise in the last five quarters that you kind of see even on the graph in the earnings slide deck and what I\u2019d point out is in Q1 and Q2 of last year there was inventory movement that arose out of the transaction. So Q1 actually kind of moved revenue up by about $25 million or $26 million and as a result Q2 was depressed by that amount in the United States. I believe it\u2019s in one of the footnotes.  Then, as it relates to Q1 2014 the one thing I would point out is that just the uniqueness of the way we ship TYSABRI, Q1 2014 actually had 12 shipping weeks versus all the prior quarters last year had 13 shipping weeks and it\u2019s just a function of we essentially ship on Tuesdays. It\u2019s essentially a function of the number of Tuesdays in a quarter so it\u2019s quite peculiar. Now, if you rise above all that, when we look at our patient data, when we look at our discontinuations, when we look at our patient adds we still believe there\u2019s still a fair amount of homework to get TYSABRI moving in the right direction but we believe those metrics are moving in the right direction. Discontinuations were meaningfully impacted through the second and third quarter last year as many patients moved to TECFIDERA but we\u2019re seeing discontinuations come back to a more normal level and we\u2019re seeing actually patient adds coming into the TYSABRI franchise that is solid performance. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Weber \u2013 Citi. Yaron Weber \u2013 Citi: I\u2019ve got a couple of quick questions. One, Tony, just housekeeping we\u2019re hearing that the TECFIDERA drop out due to the typical GI is around 15% to 20%. I think it was around 10 initially, it sounds up it went up a little bit, is that what you\u2019re seeing? Then secondly, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s for Doug or for [inaudible], but it\u2019s a question on LINGO. When you\u2019re looking at your primary end point whether it\u2019s optic neuritis, the fore field [inaudible] potential or in MS where you\u2019re using this neurofunctional neurocongnitive decline or stability in three or more months. My question is how validated are these end points in terms of your ability to adequately power against the control arm? Just help me understand a little bit how validated have you been on the studies just so we really kind of understand what to expect? Tony Kingsley : The short answer to your question is I don\u2019t think we have any strong signal that GI is moving up or down. We\u2019re obviously monitoring that on a regular basis through a whole bunch of different data sources and no signal that there\u2019s a meaningful trend in one direction or the other. Douglas E. Williams: With respect to the endpoints, I think the endpoints that we\u2019ve chosen to use are well validated endpoints. I mean, certainly not only visual [inaudible] potential, it gives you a hard number in terms of nerve conduction velocity but also the low contrast visual acuity endpoint in that study is one that\u2019s been used for other drugs for registrational purposes. So the endpoints I believe are hard. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve released the power calculation but suffice to say that these studies are large enough and well powered enough for us to feel comfortable about whether or not we will make a go no go decision based on the data that comes out.  I should also point out that the other endpoint in the MS study is ESS progression as well so we\u2019re looking at well validated tried and true endpoints in these studies on the basis of which to make our decision to go to Phase 3. Operator :  Your next question comes from Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo. Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo : On the Alzheimer\u2019s front you\u2019re looking primarily at imaging endpoints with 037 and clinical endpoints with 2401 so I\u2019m wondering how do you put all that information together to determine which antibody to move forward with, in what population you might proceed. Then real quick, I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re expecting any shifts in US reimbursement dynamics in the MS space given some of the concerns out there for pricing for other specialty drug classes? Douglas E. Williams: With respect to the two different antibodies in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, you\u2019re correct that there is a straight cognition endpoint with the Eisai molecule. We\u2019ve also built that in as exploratory endpoints in the BIIB037 study so the primary endpoint of the study is based on imaging as you point out but we\u2019ve also built in [FDG PET] as sort of the surrogate for improvement in synaptic activity. We consider that to be sort of a surrogate clinical endpoint but we\u2019re also looking at cognition and we hope to see a trend in cognition in that study as well. So, there are a number of endpoints that will help drive the decision making with respect to BIIB037 including both imaging and clinical endpoints as well. Paul J. Clancy : On the second part of your question I mean no real additional color to provide. Certainly, we\u2019re cognoscente that it could be a challenging environment. In multiple sclerosis the patient mix is kind of 80% private. At this point we\u2019re very comfortable with our formulary status so we\u2019ll just have to continue to see where the landscape takes us. Operator :  Your next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas \u2013 Deutsche Bank. Robyn Karnauskas \u2013 Deutsche Bank : The first question, on LINGO I know that it\u2019s a six month trial and I\u2019ve heard from some physicians that some patients can recover faster than that especially with steroids so what are your thoughts on whether or not you\u2019ll be able to see a difference between the treatment control arm giving the time element and how quickly LINGO might be able to act? The second question, what percentage of hemophilia treatments [inaudible] trial and what percentage of patients do you think would be the people who would switch first to new therapy? Douglas E. Williams: With respect to LINGO, you\u2019re correct that there are some patients that do respond to steroid therapy and show an improvement. The natural history studies that have been done looking at the kinetics of that improvement were taking into account when we actually powered the study to hopefully see a treatment effect in LINGO versus placebo. So, remember this is a placebo control trial that is randomized. It is on top of standard of care and so we took the natural history data into account when we designed the study both in terms of duration and in terms of the design of the endpoints. Paul J. Clancy : On the trail question on hemo, we\u2019re a little bit searching each other for that answer so I don\u2019t think we have it handy but what I would point out is a couple of things. It was only about 120 or 125 patients and in fact, it was a worldwide trial and part of the rationale in a worldwide trial with the worldwide approval but also because we just needed to get to sites around the world in order to get to those patient numbers. Fundamentally we don\u2019t believe the gating issue on launch is going to be the dynamic that you\u2019re poking at. I think we just fundamentally believe that there\u2019s a big unmet need in the marketplace for longer acting factors and that will probably carry the weight. Operator :  Your next question comes from Ying Huang \u2013 Barclays Capital. Ying Huang \u2013 Barclays Capital : First of all, we know that there\u2019s potential the FDA could approve a generic version of [COPAXONE] in May. I was wondering your thought on the impact on the pricing for the whole MS therapy class? Then secondly, on your collaboration with Eisai here for the [inaudible], it looks like there\u2019s encouraging [CFF beta level] lowering which is also [inaudible] but then how much faith do you have that there is a correlation between that and then the clinical endpoint in the trials? For example the [inaudible]? Tony Kingsley : We\u2019ve said before our expectation and our business plan does assume that there will be generic [COPAXONE] in the market this year. Obviously, there remains some uncertainty around that but we plan for it. Short term, we think the impact is on branded [COPAXONE] itself. We\u2019ve also said it adds pressure to the overall market over time because it becomes an additional option that payers can use but we think it\u2019s a very tough thing for payers to force a step out or switch to generic. Douglas E. Williams: With respect to the base inhibitor, as far as the target itself there is some pretty strong genetic evidence that the enzyme itself is an important target in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. That\u2019s based on some recent data from an Icelandic cohort showing that patients who had a specific mutation in an around the [cleavage] site where the base one enzyme clips, those patients had about a 40% reduction in the amount of beta amyloid peptide that they produced and that was completely protective for those patients if they had that mutation even in the face of ApoE4, that was a protected mutation. So, 40% seems to be the target at least in terms of lifelong inhibition of the enzyme. The [inaudible] data from Phase 1 shows that you can dose escalate the compound and get to levels of inhibition sort of north of 90% at safe doses. So, we think that we have a compound that\u2019s capable of blocking the enzyme at levels that are sufficient to be meaningful and with respect to the ADAS-cog endpoint it is an accepted endpoint for clinical trials and we think it\u2019s probably the most sensitive and most validated measure to use for these studies. The target is good, the endpoint is good and appropriate and we\u2019ll wait to see the data. Operator :  I will now turn the conference back over to our presenters. George A. Scangos: Thank you all for your attention today, for all the questions, and we can now all get back to work. Thanks. Operator :  This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Tiffany and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Idec Q2 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Claudine Prowse, Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Claudine Prowse : Thank you. And welcome to Biogen Idec\u2019s second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogenidec.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in tables one and two. Table three includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflects how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult our SEC filings for additional detail. On today\u2019s call, I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. George Scangos; Dr. Doug Williams, EVP of Research and Development; Tony Kingsley, EVP of Global Commercial Operations; and our CFO, Paul Clancy. We will also be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Al Sandrock. Now, I will turn the call over to George. George Scangos : Well, thanks Claudine and good morning everybody and thanks for joining us today. Biogen Idec had a great second quarter, strong financial performance and several key pipeline accomplishments. So, as we recap these achievements today, we believe that our continued progress reflects the strength of our underlying business and good execution towards our 2014 goals. Our core multiple sclerosis franchise performed remarkably well and we continue to see an increase in number of patients using our therapies. TECFIDERA continues to gain market share and we believe it\u2019s on track to become the leading MS therapy in the U.S. The early months of our European launch reinforce our belief that TECFIDERA will continue to be a major value contributor to the company. AVONEX and TYSABRI also performed well as physicians and patients continued to look to them as the injectable and high efficacy therapies [inaudible]. With these important medicines available to patients, we believe that we have a product portfolio that makes us the global leader in the treatment of MS. In our late-stage pipeline, we moved forward two new potential therapeutic options for relapsing MS patients this quarter. PLEGRIDY received the positive CHMP opinion in Europe and at this point, I will diverge from my prepared statements to say that just this morning as we are sitting in the room preparing for the call, we received the letter from the EU saying that PLEGRIDY have been approved. We haven\u2019t had a chance to look at the label or any details yet, which we will do. And when we are through that, we will issue a press release, but since we are sitting here, PLEGRIDY has now been approved in the EU. We also reported positive top line results from the Phase 3 trial of Daclizumab and should all these products complete registration, we will have six important medicines that offer MS patients with different needs. Moving beyond the MS franchise, we launched ALPROLIX, the long-lasting therapy for hemophilia B and received FDA approval of ELOCTATE, our therapy for hemophilia A. These products mark our entry into a major new therapeutic area. ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE represent the first meaningful innovations in the treatment of hemophilia in many years and reflect our mission to help renewed therapies to patients who are underserved. We believe that these therapies have the potential to meaningfully reduce treatment burden and significantly improve patients\u2019 lives. These accomplishments are reflected in our strong quarterly financial performance with a 40% growth in revenues and a 52% growth in non-GAAP EPS year-over-year. And as Paul will discuss this quarter\u2019s financial performance also benefited from the approval of an agreement with AIFA relating to TYSABRI sales in Italy. We have also made excellent progress in Japan which is an important strategic priority for us as we expand our global presence. We have recently obtained Japanese approval for TYSABRI and ALPROLIX and filed a marketing application for ELOCTATE earlier this year. The expansion of our products into Japan allows us the opportunity to introduce new treatment options to patients and physicians in new regions around the world. We believe that Japan represents an attractive long-term growth opportunity for our company. So we had an eventful and productive quarter with a lot of exciting developments. And I will now pass the call over to Doug. Doug Williams : Thanks George and good morning everyone. We and our collaborator AbbVie recently announced positive top line Phase 3 data for Daclizumab HYP in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Based on this study and previous clinical data we are working expeditiously to file an application for regulatory approval of Daclizumab. We believe that if approved, Daclizumab could be an additional effective therapeutic option to treat this heterogeneous disease. A number of our other clinical programs continue to advance. In the coming 12 to 18 months we anticipate Phase 3 data from TYSABRI in SPMS as well as data from earlier stage programs including BIIB037 in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, neublastin in neuropathic pain, STX-100 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, anti-CD40 ligand in general lupus and anti-LINGO in both acute optic neuritis and multiple sclerosis. We would like to take the opportunity to review our ongoing anti-LINGO clinical studies and clarify the timing of anticipated data readouts. The Phase 2 program remains on track and includes two studies, one in MS and the other in acute optic neuritis. We believe the totality of data from these studies would provide us with a clearer understanding of anti-LINGO\u2019s potential in both clinical settings. The goal of the acute optic neuritis study is to demonstrate proof of mechanism in humans. We will examine whether anti-LINGO is able to protect and repair the optic nerve when given shortly after the acute damage caused by a demyelinating lesion of the optic nerve or optic neuritis. The study will examine various end points including novel end points developed by Biogen Idec. The primary end point visual evoked potential will measure effects on optic nerve signal conduction. We will also use optical coherence tomography imaging to determine if anti-LINGO treatment impacts the viability of axons in the optic nerve and retinal ganglion cells. As an exploratory end point this study includes objective and patient reported outcome measures to examine any potential benefit on visual function. The study is fully enrolled and we expect to disclose top line results in January 2015 and full data disclosure at a 2015 medical meeting. In the second study we are evaluating whether anti-LINGO can facilitate remyelination and functional improvement in patients with active relapsing MS. Primary end point is a clinical composite measure testing various aspects of both physical and cognitive improvement. As exploratory end points we will also examine various advanced brain imaging techniques to detect potential remyelination and axon preservation as well as numerous blood and CSF biomarkers. The MS study is designed treat patients for approximately 18 months with the primary efficacy end points being evaluated at the end of that period. There will be a preliminary look at data after all patients have reached 12 months of treatment duration to inform future study planning. Based on current enrollment rates which are ahead of projections, we expect the interim look to occur in the second half of 2015. Investigators, patients and the study management team will remain blinded in order to preserve the integrity of the ongoing study. We expect MS study results to be presented at a scientific meeting in 2016. We look forward to sharing additional data as our pipeline advances. I will now pass the call to Tony. Tony Kingsley : Thanks Doug. The second quarter marked another strong performance for our commercial organization. We think we have demonstrated that we can launch multiple products while also maximizing our base business. This has been no small feed for our company and I am very pleased with how the commercial team has executed and driven results. Let\u2019s start with MS. We continue to grow our MS market share through executing our franchise strategy. TECFIDERA in the U.S. continued on a solid trajectory. TECFIDERA has been broadly used across numerous patient segments, newly diagnosed switches prompted by efficacy and non-efficacy reasons as well as patients returning to the market. We believe TECFIDERA is generally viewed by physicians and patients as efficacious with an attractive safety profile and a manageable tolerability profile. Importantly, patient retention rates have been similar to other marketed MS therapies and in line with our expectations. Outside the U.S., TECFIDERA is off to a strong start. In countries where we have launched, including Germany, the uptake for TECFIDERA has been encouraging, where we had been more cautious about uptake in Europe given TECFIDERA\u2019s later entry in the markets, where other orals had a stronger foothold, we now believe that we see launch trajectories that are similar to what we experienced in the U.S. We are also making good progress on reimbursement. Currently, we have obtained full reimbursement in six markets and TECFIDERA is also available in a number of other countries with limited reimbursement. In the UK, we recently received a favorable pricing decision from NICE and we expect to obtain full reimbursement in most of the other large MS markets by the end of 2015. During the quarter, AVONEX gained share among interferon therapies. As expected, injectable therapies continued to decline as patients move toward oral therapies. While global units for AVONEX declined 7% year-over-year, AVONEX has shown staying power in a dynamic market. We look forward to the potential launch of PLEGRIDY to extend our leadership in interferon. We believe PLEGRIDY has the potential to provide MS patients a combination of strong efficacy, a safety profile consistent with the MS beta interferon class and a SubQ auto injector administered every two weeks. Across markets, TYSABRI demand remains solid as physicians continued to choose this therapy for patients requiring high efficacy. The U.S. TYSABRI business improved as patient retention rates are stabilizing and are now similar to pre-TECFIDERA launch. TYSABRI performance in Europe was also favorable despite the increased oral competition. We continue to focus on execution and despite an increasingly crowded market we believe neurologists continue to view TYSABRI as having unique power to control disease. Turning to hemophilia, ALPROLIX is off to a solid start since its introduction to the U.S. market in May. Our focus to-date has been in two areas raising awareness of the therapy\u2019s attributes and streamlining patient access. Our field forces build strong relationships with customers and is achieving its early goals of reach and frequency with hemophilia treatment centers or HTCs. As of the end of the quarter, approximately one-third of HTCs had prescribed ALPROLIX, which we believe indicates very good initial interest. Early indications suggest ALPROLIX has not faced significant hurdles with reimbursement. We have also established financial and patient support programs which have enabled a smooth initial launch. As expected, we believe the majority of ALPROLIX patients have started with once weekly prophylaxis, a significant improvement over the current standard of care of two or more prophylactic infusions per week. Turning to ELOCTATE, we are pleased to have launched ELOCTATE in the U.S. last week with what we believe to be a competitive label. Our initial objectives are focused on extensive education to physicians, payers and advocacy groups. And we are also beginning to expedite access for patients starting on ELOCTATE. We are pleased with the performance of the commercial organization. Across an expanding portfolio of therapies, we believe we are demonstrating strong execution and solid results. I will now pass the call to Paul. Paul Clancy : Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.01 in the second quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the second quarter were $3.49. I will provide additional details on the AIFA agreement, which benefited both revenue and earnings in Q2 in a minute. Walking down the P&L let me start with revenues. Total revenue for the second quarter grew 40% year-over-year to approximately $2.4 billion. Second quarter AVONEX worldwide revenue was $774 million. In the U.S., Q2 AVONEX revenue increased 4% compared to prior year to $498 million. And outside the U.S., Q2 AVONEX revenue was $276 million, a decrease of 6% compared to prior year. Global TECFIDERA revenue was $700 million in Q2. In the U.S., TECFIDERA revenue was $585 million. We\u2019re very pleased with the compliance in gross to net performance which provided a benefit to revenue in the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately 3.5 weeks of inventory in the channel, which includes specialty pharmacies and wholesalers. This is a slight decline versus prior quarter. International TECFIDERA revenue was approximately $115 million as the launch in Germany has exceeded our expectations. Germany represented approximately three quarters of our ex-U.S. revenues. TYSABRI worldwide revenue net of hedging was $533 million in the second quarter. These results were comprised of $250 million in the U.S. and $284 million internationally. TYSABRI benefited from two events which helped the year-over-year comparison. Recall during the first quarter of 2013, we increased inventory levels in anticipation of the asset transfer from Elan to Biogen Idec. This equated to in-market revenues of approximately $26 million, increasing Q1 of 2013 and decreasing Q2 of 2013. In the second quarter of this year, TYSABRI revenues outside the U.S. included the impact of an agreement with AIFA. Our agreement with AIFA provided for the elimination of the reimbursement limit related to TYSABRI sales in Italy from February 2013 going forward. As a result, we recorded approximately $54 million of previously deferred revenues related to the period from February 2013 through March 31, 2014. In the second quarter we recorded TYSABRI revenues in Italy at the full reimbursed price, which increased revenues by approximately $14 million versus prior trend. We continue to be in discussions with AIFA to resolve our dispute concerning the periods February 2009 to January 2013. Nevertheless we\u2019ll be booking revenues at the full reimbursed price going forward. Adjusting for these items, we\u2019re very pleased to see TYSABRI experience low double-digit revenue growth in the second quarter. Moving to hemophilia, ALPROLIX revenue in Q2 its first quarter on the market was $10 million. Turning to our anti-CD20 franchise, U.S. profit share was $285 million for the second quarter and royalties and profit-sharing sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. were $18 million. The result was $303 million of net revenue from unconsolidated joint business. Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q2 cost of goods sold were $292 million or 12% of revenue. Q2 non-GAAP R&D expense was $446 million or 18% of revenue which includes approximately $40 million in milestone and other payments related to our collaborations with Eisai and Isis. Q2 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $540 million or 22% of total revenue. Our Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 27%. During the quarter, as part of our shared stabilization plan, we repurchased $1.2 million for a total of approximately $340 million. Our weighted average diluted shares were $237 million and we ended the quarter with approximately $2.6 billion in cash and marketable securities which approximately two-thirds within the U.S. As a reminder, we expect to enter a period of large TECFIDERA CVR payments to the former shareholders of Fumapharm. In Q2, we accrued $150 million as we reached $2 billion in accumulative sales of TECFIDERA. This brings us to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $3.49 million for the second quarter, an increase of 52%. Now, let me turn to our updated full year 2014 guidance. We now expect total revenue growth between 38% and 41%. Clearly, this change represents a meaningful increase from prior guidance owing primarily to the growth of TECFIDERA in the U.S. and EU, the strength of our other MS therapies and clarity on the AIFA pricing matter. Let me provide additional color. First in the U.S. underlying demand for TECFIDERA, in addition to compliance in gross to net dynamics are all anticipated to be favorable throughout 2014 compared to our prior plan. In Europe, as Tony noted, we had originally assumed TECFIDERA would have experienced a slower uptake than the U.S. due to delayed launch. Our forecast now assumes TECFIDERA uptake in Europe similar to what we saw in the U.S. on a country by country rollout. We continue to expect Germany will be the primary TECFIDERA revenue driver outside the U.S. for 2014. And it does continue to appear that TECFIDERA has expanded the market. Second, we believe AVONEX and TYSABRI performance will remain resilient each carving solid roles in the market. And our 2014 guidance now includes the impact of the agreement with AIFA as we picked up the previously deferred revenue and will no longer defer revenue for the balance of the year. The full year impact from the AIFA agreement is favorable by approximately $96 million versus prior guidance. R&D expense is expected to be between 20% and 21% of sales. Our full year R&D forecast now includes greater than $150 million for the balance of the year for business development opportunities. Coupled with what we have spent on Eisai and Sangamo, this represents over $300 million for the full year in increase over prior guidance. This remains strategically important focus for the company. However, if we cannot find high quality pipeline assets by the end of the year, some of this amount may drop to the bottom line. SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 22% to 23% of revenue. SG&A now includes increased investments in 2014 associated with the ongoing TECFIDERA and hemophilia launches. We realized this is a meaningful increase in SG&A dollars and remain committed to SG&A leverage in 2015. The result we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share between $12.90 and $13.10 and GAAP EPS to be between $11.26 and $11.46. Turn the call over to George for his closing comments. George Scangos : Okay, thanks Paul. So, in closing, we had another productive quarter. And we successfully executed against several key objectives. We said earlier this year that our goals for 2014 were aggressive and would require focus and dedication from our employees and we have made significant progress. Well, with the second half of the year yet to go, we still have a number of product launches and pipeline milestones ahead of us. So, our efforts over the coming months will focus on the launch of four new products in two distinct therapeutic areas, a real challenge for a company of our size. We will continue to launch TECFIDERA across the EU as we work to expand marketing approval across the globe. We anticipate both U.S. and EU launch of PLEGRIDY for relapsing MS. And that\u2019s an important part of our strategy for maintaining our leadership among the injectable products for MS. And then the continued launch of our hemophilia products, ALPROLIX for hemophilia B in the U.S. and other countries, including Japan and ELOCTATE for hemophilia A, an important step towards revenue diversification. We also expect an important part of our long-term value creation will come from a number of mid-stage proof of biology and proof of concept readouts this year and next. Our strategy for sustainable growth centers on deep commitment to the patient leveraging our areas of expertise in neurology, hematology, and immunology while continuing to focus on innovation. We believe that if we anchor ourselves on these three tenets, patients will benefit and meaningful shareholder value creation should follow. As always, I want to thank our employees who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patient\u2019s lives and the patients and physicians who are involved in our clinical development programs. The achievements we have made together could not have been realized without their steadfast passion and commitment. So, thank you all for joining us this morning. And operator, we will now open up the call for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets.: Hey, great. Thanks. Good morning. On TECFIDERA just drilling down a little bit, the beat was just significantly higher than anyone would have thought, so just trying to understand the compliance you mentioned, do you think that that\u2019s actually getting better that there is less dropouts over time. Is there anything there that you are seeing? There are still lot of people out there suggesting that, that\u2019s a hindrance for some patients, who maybe just thinking about that compliance rate over last year? And then just as a follow-up for Paul, there has been a lot of things in the industry as it relates to M&A in domestic and foreign companies, have you rather been thinking about this, is there any comments you can make as it relates to tax strategy, are there things you can do to impact your margins such as it will be your AbbVie collaboration, maybe any comments around that would be helpful? Thanks. Paul Clancy : Michael, this is Paul. I will try to take both of them. Yes, we are very pleased with the TECFIDERA results for the quarter, but I\u2019d say it was across both Europe and the U.S. When we refer to compliance, we are actually referring to essentially the number of pills patient takes over the course of the month, if you will. That\u2019s slightly different than discontinuation rates, which is \u2013 or persistency, which I think you had kind of referred to. The persistency in discontinuation rates, are still a little bit opaque for us. So, I think that what we said in the past around kind of 10% to 20% over the course of the year, I think we still believe that and that\u2019s kind of the triangulation of the data, but I think the TECFIDERA numbers were just kind of real good performance in compliance better than expectations in the United States on gross to net and certainly the German launch has exceeded our expectations. We are probably about 5.5 months into the German launch, were a little bit less time in a few other countries, but we are very pleased with the performance in Europe. With respect to inversions, it\u2019s obviously a very topical, I mean, you can\u2019t kind of open up the journal any day without having \u2013 being able to read an article on re-domiciling. It\u2019s clearly something that we have thought about over the years, right. I mean, we didn\u2019t ask that purchase agreement with Elan a year ago. So, the course of time leading into that, we clearly thought about it, because the ability to do that has been around for a long period of time. I will give you a couple of perspectives on how we think about it, because I\u2019d certainly don\u2019t want you to lead into that we are all excited about it just given the press news.  And kind of just a level point, let me explain our effective tax rate is kind of a combination of the RITUXAN cash flow, which is really all U.S. cash flow, so it\u2019s going to be a high 30s percent on that cash flow in everything else that is probably more biopharmaceutical like. Even re-domiciling without IP migration would not meaningfully affect the RITUXAN cash flow tax rate. And we generally cost share assets in our pipeline. So, that\u2019s the way to think about our tax rate as it stands now. The way we conceptually think about a business combination which would result in re-domiciling is all the benefits of re-domiciling are essentially like a synergy. And of course you always want to try to get synergies in the business, but we don\u2019t think that\u2019s a rationale for a business combination, that it has to make the industrial logic first and foremost. So, if there is industrial logic which we just have not seen around a business combination, then there would be a possibility for that. I think the other thing to point out for Biogen Idec, a major consideration for us, which is probably more acute than others is for our long-term shareholders, it would result in a meaningful capital gains, just the result of \u2013 we have shareholders that have been in the stock for a very long period of time. And with the capital appreciation in the stock, that\u2019s a major, major consideration that we think about. So, that\u2019s a little bit of perspective. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Ravi Mehrotra - Credit Suisse : Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. First one for George, it\u2019s been very nice this year that you flagged the intention to enter into new, early and mid-stage business development opportunities, given the fine form and front running commercial performance you have delivered in the first two [furlongs] [ph] of this year, do you see potential for either greater focus on these deals and which domains would you like to dominate by these deals? Let me sneak another one in for Doug, so on anti-LINGO, how will the RENEW and SYNERGY data influenced the Phase 3 trial endpoints? Do you see more of an evolution or revolution in endpoints normally seen in Phase 3 MS studies? Thank you. George Scangos : Okay, Ravi, it\u2019s George. I will take the first part of your question. Look I think the \u2013 we have said for a while now that our strategy was to continue to build out our pipeline, so that we can have a high-quality pipeline of sufficient size to generate additional value as we go forward. We have done a number of business development deals already a couple this year, certainly several last year and we will continue to do them. I don\u2019t see any big divergence from what we have done in the past. As Paul said, we have money now in the budget for additional deals this year, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean we are going to go spend it, right. Then we have money available if and when the appropriate technologies or product opportunities come our way. We will focus in our areas of expertise, so neurodegenerative diseases, immunology, hematology, I think there is a big advantage to sticking to our knitting and focusing in areas where we have real expertise. A lot of this business is based on information arbitrage and getting some insights that are not everybody has and we believe that\u2019s an important part of our strategy. We have done that focusing now for years. And I will continue to work in those areas, where we believe we have a real depth of knowledge. Doug Williams : And Ravi, this is Doug. I will take your question about revolution or evolution with respect to SYNERGY and the endpoints. I guess that\u2019s in the eye of the beholder, but I think what we are trying to do here with this study is learn as much as we can about the correlation between re-myelination and the impact on what we think are important parameters of disease progression in these patients. What we are hoping to see with the study is actually an improvement in EDSS and a change in cognition. Cognition is not a sort of traditional endpoint if you will from a regulatory approval perspective, but we think it\u2019s important in terms of understanding the totality of impact on re-myelination in the brain of patients with relapsing forms of MS and actually progressive forms as well. So, I think the study is designed to collect and capture as much information as we can. The paradigm that we are trying to put forward is to improve outcomes for patients and not just stabilize disease. So, I think in that regard, it\u2019s probably somewhat revolutionary. And I think that the study is designed in a way to guide us forward not only with LINGO, but with other strategies that we have got further back in the pipeline that are also geared towards re-myelinating, BIIB061 being the first candidate to go forward. So, I think it\u2019s important that we run the study in a blinded fashion through the full 18 months of the study and that was the decision that we made and we have talked about in my comments in the earnings call. And I think that, that will give us the information we need to plan on appropriate Phase 3 study, where we are looking to change the treatment paradigm in MS by actually causing improvement in outcomes for patients as opposed to just stabilizing disease. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Your line is open. Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just one topic that hasn\u2019t been addressed yet on this call, but I\u2019d just like to get your dug analyses on the call, just get your current thinking at TYSABRI in SPMS, what will be the biologic rationale for TYSABRI to actually show efficacy in that indication? And then my second question, I promise is very easy, what\u2019s \u2013 Paul, what\u2019s the \u2013 can you just remind us roughly what the German prices for TECFIDERA and whether or not that could change? Thank you. Al Sandrock : Hi, Mark. This is Al Sandrock. On TYSABRI SPMS, there is continues to be emerging data that gives positive signals potentially for how TYSABRI could work, one is that there was a publication earlier this year labeled, it was called the study of the proof-of-concept of Natalizumab in SPMS, it was published by a Danish group. And it shows that when you look at CSF neurofilament levels, that levels drop after starting TYSABRI treatment and kind of the drop occurred within six to nine months. So, I think that\u2019s yet of more evidence in addition to the evidence we have been talking about for a couple of years now, which is the CXCL13 decrease which is a market of follicular dendritic cells, which we think are important in organizing these meningeal lymphoid follicle that in about half the patients seem to be important for progression in SPMS. So I think there is continuing biological data that tells us that we could potentially see a positive effect with Natalizumab in SPMS. George Scangos : Yes. And Mark, just for the quick response in the German price, it\u2019s in the low-20s on an euro basis, on an annual cost of therapy which gets essentially to right around $30,000 annual cost of therapy in Germany right now. And that as you know is in the one year \u201cfree pricing\u201d period. So it\u2019s actually important to keep in mind. So I appreciate you kind of pointing it out, important to keep in mind that as we spin into 2015, we will likely move into a different more negotiated price likely through the (AVONEX) process. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein. Your line is open. Geoffrey Porges - Bernstein: Thanks very much for taking the question and again congratulations on really terrific results with particularly TECFIDERA in Europe. I will try and slip into as it seems to be the fashion, could we just be clear on the LINGO MS study, we wanted to hear in 2015 the results of the 12-month analysis, but we will hear the 18 month results disclosed presumably not to \u201916. And then secondly Tony could you just give us a little bit more color on exactly where TECFIDERA is in the ex-German markets, not the smaller markets but the other big five European countries, when you expect to actually get the launch going there? Doug Williams : Geoff, this is Doug. You are correct that the data flow is as you describe it. We will \u2013 a small team internally will have access to the 12-month data, but we have decided that it\u2019s important to avoid the possibility of creating bias in the study outcomes to maintain our disclosure in 2016. So once the study is fully complete, we will disclose the data at that time. And we think it\u2019s important to keep the study blinded between the 12 and 18 month timeframe and that will kick the disclosure over into 2016 as you described. Tony Kingsley : Yes, it\u2019s Tony. On ex-U.S., so we have \u2013 you saw the nice opinion from the UK, the process once they have issued the (FAD) is 6 to 8 weeks, we give guidance and then there is a couple of months to get funding and so thank you for. By the time the funding hits market we are in the market in France in a limited way in the hospital channel, negotiations ongoing. We also think that\u2019s Q4 timings in Italy would likely be 2015 well hard to handicap, but we think first half 2015. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen and Company : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe for Paul or George, it sounds like business is good, the revenue stream is increasingly diversified, the outlook is very favorable, you are building cash so I guess some, I am asking about your capital reallocation plan and thoughts on the dividend or a substantial share buyback. George Scangos : Thanks Eric. Yes, important question. So we have certainly rebuilt the cash position over the last 12 months. If \u2013 as we have talked about this 12 months ago, following the asset purchase of TYSABRI we were running on fumes that has changed meaningfully as the business has performed quite well. We want to continue to be cognizant over the kind of next couple of year time period that we are probably greater than I would have expected have the potential for the CVR tech related payments just to come may be at a quicker phase. Those obviously turn out as people know, but we want to be mindful of that. We continue our strategic bias is remains these tuck-in acquisitions where we think its core of the business and great internal rates of return and all that. With that said, more than likely we have excess cash over the next number of years. We have been having very constructive conversations over the last couple of months with our shareholders. On this topic, not all of them, but a number of them, I think we completely agree it\u2019s one of the more important judgments that we have. We agree that it is \u2013 it is all about deploying this and returning it in the way that maximizes the intrinsic value. We will continue to have that dialog. I think it\u2019s a Mosaic in terms of preferences around which vehicle to return cash and we will have to synthesize that and get to our own judgment. So, nothing to report per say yet, but very high on the agenda of our conversations here George and I and with the board and hopefully we start to get clarity in the near term. George? George Scangos : I don\u2019t have too much to add to that. I think look this is the topic as Paul said that we are in discussions with the board with a number of our shareholders. And as we have started to refill our coffers after the Elan acquisition becomes something were discussing more, but nothing really to add at this time? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Weber with Citi. Your line is open. Yaron Weber - Citi: Great, thanks for taking my question. It\u2019s a question maybe for Al or Doug, when you look at the combination now admittedly, it\u2019s an animal models and the EAE model is not a great model, because it\u2019s inflammatory. But when you look at LINGO and AVONEX together there is some data suggesting maybe LINGO alone is just as good as the combo and perhaps LINGO is more synergistic with an oral like Gilenya. So, I wanted to get your thoughts on that? And then if you don\u2019t mind, I am just going to sneak in for Paul, the IMS data how good is that, it sounds like historically you have said that it\u2019s good predicting TECFIDERA. Excluding the stocking, although it sounds like a slight de-stocking yet you will be by about 30% the IMS stock on a prescription number. So, what are we missing there? Thank you. Paul Clancy : So, on EAE question, it\u2019s been traditionally difficult to see a robust effect of interferon in EAE. So, it doesn\u2019t surprise me that adding LINGO to AVONEX doesn\u2019t give you very much more than LINGO. I think the bottom line is that the effect of LINGO either in a knockout setting or other settings is pretty robust on re-myelination animal models in general, including EAE. And then in terms of combining, is it better with Gilenya? Doug Williams : We have some \u2013 we publish data that suggests that just to be cautious about these S1P antagonists, some of them actually have negative effects on all the good intersite differentiation and myelination. So, I think it needs to be studied further, but I think it\u2019s a very complex field, because many of these antagonists cross to multiple subtypes of S1P receptors and they can each have different activities. And so we are actually studying that quite extensively ourselves. I would also say that one of the issues that is still an open issue for us with respect to the Phase 3 study design as what we will combine with anti-LINGO assuming we get to Phase 3, what will combine with anti-LINGO as far as disease modifying therapy. And part of that will depend upon conversations with regulators in terms of what they are going to require vis-\u00e0-vis the kind of labeling that we would be able to achieve. So, that\u2019s an open question and one that\u2019s under active debate right now, but we will obviously require some input from the regulators in terms of how that proceeds in Phase 3. George Scangos : Yaron, on your first part of your question as we have said in the past over time, IMS seems to be predictive in any given week or any given quarter. It can have some wobbling as it tracks. Our inventory in the channel actually as I mentioned modestly went down. So, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s kind of driving it. It maybe gross to net as I pointed out. We had originally thought in our plan that the gross to net percentage would approach AVONEX this year and it\u2019s probably really closer to mid-teens rate. So, we are getting a little bit of favorability, which pulled through in the second quarter that may account for some of it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Matthew Harrison - Morgan Stanley : Great, thanks. Good morning everybody. I just wanted to ask on when you launch TECFIDERA in the U.S. you obviously saw sort of a pattern of TYSABRI patients or some weakness in TYSABRI, it\u2019s hard for me to breakout what\u2019s going on in Europe given some of the agreements and one-time items. I am wondering if you think we should expect to see that in Europe as well or not. And then Paul can you just be specific on what the sort of gross to net swing for TECFIDERA in the U.S. was? Thanks. Tony Kingsley : Thanks Mathew. It\u2019s Tony. So the short answer is, yes we have expected to see some TECFIDERA impact on TYSABRI but \u2013 in Europe, but substantially you did relative to what we saw in the U.S. the reality is in 2013 there was one of the issues with TYSABRI in 2013 is outside the U.S. and largely in Europe. We had a bunch of patients who would discontinue and switch to Gilenya. Any how we also had Gilenya in front of TYSABRI. So, we think we actually absorbed a lot of that impact of the oral switch frankly when we didn\u2019t have TECFIDERA in the market. We are going to see some switch from TYSABRI to TECFIDERA. We think it\u2019s less dramatic than in the U.S. frankly, because a bunch of it happened with Gilenya, I think 12 months ago. Paul Clancy : And then Matt, with respect to the TECFIDERA kind of gross to net question, I wouldn\u2019t characterize it or portrait it as a swing. I think I would portrait more as our prior thinking and kind of conversations with you had been that we have \u2013 what we had thought originally was approaching AVONEX like which would have getting it close to 20 and it\u2019s probably more mid-teens-ish. And we are just benefiting from that vis-\u00e0-vis our original plan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. First on ALPROLIX anything notable about the early adopters that you have seen there and any thing we can read through to ELOCTATE. And I know it\u2019s still early there early days, but anything we can read through from ALPROLIX or ELOCTATE. And then Paul on SG&A leverage you mentioned a commitment there again I think consensus is modeling about 1% improvement is that the right order of magnitude? Thanks. Tony Kingsley : Good question, Tony on hemophilia. So look with ALPROLIX we are pleased to be clear. We always said this was difficult to predict to be \u2013 what the trajectory would be because it\u2019s such a patient driven market and there hasn\u2019t been a new entrant in some time. Look having said that, we always thought there would be a cohort of patients that we can activate more quickly prophylaxis patients who are really bought the proposition were well-informed. And there were certainly investigators or others who are more familiar with the product. So I think we have demonstrated that that has happened and that\u2019s how we sort of captured is the early adopters, which is good. We are very pleased with that. We are getting access to HTCs, but on ALPROLIX I think the harder work begins now which is that next year patients convincing them this is the right value proposition and activating I mean getting the physicians ready. We feel very pleased with the execution. ELOCTATE, yes, early days, too early to comment on the performance. We are also confident in the ELOCTATE product profile. It\u2019s a less simple cell frankly. The ALPROLIX once a week cell is a pretty straightforward message. It\u2019s easier to counter position. You only have to listen to some of the competitors\u2019 earnings calls to talk about what they are doing. So we have some work to do to get out and educate physicians and patients. We think the extended half life makes a big difference for patients. And we think we are going to be able to communicate that message to patients and also to hemophilia treatment center. So early days but pleased with where we are. Paul Clancy : Terence, on the SG&A leverage question, so the 100 basis points I mean is certainly not crazy, I mean it\u2019s obviously going to be a function of revenue as we spin into 2015. I would hate to go get pinned down on that. Let me kind of give you more broadly the thinking. The thinking more broadly is look we have realized the SG&A growth has been pretty meaningful, right. I mean just in terms of raw dollars, it\u2019s been very meaningful. We have all along thought that that has been the right business judgment to make during this unprecedented time of launches for a company our size to go through the close to handful of launches. We needed to make sure we weren\u2019t as I have said before penny wise and pound foolish. Conceptually where we are thinking as we move into 2015 is that those launches we now moved to a time period of leverage. And I think that\u2019s both a cost and shareholder value perspective as well as a cultural perspective to make sure we don\u2019t kind of take a base that was designed for one reason and just keep building off the base and conceptually I think that we believe as we go into \u201915, \u201916, the resource allocation shift can actually move towards making sure we\u2019re building the pipeline. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS. Your line is open. Matt Roden \u2013 UBS: Great, thanks very much for taking the question and congrats on the nice quarter here. Question on one of your pipeline opportunities in IPF with STX-100, I\u2019ve asked about this before, but in the past quarter, we\u2019ve gone to complete Phase III datasets from other IPF drugs and they look like they\u2019re going to be approved in the next year and so the question is if your Phase IIa data are positive in terms of the biomarkers and other signs and symptoms of disease. What would then be the next step for STX-100, would you go straight in the combination studies that will be additional Phase II work before moving into Phase III and then related, is there either one of the two assets that are out there that look more combinable or more attractive as a combination partner. Thanks very much. Doug Williams : Hi, Matt, this is Doug. I think at the moment, the issue of combination versus whether you would target later stage patients, which presumably the labels for these two frontrunner drugs wouldn\u2019t cover. I think there is a variety of different ways that we can think about running the next series of studies. I think we\u2019re still exploring the data from both the intermune and the BI study, but I think there is a lot of options that are available to us. As you point out, one option is obviously looking at combination therapy. I can\u2019t give you a clear preference yet other than to say that there is a difference in the safety profile between the two drugs and that would lead one to believe that perhaps intermune will have a lag up in terms of market share and penetration so that might be a bit more attractive to think about from a combination perspective. But I think that the differential mechanisms lend themselves to combinations and also think that this is a market that\u2019s going to evolve much like other disease modifying therapy market, not unlike MS which is not every drug will work in every patient and so the market will evolve with space for multiple entries into that market overtime and I think that STX-100 represents an attractive opportunity either a single agent or potentially in combination with one or both of those agents. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Robyn Karnauskas, your line is open. Robyn Karnauskas \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Hi guys, sorry about that, I was on mute. Thanks for taking my question. So on Alzheimer\u2019s program, can you just walk us through the rationale Al for I am targeting the insoluble form of A-beta versus the soluble form and why you think that will work. And then just any color on the second generation (exonerated) hemophilia product with AVONEX, what could be the timeline, what\u2019s the height \u2013 the science behind the longer halfway for that technology? Thanks. Al Sandrock : Yes. Hi, Robyn this is Al. So we \u2013 if we have a drug that binds to soluble forms, it\u2019s going to have a hard time getting to the plaque and because there is soluble forms not only as circulating in the blood, but also there is going to be soluble forms all around the brain. So if you really want to \u2013 and many of the dystrophic neuritis are around the plaque, so we think the plaque if we can remove the plaque, we can remove not only the fibular forms of A-beta, but all the other smaller forms, the oligomers that we believe are toxic are not only to synapses, but also to nerve fibers. So I think having a drug that targets the plaque allows access of the antibody to \u2013 we think the core of where the toxic proteins are emanating from and that\u2019s our rationale. Also if we look back at the old paper that we are with the neuroimmune antibody came from, those are patients in that small study of 30 patients who developed antibodies to plaque amyloids. Actually, we are doing better around the patients who have not developed antibodies to plaque amyloid on targeted studies. And it was a basis of that paper that was published in Europe, 9 years ago that got us excited in the particular antibody. Doug Williams : Robyn, this is Doug. I think you are alluding to the next generation factor 8 that utilizes the X10 technology that could come into the clinic as early as next year, that\u2019s our hope. And the technology behind that molecule is really based on the fact that if you look at all of the extended half life factor 8 molecules that are out there, they are all clustered around 1.5 to twofold greater half life than the unmodified versions of factor 8. That\u2019s because they interact with von Willebrand factor. And so we set about trying to engineer the molecule to sort of breakthrough that barrier and based on the preclinical data that we have accumulated thus far, it looks like that we have probably another twofold extension of the half life beyond what we have with a lock take right now, which could be very meaningful from the standpoint of further extending the frequency of infusions for patients with hemophilia A. So, we are hoping to bring that forward as early as next year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Geoff Meacham - JPMorgan: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the taking the questions. One for Doug or Al, so when you look at anti-LINGO and MS, I know it\u2019s tough to say specifically, but mechanistically should there be a meaningful difference between 12 months and 18 months of treatment? And are you guys assuming for these novel endpoints a decline in the AVONEX-only arm? And then just a quick one for Tony on the Daclizumab, you have Phase 3 data in hand, just wanted to get the early kind of read about how you are thinking about positioning? Thanks. Al Sandrock : So, Geoff, this is Al. I mean, as Doug said in his great answer to this question, what we are trying to do is to learn as much as we can. This is really the first well-controlled trial of any drug for re-myelination. What we are trying to do in the MS study and in the combination of the MS and optic neuritis studies to understand first, do we get re-myelination when we look at images? Second, do we get any electrophysiologic consequences? So, that\u2019s why we are looking at nerve conduction velocity in the optic neuritis. And then the third and this is the most important thing is what\u2019s the connection of these biological changes, if you will, or electrophysiologic changes to clinical endpoints, because ultimately that\u2019s what we are going to have to show on Phase 3 is assuming we get re-myelination or preservation of axon, are we going to get improvement in disability, are we going to get improvement in cognition? And so \u2013 and the timing of these things is probably going to be different. For example, I could imagine that we will get a rapid effect on re-myelination more rapid and then you would have a delayed effect on axon preservation and even more delayed effect on cognition or disability improvement. I think it\u2019s the timing of this and the correlation as Doug said between these biological measurements of these clinical endpoints that we are trying to sort out in these two studies. Tony Kingsley : It\u2019s Tony. On Daclizumab, look with obviously top line data that has been released, we will have to see as the full dataset gets released and so forth how the market reacts. So, we don\u2019t have a sort of detailed market bag, but we think there is clearly a place for this. It\u2019s got a nice combination of efficacy one times a month dosing. I think physicians are intrigued by the MOA, which gives them another option, the open questions through registration and labeling, where it comes out in terms of safety monitoring and all that other stuff. There is a meaningful switch population of patients still who are going to come off injectables, who are going to come off orals. And there are people for whom TYSABRI patients, (indiscernible) this might be appropriate. So, we are going to have do the more detail as we get the more detailed data, but it feels like there is \u2013 it\u2019s an interesting mechanism that has physicians intrigued and it feels like there is a package there that could have a meaningful place in the market. George Scangos : So, Geoff, this is George, let me just pickup a little bit on the LINGO question, because at the end of 12 months, when we do the interim analysis, we will know the data, alright and which is the important aspect for us. And there will be a group of people in here who will know and that\u2019s important for us to know how to start planning for the Phase 3, how they design it. We are incredibly excited about this project as lots of people outside the company seem to be because of its potential and we just want to make sure we get it right. The important thing is that we get a good trial that gives us an accurate picture of the potential of LINGO and that we don\u2019t jeopardize that trial. It will be part of the registration package, it\u2019s not a Phase 3 pivotal trial, but it will be an important part of the registration package and so the two most important criteria is that we know the data so we can start planning and that we conduct the trial and don\u2019t impact the integrity of the trial. Unfortunately that means the likely delay of one we would tell you the data although, the trial itself seems to be somewhere ahead of schedule. So, that\u2019s \u2013 those are the reasons and we\u2019d like to be transparent as we always knew, but we have other considerations to think about here as well. Operator : I would now like to turn the conference back over to our presenters. George Scangos : Okay. There are no further questions. Thank you all for your attendance this morning and we can all get back to work. Thanks everybody. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Idec Q3 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Claudine Prowse, VP, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Claudine Prowse : Thank you, and welcome to Biogen Idec\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogenidec.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures that we\u2019ll discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in tables one and two. Table three includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP better represents the ongoing economics of our business and reflects how we manage the business internally. We\u2019ve also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult our SEC filings for additional detail. On today\u2019s call, I\u2019m joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. George Scangos; Tony Kingsley, our Head of Global Commercial Operations; and our CFO, Paul Clancy; Doug Williams, our Head of R&D and Al Sandrock, our Chief Medical Officer. Our traveling overseas will be available for Q&A. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to George. George Scangos :  Okay, thanks Claudine and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Biogen Idec had another great quarter in which our products continued to perform well, and during which we achieved several key milestones. Our underlying business remains strong as we enter into a period of anticipated growth, resulting from the introduction of several new therapies in MS and hemophilia. As Paul will review, third quarter financial performance was strong with 37% growth in revenues and 61% growth in diluted non-GAAP EPS year-over-year. Our core multiple sclerosis franchise continued to capture share with an increasing number of patients using our therapies. We believe that our product portfolio of disease modifying MS products, including TECFIDERA, TYSABRI, AVONEX, and now PLEGRIDY truly differentiates Biogen Idec as a global leader in the treatment of MS. TECFIDERA continues to gain market share in the U.S. and uptick has been strong in European countries, where it has been launched. TECFIDERA is the number one oral MS treatment in the U.S. and with many more launches to come around the world, we believe that it has the potential to be a market leader in many countries. According to our estimates, TECFIDERA has treated over 100,000 patients globally within just 18 months of the U.S. launch, and only six months since EU approval. This is an impressive milestone to reach and we believe that it reflects a broad recognition by physicians and patients that TECFIDERA is a unique product that offers strong efficacy with a favorable tolerability and safety profile along with the convenience of oral administration. We would like to inform you that we have confirmed the case of PML in a patient being treated with TECFIDERA, who recently died from complications of pneumonia. Despite this project loss, we believe that the overall positive benefit risk profile of TECFIDERA remains unchanged. The patient was treated with TECFIDERA for 4.5 years as part of the ENDORSE study. During the course of therapy, the patient experienced severe lymphopenia that lasted for over 3.5 years. Lymphopenia is a known risk factor for PML, and can be caused by a number of factors including treatments for MS, cancer, HIV. The current TECFIDERA label includes warnings and precautions regarding lymphopenia. We\u2019ve reported the case to the regulatory authorities and we\u2019ll work with them to confirm that the language in our label provides patients and their physicians\u2019 appropriate information regarding lymphopenia. Moving on, AVONEX continues to be a very strong part of our business, and we believe that the Interferon franchise will continue to remain solid with the anticipated launch of PLEGRIDY in the U.S. With an attractive clinical profile and every two week subcu dosing, we believe that PLEGRIDY has the potential to be the leader in the Interferon class. We\u2019re optimistic about the future of TYSABRI as physicians continue to view this product as an important high efficacy treatment option. We believe the high level of efficacy, the increasing understanding of the benefits of risk stratification, and the potential of TYSABRI and other indications such as SPMS and Stroke, all bode well for its long-term growth. We\u2019ve now launched both of our hemophilia therapies, ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE, in the U.S. Although, hemophilia is a new therapeutic area for Biogen, we believe that we\u2019re well-positioned to succeed. We\u2019re the first-to-market with long-acting products and we bring tremendous expertise in Biologics Manufacturing and Process Sciences, and we\u2019ve built a hemophilia organization comprised of many individuals with years of experience in the treatment of hemophilia for communicating the clinical benefit of ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE to physicians. We continue to advance our R&D efforts. At last month\u2019s ECTRIMS meeting, we highlighted our continued leadership in MS and ongoing commitment through advancing patient care. We presented several analyses of TECFIDERA\u2019s positive real-world patient experience, as well as longer-term data from the ENDORSE study, demonstrating sustained patient efficacy. ENDORSE data indicated a favorable overall safety profile, including data from some patients who were treated for up to 7.5 years. Other presentations, including data reaffirming the powerful efficacy of TYSABRI, two-year data for PLEGRIDY demonstrating sustained efficacy and a compelling safety profile, full Phase III results for Daclizumab HYP, as well as supportive data for Anti-LINGO in acute optic neuritis. Our pipeline continues to move forward, and we have strengthened our research and development capabilities even further by hiring a number of highly accomplished scientists. Chris Henderson has joined the Company as Head of Neurology Research. Chris formerly was Professor of Neurology, Pathology, and Cell Biology, Director of the Stem Cell Initiative and Co-Director of the Motor Neuron Center at Columbia University Medical School. Richard Ransohoff also has joined as Vice President of Neuro-Immunology Research. He previously was Director of the Neuroinflammation Research Center and Professor of Molecular Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. Don Johns recently joined the Company to head our ALS initiative. Dr. John previously was Head of Neuroscience Translational Medicine at Novartis. And Olivier Danos recently joined Biogen Idec to head Gene Therapy Research. He previously was Senior Vice President at Kadmon Pharmaceuticals and prior to Kadmon led the Gene Therapy Consortium at University College London. With these new hires, we\u2019ve meaningfully strengthened our R&D capabilities in our areas of expertise and natural adjacencies. Now I\u2019ll pass the call over to Tony. Tony Kingsley : Thanks, George. Our commercial organization continued to execute and deliver strong results during the third quarter. Starting with MS, during the quarter Biogen Idec executed our MS franchise strategy, and as a result, we continued to grow our global MS market share. TECFIDERA\u2019s launch trajectory in the U.S. was sustained through the third quarter as this therapy continued to grow. TECFIDERA continue to capture share while attracting a broadening set of patients from the MS population. Year-to-date, our market research suggests that TECFIDERA is capturing approximately a third of all new patient starts and over 40% of patient switching therapies. As a result, we estimate TECFIDERA\u2019s market share in the U.S. ended the quarter in the high-teens. Outside of the U.S., the roll out of TECFIDERA continues and we\u2019ve now secured reimbursement in 10 countries. In countries where TECFIDERA has been launched, patient uptake has been broad and strong. TECFIDERA is now the number one prescribed oral MS therapy in Germany. TECFIDERA is also available in a number of other countries with limited reimbursement and we continue to expect to achieve full reimbursement across most of the major EU markets in 2015. In a market where oral therapies are growing rapidly, our Interferon franchise saw 2% year-over-year revenue growth. Q3 revenues included AVONEX and early PLEGRIDY revenues from Europe. AVONEX continued to perform well within the Interferon therapies. With our continued focus, we believe AVONEX has captured meaningful share of new patient starts and has exhibited strong performance within the evolving MS landscape. The PLEGRIDY launch in Europe is underway with the initial launch in Germany and Denmark. Physician awareness of PLEGRIDY is high, and we believe the product\u2019s efficacy and dosing make it an attractive option in the Interferon class. In Germany, we gained favorable reimbursement for PLEGRIDY. PLEGRIDY does not need to go through the AMNOG process and has been priced within the band of other Interferon 8018 therapies. In the U.S., we are prepared for an early November launch of PLEGRIDY. We\u2019ve completed sales force training, established contracts with specialty pharmacies, and prepared the financial and patient support programs for a successful launch. Now turning to TYSABRI. TYSABRI has continued to demonstrate strong performance. Patient and physician demand for TYSABRI is solid as the therapy enjoyed its second consecutive quarter of positive net new patient adds. In the U.S. retention rates have improved the levels seen prior to the launch of TECFIDERA. We believe TYSABRI continues to be viewed by neurologist as a therapy of choice for patients requiring high efficacy. In addition, we believe the TYSABRI has benefited from physicians\u2019 improved understanding of patient management. The hemophilia launches are off to a solid start as we\u2019ve said success is a new entrant as this market will require several things. Establishing Biogen Idec is a credible and committed partner to the community. Activating early adopters among patients who see the benefits of the dosing schedule in prophylaxis regiments, educating hemophilia treatment centers and providing support services to ensure patients can get rapid access to products. Our experience to date suggest we\u2019re making good progress on all of these fronts and we believe, we can reinforce that positive experience to extend use over time to a broader set of patients. Starting with ELOCTATE, the patient and physician awareness for ELOCTATE is high in weeks into the launch. We\u2019re building strong relationships with customers in achieving our early goals of reach and frequency with hemophilia treatment centers or HTCs. As of the end of the quarter based on our data approximately 50% of all HTCs have prescribed ELOCTATE, suggesting broad interest in longer acting therapies across the market. ELOCTATE is also widely available through specialty pharmacies and we\u2019re pleased with the status of reimbursement at this stage. ALPROLIX is also seeing strong demand in broad interest from patients and physicians through the end of the quarter, approximately 55% of HTCs have prescribed ALPROLIX. We believe that the early adopters initiating ALPROLIX have primarily been existing prophylactic patients and have been largely choosing the once weekly prophylactic dosing schedule. Acquiring additional patients with hemophilia will require sustained educational and promotional efforts, but we believe we have the ability to execute. We continue to believe that reduced infusion frequency is the largest unmet need for the hemophilia community and then ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE have attractive product profiles to address this burden. Our goal is to become market leaders in the mid to long-term and we believe in the products and in our ability to execute. So overall, we\u2019re pleased with our performance. The commercial team is executing well. And we believe we are demonstrating the ability both to launch multiple therapies in parallel and drive continued growth in the base business. With that, I will turn the call over to Paul. Paul J. Clancy: Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.62 in the third quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the third quarter were $3.80. Walking down the P&L, I will start with revenues. Total revenue for the third quarter grew 37% year-over-year to approximately $2.5 billion. Global TECFIDERA revenue was $787 million in Q3. In the U.S., TECFIDERA revenue was $638 million. Our best estimate at this time indicates that we ended the quarter with approximately 3.5 weeks of inventory in the channel, which includes specialty pharmacies and wholesalers. International TECFIDERA revenue was $149 million in the third quarter. Germany represented approximately three quarters of our ex-U.S. TECFIDERA revenues. Interferon revenues including AVONEX and PLEGRIDY were $745 million. In the U.S., Q3 revenue increased 6%, compared to prior year to $482 million. Outside of the U.S., Q3 AVONEX revenue was $260 million, a decrease of 6% compared to prior year due to increased oral competition. TYSABRI worldwide revenue net of hedging was $501 million in the third quarter, an increase of 25% over the same period last year. These results were comprised of $275 million in the U.S. and $226 million internationally. There were number of items of note for TYSABRI. We\u2019re now recognizing TYSABRI revenues at the full reimbursed price in Italy. In the U.S., there were 14 shipping weeks this quarter, compared to 13 in the same quarter last year, as TYSABRI ships on Tuesdays. And we benefited from the benefit of a timing of shipment in Brazil, a tender market. Factoring in these items, TYSABRI still experienced double-digit revenue growth year-over-year. Moving to hemophilia, ELOCTATE revenue in the third quarter, first quarter on the market was $22 million. ALPROLIX revenue in Q3 was $25 million. Turning to our anti-CD20 franchise, RITUXAN and GAZYVA U.S. profit share was $271 million for the third quarter. Royalties and profit share and sales of rituximab outside the U.S. were $20 million. The result was $291 million of net revenue from unconsolidated joint business. This amount includes an expense of approximately $21 million related to our share of changes in the recognition of the branded prescription drug fee in the quarter. This fee was imposed to pharma companies as part of the Affordable Care Act. During the quarter, the IRS issued final regulations related to the drug fee which changed the recognition for accounting purposes from the period in which it is paid to when the sales occur. The incremental charge this quarter represents the remaining expense for 2013 and year-to-date 2014 sales related to RITUXAN. Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q3 cost of goods sold were $303 million or 12% of total revenue. Q3 non-GAAP R&D expense was $416 million or 17% of revenues, which includes no new business development activity this quarter. Q3 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $569 million or 23% of total revenue. Included in this amount is an expense of approximately $90 million related to the previously mentioned Branded Prescription Drug Fee. Our Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 25%. Weighted average diluted shares were $237 million, and we ended the quarter with approximately $3.2 billion in cash and marketable securities, of which 60% is in the U.S. In Q3, we incurred a $200 million liability as we reached $3 billion in cumulative sales of TECFIDERA and FUMADERM in the quarter. As highlighted in our SEC filings, this relates to the TECFIDERA contingent payments, which are being recorded as an increase to goodwill, reported on the balance sheet when incurred and flowing through the cash statement when paid, but not impacting the income statement. We expect to enter a period of meaningful TECFIDERA CVR payments to the former shareholders of Fumapharm. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to a $3.80 for the third quarter, an increase of 61%. Now let me turn to our updated full year 2014 guidance. We expect total revenue growth between 38% and 41% compared to prior year, unchanged from prior guidance. R&D expense is unchanged, yet expected to be at the low-end of the range of our previously communicated guidance between 20% and 21% of total revenues. Our full year R&D forecast now includes approximately $50 million in the fourth quarter for business development opportunities, a decrease from prior guidance. This remains an important focus for the company and we continue to pursue high-quality early and mid-stage business development opportunities. SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 22% to 23% of total revenue, unchanged from prior guidance. We anticipate non-GAAP EPS results between $13.45 and $13.55 and GAAP EPS to be between $12 and $12.10. Our improvement in both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS is primarily due to our revised assumptions with respect to anticipated business development activity. I\u2019ll turn the call over to George for his closing comments. George A. Scangos: Thanks, Paul. In closing, I think the third quarter was very productive for Biogen Idec. We now have 10 marketed products, including five in MS and two in hemophilia. Our efforts over the coming months will focus on continued performance of the base business, execution on the launch of new products and innovation to bring meaningful new therapies to patients. We plan to make TECFIDERA broadly available as we launched across Europe and other regions around the globe. We will begin launching PLEGRIDY in the U.S. imminently with continued launches across Europe occurring over time. We expect to continue to grow our hemophilia franchise. We believe ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE represent true innovation for patients and a significant long-term opportunity for the company. We believe that our accomplishments have set the stage for an exciting period as we look forward to 2015 and beyond. We expect an important part of our long-term value creation for patients and shareholders will come from our pipeline that could form the next wave of late stage development opportunities. Our strategy for sustainable growth centers on the deep commitment to the patient and continued innovation to develop novel medicines that address important medical challenges. We intend to follow good science and stick to our knitting in the areas that we know best : Neurology, Hematology and Immunology. We believe these guiding principles position us for long-term success. So in closing, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank our dedicated employees and the patients and physicians involved in our clinical development programs in helping us to make a deep difference to patients\u2019 lives. So thank you all for joining us this morning. And operator, we\u2019ll now open up the call for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen and Company : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Maybe for Tony or Paul, it\u2019s on TECFIDERA. It looks like the growth on a quarter-on-quarter basis either absolute dollars or percentage basis, it looks a little bit lower in Q3 and, say over any of the last four, five prior quarters. Was there anything sort of one-time nature that you want to call out or should we just assume that the drug is on a different sort of trajectory? Tony Kingsley : Thanks, Eric. It\u2019s Tony. Nothing big on a one-time nature. Inventories are moderating, I think a little bit in the channel, and that\u2019s always little, probably, difficult to predict exactly, but no look, we\u2019ve always expected that TECFIDERA\u2019s grow rate would moderate over time. I think we\u2019re seeing a natural case of that, but we\u2019re very comfortable with the trajectory of the product right now. We\u2019re very comfortable as we talked about the portion of new starts and switches that we\u2019re getting. So nothing that\u2019s significantly off plan from our standpoint, in fact I think we feel pretty good about the performance. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Your line is open. Salim Syed \u2013 ISI Group : Hey guys. This is Salim in for Mark. Thanks for all the information. On the PML patient, George, can you just confirm if the patient had a history of being on TYSABRI, and then also I know you mentioned 100,000 patients have been treated with TECFIDERA, but how many of those patients have been on drug for same length of time that the PML patients, which I believe you said 4.5 years? George A. Scangos: Yes, okay. Look, this patient was not on TYSABRI, but this patient did have severe lymphopenia for 3.5 years, and we believe that the length of time on TECFIDERA is not the issue, the issue is related to lymphopenia, all right. And so, we are treating this as a case that resolves from the lymphopenia, and there is a normal background rate of lymphopenia. There is a lymphopenia on the TECFIDERA label, a small fraction of the patients develop lymphopenia and that\u2019s why a screening for the lymphopenia is on the label, it\u2019s caused by lots of drugs. Salim Syed \u2013 ISI Group : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo & Company:  All right, thanks very much for taking my question. We\u2019ve been getting feedback from physicians that PLEGRIDY could be an attractive option relative to other beta interferons. So I\u2019m just curious with respect to your marketing and commercial strategy to what extent are you going to be focused on trying to capture share from other interferons beyond AVONEX and how much weight do you think improvement, the improvements and convenience might happen since perhaps some of the pricing discounts going on from some of the competitors in that space? Thanks. Tony Kingsley : Thanks Brian. It\u2019s Tony. So look, we really like the product profile of PLEGRIDY, repeat the theory. Interferons as of last count still treat more than half of the patients in our markets. We think that\u2019s declining for all the obvious reasons, but we think interferon remains an important part of the treatment set. We think PLEGRIDY is the leading interferon and should take here from all the interferons that are on the market today. And I would point out when physicians look at it, they\u2019re not going to look just at the convenience benefit, but they\u2019re going to look at the total package of the efficacy and dosing schedule. We think that\u2019s a very attractive proposition. So, yes, we think we have the potential to take share of high frequency interferons. Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo & Company: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein. Your line is open. Geoffrey Porges \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein: Thanks very much. Lots of questions, but perhaps the macro one, I\u2019ll just go back to the issue of sequential growth. Paul, you top-lined if you net out the one-time items, it looks like sequentially it was about 3% and it\u2019s been sort of in the 9% to 10% range for most of the past year. Obviously that wasn\u2019t going to be sustainable, but is this the new normal when you add up all the sort of bits and pieces and components of your revenue mix, is this what we should be thinking going forward? Paul J. Clancy:  Geoff, as we move into 2015, we\u2019ll use the end of the year call to give our expectations going into 2015, and obviously that will play into where we think 2016 goes as well. But I think that you\u2019re painting a picture that\u2019s probably less optimistic than we think. We certainly are in early stages in TECFIDERA for the European rollout. The majority of European TECFIDERA sales are Germany. We\u2019ve moved forward with reimbursement in a number of other markets, but ahead of us is a number of larger markets and most of those will be impacted as we go into 2015. We think there is meaningful, still meaningful growth in TECFIDERA in the United States as we continue to penetrate docs and penetrate the marketplace. And certainly, we\u2019re in very early days for the PLEGRIDY launch, which actually is ahead of us. In the Unites States, it just started with a very small amount of sales in Europe and certainly in very early days in ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX that \u2013 well it\u2019s hard to discern signal from noise early on, but the longer-term perspective that we have is that the marketplace will move to long acting hemophilia products, and we will play hopefully a meaningful role in that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thanks. This is John on behalf of Michael Yee. On the TECFIDERA patient with PML, could you just remind us is this the first PML case in TECFIDERA and what was the JC virus status of the patient? Also going forward, how do you think this case maybe different or similar versus the prior experience with TYSABRI? Thank you. George A. Scangos: Yeah, let me turn that question over to Doug Williams. Doug is in a different site. Claudine Prowse : Operator, please unmute our colleagues overseas. Operator : Your line is now open. Douglas E. Williams:  Can you hear me all right now, George? George A. Scangos: Yes, we can hear you, Doug. Douglas E. Williams: Okay, sorry about that technical difficulty. Yes, this is the first patient with PML on TECFIDERA that we\u2019re reporting. I think, as George pointed out, it\u2019s important to note that this is a patient that as part of the ENDORSE study and was on drug for 4.5 years and for 3.5 of those years had severe lymphopenia, which we know is a risk factor for developing PML. And so, it\u2019s an unfortunate circumstance that we believe is related to the lymphopenia. Prolonged and severe lymphopenia is a risk factor. We have monitoring rules in our label right now for checking white count and we believe that that is the best way for physicians to manage patients going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Terence C. Flynn \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Hi, thanks for taking that question. Maybe more just a high level one. So in the slides you guys had called out that a portion of the market growth since the launch of TECFIDERA was attributed to this increase in the commercially insured patients. Just wondering what data led you to draw that conclusion and if you can try to quantify the benefit for us? Thank you. George A. Scangos:  Thanks, Terence. It\u2019s an interesting point. Look, we think the market growth first and foremost is being \u2013 the increase is driven by oral to the marketplace. Specifically, TECFIDERA bringing back quitters in particular and slowing down even the number of those patients that exit the marketplace. In addition to that, what we\u2019ve noticed over the last call, five to seven years, is unemployment rates actually have in fact, play a role in this marketplace. So when unemployment rates in the United States specifically pop up to the high single-digits, we see the impact in a slightly delayed fashion. And when they drift down, we see the impact of that as well. I mean, they\u2019re modest impacts, but still meaningful. And then the second impact is, as we came into 2014, we think we\u2019ve gotten a little bit of a modest benefit from the Affordable Care Act, more patients being ensured in moving from essentially what was \u2013 patients that we supported on a free basis to those switching over to commercial. Thanks for the question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of (indiscernible) with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst :  Hi, it\u2019s actually Kathryn for (indiscernible). We\u2019ll just have a question on LINGO. What do think is a clinically meaningful improvement in VEP until those back in 2020? And then what would expect of the placebo growth? And then how much detail do you expect to this in January versus a presentation at a conference next year? Thank you. Paul J. Clancy: This is Paul. I was going to take it, but I\u2019ll turn it to Al. Alfred W. Sandrock: Hi, this is Al Sandrock. I don\u2019t actually look on the MVP as a clinically meaningful end point to begin with. We powered the study for about a 30% affect on the latency, but I would look out it more as a biological measure and not necessarily one where we can look for clinical meaningfulness. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Christopher Raymond \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.:  Just a question on TECFIDERA life cycle management, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re probably not going to want to be too descriptive of this. But we noticed a patent application that you guys filed in June describing a deuterium substitute a DMF compound. And I guess it made us to think a bit, how might this fit into your life cycle management efforts around TECFIDERA and sort of if you could maybe talk generally about the attributes you think that that could make for a meaningful improvement over the currently approved compound obviously outside of the IP, but in terms of convenience, safety, and you know that kind of stuff, that would be very helpful. George A. Scangos: Sure, but first of all great job of scanning the patent literature. Obviously the life cycle management for TECFIDERA is one of the key issues for us and we have a lot of work going on. That certainly is one aspect of it, but not certainly the only aspect. And we haven\u2019t gone into publicly all of the things that we\u2019re doing and things we\u2019re trying and certainly don\u2019t, want to do that now and I think it\u2019s in our interest. Obviously, if we tell you, we tell all our competitors as well. Look what would be the attractive life advantages, modest changes could be once a day, could be better tolerability. I think the biggest change would be increased efficacy. And so, we\u2019re working on all of those aspects. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Matthew Harrison \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Great, thanks for taking the question. I thought maybe now that you have the full Phase 3 on daclizumab. You haven\u2019t talked about that aspect a lot and maybe you could talk about how you think that could fit in and how you might position that commercially? Thanks. Tony Kingsley : Yes. Thanks, Matthew. It\u2019s Tony. So Phase 3 data was obviously very encouraging. We believe it has an attractive product portfolio that has a place in the market, doing lots of more detailed market research and positioning at this point to crisp that up, but we believe it has a nice efficacy; it has an MOA that is the interesting to many physicians that we talk to in once a month subQ injectable. So the overall package is attracted and certainly something that makes sense for patients who require that level of efficacy. It could be a good switch to product for a lot of patients that are getting the efficacy that I need today. So more to come on that but we certainly think there\u2019s a place where we believe that is a place for it on the market. George A. Scangos: At this call, I\u2019d just add additionally, we also often times think that this market is easy segments to split up, this we\u2019re approaching 800,000 patients on disease-modifying therapies with lifelong disease that have lots of different heterogenous nature to the disease. So we think that actually plays well for Daclizumab. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Robyn S. Karnauskas \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.:  Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. Just about hemophilia few things to your comments around, on the trends we\u2019re seeing, [clearly] (ph) the 50% of the hemophilia treatment centers that are not (indiscernible) how do they just refer to 6% that are and how do you get access of those centers? And then why do you think you\u2019re seeing some of the patients who are once-a-week versus to twice-week patients switch to longer halfway? And what do you need to do convert those patients do you think? Thank you. Tony Kingsley : So, thanks Robyn, its Tony. Look I think I said first we\u2019re pleased to have got the 50% or 50% plus of the hemophilia treatment centers. I think we\u2019ve said this is largely a patient-driven market, meaning that\u2019s kind of where the activation comes. So as patients get interested in the proposition of the dosing regimen for treating disease prophylactically they are asking the hemophilia treatment centers. So we are in there talking to them, having conservations. We think as patients have good experience and as centers have good experience, it creates a virtuous cycle overtime. And we believe we\u2019re seeing some evidence of that as we go out and execute. So look, its early days, but the plan has been to do that, get the patients get their treatment centers provide good coverage and build that virtuous cycle overtime, but we believe we\u2019re on a good path on that front. In terms, of dosing frequency, I think, what I said on ALPROLIX, is we believe that most patients are choosing the once weekly, which is the label dose, it\u2019s either once weekly or once every ten days. That is something that has made sense for the majority of patients. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s on plan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Ravi Mehrotra \u2013 Credit Suisse : : George A. Scangos: Look where we \u2013 I assume you\u2019re asking because of all the noise around Forward Pharma and their IPO. What we\u2019ll say is we\u2019re very comfortable with our IP situation, we\u2019re certainly not going to litigate this in public. We\u2019re very comfortable with where we are. And we\u2019ll leave it at that. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Nomura Securities. Your line is open. Ian Somaiya \u2013 Nomura Securities Co., Ltd.:  Thank you. I just want to follow-up on the questions on TECFIDERA. In the U.S., fairly rapidly you\u2019ve got into roughly 20% market share. I just wanted to get maybe just your thoughts on how we should think about growth going forward, factors we should consider when modeling out sales going forward. And similarly in Europe, the sales came in a little bit below our expectations and would you attribute more, more to that \u2013 which attribute at more to the timing of country introduction and to country rollout or was there sort of a bullish effect with the Germany introduction last quarter? Tony Kingsley : : : Paul J. Clancy: Yes, Ian just to add on Europe and I think these comments are probably a repeat from last quarter. We came into the Europe thinking Europe the pace of penetration would be underneath the pace of penetration that we saw at TECFIDERA in the United States. We\u2019re very pleasantly surprising Germany to see actually that being on track or better. And while Germany is that the Lion\u2019s share of our ex-U.S. revenue right now, all the other countries that we\u2019ve launched in Nordics, Canada, Australia, we\u2019re seeing similar trends that we saw in Germany in terms of very strong update. So the delayed launch actually has played and we\u2019re effectively trying to do in every country is learn from the prior launches and execute even better, and I think we\u2019re succeeding on that front. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS. Your line is open. Matthew Roden \u2013 UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much for taking the question. I just want to better understand the potential implications, if any, from that the case of PML. And we recognized that there is a background rate of PML in lymphopenic patients, including those with multiple sclerosis. We also know that TECFIDERA does lower lymphocyte count. Do you think in light of what\u2019s happened here would you prefer that severely lymphopenic patients not be on TECFIDERA? Do you expect that docs will reconsider use in lymphopenic patients? And lastly, do you expect that the regulators will update the label or will they wait for additional cases since there is a background rate in this population? Thanks. George A. Scangos:  Thanks. Those are good questions. Look, we\u2019re certainly not in a position to make medical recommendation, right. For long lymphopenia like this patient experiences in known risk factor for PML, TECFIDERA does result in lymphopenia in a small fraction of the patients who take it. It\u2019s for that reason that lymphocyte screening is on the label. We have reported this case to the regulatory authorities. We\u2019ll certainly, as we said in the prepared script, be discussing with them whether the language on the label is appropriate to inform patients and physicians. And what is done with lymphocyte results is, I think up to the physician that\u2019s caring for those patients. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi. Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges of Bernstein. Your line is open. Geoffrey Porges \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein:  Thanks very much for letting me jump in with another question. I just want to follow-up on the discussion on ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE. Could you give us a sense of what proportion of patients on each products, are existing prophylaxis patients for the switching over, what proportion new pro-fee patients and what proportion is used in demand? Look, I know the numbers are small, but it\u2019d just be useful to see where the majority of the uptake is coming initially. George A. Scangos:  So I think, Geoff, it\u2019s pretty clear that the vast majority is going to be existing pro-fee patients. That\u2019s the group that we expected in both cases to buying the proposition of dosing frequency most attractive side, but I would say that\u2019s the vast majority of it. There is probably a little bit on demand. There are no signals yet that we\u2019ve seen there. There is a meaningful conversion of bringing on demand patients into pro-fee. We\u2019ve always said that\u2019s probably something that happens over time. So, I would say vast majority is existing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Nomura Securities. Your line is open. Ian Somaiya \u2013 Nomura Securities Co., Ltd.:  And thank you again for letting me to ask a follow-up. George, you began the call just speaking to the new hires and I was just wondering if we should think about the growth within each of these new areas. We should assume organic growth or do you think there are certain technologies out there that you sort of need to bring in-house to accelerate your efforts in the\u2026 George A. Scangos: Yeah, those are good questions. Maybe I\u2019ll turn that over to Doug Williams. Douglas E. Williams: Sure, thanks George. Yes, I think you can look at those hires as somewhat of a mix of sort of building on our existing strengths. Don Johns would be a great example of that. Don is coming in to run the clinical trial programs in ALS. As we take those compounds into the clinic, he\u2019ll be responsible for designing and executing those studies. Chris Henderson is going to take over the research activities and neurology research. So again that just strengthens what is already a very strong group and Chris will have the mandate to focus on new target discovery and validation to really help push ahead with new initiatives that we have in some of our core areas like Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s.  : Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi. Your line is open. Yaron Werber \u2013 Citigroup: Thanks for squeezing me in. Question it\u2019s for \u2013 I don\u2019t know if Tony want to take it or Paul. Just relating to how do we think about TECFIDERA inventories, it sounds like its 3.5 weeks. I\u2019m trying to get a sense what do you think is the normal range, especially given where you are sort of in the growth trajectory as a drug? Thank you. Paul J. Clancy: Yes, good question, Yaron. The first thing I\u2019d want to point out is it\u2019s our best estimate. I think I had mentioned that, but that\u2019s important. These things always wobble along product therapy, the size of TECFIDERA, it\u2019s meaningful. So take it with a grain of salt. We think that each quarter \u2013 the other thing (indiscernible) said on is that three and half week estimate is the combination of wholesalers and specialty pharmacies, which we\u2019ve been trying to point out from the early days. We have good visibility on wholesalers. There\u2019s a limited number of them and that\u2019s where our direct channel is and we have decent visibility in the specialty pharmacies. Over time, I would think that that will tighten up a little bit, as people early in the launch in particular specialty pharmacies, wanted to make sure they had plenty of product on hand. So I think if anything over time, it tightens up a little bit to a tighter supply chain, which is normal for other therapies in particular rather overall therapies. And we\u2019ll try to keep everybody apprised if that happens as it goes to the best knowledge that we have. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS. Your line is open. Matthew Roden \u2013 UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much. I wanted to ask somewhat of a similar question on TECFIDERA life cycle strategy. I have one on hemophilia. So it looks to us that you have a pretty nice opportunity here with ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX over the next couple of years. But as you look out over the mid and long-term, obviously there are other parties working on not only competing long-acting factors, but there\u2019s also other technologies being brought to bear. I realize none of these other approaches are really de-risked, but the question is, given your leadership in this area whether we should expect to see additional innovation coming out of Biogen? And bigger picture, what\u2019s your strategy for growing the franchise over the long-term? Thanks. George A. Scangos:  Sure. Doug, you want to take that one? Douglas E. Williams: Yes, that\u2019s related to hemophilia. I think we are continuing to innovate in that space. The first two products really represent the first two products. We have other programs further back in research, one of which is a longer acting version of factor VIII that we presented some posters on, utilizes the XTEN technology, and we think that \u2013 if it does make it into the clinic will really sort of get us beyond that one and a half to two-fold half life extension threshold that everyone seems to be caught and all the long-acting factors. For Hemophilia A, really in the sort of one and a half to two-fold half life extension range and this could actually double that from what we have seen. We\u2019re also looking into gene therapy as a possibility to extend the franchise in hemophilia. I think it\u2019s sort of the general rule that when we move into an area and have programs and products that emerge from the pipeline, that we continue to innovate in those fields where we think that there\u2019s opportunities to improve upon existing products. So hemophilia is one area we\u2019re doing that obviously MS, we continue to do that, that\u2019s just sort of the natural part of the life cycle for any therapeutic area we\u2019re in. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen and Company : Thanks for the follow-up. I guess I\u2019ll ask the capital allocation question again, and I don\u2019t know you\u2019ve been getting asked from time-to-time. You\u2019ve got over $3 billion on the balance sheet now, Paul. You\u2019ve been saying that, I think, tuck in acquisitions have been your favorite use of cash. But we haven\u2019t seen any of those of late and you\u2019ve now reduced the guidance for BisDev in the back half of this year. So are you not seeing the opportunities? Are you changing strategy? What should we expect in the future? Paul J. Clancy: Thanks, Eric, for the question. Let me kind of address the second part of your question on the BisDev thing. The pipeline of business development activity, the strategic intense I think, I personally think our capabilities are at an all time high. And you just never know when these things can turn into a deal, and as a result it gets a little bit bumpy quarter-to-quarter, early in the year obviously the Eisai transaction, the Sangamo transaction impacted the R&D line. Third quarter just didn\u2019t really have anything. And I think that\u2019s continue way to expect it, it\u2019s hard to then translate that into a guidance. So we all just have to be mindful of that. More broadly, we certainly still believe those bad word for it, but tuck-in acquisitions are a remark \u2013 it\u2019s part and participle to the business that we\u2019re in. But it\u2019s really all about the mission that we have and delivering outside has the potential to deliver outside shareholder value returns. We\u2019ve seen that over the last ten plus years. As we move into 2015, we\u2019ll probably open and look towards figuring out what\u2019s the best way to return capital to shareholders as the cash flow continues to generate. As I also pointed out just wanted to make sure, but it\u2019s mindful of \u2013 we do expect to have meaningful CVR payments to the pharma owners of TECFIDERA, which is going to be captured into the cash flow statement, as well. So I think it\u2019s kind of largely continued as we have and with a pretty decent intent to rebuild their early and mid-stage pipeline. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Robert Baird. Your line is open. Christopher Raymond \u2013 Robert W. Baird: Hey, thanks. Just a follow-up here on TECFIDERA. So we\u2019ve done some of our own work on discontinuation rate and at least from docs are telling us, it looks like it\u2019s fairly flat and kind of consistent with what DEFINE and CONFIRM showed. Can you guys maybe talk about the trends you\u2019re seeing there? Are we right or is there some other sort of dynamic we should think about? Tony Kingsley :  Yes, thanks, Chris. This is Tony. I think that\u2019s consistent with what we\u2019re seeing. As we\u2019ve said before, the discontinuation rates, we expect to be similar to other in line therapies over time. We believe that physicians are learning to manage the GI and tolerability issues, but you\u2019re still going to get some drop off of that. So we believe that your analysis is probably in line with what we\u2019re seeing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thanks for the follow-up. This is John again on for Michal Yee. I don\u2019t think this was addressed on today\u2019s call, but for Anti-LINGO on the last earnings call, it was noted that the data from the optic neuritis studies will be expected in January of next year. Just wanted to confirm, is that still the guidance? And as for top line announcement we can expect, it\u2019s been a quite long since we\u2019ve last seen a Biogen press release on a mid-stage proof-of-concept program. So for the Anti-LINGO disclosure, how much data can we expect? Would it be something detailed with numerics from the multiple endpoints or just a simple short commentary whether a hit or the trends et cetera? Thank you. George A. Scangos:  Okay, sure. Yes, we\u2019re still on track for January. As to the data that we\u2019ll show, the goal here is to be as open as we can about the data without jeopardizing our ability to publish the data in peer review journal and have it accepted at a major meeting. Those are always the things that company is trying and trade off. So I can\u2019t tell you exactly what will be in the press release, but we will certainly be as explicit as we can with those caveats. Operator : I would now like to turn the conference back over to our presenters. George A. Scangos: Okay. Thank you all for the attention this morning and the time. And we\u2019ll get back to work and so can all of you. Thanks. Paul J. Clancy:  Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Courtney and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Idec Fourth Quarter and Year End 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Carlo Tanzi, Director or Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Carlo Tanzi : Thank you, and welcome to Biogen Idec\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogenidec.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures that we\u2019ll discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in tables one and two. Table three includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult our SEC filings for additional detail. On today\u2019s call, I\u2019m joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. George Scangos; Dr. Doug Williams EVP of Research and Development Tony Kingsley, EVP of Global Commercial Operations; and our CFO, Paul Clancy. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to George. George Scangos : Thanks Carlo. Good afternoon everyone thank you for joining us today. Sorry we had to move the call at the last minute, but as you can imagine things were little chaotic yesterday morning in Boston. I think we have optimally positioned it between the blizzard and the [indiscernible] discussions that will start [indiscernible]. So you guys have something to fill your, the void. 2014, I think, was a very successful year for Biogen Idec, we brought several new therapies to the market, we had encouraging data from some of the compounds in our pipeline and importantly we delivered 40% revenue growth and 54% non-GAAP EPS growth compared to 2013. In 2014 we launched four new products in two distinct therapeutic areas, which I think is a real accomplishment for a company of our size. TECFIDERA is in its second year on the market in the U.S. In 2014 we successfully launched TECFIDERA in the EU and are continuing to expand preference across the globe. TECFIDERA is now the most prescribed MS therapy in Germany and the most prescribed oral therapy in U.S. with more than a 135,000 people having been treated worldwide. As you all know from the IMS data, TECFIDERA did experience moderating growth in Q4, which we believe is due to a variety of factors that Tony will discuss in more detail. However, we believe that TECFIDERA will continue to grow in the U.S. and it will grow substantially in international markets, so that we anticipate that 2015 will be another year of meaningful growth for TECFIDERA and for our portfolio of MS products in general. PLEGRIDY was approved for the treatment of relapsing MS and launched in both the U.S. and EU in the second half of 2014. Although we are early in the launch, PLEGRIDY appears to be gaining rapid adoption. PLEGRIDY is an important part of our strategy to maintain our leadership position in the interferon segment of the MS market. We also obtained approval and subsequently launched our hemophilia products in the U.S. in 2014. ALPROLIX for hemophilia B and ELOCTATE for hemophilia A. ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE represent the first meaningful innovations in the treatment of hemophilia in many years, and reflect our mission to help bring new therapies to patients who are underserved. In our pipeline, we advanced several potential therapeutic options across a broad set of disease areas, along with our collaboration partner AbbVie, we reported positive results from the Phase 3 trial of ZINBRYTA for relapsing forms of MS, and expect to file for marketing authorization in the first half of the year. We believe ZINBRYTA has the potential to become another important treatment option to serve the diverse needs of MS patients. Our collaboration partner ISIS advanced the spinal muscular atrophy program SMNrx to Phase 3 in both infant and childhood forms of the disease. In December, we announced positive top line results from our Phase 1b trail of BIIB037 in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, this data are early but we believe they\u2019re compelling and we are aggressively working to advance this program into Phase 3. Earlier this month we announced Phase 2 results for our anti-LINGO antibody in acute optic neuritis. We believe that the data strongly suggest that our anti-LINGO antibody induced remyelination, and we\u2019re now focused on the data from the MS trial which we expect to have in early 2016. Throughout 2014 we also continued to build our research and development capabilities, by hiring a number of highly accomplished researchers from both academia and industry, and I believe that we now have truly world-class capabilities across the breadth of R&D. That has been a goal for a number of years and is rewarding to have made such a significant progress this year.  In 2000 - excuse me in 2014, we increased the number of promising assets in our pipeline through strategic acquisitions and collaborations with a number of partners including Sangamo, Eisai and most recently Convergence and San Raffaele Hospital. We also made significant progress and advancing our internally developed candidates into the clinic, including the BIIB061 and oral compound in Phase 1 development with the objective of enhancing remyelination. Additionally, Phase 1 studies are ongoing for several novel formulations of dimethyl fumarate, the active ingredient of TECFIDERA, with the goal of achieving once-a-day dosing and potentially reducing side effects. We\u2019ve not yet analyzed the data from these trials, but our hope is to move one or more of these formulations forward towards approval. Our bio-similar joint venture Samsung Bioepis continues to make important progress toward our objective of becoming a leader in the development of bio-similar pharmaceuticals. The EMEA recently accepted our application for approval of a bio-similar version of etanercept and we believe that we\u2019re making excellent progress on other bio-similar molecules as well. Through this JV, we intend to develop high quality bio-similar pharmaceutical, by utilizing our world-class protein engineering and biologics manufacturing capability. It\u2019s our belief that bio-similars will become increasingly important in the role of healthcare. And we believe that we\u2019re well positioned to contribute to this evolution. So all in all, it was a very busy and a very good year. And with that, I\u2019ll now pass the call along to Doug. Doug Williams : Thanks, George. Biogen Idec has a strong and increasingly diverse pipeline. I\u2019d like to discuss several of our ongoing programs and the progress we are anticipating during the upcoming year. Our Phase 3 study of TYSABRI and secondary progress of MS known as ASCEND, is fully enrolled. There\u2019s no effective therapies available today for this progressive and debilitating form of MS. ASCEND is a two-year placebo-controlled study in 890 patients that will determine whether or not TYSABRI has an impact on disability progression as measured by a novel composite end point. The study is being conducted under a special protocol assessment with the FDA and we expect the data from ASCEND in the second half of 2015. We\u2019re also conducting ACTION, which is a Phase 2 study evaluating TYSABRI in acute ischemic stroke. In this study, we are examining if blocking the lymphocytic infiltration, known to occur in the brain following stroke, can reduce the extent of injury. ACTION is a placebo-controlled study in a 160 patients where brain imaging is used to measure the change in infarct volume compared to Baseline. ACTION is fully enrolled and we expect data later this year. We previously discussed our positive top-line interim Phase 1b results for BIIB037 in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Additional BIIB037 study data will be presented at the upcoming ADPD meeting in March, the Phase 1b, BIIB037 study remains ongoing and our current plan is to initiate our Phase 3 program later this year. We also recently announced Phase 2 data from the anti-LINGO RENEW study in acute optic neuritis. We hope to present full data for menu at the upcoming American Academy of Neurology Meeting in April. The second ongoing Phase 2 study evaluating Anti-LINGO in MS patients is fully enrolled and we anticipate obtaining results in 2016 as previously disclosed. We continue to develop Neublastin as a novel biologic therapy for neuropathic pain. Our Phase 2 study in patients with painful lumbar radiculopathy will evaluate whether or not Neublastin has an impact on pain intensity scores. The study is now fully enrolled and results are anticipated in the second half of this year. Enrollment on our STX-100 Phase 2a study in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis continues, and the study is currently enrolling the fourth and potentially final patient cohort. Through our collaboration with Eisai, we\u2019ve obtained co-development and co-commercialization rights to two Alzheimer\u2019s disease candidates, BAN2401, an anti-amyloid BETA monoclonal antibody and E2609 a small molecule BACE inhibitor. BAN2401 is enrolling patients in Phase 2 and Eisai has initiated a Phase 2 study with E2609 in patients with Prodromal AD and mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. We\u2019ve also made progress in strengthening our pipeline through business development. And earlier this month we announced our agreement to acquire Convergence, a leader in the development of therapeutics for neuropathic pain. Convergence\u2019s lead program CNV1014802 is a small molecule inhibitor of the Nav 1.7 sodium channel, that\u2019s being developed for trigeminal neuralgia. Following completion of the acquisition, we expect to work expeditiously to advance CNV1014802 into registrational clinical programs. This morning, we announce the collaboration with San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, Italy, to develop gene therapy for both hemophilia A and hemophilia B. Our collaborators at San Raffaele are leaders in the use of Lentiviral Based gene therapy approaches. While this technology remains in early research, we believe gene therapy has the potential to provide lifelong benefits to patients with hemophilia. We look forward to continuing to drive R&D progress during the year. I\u2019ll now pass the call to Tony. Tony Kingsley : Thanks Doug. We launched four new products in 2014, and I\u2019m proud of the execution of the commercial organization. In 2014, we continue to grow our global MS market share, fueled by the continued rollout of TECFIDERA worldwide, improving performance from TYSABRI and continued strength for our interferon business, including the recent launch of PLEGRIDY. Over the past six months, our data suggested our portfolio has consistently captured roughly half of all newly diagnosis patients and switch patients in the U.S. TECFIDERA continue to demonstrate strong performance, which we believe is a testament towards attractive product profile combining strong efficacy, favorable safety, and tolerability and the convenience of overall administration. We believe TECFIDERA is on track to become the most prescribed therapy for MS worldwide. In the U.S. we saw continued growth through the fourth quarter with its market share near 20%. As you may have seen through IMS, we observed moderating new starts for TECFIDERA in the fourth quarter. We believe several factors have impacted the recent performance of TECFIDERA including a decline in the overall market switch rate. The U.S. label update in December and the recent launch of PLEGRIDY, which is capturing some interferon switches that otherwise, may have gone to TECFIDERA. Importantly, we have not noticed a meaningful change in TECFIDERA discontinuation rates. We are actively engaging physicians to ensure proper education on the label update and we believe in the continued growth potential of the product in the U.S. Out side of the U.S. we\u2019re continuing to see strong uptick in multiple launch markets matching or exceeding the pace that we\u2019ve seen in the U.S. In November, we launched TECFIDERA with full reimbursement in the UK and as of January, we secured reimbursement in both Italy and Spain. We continue to expect to achieve full reimbursement across the other major European markets by the end of the year. We believe that PLEGRIDY may become the interferon of choice based on its combination of efficacy of favorable safety profile and every two-week dosing with a convenient sub-Q autoinjector. To-date roughly half of PLEGRIDY prescriptions have come from AVONEX switches. The other half have come from other therapies and from newly diagnosed patients, which we believe is a positive message about the therapy\u2019s broad appeal. The rollout of PLEGRIDY is expected to continue across Europe in 2015 with launches in most of the major markets anticipated by the end of the year. TYSABRI continues to perform well as the therapy enjoyed its third consecutive quarter of positive net new patient adds, even as the oral therapies have continued to gain share. We believe that this performance is due to the high level of efficacy that TYSABRI provides to patients. Turning to our hemophilia products, we continue to believe that reduced infusion frequency is the largest unmet need for the hemophilia community and that ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE meaningfully address this burden. We are encouraged by the strong up tick of ALPROLIX in the U.S. We believe its value proposition to patients has been relatively straightforward, as the majority of patients starting on ALPROLIX have been choosing the once weekly prophylactic dosing schedule. ALPROLIX ended the year with its market share in the low teens with over 60% of hemophilia treatment centers prescribing the products. The U.S. launch of ELOCTATE has been preceding the plan ending the year with share in the mid-single digits with over 60% of hemophilia treatment centers prescribing after two quarters on the market. As we expected the hemophilia A market, has been more competitive than hemophilia B. Acquiring additional patients will require sustained educational and promotional efforts, but we believe we have the ability to execute on this strategy. I will now pass the call to Paul. Paul Clancy : Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.74 in the fourth quarter and $12.37 for the full year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $4.09 and $13.83 for the full year. Total revenue for the fourth quarter grew 34% to approximately $2.6 billion and grew 40% for the full year to $9.7 billion. Global fourth quarter TECFIDERA revenue was $916 million. We recorded revenues of $743 million in the U.S. and $173 million outside the U.S. TECFIDERA U.S. sales included 14 shipping weeks in the fourth quarter, this added approximately $50 million to U.S. sales. Foreign exchange offset by hedging weakened TECFIDERA revenue by approximately $7 million for the quarter, versus the prior quarter. Our estimate is that we ended the quarter with approximately 2.5 weeks of inventory in the U.S. wholesale channel, a similar level to last quarter. For the full year world wide TECFIDERA revenues were $2.9 billion consisting of $2.4 billion in the U.S. and $483 million in sales outside the U.S. Interferon revenues including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY were $777 million during the fourth quarter, which includes $528 million in the U.S. and $249 million in sales outside the U.S. For the full year worldwide interferon revenue grew 2% to $3.1 billion consisting of $2 billion in the U.S. and $1.1 billion in sales outside the U.S. AVONEX U.S. sales included 14 shipping weeks in the fourth quarter, which added approximately $35 million of the U.S. sales. Foreign exchange offset by hedging weakened Q4 interferon revenue by approximately $9 million versus prior quarter. TYSABRI worldwide revenue was $484 million in the fourth quarter these results were comprised of $266 million in the U.S. and $218 million internationally. TYSABRI U.S. sales included 13 shipping weeks in the fourth quarter versus 14 shipping weeks in Q3. Foreign exchange offset by hedging weakened TYSABRI revenue by approximately $9 million for Q4 versus Q3. For the full year, worldwide TYSABRI revenue was approximately $2 billion of which U.S. revenue was $1 billion and $934 million internationally. Moving to hemophilia, ALPROLIX revenue in Q4 was $40 million and $76 million since being launched in May. ELOCTATE revenue in Q4 was $37 million and $58 million since being launched in July. Turning to our anti-CD20 unconsolidated joint business, which includes RITUXAN and GAZYVA U.S. profit share, as well as the profit share on royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. We recorded $305 million for Q4 and $1.2 billion for the full year. Royalties were $31 million for Q4, compared to $67 million in the prior quarter. Our royalty revenues from Angiomax ended on December 15 with the patent expiration. For the full year royalty revenues were $177 million. Now, turning to the expense lines on non-GAAP P&L. Q4 non-GAAP cost of goods sold were $297 million or 11% of revenue. For the full year non-GAAP COGS were $1.2 billion or 12% of revenues. Q4 non-GAAP R&D expense was $409 million or 19% of revenue, which includes approximately $50 million in milestones and other payments related primarily to our JV with Samsung Bioepis and our recent collaboration with Google [x] Life Sciences. For the full year non-GAAP R&D expense was $1.9 billion or 19% of revenue, an increase of 31% over 2013. Q4 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $573 million or 22% of revenue and the full year non-GAAP SG&A expense was $2.2 billion or 23% of revenue, an increase of 30% over 2013. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24% for the fourth quarter, as we benefited form the reinstated R&D tax credit. Our full year tax rate was approximately 25%. During the quarter, we made a $200 million CVR payment to the former shareholders of Fumapharm. And in Q4 as part of our ongoing share stabilization plan, we repurchased 1.7 million shares for total of approximately $527 million. Our weighted average diluted shares at the end of the year were $237 million and we ended the year with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately fifty-fifty between the U.S. and ex-U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which again were $4.09 for the fourth quarter and $13.83 for the full year, representing a 54% year-over-year increase. Let me turn to our full year 2015 guidance. In 2015, we plan to provide annual guidance and one update per year during our second quarter earnings. This modest change is intended to synchronize with our internal planning processes and ensure continued focus on the long-term. Now starting with revenues, we expect revenue growth between 14% and 16%. Before I provide color on the products I\u2019d like to highlight three factors. First, our plan assumes exchange rates at the recent spot rate. Second, as a reminder, we expect a year-over-year decrease in royalty revenue of approximately $130 million as the royalties on ANGIOMAX sales have expired. And third, our plan assumes our one year free [ph] pricing in Germany for TECFIDERA will end this March and move to a lower price. Now, let me characterize how we\u2019re thinking about each of our products. Our plan assumes TECFIDERA will represent the largest contributor to our overall revenue growth. In Europe, our plan assumes TECFIDERA will have full reimbursement in the majority of the EU market. For TYSABRI we believe the therapy will continue on a positive patient growth trajectory. We continue to be in discussions with IEPA to resolve the outstanding periods yet a settlement is not included in our 2015 guidance. We believe we\u2019re well positioned with PLEGRIDY within the interferon and combined with AVONEX our plan assumes, we\u2019ll continue to gain share within this declining segment. For our MS therapies our plan assumes a constant number of shipping weeks of 13 for each of the four quarters in 2015. We believe ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE will continue to grow at a strong pace, as we continue to focus on expanding the depth and breadth of the therapies. Our 2015 plan assumes revenues related to RITUXAN and GAZYVA will grow modestly. R&D expense is expected to be between 19% and 20% of sales, which includes approximately $250 million year mark for business development activity at similar level of spend when compared to 2014. SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 20% to 21% of revenue, as we are now through the commercial ramp of both TECFIDERA and hemophilia therapies we anticipate over 200 basis point improvement in SG&A year-over-year. We anticipate non-GAAP EPS results between $16.60 and $17 and GAAP EPS to be between $15.45 and $15.85. From a cash perspective, we expect to pay over $1 billion in CVR payments to Fumapharm related to the sales of TECFIDERA. And we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $400 million to $450 million, an increase over 2014 as we invest in our manufacturing capabilities and IT infrastructure. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George for his closing comments. George Scangos : Thank you, Paul. Okay in closing, we had a very productive year. We gained regulatory data protection for TECFIDERA in the EU and subsequently launched in Europe. We launched PLEGRIDY in the U.S. and Europe and ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX in the U.S., as well as some other countries. We had a good year commercially and financially and we received positive results in some of the important compounds in our pipeline. We started out 2015 with the agreement to acquire Convergence and the collaboration with San Raffaele Hospital. And we expect to complete additional business development transactions during the year. We also expect to see pipeline readouts for several compounds. In addition to the presentations of the data for BIIB037 Anti-LINGO antibody expected in March and April and the completion of the TYSABRI SPMS trial. We expect to see mid stage data for Neublastin in neuropathic pain and TYSABRI in stroke. So this will be another busy year with meaningful milestones, with aggressive goals and all aspects of the business and we\u2019ll continue to do our best to achieve them. So in closing and as always I\u2019d like to thank our employees for a dedicated to making positive impact on patient lives, and the patients and physicians who are involved in our clinical development programs. The achievements we\u2019ve made together could not have been realized without their passion and commitment. I thank you all for joining us this afternoon. And operator, we\u2019ll now open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen. Your line is open. Eric Schmidt : Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great 2014. Maybe for Paul on the ex-U.S. TECFIDERA trajectory, it sounds like the drug is now number one in Germany and that you\u2019re quite optimistic for a lot of growth ex-U.S. in 2015, yet we think the numbers came in a little bit below consensus, you flagged this $7 million FX hit. But was there anything else on TECFIDERA that credit maybe a little bit of a weaker ex-U.S. sales number? Paul Clancy : No, nothing meaningful ex-U.S., I mean we\u2019re actually very happy with how things are moving along ex-U.S. as you had noted. Our challenge to our organization is that every country that we get reimbursement and we do better than the [prior] [ph] we actually were able to better in terms of launch curve at time equal to zero in Germany than the United States, and we hope to do it as we kind of go to every other country, that\u2019s obviously an aspiration more than anything else, so nothing too meaningful in terms of the trends to point out. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein. Your line is open. Geoffrey Porges : Thanks very much and congratulations on the results. I appreciate the detailed guidance. I just want to ask about BIIB037 still getting questions about that, and you provided some useful color, first out of the year, but could you just talk a little bit about specifically where you\u2019re going with the dose and I am thinking about the Phase 3 trials and discussions that you\u2019re having, when might you have those discussions with the FDA and when might be have a physician to sort of talk about what the trials look like, the scope and that sort of thing? Doug Williams : Hi, Geoff, this is Doug. Thanks for the question. There is not a lot of additional color that I can provide to you vis-\u00e0-vis the final study design going into Phase 3. As you can imagine, we\u2019re in the process of having discussions with regulators. In fact, we\u2019ve been having them for some time as we\u2019ve been seeing the data emerge from the study. I think it\u2019s safe to say that our intent going forward will be to try to design a study that most faithfully reproduces the type of patient that we treated in the Phase 1b study, as well as looking at similar endpoints, as you know from a cognition perspective we achieve statistical significance on the CDR sum of boxes, which is a registrational endpoint. The base inhibitor for AstraZeneca and Lilly is actually using that as a Phase 3 endpoint in prodromal and mild patients. So I think you can anticipate a Phase 3 program that will have similar patients entering the study, screened in a similar fashion upfront and the final study design we will talk about at the time we start enrolling patients, that\u2019s our usual practice. I don\u2019t see any reason to break profile for this particular molecule.  With respect to the choice of dose, as you know the study is still underway, we still have a couple of cohorts that remain blinded and until we see that data, we won\u2019t be able finalize the exact dosing regimen except reiterating, what Al said at J.P. Morgan, which is we believe we have a dosing window that we can work with from both a safety perspective, but more importantly from what looks like a treatment effect perspective, as well. So a lot more information at the ADPD meeting about the results that we\u2019ve been able to look at, but the study design issues are very much in process right now. And we\u2019ll let you know what those studies are going to look like at the time we enroll the fist patient. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Mark Schoenebaum : Hi, thank you very much. Just a follow-up on the Alzheimer\u2019s question, if I may, why did you guys choose not to use ADAS-Cog as a cognitive endpoint. And then the two cognitive endpoints that you did, look at mini mental, or the two endpoints, if you look at mini mental I believe sum of the boxes. Doug, there\u2019s been this debate on WallStreet regarding Lilly as to clinical significance versus statistical significance, I\u2019d love to get your view of what would constitute a clinically significant benefit in the mini-mental and the sum of the boxes. Thanks a lot. Doug Williams : Okay. So we choose not to use ADAS-Cog because I think it\u2019s now the view of the field that that\u2019s probably a better tool to use for patients who are further down the disease spectrum. That CDR is I think now becoming much more accepted as a preferred primary end point for studies that focus on patients with Prodromal and mild disease. That seems to be the pattern that\u2019s emerging. If you look at what the primary end points for studies in those cohorts of patients, actually are using with the Lilly study being just an example of that. The issue of what constitutes clinical significance is one that obviously is something that we\u2019ll be discussing with regulators. Our view based on our decision to go right from Phase 1B to Phase 3 is that we believe we\u2019ve seen a treatment effect that is significant enough and our advisors believe this to be the case to meet the criteria in most people\u2019s minds for clinical significance and not just statistical significance. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Terence Flynn : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Two part one for me. Just in terms of your guidance on the Interferon franchise, Paul, just wondering you mentioned you expect to take share in a declining market, which we\u2019ve heard similar commentary from you guys in the past, but do you actually think that can be a growth franchise for you this year. And then the second part of that is just implications of the entry of Daclizumab and longer-term Ocrelizumab and impact on your injectable franchise? Thank you. Paul Clancy : Yes, I think we\u2019ll probably end up tag teaming this one a little bit Terence. I think it\u2019s being growth is probably a little bit of a stretch. So I mean I think the reason we\u2019ve been a little bit cautious on kind of phrasing it up that way is this - obviously an interplay of how fast orals move along which effects Interferon, which so and if orals don\u2019t move along as fast I think the Interferon franchise will hang in there. It\u2019s not unheard of. It\u2019s just - I think it\u2019s early days right now, but over \u2013 look, conceptually we do believe there\u2019s something special about PLEGRIDY and that once every two weeks subcu is so much more favorable than any of the other Interferons and potentially COPAXONE as well. So we\u2019ll have to see whether or not that turns into the combination of AVONEX and PLEGRIDY growing. But we\u2019re hoping at a minimum it hangs in there. Tony Kingsley : Terence, it\u2019s Tony. Let me hit dac first, look we think dac is a very good compound and it certainly as a place in the market. I'm not sure I would think of it - look we don\u2019t have the label yet, so there is some things that we don\u2019t know. It wouldn\u2019t necessarily think of it as an injectable in the sense of the platform therapy as we think of them today in that it has - it appears to have a different efficacy profile, so it may play in some broader segments than the existing platform therapies do. In terms of ocrelizumab again we have to wait and see, there is - we hear interest in the market as I am sure you do from physicians that it looks like it could be an interesting, very much in the high efficacy segment, but we\u2019ll have to wait and see how that product plays out and where it fits versus TYSABRI and some of the other alternatives. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Ravi Mehrotra : Hi, thanks for taking my question and I apologize up front where we\u2019re going to ask you to do our job one level. On TECFIDERA looking at long-term consensus numbers, I know these numbers are no easy, looks like the average 20-20 estimates around $9 billion implying a global market share of around 40% interested in your view on whether you\u2019re seeing the streak may have got ahead of itself here or if you think that TECFIDERA is likely to get to those levels of market share? Doug Williams : Gosh, Ravi, I mean, we don\u2019t give long-term guidance out there and so I think we\u2019re going to kind of stay at that as it is, and let people come to their same conclusions. We think there\u2019s still a very meaningful growth with TECFIDERA that\u2019s embedded in the guidance for this year, but I wouldn\u2019t want to kind of really comments on the bunch of models over a long period of time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Cory Kasimov : Hi, good afternoon thanks for taking my question. In your prepared remarks, you alluded to the ongoing Phase 1 studies for several novel forms of MMF and, I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s anything you can say about how these molecules differ from TECFIDERA and when you maybe in a position to provide some data on that? Thanks. Doug Williams : Let me be clear. We\u2019re not testing formulations of MMF we\u2019re testing formulations of DMF, which is the active ingredient of TECFIDERA. And DMF is DMF, but the formulations are different and look the intent is to get through once-a-day formulation, potentially reduce the GI side effects. So we\u2019ll - we have several formulations in Phase 1 now we have others behind those and we\u2019re hopeful to be able to bring forward one of them to the market. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi. Your line is open. Yaron Werber : Great, thanks for taking my question. So I have a question of, Tony if you don\u2019t mind sort of two of them. One is we\u2019ve been doing a lot of work on biosimilars and we\u2019re trying to figure out your view of what happens to the ABCR class, when Copaxone goes generic, so what would happen let\u2019s say to the interferon class? And then secondly, you mentioned, there is three different reasons TECFIDERA was weaker, it was - or weaker or slowing down in terms of new patient adds, there was a decline in switching U.S. label change and a PLEGRIDY launch. Of the three, which one was the most important? Thank you. George Scangos : Good, good, two part of question your own. So let me\u2026 Tony Kingsley : You move into the fact of... George Scangos : Look, Copaxone, I think we\u2019ve been consistent on that. We think U.S. private payer market, the impact of a generic Copaxone is largely unbranded Copaxone. It\u2019s difficult for payers to see or certainly to convince physicians if there is therapeutic substitutability between [indiscernible] and the interferon. So I think that\u2019s where we are on that. And that\u2019s pretty consistent with what we said in the past. On TECFIDERA, look actually you hardened the piece apart, probably the Paul said, we expect the product to grow, but we would see some moderation in growth next year. I think we what is said that in any case for the first reason, which is the switch rate in the market in the U.S. has come down over the last three or four quarters. We\u2019ve talked about that I think again pretty consistently. When TECFIDERA launched in the U.S., and we\u2019re seeing this repeat outside the U.S. It doubled or tripled the switch rate for proto time and that\u2019s been working its way down over time. Yaron Werber : One other thing I\u2019d add to it. We\u2019ve always said in the past that over time, we think IMS the data that you all see is pretty accurate. It\u2019s actually been accurate on a short-term basis as well. So I think you can kind of look at the trends of the IMS scripts kind of in the Q3 and Q4 and you can kind of interpret things, PLEGRIDY launched effectively in the first week of November and you can kind of discern a little bit. I think at the end of the day, you look at and say a lot of these things all happen at the same time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is open. Geoff Meacham : Good afternoon guys, thanks for taking the question. I just had one on LINGO. I know you guys, obviously, just got the data this month, but when you look beyond AN, will there be much more data internally or over four year publicly released MS data. I guess I am just trying to get us feel for what you\u2019re ultimately be looking for in Phase III effect size wise. And what you can in fact address this year with regulators before you start a formal pivotal in MS. Thanks. Doug Williams : Hi, Jeff, this is Doug. I think there is not a lot of additional data from the acute optic neuritis study that we\u2019re going to see I think you\u2019ll see the majority of the data as much as we can cram into 115 minute platform presentation or at least I hope it\u2019s a platform presentation at AAN. It\u2019s likely that there will be some additional data cuts that we will sort of trickle out at subsequent medical meetings, but I think you get a clear sense of what we\u2019ve seen in that data where the acute optic neuritis at AAN. The MS study as we talked about in a previous earnings call that study is ongoing, it is fully enrolled now. Our intent is to actually have a small group of us internally, see some of that data at the 12-month time point later this year, which we will use as a basis to begin to have some of those discussions with regulators. So I think that what we\u2019re able to see in that data will teach us a lot about which of the various end points where measuring in that study, actually show the best correlation with remyelination. As you know, this is the first of its kind study where we are assessing the impact of remyelination on patients with MS. And so we\u2019re looking at a variety of end points everything from EDSS to cognition to certainly ambulatory parameters. We have a number of imaging end points built into the study. And from that analysis, we hope to be able to piece out what the most sensitive clinical measures of remyelination are, so that we can go to regulators and start discussing what a Phase 3 end point might actually look like. So as we said in the previous call, there will be a small group of us that will see that data and that will allow us to determine how to have a conversation with regulators. We plan to keep the study blinded through to the full 18-month time point, which means that full data disclosure won't come until sometime in 2016 for the full data set. So that that\u2019s what you can anticipate playing out over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Brian Abrahams : Thanks for taking my question. A question for Tony, you mentioned one of the causes for the TECFIDERA slowdown recently, has been the label change, but interestingly you\u2019re not seeing any increase in discontinuations, which I guess you\u2019d presumably get with more aggressive lymphocyte monitoring. So I'm curious what are you seeing in terms of physician reactions to the PML case that might be slowing uptake? And what sorts of educational initiatives do you think will be needed to help physicians work around this? Tony Kingsley : Thanks, good question. I think the educational initiatives are underway, which is we have our sales forces out, talking new broad set of physicians, our medical team is providing support where there are request. So I think we are executing it and educating people to the label and what the label says and answering those questions. A part of the impact when you\u2019ve something like this is the time that takes to get, you can get to a small set of physicians quickly, and you tend to get to the KOLs quickly, it\u2019s the time to get to the broader community base. So we think we have the right education in place. We have to keep executing and making sure that that continuously happen. Look the lack of meaningful change that we see or we believe we\u2019re seeing in the discount rate is encouraging because it doesn\u2019t suggest there is such a change in the profile that people are anxious to pull patients off on the country. Look I think naturally in a case like this is people are processing the new label. You\u2019ll see softness in the switch rate for a period of time and that is probably what accounts for. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Matthew Harrison : Great, thanks for taking the question. Just on BIIB037, so first can you just clarify, earlier you mentioned, only mentioned CDR Sum of boxes is - significant cognition end point. Was it just that or it was that an MMSc? And then should we expect to see or what should we expect to see in the abstract, will there be any significant data there, or is it mostly a placeholder? Thanks. George Scangos : Well, with respect to the statistical significance, we did achieve that with both the CDR Sum of boxes and with the MMSc. So I believe we did clarify that at the JPMorgan meetings in January. And with respect to what\u2019s in the abstract, I haven\u2019t actually seen it myself. So I can\u2019t answer the question. I think there won\u2019t be enough to satisfy you in the abstract anyways. So I think the real answer to the question is going to come out of the presentation itself because there will be a lot more information there than there will be in the abstract. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Ying Huang : Thanks for taking my question as well. So maybe a housekeeping question for Paul. You mentioned that IMS data in the short term was pretty accurate, but it seems you guys did a better job in several drug in the U.S. for TECFIDERA. So I was wondering can you quantify where it was I guess short. And then can you quantify also the exact inventory level, I know its 2.5 weeks from Q3 to Q4. And then just curious your view also on the outcome is, I guess [indiscernible]. It seems that you guys don\u2019t feel very strong about the MS product. Thanks. Paul Clancy : Thanks Huang. Yes, I am not sure what question is on the clarification for MS, I think you\u2019re referring to something outside the U.S. and we\u2019ve really don\u2019t have a clear picture outside the United States. So IMS what I was referring is within the United States and just on a more of a week-to-week basis. We kind of see it as pretty accurate vis-\u00e0-vis our data that we have from SPTs going to patients. Ying Huang : Okay. Doug Williams : And I think with respect to the MMF prodrug situation, I think there are certainly two programs that are in the clinic at the moment that we\u2019re aware of that are moving along, still very early. I think George pointed out the distinction between DMF and MMF and we think that\u2019s an important distinction because it\u2019s quite clear from a number of studies that we\u2019ve carried out that the biologic response at least in pre-clinical settings to MMF is distinct from DMF. And so, it remains to be proven that the ability to replicate the safety and efficacy profile that we see with TECFIDERA, which is DMF can in fact be replicated with these MMF prodrugs. So I think that\u2019s - what the hurdle is for those programs moving forward and it\u2019s still far too early I think to access how successful those are going to be. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Michael Yee : Thanks. A follow-up question on BIIB037, there has been recent phase to readouts, I guess most recently with Lilly, and we\u2019ve all seen a 34% improvement and cognition there. It has carvedilol [ph] MMSE. So can you help us to frame that data with why you\u2019re suggest up with your data, but I guess also when we see your presentation, how much information will we get, I know there is more information than - a more follow up beyond just the interim, so help us to understand what we\u2019re seeing there. Doug Williams : Well, I think, with respect to our data, which is what I\u2019ll focus the answer to the question on. I think what you\u2019ll see I think is the actual numbers behind the statements that we made. There is a clear dose and time dependent reduction in beta-amyloid levels that we\u2019ve seen in these patients. There is a dose dependent and statistically significant impact on cognition as measured by two parameters, both CDR sum of boxes as well as the MMSE endpoint. And what you\u2019ll also see I believe is data to support the notion that we put forward that we believe we have a safety window to work with vis-\u00e0-vis the area that we have seen with our molecule. That\u2019s also been seen with some of the other anti-beta amyloid antibody. So I think that the data that we\u2019ve seen, the data we\u2019ve talked about at least in verbal form is compelling enough and consistent enough for us to want to move the program as rapidly as we can from Phase 1B into Phase 3. And I think that you\u2019ll hopefully get a clear sense of the treatment effect that we\u2019ve seen and the consistency of the results across the various parameters we measure. It was enough to convince us to make the lead from 1B right into Phase 3. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Robyn Karnauskas : Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I guess I\u2019ll ask a hemophilia question, one really hasn\u2019t come up. So you just talked a little bit about its being competitive in the factory base. Help us to think about like what you\u2019re doing to maybe increase switching and should we just expect even in the steady growth of that product or could there be an acceleration in the back of the year after maybe you change some of the marketing or anything like that? Thanks. George Scangos : Good. Robyn as Tony said if I look back to before we launched both the products, I think we both said, we couldn\u2019t predict the launch curve that well, but we go with even and steady might be was ALPROLIX got off to a faster start because it\u2019s a very straightforward proposition for physicians. For patients you have a pretty friendly group of patients in the fampridine market and there\u2019s zero competitor responsible. We\u2019ve said that we think the ELOCTATE in fact really is going two plan as we\u2019ve expected to which is you have to take captures and early adaptors, you have to have - those patients have good experience, so that they can - it\u2019s a big market they can activate other people. So we\u2019re continuing to execute on patient education, but a lot of it is calling on the hemophilia treatment centers explaining - the label explaining the data talking to both nurses and physicians. So I think it\u2019s pretty consistent with the way we\u2019ve talked about it historically. It takes a lot of good hard execution, but we like the product profile. We think over time you build that virtue a cycle of - patients have good experience, physicians have good experience and you get increased adoption over time. So I think we\u2019re on a steady march - try to convert that market and I think we have a good product and good ability to do that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Roden with UBS. Your line is open. Matthew Roden : Great, thanks very much for taking the question. I hope you guys are all dug out from all the snow. George Scangos : A little soon... Matthew Roden : Yes. So Doug, you mentioned in Alzheimer\u2019s staying faithful to the patient population as you move forward, so that prompted me the wonder whether or not they start seeing improvement in cognition style [ph] was in the Prodromal patients or the early AD patients are both, and also whether or not the statistic was on a intent-to-treat basis. Thank you. Doug Williams : Yes, with respect to the study itself again I keep pointing you in the direction of the presentation. I don\u2019t want to disclose any additional information about the study itself beyond what we\u2019ve talked about so far. And again with respect to the design of Phase 3, we\u2019ll be trying to faithfully replicate the population of patients that we treated in the Phase 1b study and the Phase 3. So it will be a Prodromal and mild population of patients. I think you can anticipate that we will do a similar of type of entry screening to what we did in Phase 1b to confirm that the patients actually have the target for the drug as a pre requisite to enrolling them into the study, and beyond that I\u2019ll just stay silent until we present the actual dataset in March. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Wei with Jefferies. Your line is open. Thomas Wei : Thanks, just a follow-up on BIIB037. Just from whatever work you\u2019ve done or when you look at the overall literature, do you think you believe that the BETA amyloid pieces could lead to improvements in cognition or are really just looking for slowing or stabilization of cognitive decline? Alfred Sandrock : It\u2019s a really good question. I think we don\u2019t actually know the answer to that question. It\u2019s testable, if in fact you have an agent that both removes amyloid and does in fact, show improvements in cognition, at least the rate of the decline versus the control population. And my bias and my guests is that what we\u2019re looking at is something a kin to disease modification with DMT\u2019s and MS, which is a hopefully a major slowing in the decline of these patients overtime. Whether in fact we can treat them and reverse some of the damage that\u2019s been done. I think is an unknown at this point, but obliviously the long-term follow-up studies would be designed to try to answer those sorts of questions over a longer duration of treatment than what we\u2019re likely to do in the Phase 3 program. So I think the hope is there, but at the moment, I think it\u2019s a hope. George Scangos : Tom, this is George. It\u2019s a question that we also I think is a very important. Look we\u2019ve one year data on patients and it\u2019s a long-term disease. And so we just on have enough data yet to answer that question. I think when you see the data that we present in March we can have a more, let\u2019s say intelligent discussion about that topic. But it\u2019s hard to see anything meaningful in the absence of the data. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Josh Schimmer : Thanks for taking the question I'm going to ask the Gene Therapy Consortium, is the hemophilia program going to be first experience of an in vivo, use of antivirus and what gives you confidence in the safety and efficacy of this approach? Thanks. Doug Williams : The question is with respect to the gene therapy. Josh can you just repeat the question, you were breaking up. George Scangos : Yes, you\u2019re breaking up there. Josh Schimmer : I\u2019m sorry, so I was just wondering is this the first experience with in vivo introducing antivirus to support purpose of gene therapy and what gives you the confidence that the in vivo approach will be both safe and efficacious. Doug Williams : Yes, Josh, this is Doug. I think the deal we announced today is in fact using lentiviral in a systemic delivery mode. It\u2019s still a very early program, but one that we have looked at and one for which we\u2019re excited to be working with Luigi Naldini, who is one of the leaders in this area. It\u2019s an early program he\u2019s got intriguing data at the moment using a vector system that they have designed, there\u2019s still a number of technical hurdles to overcome with this. But it does direct expression into the liver and one of the advantages with lentiviral vectors is that, number one, you obviate some of the issues that you have with AAV vectors, which involved pre-existing immunity to the vector system itself. And it\u2019s also a very long-term expression that you\u2019re capable of getting with that vector system. So Luigi is one of the pioneers in this area, we think that if we can make this a successful approach that it really is a transformational approach from a gene therapy perspective given how broadly you could treat patients with both factor VIII and factor IX deficiency. So still pre-clinical, but I think very much with transformational type of therapy if we can bring it forward and make it work. Carlo Tanzi : Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Joseph Schwartz with Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Joseph Schwartz : Thanks very much for fitting me in. You\u2019ve been using some innovative patient screening methodologies in the Phase 1b for BIIB037 such as automating PET amyloid quantification and focusing on certain regions of the brand. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about these tools in terms of how they could influence who will be eligible for receiving the drug. If it comes to market, are you planning to develop a companion diagnostic to can it be commercialized along side BIIB037? Tony Kingsley : Well, at the moment what we are using is an agent that is in fact already licensed and available in the market. It\u2019s AV-45 as a screening tool for patients coming into the study. We thought that that was an important way of screening patients upfront to confirm that in particular patients with mild cognitive impairment. There are many reasons why that could happen, amyloid-beta deposition being just one of them. So confirming that the patients actually have the target for our drug upfront, we believe it was an important way of enriching the population of potential responders. And as we carried out the study, I think that was confirmed because our screen failure rate was probably on the order of 30% to 40%, meaning that even though these patients had cognitive impairment, it didn\u2019t actually have BETA amyloid deposition at a level that was detectable with the screening reagents. So they were eliminated from the study, they could arguably never have responded to our drug anyways. So we needed to actually get them out of the study upfront. How this plays out with respect to the eventual labeling of the drug? My guess is that it will become standard practice to actually screen patients with early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s with either AV-45, which is available or something a kin to that and a kin to that, I mean there are CSF levels of a beta that can be looked at as well. Someway of screening patients upfront to confirm that their disease, their cognitive impairment is caused by BETA amyloid deposition, I think, will become part of the treatment paradigm. So whether it\u2019s a bio assay based on CSF or whether it\u2019s an imaging approach like we\u2019ve used, I do believe that that will be an essential part of the treatment paradigm going forward, to confirm that these drugs are being used in the right patients. George Scangos : Okay. So with that I think we\u2019ll bring the call to an end. So thank you all for your flexibility and being with us this afternoon. And thanks for all your interest and we can all get back to work. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Biogen First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one question to allow time for others in queue to ask a question. I'll now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ben Strain, Associate Director, Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Ben Strain - Associate Director, Investor Relations : Thank you and welcome to Biogen's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investor section of biogen.com to find the press release and the related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on the website that follow the discussion related to this call. I would like to point out that we'll be making forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage everyone to consult our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. George Scangos; Dr. Doug Williams, EVP of Research and Development; Tony Kingsley, EVP of Global Commercial Operations; and our CFO, Paul Clancy. Now, I'll turn the call over to George. George A. Scangos, Ph.D. - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Biogen had a mixed start to 2015. We made good progress on our pipeline but our commercial results were not as strong as we'd hoped. Although we achieved 20% revenue growth and 55% non-GAAP EPS growth compared to the same quarter last year, we'd expected to do even better. We saw moderating patient uptake of our oral MS therapy TECFIDERA in the U.S. and Germany. And like other companies, we had foreign exchange headwinds. Our MS franchise continued to gain overall share this quarter but at a moderating pace. Our interferon business continued to perform well, driven by the recent introduction of PLEGRIDY. TYSABRI remained the therapy of choice for patients needing high efficacy. TECFIDERA had a more challenging quarter due to a number of issues, including an overall slowing of the MS market, the recent launch of PLEGRIDY, the single PML case reported last year and some first quarter financial dynamics that Paul will discuss. And as Tony will describe a little later, our two hemophilia products, ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX, continued to gain patients and market share during the quarter. On the research front, we continue to advance our pipeline. We recently presented compelling data for aducanumab, which is the first investigational drug for Alzheimer's disease that has demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of amyloid plaque and a statistically significant slowing of clinical impairment. And this week, we're presenting 73 company-sponsored platform and poster presentations at AAN [American Academy of Neurology], which highlight our marketed MS therapies, including TECFIDERA's strong efficacy across a broad range of MS patients in addition to its favorable long-term safety. We also presented new data for anti-LINGO-1 in acute optic neuritis and aducanumab in Alzheimer's disease. We made excellent progress toward initiating multiple Phase III trials. We plan to initiative Phase III trials for aducanumab later this year. We also recently initiated a Phase III trial for TECFIDERA in patients with secondary progressive MS, both of which Doug will highlight. We believe these important investments have the potential to be significant future growth drivers for Biogen. We continued to make progress in our biosimilar efforts. So far this year, Marketing Authorization Applications filed by Samsung Bioepis, our joint venture with Samsung Biologics, for etanercept and infliximab biosimilar candidates have been accepted by the EMA. Biogen is preparing to commercialize these therapies across the EU if approved. There is a growing societal need for high-quality biosimilars to help improve patient access to treatments that they need, and we believe that Biogen's world-class development, manufacturing and analytical capabilities position us well to bring these therapies to patients. So in conclusion, we have another busy year in which we'll focus on the trajectory of TECFIDERA and of our entire MS franchise in order to achieve our commercial and financial goals and ensure that we execute ongoing and planned clinical trials to move our pipeline forward as quickly as possible. So now, I'll turn the call over to Doug who will update you on our progress in R&D. Douglas E. Williams, Ph.D. - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Thanks, George. At last month's AD/PD meeting, we presented positive interim data from our Phase Ib study evaluating aducanumab in patients with prodromal and mild Alzheimer's disease. And earlier this week at AAN, we presented additional Phase Ib results demonstrating that aducanumab treatment had a consistent impact on amyloid levels in ApoE4 carriers versus non-carriers as well as in prodromal versus mild AD patient subgroups. We plan to present clinical data for these subgroups at subsequent medical meetings. We plan to initiate Phase III registrational studies for aducanumab in the second half of this year. We've been in active dialogue with regulators and we're close to finalizing our Phase III development plan. Our expectation is that our registrational program will include two identical 18-month-long placebo-controlled trials, each including 1,350 subjects with early Alzheimer's disease. We intend to use the CDR [Clinical Dementia Rating] sum of boxes as the primary end point. In each Phase III study, we plan to evaluate two doses of aducanumab in both the ApoE4 carriers and non-carriers, with ApoE4 non-carriers receiving higher treatment doses. Estimating enrollment timing is difficult though we anticipate Phase III enrollment duration will be similar to other large studies in Alzheimer's disease. We hope the substantial interest in the program will catalyze recruitment. However, the studies will include early Alzheimer's patients who are often not yet diagnosed. Also, we must ensure that clinical sites have access to amyloid PET imaging. As we initiate the Phase III program, the Phase Ib study will remain ongoing. We expect to present the one-year clinical results for the 6 mg/kg study cohort at the AAIC meeting in July. We also continue to evaluate dose titration, and we expect to present those results next year. Moving on to our other programs, starting with ZINBRYTA. The EMA has validated the Marketing Authorization Application for ZINBRYTA. If approved, we believe ZINBRYTA could be an important new therapeutic option for relapsing MS patients. For TECFIDERA, we recently initiated a new Phase III study, INSPIRE, to evaluate whether TECFIDERA slows the rate of disability progression in patients with secondary progressive MS. There are no effective treatments available today for SPMS, and developing therapies for this patient population is of great interest to the organization. INSPIRE is a two-year placebo-controlled study in 1,170 subjects. The primary endpoint is time to confirm disability progression based on a composite endpoint including EDSS, a timed 25-foot walk test and a nine-hole peg test. The endpoint utilized is similar to that being used in the ongoing TYSABRI ASCEND SPMS study. The scientific rationale to develop TECFIDERA in SPMS is based on both biological and clinical evidence. We believe preclinical data demonstrate that TECFIDERA has cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties that may address the lymphocytic infiltrates and neurodegeneration known to occur in SPMS patients. The clinical data from TECFIDERA Phase III studies also demonstrated reduced disability progression in subjects even when they hadn't experienced recent relapses. Turning to anti-LINGO, at this week's AAN meeting we presented detailed results from the Phase II acute optic neuritis study which we believe demonstrate that anti-LINGO is able to remyelinate damaged neurons. New data demonstrate a statistically-significant improvement in recovery of optic nerve conduction latency in subjects treated with anti-LINGO going out to week 32. Also, results from a sub-study evaluating multifocal VEP, a more sensitive measure of optic nerve conduction, were found to be consistent with a full-field VEP findings. Our anti-LINGO Phase II study in MS remains ongoing, and we expect to obtain final results in mid-2016. I'll now turn the call over to Tony. Tony Kingsley - Executive Vice President-Global Commercial Operations : Thanks, Doug. Let me start with the MS franchise. We continue to believe that our portfolio of products is a source of strength in the marketplace with the leading oral agent, the leading high-efficacy agent and two well-positioned interferon options. In the U.S., we believe we continue to capture roughly half of all newly-diagnosed and switch patients within our franchise in Q1. As we've said in prior calls, with the launch of TECFIDERA in 2013 in the U.S. and 2014 in Europe, we saw a period where both market growth and switching dynamics were well above historical averages, and TECFIDERA really drove this. And we expected a natural moderation in these rates through 2014 and into 2015. We believe this is occurring as expected, but also believe that the Tech safety (10:45) event in October further dampened market growth and switch rates in Q1. So in this broader market context, TECFIDERA continued to add patients this quarter but at an overall slower rate. In the U.S., our internal market research suggests that physician intent to prescribe may be improving. We believe these data indicate that we are assisting physicians in putting the updated label into context. In Europe, we saw robust uptake in patient capture in the quarter in the U.K. as well as in newly launched markets such as Italy and Spain. In Germany, the product saw similar headwinds as in the U.S., but for Europe as a whole we saw a nice growth in patients in the quarter. Finally, in markets where we have launched PLEGRIDY, we believe the uptake of that product has also dampened TECFIDERA patient growth by taking some interferon switches that could have gone to TECFIDERA. But obviously for Biogen overall, this is a positive and, again, speaks to the strength of our franchise position in the market. We continue to believe that TECFIDERA remains the preferred oral option in the market given its strong efficacy, convenience and safety profile. We are leveraging the full capabilities of our commercial organization to communicate these benefits, maintaining significant sales force focus, executing both physician and patient programming with updated messaging, and increasing our share of voice across both print and digital media. Next, AVONEX and PLEGRIDY combined continued to gain share among interferons this quarter. PLEGRIDY has continued to source patients broadly, which we believe is a positive indicator of the product's appeal. Based on our market research, we believe PLEGRIDY is emerging as the interferon of choice. And we continue to believe that as the interferon market declines, Biogen's ability to grow share within it is attractive. Finally in the MS franchise, we're pleased that TYSABRI showed a full year of positive patient growth in a market with an increasing number of alternatives. From Q1 2014 to Q1 2015, global TYSABRI patients increased 5%. We think this performance is a testament to physician and patient belief in the high level of efficacy that TYSABRI provides to patients. So in summary, our MS franchise revenue increased 19% year-over-year to approximately $2.1 billion. Turning to our emerging hemophilia business, we continue to be pleased with the launch of our long-acting factors. In the U.S., as the first long-acting factors in the market, both ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE continued to gain new patients this quarter, and we've continued to see expansion of usage among hemophilia treatment centers. We now have over 70% HTC penetration for each product, and our data showed that switching rates in both hemophilia A and hemophilia B are running well above historical averages. We believe we are succeeding in our strategy to capture early adopters and then expand our footprint as both patients and physicians have positive experiences with the products. Outside of the U.S., we also recently launched both ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE in Japan and have seen strong initial interest. We believe that Japan represents an attractive long-term growth opportunity for our hemophilia business. I'll now pass the call to Paul. Paul J. Clancy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.49 in the first quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the first quarter were $3.82. Total revenue for Q1 grew 20% year-over-year to approximately $2.6 billion, though decreased 3% versus the prior quarter. The strengthening dollar weakened revenues by approximately $89 million, which was partially offset by hedging for a net unfavorable impact of $49 million. Global first quarter TECFIDERA revenues were $825 million, an increase of 63% year-over-year, however, a decrease of 10% versus the fourth quarter of last year. This quarter's TECFIDERA revenues consist of $648 million in the U.S. and $177 million outside the U.S. There are a few items that impacted TECFIDERA revenue in Q1. Let me provide the details. U.S. TECFIDERA sales included 13 shipping weeks in Q1 compared to 14 shipping weeks last quarter. We estimate the additional week of TECFIDERA sales in Q4 represented approximately $50 million. U.S. gross-to-net adjustments were higher this quarter than prior quarters. Specifically, increased discounts and allowances in part due to donut hole were approximately 400 basis points higher than our estimated run rate for the remainder of 2015. This impacted Q1 U.S. revenues by approximately $35 million. In the U.S., we estimate we ended the quarter with approximately 2.5 weeks of inventory in the wholesale channel, a similar level to last quarter. However, we believe there was a slight drawdown of inventory in the specialty pharmacy channel. Outside the U.S., foreign exchange impact offset by hedging weakened TECFIDERA revenues by approximately $8 million for Q1 versus the prior quarter. And in Germany, we began recording TECFIDERA sales at a lower price as the free-pricing period ended in mid-February. We expect the official price will be made public in May. So shipping weeks, gross-to-net, foreign exchange and German pricing negatively impacted TECFIDERA this quarter. Nevertheless, as we've noted, we saw moderating patient growth especially in the U.S. and Germany, and we're working diligently to improve TECFIDERA's trajectory. Interferon revenues including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY were $755 million during the first quarter, including $518 million in the U.S. and $236 million in sales outside the U.S. AVONEX U.S. sales included 13 shipping weeks in Q1 compared to 14 shipping weeks in the prior quarter. Foreign exchange impact offset by hedging weakened Q1 interferon revenue by approximately $12 million versus prior quarter and by approximately $25 million year-over-year. TYSABRI worldwide revenue was $463 million in Q1. These results were comprised of $273 million in the U.S. and $190 million internationally. Foreign exchange impact offset by hedging weakened TYSABRI revenue by approximately $12 million for Q1 versus Q4 and approximately $20 million year-over-year. Moving to hemophilia. ALPROLIX revenues in Q1 was $43 million and ELOCTATE revenue was $54 million. For our anti-CD20 unconsolidated joint business which includes RITUXAN and GAZYVA, our U.S. profit share as well as the profit share and royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. were $331 million, an increase from prior quarter, in part due to an inventory build. Royalties were $20 million for Q1 compared to $38 million in the same quarter last year. Our royalty revenues from ANGIOMAX ended on December 15, 2014. Now, turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q1 cost of goods sold were $312 million or 12% of revenue. Q1 R&D expense was $461 million or 18% of revenues, which includes no meaningful business development activity during this quarter though we continue to anticipate additional BD activity through the remainder of the year. Q1 SG&A expense was $560 million or 22% of revenue. Our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 25% for Q1, and our rate benefited by approximately 1.5% related to a discrete item. During the quarter, we made $250 million of CVR payments to the former shareholders of Fumapharm. And our weighted diluted shares at the end of the quarter were 236 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 50/50 between the U.S. and ex-U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $3.82 for the first quarter. As a reminder, last quarter we announced our plan to provide annual guidance and one update per year during our second quarter earnings. This change is intended to synchronize with our internal planning processes and ensure a continued focus on the long term. As a result, we won't be updating our formal guidance this quarter though I'd like to briefly characterize how we're thinking about the remainder of the year. There are two key items that we're keeping a watchful eye on for the rest of the year. First, while foreign exchange has been a headwind, any additional strengthening of the dollar could exacerbate this impact on revenue. And second, we continue to expect TECFIDERA will represent the largest contributor to our overall revenue growth. If the U.S. trajectory does not improve, we may come in at the lower end of our previously provided revenue growth. Now I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments. George A. Scangos, Ph.D. - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thank you, Paul. In closing, the year is shaping up to be an eventful one for us. Obviously, a top priority for us is the growth of our entire MS portfolio, including TECFIDERA. We believe that TECFIDERA is a compelling treatment option for MS patients, and our long-term outlook for TECFIDERA and for our entire MS portfolio remains strong. We believe that our portfolio provides leading choices for patients among interferon, oral and high efficacy therapies, and we're working hard to overcome the headwinds that we saw last quarter. And of course, we'll continue to focus on increasing the numbers of hemophilia patients who are taking advantage of the benefits of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX. This year is also an important one in terms of advancing the pipeline. We'll move aducanumab into Phase III as quickly as possible, and we'll focus on execution of our ongoing trials for the other compounds in our pipeline. We anticipate data on several pipeline compounds this year, including a Phase III trial of TYSABRI for the treatment of SPMS, the Phase II trial for TYSABRI in acute ischemic stroke, and Phase II data for Neublastin in neuropathic pain. And of course, we're looking forward to the data from the Phase II trial of our anti-LINGO antibody in MS next year. We believe that each of these therapies has the potential to be a significant therapeutic advance. And so with that, we'll close our remarks. And, operator, you can now open up the call for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges of Bernstein. Your line is open. Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you very much for the question, and perhaps we start off with TECFIDERA. You highlighted the case of PML last year in your comments, but of course there was the other case written up though it was with a different form of MS, not TECFIDERA, this year. And first of all, do you think that that will have any impact on the outlook in the future for TECFIDERA? And secondly, I'd just be curious as to what advice you're now giving physicians with respect to patients who are JCV positive. Do you think the case this year alters the sentiment you had after last year's case, where, of course, the patient was heavily pretreated and lymphopenic. Thanks. Tony Kingsley - Executive Vice President-Global Commercial Operations : Yeah, thanks, Geoff. It's Tony. We just spent much of this week in talking to physicians and understanding what their perspective is. Just to highlight, between the Tech event and the BML (23:21) report late last year, what they're seeing is more hesitancy among patients. We talked about market growth as one of the issues in switch rates. Not clear that the physicians, at least that I talked to which was the anecdotal, had a dramatically different perspective themselves, but they see some hesitance in the conversations that they're having with patients. I think it's a little early to tell what the kind of impression result or perception result from the recent New England Journal articles will be. But, Doug, maybe you want to comment on... Douglas E. Williams, Ph.D. - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Sure. Geoff, I think the simple answer to your question is that it's our assessment that there's no real change in the benefit/risk profile in the drug for patients with MS. So, it's pretty much status quo at the moment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I just maybe turn the conversation to Alzheimer's, and I'm sure a lot of the other analysts will. But, hey, Doug, I just love \u2013 I know you addressed some of this or others did at AAN, but maybe just talk a little bit about some of the concerns. I mean obviously most of us think the data are good, but on the concern side is, number one, that the placebo group may have deteriorated more quickly than one would expect in this population; and number two, the risk that some of \u2013 at least the caregivers were unblinded to the status given the instance of ARIA. And then also, along the lines of, on Alzheimer's, is ARIA a clinical problem? Douglas E. Williams, Ph.D. - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Okay, that's three questions. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : No, no, no. It's one question. Douglas E. Williams, Ph.D. - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: I'm keeping track here. So, let's take the first one, the placebo group and did they behave as expected. It's our view that based on the natural history studies that, yes, they did. And remember that this was a slightly different population in that they were all PET amyloid confirmed. So we had a population that was perhaps slightly different than what the sort of full spectrum in the natural history studies would look like, and I think maybe that's where some of the perception issue comes from. But this was an enriched population of patients based on the fact that they were all amyloid-imaged prior to entering the study. So, that's the first question. The unblinding issue, I'm glad you asked that question because I've heard that several times now. And we feel very confident that that was not an issue in the study for a variety of reasons. Probably the most important is that we anticipated this in the sense that we were aware of other studies with other antibodies where ARIA had been observed. And so as we design the study, we wanted to be sure that we put the appropriate safeguards in place so that this would not be an issue. So we segregated the raters who were looking at the CDR endpoint and the MMSE endpoint, and neither of those raters were the treating physicians. So, they were completely separate from the assessors of clinical results including ARIA. So, we anticipated this. We put the safeguards in place upfront. And I think that that was an important study design aspect. The other piece of information I think is relevant here \u2013 if you don't buy that argument, then the other piece is that, frankly, the temporal issues I think also support the fact that it's unlikely that there was any unblinding. Because 92% of the events, the ARIA events that occurred, occurred within the first five doses of administration. We didn't actually see a change in cognition until 12 months, or 54 weeks to be precise. So, there was a significant gap between any of the observed ARIA in these patients and the treatment benefit that we recorded with CDR sum of boxes and the MMSE endpoint. So, that gap in time I think should also give you some comfort. And then with respect to clinical, is ARIA a clinical observation? It's a really good question, Mark. I think it may actually be an indication of biology in the case of our antibody. I think it's difficult to say. What I think is important though is that about two-thirds of the cases of ARIA that we saw had no symptoms associated with them. In those patients, the roughly 35% that did show some symptoms, they were primarily mild to moderate, self-resolving within 4 weeks to 12 weeks. So, I think there's still a lot for us to learn about ARIA and what it means and how we manage patients through that. But it is a question that I think will continue to be explored and the answers will play out over the course of the next several years. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Eric T. Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks for the question. Doug, just sticking with Alzheimer's, there's also been some concern out there around the six milligram dose cohort that didn't perform as well, at least at 26 weeks. Do you share that concern? And if we don't see improvement at AAIC in the one-year data for the six milligram dose cohort, what could explain lower performance for that arm? Douglas E. Williams, Ph.D. - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Our assessment is that the six milligram dose is actually, given the small cohort size, within the range that we would have expected to see. From an amyloid-reduction perspective, it sort of sits in between the 3 milligram and 10 milligram dose at the 26-week timeframe. So, I think we feel pretty comfortable that that dose cohort is behaving roughly in line with what we would have expected based on the other cohorts in the study at that time point. So, no, we don't have concerns that that particular cohort represents an outlier in any way. Eric T. Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC: Cognition as well? Douglas E. Williams, Ph.D. - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Well, cognition, I think, again, the real end point or the real question mark will be at the 54-week time point. So, I'm not sure we really saw anything convincing at 26 weeks. The data was within the noise, I think, at 26 weeks. It's at 54 weeks that I think the important data point will emerge. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Robert Baird & Company. Your line is open Chris J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, thanks. Just curious on anti-LINGO. You had some data obviously this week, and just curious, your reaction, at the highest 100 mg/kg dose, obviously you're getting into some sizable drug product on a per dose basis when you think about a 70 kilogram patient. I'm just wondering how you think about dosing with that kind of dose level and then potential cost of goods. Douglas E. Williams, Ph.D. - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Yeah, let me just sort of frame, the purpose of the study was really a proof of biology study. I think we're not, at the moment, planning to go into acute optic neuritis as an indication per se. But we thought it was an elegant way to assess whether or not we could demonstrate remyelination in man. The 100 mg/kg dose was simply chosen because we were only planning to do a single dose cohort and we chose the top dose that we had looked at in the single ascending dose safety study. So, we wanted to make sure we had adequate drug onboard to see a treatment effect if there was going to be one. And I think we're encouraged now by the fact that we've seen through two different measures of VEP and also looking at the percentage of patients that actually returned to a latency level that looks like normal, which is roughly 2x in the treated group versus the placebo group, that in fact we're convinced that there's remyelination that translates to a benefit in terms of improved latency. So, 100 mg/kg was chosen just as a dose that we could give to make sure we had adequate drug onboard. But we don't believe that that will be the dose. And in fact, the Phase II study that's underway, SYNERGY, is exploring a whole range of doses to allow us to pick the minimum effective dose to take forward hopefully into Phase III studies. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS. Your line is open. Matt M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much for taking the question. At AAN, there seemed to be some talk at the BIIB037 poster an about both IV and subcutaneous administrations of BIIB037. Can you give us a sense for whether or not we can see a subcutaneous emerge either in the Phase III later this year or maybe further dosing work in a sort of Phase I level as you go forward? Obviously, it'd be attractive to have a subcutaneous formulation if you had it. Just wondering if you'd give us some update there. Thanks. Douglas E. Williams, Ph.D. - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Yeah, I think that you should anticipate that the Phase III study will be given by the same route of administration as the Phase Ib. But you are correct. We're already beginning to think about the benefits to patients of developing a subcutaneous formulation, so I think that that's something that will be in the offing but not likely incorporated into the Phase III program. But it is a patient convenience issue that we're thinking about already. Matt M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC : If you'd be able to take that forward, would you have to run a bridging study or you wouldn't have to run in a separate Phase III, just a bridging should be fine, if you could advance that? Douglas E. Williams, Ph.D. - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: I think it's likely to be a bridging study. That would be our assumption at this point. But obviously, that would require confirmation with the regulators. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is open. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Doug, another one for you. In Alzheimer's, it looks like you have a very good idea of the Phase III design. So, is this final meeting with the FDA for sign-off or are there any additional design issues in play? And then, can you give us any perspective on what treatment effect you're looking for or maybe what we should use as a historical benchmark for CDR at 18 months? Thanks. Douglas E. Williams, Ph.D. - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Well, yeah, I think the design is not final until it's final. I'm not trying to be cute. But obviously, we're still in active discussion with the regulators. I think we feel like we've really nailed down a lot of the key issues, most of which I have delineated for you in the script a bit earlier. There are, obviously, a few remaining issues that we need to tie down and make sure that we're coordinated with regulatory agencies around the world. So, we want to conduct a program that would support registration in a very broad sense geographically. And then in terms of the treatment effect, again, this is the first time that anyone with an amyloid antibody has seen a treatment effect of this magnitude. I think our goal is to attempt to replicate the Phase Ib data at least at a high level. The specifics around the treatment effect that will be acceptable for registration, I'm not prepared to discuss that at this point. I think once we've finalized all of our negotiations with regulators, we'll have more to say about the study design and get into a bit more details once we begin enrollment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just one with respect to the gross-to-net in the quarter on TECFIDERA. Just wondering if you can give us any more color about the delta there versus your expectations. And then, should we expect that that's going to continue over the balance of the year? It was a little unclear from your comments. Thank you. Paul J. Clancy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, thanks, Terence. This is Paul. Yeah, we saw the gross-to-net drift upward versus the last four quarters. We had anticipated for a full year coming into 2015 that we'd have a little bit of upward pressure on gross-to-net just as we continued to penetrate managed care contracts. Q1 drifted up for two reasons. The normal Q1 donut hole, et al., and we also just had a adjustment made in the managed care accounts. That resulted in close to a 20% gross-to-net. We expected to drift down about 400 basis points for the subsequent three quarters. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions as well. Maybe for Doug, I have a couple for the Alzheimer program. First of all, can you clarify whether you will wait for the titration results before you start the Phase III trial officially for BIIB037? And secondly, do you guys have any data in-house for the correlation between plaque reduction and also the neurocognitive endpoint such as CDR and MMSE from the Phase IIb? Thank you. Douglas E. Williams, Ph.D. - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: So with respect to titration, our expectation is that we will begin the study prior to reporting out the titration data. I think we have a pretty good handle on the dosing parameters for the study and how we plan to handle that. So, it's our expectation that we won't wait for that data. And then with respect to the correlation between plaque and CDR, I think it's difficult to, in a study of this size, really draw those sorts of direct correlations. Obviously, we'll be looking at those sorts of things to see whether or not plaque reduction per se can be used as a \"biomarker\" on sort of an interim basis. But I think the study is relatively small to be able to draw those sorts of strong correlations. What I will say is that irrespective of the cohorts that we looked at, and this is from the most recent AAN poster that was presented, whether you're looking at ApoE4 carriers or non-carriers, whether you're looking at mild or moderate patients, the reduction in amyloid appears to be pretty consistent across the spectrum. So, there doesn't appear to be any difference in ApoE4 status influencing amyloid removal nor the stage of disease, roughly breaking it down between mild and prodromal patients. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe one for Paul and George. Just you've got a substantial cash balance. You've seen some other companies go out and buy some close-to-market neurology assets. We've seen you guys do some early-stage deals but not sort of close-to-market deals. Any thinking or what might change your thinking to pick up an asset which could be closer to market than maybe spending a little bit more money than you typically have? Thanks. George A. Scangos, Ph.D. - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, look, we have no formal strategy that says we're only going to in-license early-stage items. I think when we look at acquisitions from the outside, we look at the data, we look at the market potential, we look at the competitive status and we look at value. And if all those things make sense, then we could go ahead and make an acquisition or in-license a compound. So, I think we try and take a look at these from a scientific and medical perspective to make sure that they're valid from a market perspective, to make sure there's a patient need from a competitive perspective. And then, they have to make sense in term of what we have to pay for what we get. And so, I think those are the filters and, we'll \u2013 those are the ones we've used, those are the ones we'll continue to use. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to go back to Alzheimer's for a minute. I'm curious if you can provide any updates on the progress with your tau inhibitor, when that might enter the clinic. More specifically, last month at AD/PD there's a lot of talk from KOLs about combo strategies in Alzheimer's. So, wondering if you have any pre-clinical data on tau plus a-beta antibodies and just a combination you may evaluate relatively rapidly, or would you wait to see how aducanumab monotherapy plays out first? Thanks. Douglas E. Williams, Ph.D. - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: This is Doug. We have a couple of different approaches on tau. Both of them are in pre-clinical at the moment. And I would expect that the sort of front-runner amongst those candidates is one of the antibodies that we have under development. Likely to move into the clinic next year would be my best guess at the moment. We're starting to do some of those experiments with combinations, not just with tau antibodies and anti-amyloid antibodies but also beginning to look at the combination of BACE inhibitors with the anti-amyloid antibodies. So I think long term, our view is that this will become a combination market and we're exploring a number of, what I'd characterize as the sort of obvious combinations to look at right upfront. And I think we're fortunate that we've got a collection of these assets that we can begin to mix and match in the preclinical stages to help guide us towards the choices of what makes the most sense to look at once we actually start generating clinical data. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I just want to ask a question about TYSABRI in stroke. I kind of understand the mechanism, maybe you can talk a little bit more about it. But specifically, how quickly will TYSABRI work, do you think, in a patient? So what gives you the confidence that when they get this injection after stroke, that you could see a benefit? And maybe, update on possible timing of the data. Thank you. Douglas E. Williams, Ph.D. - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Sure, Robyn. This is Doug. Well, the timing of the data would be the second half of the year. And I think from the standpoint of mechanism, there's actually quite a bit of preclinical data and stroke models either with antibody treatment or knockouts that demonstrate that the size of the infarct is dramatically reduced when you antagonize this pathway. So, what we're going to be looking at in this particular study is two different measures. The first is a reduction in the infarct size, which we would predict to occur based on the biology. The immediate influx after an infarct tends to be neutrophils, followed quickly thereafter within the first 24 hours with a pretty robust lymphocyte infiltrate. And it starts at that lymphocyte infiltrate, contributes to cytokine production that causes further damage and loss of function. So by antagonizing that sort of second influx of lymphocytes, we hope to reduce the infarct size. And we'll be looking at that by imaging five days out. The perhaps more important endpoint that we're also looking at, and obviously it's a relatively small study so we haven't sized it to see it per se, but there are several measures of stroke. There's a rating scale that is used routinely in these types of studies that we'll be looking at day 29 to really assess whether there's any functional benefit in terms of protecting these patients from loss of function as a result of stroke. So, it's really a two-prong study. The first is the imaging endpoint, and that will come fairly quickly and that's where most of the good biology data is. Secondarily though, we'll be actually looking at the performance of these patients either with placebo or TYSABRI to ask the question of whether we've actually shown some benefit from a clinical perspective. And that's what will drive the decision as to whether we move in to Phase III. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, good morning. Thanks. Just wanted to clarify on the BIIB037 Phase III that you talked about, is it specifically one study in carriers and one in non-carriers and each of those using different doses? And then, you mentioned it was 18 months. Is that just because you want to give confidence or get confidence that there's enough time to separate between the curves? Is that what you're thinking? Thanks. Douglas E. Williams, Ph.D. - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Yeah, the two studies will essentially be identical, mirror images of each other, and they will incorporate both carriers and non-carriers into those studies. And you're right, the 18 months is really simply a way of assuring that we have adequate time to capture the treatment effect with the various doses that we'll be testing, both the lower and the higher doses that will be incorporated into the study. So it's been designed really based on the observations from the Phase Ib study in terms of the cadence of the treatment effect, and we think that the 18 months is the appropriate timeframe in which to assess in both carriers and non-carriers of the doses we're planning to go forward with. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi. Your line is open. Unknown Speaker : Hi. This is Kumar Hassain (48:21) for Yaron. Thank you for taking my question. For Alzheimer's, will a single primary of CDR-STB sufficient (48:27) and what are the differences in EU and U.S. regulatory requirements? And also, if you can make any comments on IPR and the Patent interference. Douglas E. Williams, Ph.D. - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: I missed the second question. But the first question on CDR, I think for a population of patients that are largely prodromal but also including some sort of early mild patients, which is what we'll be focusing our attention on in these studies. The CDR endpoint is an accepted endpoint for regulators. It is, remember, a composite score that looks at both cognition and function. And in prodromal patients in particular, you don't actually have functional changes. So it's thought that this is the most appropriate tool for the early spectrum patients in Alzheimer's disease, and that's why regulators have started to accept this as a single primary endpoint in registrational studies, not just in the U.S. but in the EU as well. George A. Scangos, Ph.D. - Chief Executive Officer & Director: This is George. On the IPR question, we're certainly aware of the IPR that was filed. We have several patents that are protecting TECFIDERA. But we're confident in our IP portfolio, and so we don't think it's going to have an impact on our ability to continue to sell the drug. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Joseph Schwartz with Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks very much. Maybe one on LINGO. Can you explain to us your thoughts on why you're able to see functional benefits in the absence of seeing anatomic evidence of remyelination? What are your latest thoughts on how useful or not a model of AON is for MS, and how are you thinking about that now versus before you ran the latest experiment? Douglas E. Williams, Ph.D. - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Well, the LINGO study that we've reported out on in optic neuritis, I think the anatomical data, just based on where these lesions occur, it's difficult to actually get the sort of imaging confirmation that you can get in MS studies where the lesions are much more visible just because of current MRI technology. So, I think we relied on functional measures of remyelination as opposed to imaging measures just because that was more appropriate in the optic neuritis setting. Our results, I think, give us more confidence going in to the readout from the MS studies. This is, in fact, the first time anyone has reported a treatment effect and the ability to observe remyelination in man. Prior to this study, all we had was some very elegant animal experiments but we'd never really created the linkage of those data to what we can accomplish in man. So, I think the exciting part of the data from the optic neuritis study is that we now have evidence in man looking at a couple of different ways of measuring latency on the optic nerve and also the recovery parameters that I mentioned earlier with double the number of patients getting back to a normal level of latency versus the placebo group. I think the consistency of that data across the various ways we've looked at it gives us added confidence going into the MS study that at least we're influencing the biology we hope to influence. So, we'll just have to wait and see what that data shows us. And as I mentioned in the call, the final data will be available in 2016 in the MS study and tell us a lot more than what we know now about how or if to go forward in MS. Operator : There are no further questions. I turn the call back over to Dr. Scangos. George A. Scangos, Ph.D. - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thank you all for your questions. Thanks for your attention this morning. And we'll conclude the call. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Operator : Good morning. My name is Chris, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Carlo Tanzi, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Carlo Tanzi - Director- Investor Relations : Thank you and welcome to Biogen's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided on Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. George Scangos; Dr. Doug Williams, EVP of Research and Development; Tony Kingsley, EVP of Global Commercial Operations; and our CFO, Paul Clancy. We'll also be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Al Sandrock. Now, I'll turn the call over to George. George A. Scangos, Ph.D. - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Carlo. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. There are two sets of data on which most of you have been focused, so let me lead with those issues. First is the commercial trajectory. So versus prior year, we achieved 7% revenue growth and 21% non-GAAP EPS growth, good numbers but certainly lower than we had anticipated a few months ago. We had expected to see a reacceleration of TECFIDERA this quarter, but that did not happen to any appreciable extent. Rather, TECFIDERA experienced modest sequential patient growth as we continued to work through the same commercial challenges experienced in the first quarter of the year. We continue to believe that TECFIDERA remains the preferred oral option in the MS market based on its strong efficacy and favorable safety profile. And we're working hard across the organization to improve TECFIDERA's trajectory. With that said, our multiple sclerosis portfolio continues to add patients globally. TECFIDERA is the most prescribed oral MS therapy globally, and has now been used to treat over 155,000 patients. We believe that PLEGRIDY is on its way to becoming the interferon of choice, as we continue to make it available in new markets around the world. And TYSABRI, which we believe is viewed as the preferred high-efficacy therapy, continued to add patients this quarter. Second, development with the recent announcement of the new data from aducanumab Phase 1b study at AAIC [Alzheimer's Association International Conference]; by now, you've all seen the data, which we take to be positive, in line with, and supportive of the data we reported earlier. Doug will provide some additional details on this analysis later on the call. We've initiated sites for two pivotal Phase 3 trials for aducanumab in early Alzheimer's disease and are screening patients for enrollment. Millions of people worldwide are living with Alzheimer's disease and no disease modifying treatment options. We believe that this important investment has the potential to be a significant future growth driver for Biogen. Moving on to other areas, through our joint venture with Samsung Bioepis, we announced positive results across our anti-TNF biosimilar portfolio at the EULAR [European League Against Rheumatism] conference in June. With these results, we believe that we're well positioned to bring these widely used anti-TNF therapies to physicians, payers, and ultimately the patients who need them most next year. Just this month, we announced our intent to build a new next-generation manufacturing facility in Solothurn, Switzerland to support our emerging pipeline, a significant step towards ensuring a long-term global supply of new world-class therapies for patients. We expect to break ground on the facility early next year and start manufacturing activities in 2019. So we had a busy second quarter with an important second half of the year ahead of us, in which we'll focus on improving the trajectory of TECFIDERA and ensuring that we execute important clinical trials to move our pipeline forward as quickly as possible. Now I'd like turn the call over to Doug, who will update you all on our progress in R&D. Douglas E. Williams - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Thanks, George. Earlier this week at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference, we presented additional interim results from the aducanumab Phase 1b study in subjects with prodromal and mild Alzheimer's disease. To remind you, we previously presented results for the 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg patient cohorts at six months and one year, and for the 6 mg/kg cohort at six months. The new results now include one-year data for 30 subjects treated with 6 mg/kg of aducanumab and for an additional ten subjects randomized to placebo. The 6 mg/kg one-year results demonstrated a statically significant reduction on brain beta amyloid levels versus placebo, as assessed by PET imaging. The results at six months and one year show very strong dose and time-dependent reduction of brain beta amyloid and extend our previously reported observations. We observed a numeric improvement on the MMSE and CDR sum-of-box clinical measures compared to placebo, though the results did not achieve statistical significance. The 6 mg/kg dose at one year was intermediate in effect to that seen with the 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg doses on the CDR score, which will be the primary endpoint for the Phase 3 program. The safety results were consistent with previously reported results. Overall analysis of the 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg clinical results at one year demonstrated a statistically significant dose-dependent impact on MMSE and CDR sum of boxes compared to placebo. Additional analyses demonstrated strong positive correlations between reduction in beta amyloid levels in both CDR and MMSE scores. We believe that the totality of the aducanumab Phase 1b study results strongly support development and registrational studies. Based on feedback from regulatory agencies, we've recently finalized the aducanumab Phase 3 study design. The Phase 3 program includes two identically designed placebo-controlled studies, referred to as ENGAGE and EMERGE. Each study is expected to include 1,350 subjects with early Alzheimer's disease. Study subjects will be screened by PET amyloid imaging to confirm elevated beta amyloid plaque levels in the brain. The primary endpoint will be CDR sum of boxes, a clinical measure including both cognitive and functional components measured at 18 months. In each Phase 3 study, APOE4 non-carriers will be randomized to receive 6 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, or placebo, while APOE4 carriers will receive 3 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg, or placebo. Study dosing will include an up-titration period in an effort to reduce ARIA and maximize aducanumab's benefit/risk profile. The Phase 3 program will be conducted globally and is planned to include more than 300 sites. Good progress has been made in operationalizing the studies, and initial investigational clinical sites for ENGAGE and EMERGE are now active and screening patients. Moving on to our other programs, I'm pleased to mention that the European Medicines Agency has accepted the marketing application of ALPROLIX for the treatment of hemophilia B, signifying the initiation of the review process. Last week our partner, Sobi, exercised its opt-in right for ALPROLIX to assume final development and commercialization in certain territories, including Europe. Our collaborator, Isis Pharmaceuticals, recently presented additional results from the ongoing Phase 2 studies evaluating SMNRx in infants and children with spinal muscular atrophy. We believe the available data are increasingly supportive of SMNRx having a therapeutic effect. Two Phase 3 studies for SMNRx are active, with enrollment currently ongoing. We recently obtained Phase 2 study results for NEUBLASTIN in moderate to severe sciatica. The clinical results observed did not achieve our target product profile. And while we've made the decision to terminate this program developing new therapies (9:32) for pain remains an area of focus for Biogen. We've made good progress advancing development plans of our Nav 1.7 inhibitor acquired from Convergence, and we expect to begin enrolling patients into a Phase 3 study in trigeminal neuralgia next year. We've also obtained Phase 2 study results for TYSABRI in acute ischemic stroke. Study results did not demonstrate an impact on the change in infarct volume, the primary endpoint of the study. However, secondary and exploratory endpoints, including the Modified Rankin Scale evaluating stroke recovery, suggest that TYSABRI may have had a beneficial impact on the functional deficits experienced by stroke patients. We believe that the benefit observed, if confirmed, would be clinically meaningful. We're evaluating additional study designs to pursue development of TYSABRI in stroke. Earlier this month, we announced a collaboration with AGTC to develop gene therapies in ophthalmology. The collaboration is focused on adeno-associated virus-based gene therapy, with the goal of developing one-time transformative treatments for XLRS and XLRP. Expansion of our pipeline into these orphan ophthalmic indication represents a natural extension of Biogen's focus in neurology. Furthermore, through this collaboration, we've further bolstered Biogen's capability to utilize gene therapy as a therapeutic approach. Before I turn the call over to Tony, I want to say that, as many of you know, this will be my last earnings call for Biogen. I'll be leaving the company at the end of next week to take on the role of CEO of a new startup company. During the last four and a half years at Biogen, I've had the opportunity to work with many extraordinary people, and the company has been transformed in many ways. We've strengthened the pipeline and put a strong emphasis on discovery science excellence, which will pay off over the coming years. The R&D team is in very capable hands with Al and Spyros, and the company is performing extraordinary science in the labs and in the clinic under their guidance. I'd like to thank George and my colleagues at Biogen for giving me such a great opportunity, and I look forward to many more successes for the company. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony. Stuart Anthony Kingsley - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : Thanks, Doug. Our basic strategy in MS remains the same, to position TECFIDERA as the standard of care in the marketplace, to establish PLEGRIDY at the interferon of choice, and to leverage TYSABRI as the leading high-efficacy agent. In light of continued headwinds affecting TECFIDERA, we saw moderated patient growth for our MS portfolio as a whole this quarter. Our 2015 business plan for TECFIDERA made two important assumptions : first, that TECFIDERA would continue to stimulate higher than historical market growth in switch rates as it drives the market from injectables to orals; and second, that TECFIDERA, with what we believe is a strong all-in profile, would continue to capture a high rate of both new starts and switches. Through the second quarter, both of these were weaker than planned, particularly in the more mature and larger markets of the U.S. and Germany. In the U.S., total market growth and switch rates remained lower than our original expectations and appear to have returned to historical averages typically seen in the market before the launch of TECFIDERA. We believe the safety event reported in late 2014 is creating greater caution on the part of both physicians and patients about switching to orals. Our U.S. market research indicates a moderation in physician intent to prescribe, though in Q2 TECFIDERA continued to gain patients in the U.S. We believe our promotional and educational efforts are strong and well resourced. In the U.S., we remain focused on emphasizing TECFIDERA's strong efficacy profile while ensuring physicians and patients are educated on proper monitoring requirements for lymphopenia, and we believe we are making progress. We have recently increased our share of voice across print and digital media to increase patient awareness and have also ramped up TECFIDERA sales calls by our field teams. In more mature markets in Europe such as Germany, TECFIDERA has faced similar dynamics as in the U.S. On a patient basis, this has been offset by robust uptake in newly launched markets such as the UK, Italy, and Spain, where the launch curves to date have mimicked prior experience of very rapid uptake. For example, in the UK where full reimbursement funding really came into place around the turn of the year, we believe the uptake curve through June has actually exceeded what we saw in the U.S. and Germany. While patient growth for Europe as a whole was robust, total European TECFIDERA revenue was dampened both by the change of price and softer demand in Germany. In Europe, our promotional strategy is similar to what I described in the U.S., maintaining high reach in frequency and emphasizing the strong value proposition of the product. However, in Europe we have been more limited in our ability to educate physicians about any new monitoring requirements as we are still waiting for an updated European label. We continue to believe in TECFIDERA's competitive profile and believe the product can drive future patient growth, although at a more moderated rate. Establishing TECFIDERA as the standard of care in MS remains a primary focus, and we will be tireless in those efforts. We believe that AVONEX and PLEGRIDY will continue to play an important role and that we are gaining share among interferons. PLEGRIDY has seen steady early uptake and has continued to source patients broadly. TYSABRI continues to set itself apart in the market with an increasing number of alternatives. TYSABRI demonstrated positive patient growth again this quarter, and we believe this strong performance is a testament to the high level of efficacy that TYSABRI provides to patients. Finally, in MS, we are gearing up for the potential launch of ZINBRYTA with our collaboration partner, AbbVie. If approved, we believe ZINBRYTA could be an important new therapeutic option for relapsing MS patients. Turning to our hemophilia business, ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE continue to grow market share this quarter in the U.S. We continue to broaden both breadth and depth of prescribing amongst physicians and educate the community about the importance of maintaining protection from bleeding with less frequent infusions. Recent market research suggests that the product awareness continues to increase and that the convenience of our products' dosing schedules is well appreciated by patients. Outside of the U.S., we have also seen strong initial uptake of ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE in Japan, which we believe is an attractive long-term growth opportunity. I'll now pass the call to Paul. Paul J. Clancy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.93 in the second quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.22. Total revenue for Q2 grew 7% year over year to approximately $2.6 billion. Foreign exchange offset by hedging weakened total revenue by approximately $79 million year over year. Global second quarter TECFIDERA revenue was $883 million, an increase of 26% versus second quarter of last year and an increase of 7% versus the prior quarter. This quarter's TECFIDERA revenues consisted of $721 million in the United States and $163 million outside the U.S. U.S. gross-to-net adjustments were lower this quarter than Q1 by approximately 400 basis points. We estimate we ended the quarter with approximately 2.5 weeks of inventory in the U.S. wholesale channel for TECFIDERA, a similar level to last quarter. In Germany, TECFIDERA sales are being recorded at \u20ac12,800 as the free pricing period ended in mid-February. Largely driven by this, ex-U.S. TECFIDERA sales decreased 8% versus prior quarter, despite unit growth of 14%. Foreign exchange impact offset by hedging weakened TECFIDERA revenue by approximately $10 million year over year. Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $690 million during the second quarter, including $455 million in the U.S. and $235 million in sales outside the U.S. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, U.S. interferon revenues decreased 12%. We estimate that approximately $50 million of the decrease is due to an inventory drawdown in the U.S. wholesale channel. We believe this was the result of rebalancing of inventories subsequent to the launch of PLEGRIDY. Foreign exchange impact offset by hedging weakened Q2 interferon revenue by approximately $27 million year over year. TYSABRI worldwide revenue was $463 million in Q2. These results were comprised of $269 million in the U.S. and $195 million internationally. As a reminder, TYSABRI sales outside the U.S. in the second quarter of 2014 included $54 million of previously deferred revenue related to our AIFA [Italian National Medicines Agency] agreement. Foreign exchange impact offset by hedging weakened TYSABRI revenue by approximately $35 million year over year. Moving to hemophilia, ALPROLIX revenue in Q2 was $54 million, and ELOCTATE revenue was $74 million. Our U.S. profit share for RITUXAN and GAZYVA as well as our profit sharing royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. were $338 million. Turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L, Q2 costs of goods sold were $286 million, or 11% of revenue. Q2 R&D expense was $491 million, or 19% of revenue. In Q2, SG&A expense was $492 million, or 19% of revenues. Our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24% for Q2, which benefited by approximately 50 basis points related to a discrete item. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 50 :50 between the U.S. and ex-U.S. Our weighted average diluted shares at the end of the quarter were 236 million. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $4.22 for the second quarter. Let me turn to our updated full-year 2015 guidance. We now expect revenue growth between 6% and 8%. This substantial decrease from our prior guidance is primarily driven by a change in our estimate for TECFIDERA's trajectory. Our balance-of-year forecast assumes limited patient growth for TECFIDERA in the United States. Additionally, in Europe overall reimbursement is below our original plan. Our revenue estimates for the rest of our MS portfolio remain largely unchanged. Moving to operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, OpEx is unchanged as we work to contain costs for the balance of the year. R&D expense is expected to be between 19% and 20% of revenue, unchanged from prior guidance. Assuming deal closure, we will book an approximately $40 million expense to R&D in the third quarter related to our collaboration with AGTC. SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 20% to 21% of revenue, unchanged from prior guidance. I'd like to point out that we'll owe Neurimmune a $60 million milestone payment upon dosing of the first patient in the Phase 3 trials for aducanumab. This payment will be an expense and presented within the non-controlling interest line in the P&L. We anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results between $15.50 and $15.95, and GAAP EPS to be between $14.25 and $14.70. From a cash perspective, we now expect to pay approximately $850 million in CVR payments in 2015 related to the sales of TECFIDERA, a reduction from prior guidance. We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $650 million to $700 million, an increase over 2014, as we continue to expand our manufacturing footprints. Included in this forecast is the recently announced agreement related to the Eisai's Research Triangle Park campus. Overall, we're very disappointed in the change of outlook for the year. Nevertheless, we remain committed to working tirelessly to turn around the commercial performance, and we'll aggressively look for opportunities to reduce expenses while simultaneously ensuring we invest in the pipeline. I'll turn the call over to George. George A. Scangos, Ph.D. - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thanks, Paul. Look, we obviously have a lot of work ahead of us as we strive to maximize the success of our commercial business and execute on our operational goals. Over the long term we expect that the primary source of value creation will be from the introduction of new therapies. So in closing, I'd like to highlight several pipeline programs that may be future value drivers for the company. ZINBRYTA is currently under regulatory review as a potential new therapeutic option for relapsing MS patients. If approved, we believe that ZINBRYTA could be an interesting addition to our MS portfolio and provide Biogen with an additional treatment option for patients. Later this year, we anticipate Phase 3 results for TYSABRI in secondary progressive MS, a form of the disease impacting approximately 30% of MS patients, and for which there are no proven effective therapies today. We also recently obtained Phase 2 results suggesting that TYSABRI may improve clinical outcomes in stroke patients, and we're rapidly moving forward to better understand TYSABRI's potential as a post-stroke therapy, with hopes to offer a new potential therapeutic option for the millions of patients experiencing this debilitating condition. The Phase 3 SMNRx program, developed with our partners at Isis Pharmaceuticals, represents another important opportunity for Biogen. SMNRx is being developed with the goal of improving and extending the lives of patients with spinal muscular atrophy. The available clinical results increasingly suggest SMNRx may indeed be having this effect. We look forward to obtaining Phase 3 data late next year or early 2007. We're eagerly awaiting the anti-LINGO Phase 2 MS results next year and expect to provide an update on the AON data at ECTRIMS [European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis] in the fall. While available MS therapies slow the course of the disease, anti-LINGO has the potential to work in a fundamentally different way, by acting as a restorative therapy. And of course, Alzheimer's disease is an area of intense focus for Biogen, with several active clinical programs. In addition to aducanumab, our lead program, we're working with our partner Eisai to develop BAN2401 and E2609, potential disease-modifying therapies in Phase 2. BAN2401 is an anti-beta amyloid antibody, while E2609 is an oral base inhibitor that seeks to block the production of amyloid plaque. Clinical results are expected for both product candidates next year, and we look forward to providing updates on the progress of our R&D efforts as we continue to advance the pipeline. Before I end the call, I want to take a moment to acknowledge Doug Williams's contributions to Biogen. Doug joined Biogen over four years ago, and since then has been a great friend and colleague and has done an amazing job helping to invigorate Biogen's R&D. I think that the progress that we've made should be obvious to everyone. So, as Doug prepares to leave the company, I'm sad to see him go, but I'm happy for him that he has the opportunity to move to a new role that truly excites him. I want to publicly thank Doug for all that he's done and wish him all the best in his next endeavor. Fortunately for us, Doug has helped build a deep team, including for us (26:10) physicians and scientists who continue to advance Biogen's R&D efforts. Leadership for the research and development organization will be assumed by Al Sandrock, our Chief Medical Officer, and Spyros Artavanis, our Chief Scientific Officer. Both Spyros and Al are extremely talented and accomplished and I'm confident in the continued success of our R&D organization. Finally, as always, I want to thank the many Biogen employees who have contributed to our success. Through good and challenging times, I'm always gratified to see the consistent dedication to patients and shareholders exhibited by our employees, and I'm confident that we'll all continue to work hard to accomplish our ambitious goals. So with that, we'll end the call and open it up for questions. Operator : Your first question is from Geoffrey Porges with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. Geoffrey Craig Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks very much, and I'm sure there will be lots of questions on the TECFIDERA and the rest of the MS portfolio outlook. Paul, I wanted to ask you a question first about margins and on a related basis about capital allocation. As you've had a chance now to look at this revised guidance and the outlook for the core business and then the various clinical trials that you're planning, what confidence do you have that the 48% to 49% operating margin you have today can be maintained over the next two years to three years? And related to that, you have a very strong balance sheet. You mentioned the $4.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, next to no debt. Some of your competitors have used their balance sheet quite effectively, and we're wondering, are you contemplating that? Would you take on leverage? If so, how much, and what are your capital allocation priorities now? Thanks. Paul J. Clancy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Geoff, thanks for the question, pretty expansive, so let me try to tackle it. On the margin front, certainly I'd point to what the guidance now assumes. I think from a multi-year perspective, we certainly would continue to still want to drive towards margin improvement. The dynamics of our margin improvements obviously over the next couple of years are going to be a little bit different. As the revenue growth has attenuated, we're going to have to work harder to control costs, and I think that we came into this year starting to do that with our SG&A. We are certainly doing that with the balance-of-year forecast, maintaining the OpEx targets as a percentage of sales that effectively assumes not an insignificant pull-back in our spending. We're coming off a period that we purposely, and as I've articulated that we didn't want to be pennywise and pound-foolish, we had an unprecedented number of product launches for a company our size. I think that was appropriate, and we need to pivot towards making sure any and all waste gets out of the organization. That will be a very fine, delicate balance because we want to continue to invest in the pipeline, and we will absolutely make that an incredible priority. So we'll navigate through that. It will be a little bit of a challenge, but there's no doubt that we're up to it. With respect to capital allocation, the balance sheet leverage, George and I will tag-team this one now. Certainly, we have a pristine leverage profile and a pristine capital structure. I don't, as I said before, don't think that should be measured on a quarter-in or quarter-out basis, but I think this company can and we would love to have a capital structure that has more debt on it. But that will be driven by the opportunity to be able to do that as opposed to falsely trying to do that. As people noted, we have authorization from the board for a $5 billion share repurchase program. We have cautiously communicated that that would be done within five years' time. If the stock is under pressure, as it was in pre-market today, I suspect that we will look for opportunities to lower the share base. And capital allocation is much broader than that. Obviously, we continue to look for M&A opportunities. They've got to be the right thing. They've got to be the right value, and I'll let George pick up on that as well. George A. Scangos, Ph.D. - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Paul. Thanks, Geoff. The question is are we willing to use our balance sheet and our debt capacity for M&A, for acquisitions, for projects, product, compound acquisitions. The answer is certainly yes. We are constantly looking, and we will be aggressive when we find opportunities that we think are attractive and consistent with our strategy. Operator : The next question is from Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, thanks. I guess a question for Al or Doug. I guess to start with Alzheimer's, which is, maybe you could give some more specific comments about your interpretation of the recent data, specifically six milligrams, and how we should interpret the clinical meaningfulness of this. I think people are looking at MMSE and then CDR and not confident on that clinical meaningfulness. So maybe you can give some more perspective on that data and why I guess you're confident now that you've disclosed also the doses. Thanks. Douglas E. Williams - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Hi, Michael, this is Doug. I'll start. Al will jump in as well. Look, I will simply say that when Al and I looked at the data from the 6 mg cohort, I think we were both very happy to see that it lined up very nicely with our expectations for what we thought should have happened. I think the fact that for CDR, it's slotted right in between the 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg dose cohorts. You couldn't ask for a better outcome, frankly, in terms of how that data shook out. As I mentioned in the call earlier, that's the primary endpoint for the Phase 3 study, so I think we're increasingly confident that the data is continuing to be very, very consistent across multiple parameters. We believe that this data is increasingly strong, and we're very confident setting up and starting the Phase 3 study based on the results we've seen. I will go back in history and say that the last time that I personally was associated with a study at this stage where the results were this consistent across multiple parameters was back in my ENBREL days. So again, I believe that we have a really firm basis on which to go forward into Phase 3. The MMSE data, a little bit of wobble in that. That's the only data point that I can think of across the entire spectrum that didn't just line up almost perfectly. So we're strong believers in this product and feel very confident moving it forward. Alfred W. Sandrock Jr., M.D., Ph.D. - Group Senior Vice President, Chief Medical Officer : I completely agree with Doug and I have nothing to add. Operator : The next question is from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Hey, guys. I apologize, I have the flu, if I sound a little down. First, I'd just like to just say congratulations to Al. As you know, Wall Street loves him, as do I. George A. Scangos, Ph.D. - Chief Executive Officer & Director: We do too. Paul J. Clancy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We do, too. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : In a friendly non-romantic type of way. So I just wanted just a couple points. Hey, Paul, I just want to be really clear. You're basically telling us that from a volume perspective, TECFIDERA is basically going to stay flat this year. I just want to make sure. That seems like a core \u2013 I just want to make \u2013 there are all these numbers flying around. I just want to make sure that that is the message here in the U.S. And then I wanted to ask you \u2013 I wanted to push you guys a little bit on M&A, now with the unexpected slowing of the core business and a very interesting pipeline. But several years before it's going to contribute to the P&L, it would seem just obvious that plugging in some new products here, like Celgene perhaps has been doing, could make a lot of sense. You guys haven't really been very active on the M&A front. I think the last thing you did was the Elan transaction, which is just buying something you really knew. So can you talk about that? I think the Street would love to see you get more aggressive. Stocks go up every time acquirers buy a company. And I'll leave it at that and I'll get back in the queue. Thanks a lot. Paul J. Clancy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Mark, I'll take the first part. Your interpretation is exactly accurate. There's some very modest patient growth, but it's essentially what we're assuming. And I know there will be an assessment of whether or not we're being conservative or not. But essentially, what we're assuming is extremely limited patient growth on a sequential basis for the balance of the year in the United States. Our aspirations are obviously \u2013 commercially we're aspiring for much more than that, but that is the assumption that we have in the balance-of-year forecast. George A. Scangos, Ph.D. - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Look, Mark, on M&A, I think what you see, your observation is certainly is right. Every time there's some M&A event, stocks go up. We are certainly not engaged in M&A for any short-term stock performance. But we certainly are, I would say, increasingly aggressive about wanting to add additional compounds to our portfolio and to our pipeline. And we will be aggressive when we see good opportunities that are consistent with our strategy. So I think you can count on that. Operator : The next question is from Ying Huang with Bank of America. Your line is open. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I want to probe you a little bit further on TECFIDERA. So we now have a second confirmed case on PML, even though it's off-label. And then we will see ocrelizumab data in RMS in Phase 3. So if you take a longer-term look at TECFIDERA, what do you think those could affect the growth trajectory for TECFIDERA? And then also second question I have on the SPMS trial, I know you have a special product agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 trial for TYSABRI in SPMS. Can you elaborate a little more? What do you need to see in order to be able to file for approval here? Thank you. Stuart Anthony Kingsley - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : Thanks, Ying. It's Tony. So on the second PML case, let me talk about that and then talk about ocrelizumab. I guess it's still early days but it's certainly been several weeks that the information is out in the market. So we think the market has had some chance to absorb it. Look, the first PML case was a pretty significant change statement for the profile of TECFIDERA, given its very pristine safety profile at the time. Our sense is that the second one is a much less significant change statement. The cases within the expected profile, still exceptionally rare. So in discussions that we've had with physicians, with thought leaders, they seem to be \u2013 the appearance is that they are processing that much more straightforwardly. We've also monitored media pickup, social media pickup, other things like that, and to date have seen very significantly less reaction on that front. So this feels like a significantly different and more muted reaction to date than the first case. Ocrelizumab, look, I think consistent with what we've said before, we have seen increasing excitement in the market about ocrelizumab, particularly among specialists. We don't know the full data. It looks like a product that will play in the high-efficacy space. It's likely to appeal to the specialists, particularly the TYSABRI user, the RITUXAN user. That we think is more of an issue, frankly, for TYSABRI as it competes in the high-efficacy space and probably in a narrower customer, more specialized customer base over time. So we think of that as probably less relevant to TECFIDERA. Look, in terms of TECFIDERA's long-term profile, which is where you had asked that, I'll say this. To date, when we look at our market research, the indicators and the leading indicators of brand health we believe continue to be pretty favorable. Our market research says the benefit/risk profile has changed, but we believe it's still overall very positive. It's the most requested product by patients based on our research. Physicians state that they intend to use more, again, from market research, and they see it as appropriate for a broad set of patient types. So in the current environment, that's essentially why we're doubling down in what's been a slow market. The market has been more cautious and we think a lot of it is on the margin more cautious. But for a big brand like TECFIDERA, on the margin matters. So reach and frequency, patient outreach, and emphasizing the benefits of the product continue to be where we'll put our efforts. Alfred W. Sandrock Jr., M.D., Ph.D. - Group Senior Vice President, Chief Medical Officer : Hi, Ying, this is Al Sandrock. I'm still blushing from Mark's comments, but I'll try to answer this question on SPMS. As you pointed out, it was important to get a SPA approval prior to starting because this is the first time the drug would be approved using a new composite measure of disability progression, and so that's why it was important to get a SPA agreement. This composite measure, I think that whether or not the drug gets approved is going to rest almost entirely on whether or not the drug is statistically significant on this measure, which by the way, this measure has the EDSS standard, EDSS one-point change that we've been using for a long time in relapsing MS, but also in addition has two other pieces, a nine-hole peg test, a certain percentage change in the nine-hole peg test, as well as the timed 25-foot walk. So we believe that increases the sensitivity to change, so we will see disability progression better and therefore increased chances that TYSABRI will show a treatment effect. Operator : The next question is from Matt Roden with UBS. Your line is open. Matthew M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC : Great, thanks very much for taking the question. While I share the love for Al and say congrats to your promotion, I also want to say congrats to Doug on a great run at Biogen and good luck on your next venture. Douglas E. Williams - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Thank you. Matthew M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC : The question is on the Alzheimer's program. So the new information for us today is the dosing in the Phase 3 program. If you look at the numbers you have on CDR, sum of the boxes at 3 milligrams and 6 milligrams, would you get stat-sig, statistical significance if the sample size were 1,350 patients, which is what you're using in ENGAGE and EMERGE? And I guess related, just to better understand the strategy of using the multiple doses here, is it meant to enable patients in the real world to move up and down dose, or is it meant to just take people all the way up to 78 weeks in a particular dose and then reassess? I'm just trying to understand whether or not the clinical trial is capturing what you mean to do in the real world. Thanks. Douglas E. Williams - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Again, Al and I will tag-team this. I think the intent here, obviously, we've analyzed the data very carefully, and it's a very small sample size coming out of the current Phase 1b study. But what we've seen in terms of consistency of response across the doses I think has allowed us to do some very nice statistical modeling and make some assumptions about sample size that obviously we think will allow us to achieve statistical significance with the sample size, with the increased duration of dosing because as you recall from the previous look at the data, the longer you dose, the more amyloid you remove. And what we've shown in the most recent presentation is that there is a very nice correlation between amyloid removal and improvement in cognition. So I think all of these factors have come into play to both size the study and to pick the dose. And I would say what we're trying to do is to actually push the dose and to push it as high and as hard as we can to remove as much amyloid as possible because we know that that seems to be an important parameter for efficacy with our drug. So all of this has been factored into the sample size, and I think we've designed a study now that allows us to take into account the fact that increasing doses work better, increasing durations seem to work better. And stratifying, based on APOE4 status is an important parameter for allowing us to both push the dose but at the same time try to minimize ARIA. And I think the up-titration is another element to the study that will improve our chances of maximizing the benefit/risk. Alfred W. Sandrock Jr., M.D., Ph.D. - Group Senior Vice President, Chief Medical Officer : I think anytime we go from Phase 2 to Phase 3, we do a discounting, if you will. We assume that the variability will increase. We assume that \u2013 and we look at 95% confidence intervals of what the actual treatment effect is, and that's what Doug was saying about the modeling. And so I think we're pretty confident using this sample size that we will achieve a statistical significance. In terms of how we view this drug to be used once it's approved, I do think that people will get genotyped and the dose will be based on genotype, not (45:37) on whether or not they're APOE4 carriers. And then we'll have to look at the data to see which dose is superior in each of the subgroups, the carriers and non-carriers, and that will probably be the recommended dose. And then the other complication is if there's some ARIA whether or not people would dose-reduce because that's what was typically done in the Phase 1b trial. People dose-reduced, then most people were able to continue dosing with the dose reduction. So that's how I see it playing out. Operator : The next question is from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, thanks for taking my question, maybe just two quick ones for me. First is just TECFIDERA, as you think about the out-year trajectory in the U.S., I know your outlook for this year is flat, but just help us think about the dynamics in terms of what really drives the trajectory change there. And then just on Alzheimer's, I was wondering if you can remind us of any similarities or differences between BIIB037 and the Eisai antibody and the endpoint they're using in that ongoing Phase 2 trial. Thanks. Stuart Anthony Kingsley - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : Thanks, Terrence. This is Tony, just maybe some qualitative comments on the outlook. We believe that the market continues to move to orals. We continue to believe that we have the best oral. So those are the two core things. And as I said, based on what we see in the market today, we continue to believe that we have a very good product profile. We think that we can continue to add patients. It's harder work at this point given where it is in the product life cycle. Alfred W. Sandrock Jr., M.D., Ph.D. - Group Senior Vice President, Chief Medical Officer : In terms of the BAN versus BIIB037, the BAN trial is using a composite measure that includes some of the measures that we've looked at in the BIIB037 study. So it's a different kind of measure that is rather unique actually. I think it was developed by the scientists and clinicians at Eisai. In terms of the differences in the antibodies, BAN binds to a different epitope than BIIB037. BAN is a humanized mouse antibody, whereas BIIB037 is a fully human antibody derived from human B-cells. And also BAN tends to bind to protofibrils. And so exactly which species of A-beta in terms of the aggregation status and fibrillar status, there are probably going to be some differences, although I would say that BIIB037 also binds to the ligamers as well as the fibrillary beta. So those are the differences. Operator : The next question is from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thanks for taking the question. I want to ask just on stroke. Can you clarify exactly what you saw on those functional endpoints, how similar or different they might have been from TPA, and then when we should think about some sort of Phase 3 design or plan for that, and when we might see that data. Thanks. Alfred W. Sandrock Jr., M.D., Ph.D. - Group Senior Vice President, Chief Medical Officer : This is Al Sandrock. The primary endpoint was the volume of the stroke basically based on MRI at day five. And as Doug said, that was not statistically significant, so we missed on the primary endpoint. What was surprising to us is then when we looked at the other clinical outcome measures at day 30 and day 90, we saw some interesting trends. And in some cases at certain times with certain measures there were statistical significance. And the other measures that were looked at were the Modified Rankin Scale, the Barthel Index, and the NIH stroke scale. Those are the typical stroke scales. And in fact, people often combine them into the global scales. When we look at those, we see some interesting trends, as I said. With odds ratios \u2013 so then the other way to look at it is the odds ratios of reaching a favorable outcome on these endpoints individually and as a composite global score. And when you look at that, it's actually in the range of what was seen with TPA, which makes us interested in what we saw. And so you mentioned going to Phase 3. I'm not sure we'll jump right into Phase 3, but we're still mulling over the data. We're looking at it in every which way that we can. We're discussing it with stroke experts. And we'll let you know what we're going to do next, but I think it bears further study. Operator : The next question is from Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Co. Your line is open. Eric Thomas Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks for the question. Maybe, Paul, I think we've touched on TECFIDERA's growth trajectory, but it sounds like your guidance for the second half of the year essentially on the top line implies no growth in revenue over the first half of the year. And I guess if there's no growth H2 over H1, maybe why should we be optimistic for growth in the future as well? So perhaps you could just talk about the overall top line growth trajectories that you're expecting over the next six to 12 months. Paul J. Clancy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We've got to still sort that out as we move into 2016. I think that's what you're getting at, Eric. The guidance assumes that TECFIDERA patients in the United States are relatively limited growth, and that is clearly what we have to get motoring along. So that's the homework assignment. Outside the United States, we are growing in terms of patients. We had a hiccup this quarter versus Q1, as noted from the German pricing. That's a dynamic that will now settle out. But certainly, we've got some work to do on the commercial front. Operator : The next question is from Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. So just to take a step back and just help me feel more comfortable around the rest of the year, two things. Again, it's early, but have you seen any impact from generic COPAXONE as push-back on price or utilization? Second, when you thought about TECFIDERA and flat sales, to what extent do you think there will be people stopping the drug versus just minimal growth, and how are you thinking about that? And then third, given the lack of growth in one of these core products, you talked about share buybacks. I guess this is going to a point that was made earlier. Has that changed your interest in bringing in something that will be a growthy driver, an M&A potential candidate that might help the company grow during the time in which you're developing your pipeline and you're facing such headwinds? Thanks. Stuart Anthony Kingsley - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : Okay, Robyn, it's Tony. First on GLATOPA, generic COPAXONE, absolutely to date within our expectations, which I think we've talked about for a while now is we think that product largely has an impact within the COPAXONE molecule category. Last I looked, which was probably a couple weeks back to early July, there were 400 or 500 Rxs, 90%-plus of them were switches. 97% of those switches were from COPAXONE QD, so to date absolutely where we expected it to be. You've seen probably the WAC, which is $63,000 \u2013 $64,000. I don't have clarity on what their contracting strategy will be, but absolutely within the expectations that we had. Douglas E. Williams - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: And then good point, Robyn, what you're bringing up with respect to TECFIDERA. Certainly one of the dynamics that we've seen that we didn't expect was a modest but not trivial increase in discontinuations in TECFIDERA in the United States in particular. That probably we think traces back to the monitoring to some extent. It traces back to efficacy breakthroughs, which is typical for most of the disease modifying the majority in it traces to some of the GIs. So both dynamics are actually happening. We're hopeful that we can actually bring that back to a bit normal state, but TBD as we move forward. George A. Scangos, Ph.D. - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, and this is George, Robyn. Look, on the M&A question, I think as we've said before, we have a good balance sheet. We have debt capacity. We will not be shy about using it when we see opportunities that are interesting and consistent with what we want to do. I don't think we're in any panic situation to go out and be desperate. But there as we see good opportunities, we will be aggressive about bringing them in. Operator : The next question is from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is open. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question, one for Tony and one for Doug or Al. So for Tony, you guys have talked about Europe being as big as the U.S. in terms of peak potential for TECFIDERA. I was just wondering if that was still the case and how you think about how quickly you could reaccelerate growth OUS. And then for Doug or Al on aducanumab, maybe help us with the criteria for beta amyloid elevations and PET scans. I know you guys had a correlation between beta amyloid levels and cognition. But is there a threshold that you're looking for that you feel like you'd have maximal efficacy, or does it matter? Over an 18-month period, do you feel like just clearance of the plaque, even a marginal clearance, would have some sort of effect on cognition? Thank you. Stuart Anthony Kingsley - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : Good, thanks. It's Tony. On Europe, the short answer is basically mathematically impossible for Europe to be as big as the U.S. given the differential in pricing and therefore net revenue per patient across. You have a big patient population in Europe. As I said, more mature markets like Germany, we believe we've seen dynamics that are a little bit more like the U.S. But launch markets we're seeing really nice uptake, and we believe it's very consistent with what we saw in the other launches. So the total dynamic is we have seen good patient growth in Europe. We have had both net price and also FX working against us this year. We are basically through all the major reimbursement decisions at this point. And when all the dust has settled, the net prices we were able to achieve over there were certainly lower than our aspiration and what I think our plan was. We always cautioned that given how broadly TECFIDERA would be used, you'd have a gravitational pull-down to the platform therapies. The argument for us with the pricing authorities obviously was superior efficacy, better profiles than the platforms. That has been a very tough row to hoe. It was made tougher by AUBAGIO, which went ahead of us and took what was a pretty low price strategy that increased the pressure over there. So I think Paul referenced it, and I talked a little in my comments. The net revenue per patient in Europe is just structurally substantially lower than the U.S. and for TECFIDERA specifically has come out lower than we would certainly have aspired to given those market dynamics. Douglas E. Williams - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: And on the question about the lowering of amyloid, what we did there was to look to see whether there was a PK/PD relationship essentially. And it was a scientific question. Does the effect on cognition need to go through the effect on amyloid lowering? And in a way it's asking is the amyloid hypothesis correct? And what we saw was that it's consistent with the amyloid hypothesis being correct. Your question goes to another thing, which is are we going to be using this as a biomarker in the clinic when it's approved, and will there be some sort of threshold effect being used in clinic? And I think it's far too early to speculate on that. I think it might go to that part, but I would not say that this one standard deviation unit that we chose to look at would be that threshold. I think there's a lot more work that has to be done before we get to that stage. Operator : The final question is from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to go back to aducanumab and see if you could provide a little more clarity on the titration there. I'm just not clear. Can anyone go up to 10 mg/kg if they're tolerating the drug? And what's the trigger to up-titrate? And then also, how much would the planned titration schedule informed by the titration cohort you added to the Phase 1b trial? Thanks. Douglas E. Williams - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: We haven't actually released the specific details on how the up-titration is going to work except to say that all of the patients will undergo that process as they get to their final dose in the study. Again, I think we'll have more clarity on that once we actually begin enrolling patients. But for the moment, I think we'll simply say that that is based on a variety of parameters, primarily that there are two things we know correlate with the incidence of ARIA. One is obviously dose, so a lower dose has a lower incidence of ARIA. And the second is time. Most of the ARIA occurs during the first five doses of administration. So the hypothesis that's being tested right now with this cohort you mentioned is whether or not at a lower dose for a period of time you can get through this period of risk, I'll call it, for developing ARIA and end up with a lower overall incidence on your way up to the final dose. Carlo Tanzi - Director- Investor Relations : Okay. With that, we'll bring the call to an end. Thank you all for calling in today. Thanks for all the questions, and we can all get back to work now. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Thomas Shrader - Stifel Nicolaus Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Operator : Good morning. My name is Chris, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Third Quarter 2015 Financial Results and Business Update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ben Strain, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Ben Strain : Thank you, and welcome to Biogen\u2019s third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we\u2019ll discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult our SEC filings for additional detail. On today\u2019s call, I\u2019m joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. George Scangos; Dr. Alf Sandrock, our Chief Medical Officer; and our CFO, Paul Clancy. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George. George Scangos : Okay. Thank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Third quarter was marked by significant progress across several key areas. We delivered a 11% revenue growth and 18% non-GAAP EPS growth, as we continue to see modification growth across the portfolio. We have several important developments in our pipeline. We initiated enrollment for our Phase 3 clinical program for aducanumab and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. We announced Phase 3 results for TYSABRI and secondary progressive MS, which I will cover in more detail later in the call. And we continue to strengthen our pipeline by announcing an agreement to exclusively license MT-1303 for Mitsubishi Tanabe. On the commercial front, we remain committed to improving our commercial trajectory with a particular emphasis on TECFIDERA. Our market research continues to indicate that prescribers believe TECFIDERA has a very strong benefit risk profile. However, patient growth in the U.S. and Germany remains challenging, and we\u2019re actively working to improve this dynamic. We\u2019ve increased sales costs for TECFIDERA, as we continue to educate physicians on TECFIDERA\u2019s strong efficacy and favorable safety profile and its label and monitoring requirements. We\u2019ve also increased our direct-to-consumer marketing in the U.S., including a recently launched television campaign that some of you may have seen. We also made significant progress on capital allocation. Through yesterday, we\u2019ve returned approximately $3.9 billion to our shareholders through the repurchase of our common stock. Importantly, Biogen still retains strategic flexibility to support both continued business development and potentially larger scale acquisitions. We remain focused on strengthening and expanding our early stage pipeline through tuck-in acquisitions and collaborations. The strategy that has produced assets, such as TECFIDERA, ELOCTATE, ALPROLIX, aducanumab, Isis-SMNRx and Raxatrigine. We\u2019re actively looking for late-stage and commercial assets, which have the potential to add both strategic value and near-term revenue growth, while maintaining financial discipline. Today, we also announced the corporate restructuring that we believe will best position the company to achieve our strategic priorities. This decision to reduce our workforce was extremely difficult and we\u2019re very thankful for the hard work and contributions of our talented colleagues and friends. As part of our effort to focus on key commercial initiatives and high potential pipeline candidate, we\u2019ve also made a decision to discontinue several pipeline program that includes TECFIDERA in secondary progressive MS, as well as certain programs in immunology and fibrosis research, including anti-TWEAK. Importantly, we plan to reinvest the savings from this restructuring into key commercial initiatives and a number of prioritized programs across our emerging mid- and late-stage pipeline, including commercial initiatives aimed at increasing sales and marketing therapies, including new direct-to-consumer marketing programs for TECFIDERA, the advancement of aducanumab, BAN2401, and E 2609 for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Anti-LINGO for multiple sclerosis, Isis-SMNRx for spinal muscular atrophy, our recently acquired asset from Convergence, Raxatrigine for Trigeminal Neuralgia and other pain indications, and MT-1303 for inflammatory bowel disease and other autoimmune diseases. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Al for an update on R&D. Alfred Sandrock : Thanks, George. We had important clinical study readouts and good progress advancing a new generation of mid- and late-stage clinical program. This morning, we reported top line results from the Phase 3 ASCEND study for TYSABRI and secondary progressive MS. The objective of the ASCEND was to determine whether TYSABRI had an impact on slowing disability progression unrelated to relapses in patients with SPMS. Most patients that enrolled in ASCEND had non-relapsing SPMS and had EDSS scores of 6.0 to 6.5. ASCEND did not achieve its primary or secondary endpoint, and we do not intend to file for label expansion. We are disappointed in these results, as SPMS is a serious condition with no effective therapies. ASCEND study results did demonstrate that TYSABRI had a robust impact on relapses and MRI measures of disease, consistent with its known clinical profile in relapsing MS. Study results also indicated that TYSABRI had a statistically significant effect on upper limb function measured by the 9-Hole Peg Test, which was a component of the composite primary endpoint. Full study results will be reported at our future medical meeting. Moving onto our other MS development programs, at the ECTRIMS Meeting earlier this month, we represented an additional analysis for renew, a Phase 2 study that evaluated Anti-LINGO in patients with acute optic neuritis, the top line results of which we reported earlier this year. About half the patients in renew underwent multifocal visual evoked potential testing, a method that allows us to record electrical responses produced in the occipital cortex upon stimulation of small segments within the retina. First, we found that Anti-LINGO had an effect on the recovery of the multifocal VEP amplitude recorded by stimulating the eye that was affected by the optic neuritis. Interestingly, we also found that Anti-LINGO treatment preserved the multifocal VEP amplitude, recorded by stimulating the opposite eye, which was seem to be deteriorating in the placebo group, likely due to lesions developing in the visual system, as a result of some of these patients being in the early stages of MS. We believe that these results further support our previously reported findings and provide evidence that Anti-LINGO may have neuroprotective properties. We continue to expect top line results from the Phase 2 synergy study in MS in mid-2016. Turning to ZINBRYTA, The New England Journal of Medicine has just published the results of the ZINBRYTA Phase 3 DECIDE study. In DECIDE, ZINBRYTA demonstrated a compelling 45% improvement in annualized relapse rate compared to interferon therapy. If approved, we believe ZINBRYTA could be an important new therapeutic option for relapsing MS patients. At ECTRIMS, Roche presented positive Phase 3 results in both relapsing and primary progressive MS for ocrelizumab, a product in which we have a business interest. Results from two Phase 3 studies in relapsing MS showed a 46% and 47% reduction in annualized relapse rate compared to interferon therapy. Ocrelizumab also demonstrated a significant role in the treatment of primary progressive MS, a serious neurodegenerative condition for which there are no approved therapies. If approved, it would be wonderful to be able offer these patients a meaningful new therapy. Turning to our hemophilia therapies, ELOCTA, which is the approved European trade name for ELOCTATE, obtained a positive recommendation from the CHMP, as a therapy for hemophilia A. If approved in the EU, ELOCTA would be commercialized there by our collaborators Sobi. At the 2015 National Hemophilia Foundation Meeting, new ALPROLIX data showed a beneficial long-term safety and efficacy profile in patients with hemophilia B. Favorable long-term clinical results for ELOCTATE treatment of patients with hemophilia A were also recently published. Moving to the aducanumab Phase 3 program for patients with early Alzheimer\u2019s disease, we have initiated clinical sites in both the emerged and engaged studies and the first study subjects have now been enrolled. We are pleased to have received FDA agreement on a special protocol assessment on the aducanumab Phase 3 study protocols. We have previously reported that ARIA or amyloid-related imaging abnormality was the most significant adverse event observed in the aducanumab Phase 1B study. All patients currently enrolling into Phase 3 studies of aducanumab are undergoing dose titrations in an effort to mitigate the risk of ARIA. Preliminary data from the Phase 1B study suggests that dose titrations does seem to reduce the incidence of ARIA, although these findings will need to be confirmed with further study. We continue to obtain additional clinical data from the Phase 1B study, and we anticipate discussing these results at a scientific meeting in the second-half of next year. We have made progress in expanding our development pipeline by acquiring rights to MT-1303, a Phase 3 ready program with potential and multiple autoimmune diseases. At the recent ECTRIMS Meeting, Mitsubishi Tanabe presented compelling results from a 415 patient Phase 2 study in MS. Results demonstrated that MT-1303 did not cause a decrease in heart rate with administration of the first dose, even without dose titration. This characteristic of the molecule may serve to eventually differentiated from other S1P modulators. We anticipate deal completion in the fourth quarter and we intend to initiate Phase 3 studies in inflammatory bowel disease as soon as possible next year. We continue to evaluate potential further development in MS. Progress has also been made with several early-stage programs BIIB061 and oral treatment being developed as a potential reparative therapy for MS has successfully completed Phase 1 studies. We recently initiated a Phase 1 study for BIIB054, a monoclonal antibody targeting \u03b1-synuclein, which is being developed as a potential disease modifying therapy for Parkinson\u2019s disease. The target of BIB-54 \u03b1-synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies, a pathologic hallmark of Parkinson\u2019s disease. R&D continues to make good progress advancing the next wave of therapies and development candidates. Next year, we anticipate the approval of ZINBRYTA for relapsing MS. We also intend to initiate a number of clinical studies, including a Phase 3 study of MT-1303 in IBD, a Phase 3 study for Raxatrigine for trigeminal neuralgia, as well as a Phase 2 study BIIB61 in MS. We\u2019re also looking forward to several upcoming clinical readouts, including Phase 3 results for SMNRx in spinal muscular atrophy, Phase 2 results for Anti-LINGO in MS, and interim phase 2 results for BAN2401 and E2609, both for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. We look forward to a deeper discussion of these pipeline programs and other initiatives that are upcoming R&D Investor Day on November 3. I\u2019ll now pass the call to Paul. Paul Clancy : Thanks, Al. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.15 in the third quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.48. Total revenue for Q3 grew a 11% year-over-year to approximately $2.8 billion. Foreign exchange offset by hedging weakened total revenue by approximately $63 million year-over-year. Global third quarter TECFIDERA revenue was $937 million, an increase of 19% versus Q3 of last year, and an increase of 6% versus the prior quarter. Foreign exchange impact offset by hedging weakened TECFIDERA revenue by approximately $12 million year-over-year. This quarter\u2019s TECFIDERA revenues consisted of $754 million in the U.S. and $183 million outside the U.S. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, U.S. TECFIDERA revenue increased 5%, partially due to an increase in inventory at specialty pharmacies, while U.S. revenue also benefited from a price increase in the quarter, this was partially offset by an increase in managed care and government rebates. In Europe, TECFIDERA had strong sequential patient growth this quarter, driven by newly launched markets, including the U.K., Italy, and Spain. Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY increased 5% year-over-year to $785 million in the third quarter. Foreign exchange impact offset by hedging weakened Interferon revenue by approximately $23 million year-over-year. Interferon revenues were comprised of $538 million in the U.S. and $247 million in sales outside the U.S. On a sequential basis, we believe the 18% increase in U.S. Interferon revenue benefited from a wholesaler inventory rebalancing coming off of the inventory drawdown in Q2, which contributed approximately $40 million. Outside the U.S., AVONEX revenue benefited by approximately $16 million from the timing of shipments in Brazil and a clinical trial order in our rest of world business. TYSABRI continue to add patients this quarter with worldwide revenues of $480 million. These results were comprised of $284 million in the U.S., and $196 million internationally. Foreign exchange impact offset by hedging weakened TYSABRI revenue by approximately $23 million year-over-year. Turning to our hemophilia business, ALPROLIX revenue in Q3 was $66 million and ELOCTATE was $91 million. In the U.S. after a period of rapid uptake for our ALPROLIX with elevated switching in the market, we saw the switch rates start to moderate is roughly half of the moderate and severe hemophilia B patients, treated prophylactically have switched to ALPROLIX. ELOCTATE has continued to grow in the U.S., and we saw increased breadth and depth of prescribing. Approximately 20% of moderate and severe prophylactic patients with hemophilia A have switched to ELOCTATE. Our U.S. profit share for RITUXAN and GAZYVA, as well as our profit-share and royalties on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. were $337 million. Now, turning to the expense lines in the non-GAAP P&L Q3 cost of goods sold were $310 million, or 11% of revenue. Q3 R&D expense was $520 million, or 19% of revenues. This includes $48 million in upfront and milestone expense related to our recently closed collaboration with AGTC. We made a $60 million milestone payment to Neurimmune this quarter triggered by dosing of the first patient in, in the Phase 3 trials for aducanumab. This payment was an expense and presented within the non-controlling interest line in the P&L. Q3 SG&A expense was $478 million, or 17% of revenue, as we continue to make steps in containing SG&A expenses. Our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24% for Q3. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were 448 for the third quarter, an increase of 18% over Q3 2014. While there are number of puts and takes in the quarter, we delivered a very solid quarter with solid results from the United States Interferon business, continued European rollout of TECFIDERA, continued progress in the hemophilia franchise, and meaningful cost control absorbing the AGTC in Neurimmune payments. Let me turn to discuss our progress on returning capital to shareholders. Recall, our Board had authorized the $5 billion share repurchase program in May of this year. Due to lower share price, we put in place a more robust share repurchase plan in late July, effectively expediting the program. Through September 30, we\u2019ve repurchased approximately 9.7 million shares of our common stock for a cost of approximately $3 billion. And since the end of the quarter, we have purchased an additional 3.2 million shares for approximately $900 million. Our current expectation is to complete the 5 billion share repurchase plan by the end of the year. In conjunction with funding our share repurchase program, we borrowed $6 billion of senior unsecured notes in mid-September. This included maturities of 5, 7, 10 and 30 years. We ended the quarter with approximately $7.8 billion in cash and marketable securities split approximately 60/40 between the U.S. and ex-U.S. Let me now provide additional detail on the corporate restructuring. The restructuring includes the termination of a number of pipeline programs in a 11% reduction in workforce. The reduction was the result of a number of actions, including the consolidation and elimination of certain overlapping groups across the organization in analytical and operational support and in marketing. Resizing portions of the company, where we felt there was excess capacity, including in our manufacturing operation. Resizing our ex-U.S. commercial operation and reductions driven by our de-emphasis of certain activities in immunology and fibrosis research in the termination of certain development programs. We plan to complete the majority of the reduction of the global workforce by the end of 2015. The restructuring is expected to reduce the current annual run rate of operating expenses by approximately $250 million. We expect to incur charge in the range of approximately $85 million to $95 million, primarily in the fourth quarter related to the restructuring. Additionally, we\u2019re currently in the middle of our financial planning for 2016, and aim toward additional savings in non-labor expenses, with the objective of reducing lower priority fees and services expense. Conversely, on the investment side, as we move into 2016, we\u2019re excited and plan to invest behind in emerging, mid- and late-stage pipeline, invest in TECFIDERA DTC, and we\u2019ll potentially invest at risk behind prelaunch activities related to the potential commercialization of SMNRx. While we outline our specific 2016 financial guidance in late January, we currently expect upward pressure in R&D and aim for leverage in SG&A. We aim to achieve lower overall expense growth in the top line for 2016. The restructuring will yield risk savings to enhance our operating results for 2016 and beyond, while also providing financial flexibility, as we embark on a number of meaningful pipeline opportunities. Given the restructuring change in capital structure and share repurchase activity this quarter, we\u2019re updating our full-year 2015 guidance. Let me start with revenues. We now expect revenue growth between 8% and 9%, a modest increase versus prior guidance, reflecting the revenue strength seen this quarter. This guidance assumes modest patient growth in the U.S. for our MS products as a whole for the balance of the year. The revenue outlook also assumes a sequential decrease in Q4, due to the assumption of stable U.S. channel inventory levels for the balance of year in MS, and a reduction in U.S. wholesaler inventory levels for RITUXAN. Non-GAAP full-year R&D expense is expected to be between 19% and 20% of revenue, unchanged from prior guidance. Assuming deal closure, we will book in approximately $60 million expense to R&D in the fourth quarter, relating to our agreement with Mitsubishi Tanabe. Non-GAAP full-year SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 19% to 20% of revenue, a decrease from prior guidance. We do expect to invest in TECFIDERA TV in Q4. We anticipate booking a GAAP charge of approximately $85 million to $95 million, primarily in Q4 related to the restructuring. In conjunction with our recently completed bond offering, we now anticipate additional interest expense of approximately $60 million per quarter. We expect to end the year with approximately $219 million fully diluted shares, and have a full-year weighted average diluted share count of approximately 231 million shares. We anticipate non-GAAP full-year earnings per share results between $16.20 and $16.50. This represents an increase of 17% to 19% year-over-year, and GAAP earnings per share, we expect to be between $14.65 and $14.95. The increase versus prior guidance is due to stronger than anticipated revenues in Q3, taking costs out of the business in the share repurchase activity. I\u2019ll turn the call over to George for his closing comments. George Scangos : Hey, thank you, Paul. This year has been a challenging month for those of us here at Biogen. But I believe that we have a solid business and R&D pipeline with exceptional potential, a thoughtful capital allocation strategy, a well-controlled expense base, and a capable group of people, who can execute against our goals. If we put aside quarterly revenue variations due to fluctuations in inventory levels, FX, or other factors, on a unit basis, we\u2019ve seen moderate but steady growth in the underlying business. Our pipeline has matured, and I believe that pipeline is more exciting and more promising than it was a year ago. Additional data for aducanumab and Anti-LINGO increased our optimism about both of those compounds. We believe that MT-1303 has real potential in ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease. Raxatrigine had promising data in a controlled Phase 2 trial and will move to Phase 3 trial in trigeminal neuralgia in a Phase 2B trial in sciatica. SMNRx data from the open label Phase 2 trial are encouraging, and we\u2019re looking forward to the Phase 3 data late next year or early 2017. Additionally, our research has become truly world-class, and were looking forward to giving you a deeper view of what we\u2019re doing at R&D Day on November 3. In Q3, we began the execution of a thoughtful capital allocation strategy. We issued $6 billion of senior unsecured notes, which allowed us to take advantage of our lowered stock price to return approximately $4 billion to investors through stock buy backs with an additional $1 billion to go. We have been able to reduce our share count substantially, while leaving adequate financial flexibility for strategic acquisitions of compounds and our companies. We continue to consider opportunities within our core areas of expertise, both large and small, and as always, we\u2019ll do so, while being financially disciplined. The restructuring that we announced today was an extremely difficult position, and all of us feel deeply for the affected employees. These people are our friends and colleagues and they\u2019ve played a big role in the successes that Biogen has had up until now. They\u2019re good people, good employees, and it truly saddens us to have to take this action. On behalf of the senior leadership team, I want to express our sincere appreciation for the work that everyone at Biogen has done. Although this action is extremely difficult, it\u2019s a necessary step in order for us to fulfill our goals as a company. I believe that our mid- and late-stage pipeline is larger and higher quality than it has ever been, aducanumab, SMNRx, Raxatrigine, and MT-1303 either are or soon will be in Phase 3, and we\u2019re hopeful that LINGO will join them next year. These programs will require substantial investments and we believe that restructuring will allow us to aggressively conduct these programs, while maintaining healthy earnings growth. Next year, we expect to have meaningful clinical data from SMNRx, Anti-LINGO, BAN2401, our base inhibitor E2609, and we hope to gain approval for ZINBRYTA and for two of our bio-similar molecules. So our pipeline has both near-term and longer-term potential to add value to patients and the company. And we need to be able to adequately fund these exciting programs. The restructuring helps us to do so. Before I conclude, I want to take a moment to acknowledge Tony Kingsley\u2019s contributions to Biogen. Tony joined Biogen over five years ago and was instrumental in leading the successful introduction of several important new therapies that help serve patients around the world. I want to publicly thank Tony for all that he has done and wish him all the best in his next endeavor. Tony built an extremely capable team, and I believe that we have the people and programs in place to maximize the potential of our commercial portfolio. In the interim, leadership of this group will be assumed by John Cox, EVP of Pharmaceutical Operations and Technology. John has been with Biogen for over 12 years, has a good understanding of all aspects of our business, and I believe that we will \u2013 he will effectively lead this group. So as we move forward, we\u2019re starting from a good base and we\u2019ll focus on five key goals. One, maximize the potential of our commercial portfolio; two, aggressively advance our mid- and late-stage clinical programs to get them gone on or ahead of schedule; three, continue our emphasis on world-class science and medicine; four, carefully control our costs; and five, pursue nonorganic growth opportunities. We\u2019re energized by the potential that we have to transform the lives of patients around the world, and by doing so to do right by our shareholders. I can\u2019t promise you success in everything that we do, but I can promise you our commitment and dedication. And with that, we\u2019ll now open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Mark Schoenebaum : Once again thanks for all the transparency that has been the hallmark of Paul\u2019s tenure as CFO, and George as CFO, and your IR team has done a great job too. I had some questions on the pipeline for Al, if I may. Al, when will we actually see data from the some of the titration doses on the antibodies, most importantly the titration to the 10 milligram data please? And number two, you\u2019ve talked about this before, but I think, it\u2019s time that we all start talking about again and just want to get your take. The optic neuritis data that you looked at is kind of you had to really squint to see activity. And so Wall Street expectations right now are extremely low for LINGO and MS. I mean, do you view LINGO and MS as a low probability trial, or is this one that you have a higher degree of confidence in? Thank you. Alfred Sandrock : So, thanks, Mark. On the first question, we expect to show results in the second-half of the year. We actually have two places \u2013 oh, next year, yes. The \u2013 there\u2019s two places where we\u2019re doing titration. One is that we \u2013 when we put people from placebo in the prime study, in our Phase 1B study over into the long-term extension that was the titration phase. And second, in cohorts eight to nine in the prime study, titration was built into the \u2013 into that study. So there are these two studies essentially to analyze and it\u2019s going to take us a little time of time particularly to get to the 10 milligram, which is what you\u2019re interested in, and will be the second-half of next year. In terms of the Anti-LINGO, I mean, look, it\u2019s high risk. I mean, nobody has ever even attempted really that I know to repair the central nervous system, and it\u2019s a tall order. On the other hand, we think we have proof of biology based on the optic neuritis study. We believe that the results portend that we\u2019re getting the biology we want. The key question for me is, is that biology going to lead to a clinically meaningful effect? And that\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping to see in the MS trial. Operator : The next question is from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Matthew Harrison : Great, thanks. Definitely a lot of questions to ask, maybe just another one for Al. Maybe just specifically on SPMS. Could you \u2013 it\u2019s unclear to me from the press release, it sounded like what you were trying to say was, you saw some impact in patients that had active lesions and you saw no impact in patients that didn\u2019t. Can you maybe just confirm if that was what you were trying to say, and if there was any numerical trend outside of patients without active lesions? Alfred Sandrock : Well, I mean, what we are saying is that, it\u2019s true that there was a minority of patients, that were still relapsing in the trial, and that\u2019s why we were able to show a robust effect on relapse rate. Those are what I would call active from the inflammatory point of view. And that \u2013 there clearly was \u2013 we saw what we had seen in the past an inflammatory disease with TYSABRI. In the non-inflammatory group, which was, I think, the majority of patients, we think, we see something in the upper extremity. However, we did not see an effect on the other two components of the primary endpoint, which was the EDSS and the Timed 25-Foot Walk. And so we were disappointed in the fact that, we didn\u2019t see an effect on ambulation. And so I think that\u2019s the reason why the primary endpoint was negative. I would say that upper extremity function is important in patients, particularly if their ambulation is starting to get lost. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to present these results next year at the Scientific Meeting. Operator : The next question is from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is open. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Morning, guys. Thanks for all the detail today and congrats on the quarter. Switch gears to ask a couple of questions on commercial for TECFIDERA and then DTC campaign. What population MS patients do you get or do you expect to get that you couldn\u2019t reach previously? And maybe can you speak to the breadth and length of time that you\u2019ll be doing the PCR reach just thinking from a cost perspective? Thanks. Paul Clancy : Yes, thanks, Geoff. This is Paul, I\u2019ll take a crack at that \u2013 at that question. We essentially started in the first week and some of you may have seen the TV campaign, I think, the current thinking now is, we\u2019ll look hard at measuring this thing along the way. But I think the current thinking now is well into 2016. And our planning that we\u2019re doing now is to effectively have it ongoing throughout the majority of 2016. I think the overall objective isn\u2019t that similar to the \u2013 what we saw early on in the launch is that, TECFIDERA when it came early on the launch, expanded the market, activated new patients, many of them that had gotten injection fatigue on the sidelines. And I think the thinking here is to activate those patients, activating a whole set of patients through patient awareness, which we do have some data that actually suggests that, it\u2019s a relatively low level of patient awareness, sorry, said another way, at least, that there\u2019s a big opportunity in driving patient awareness. And we also have data that suggests that when a patient comes to a doctor, particularly in the United States with a preferred therapy that is often the therapy that the patient goes on. So that\u2019s kind of a bit of a core thesis, and we look forward to kind of moving forward with it. Operator : The next question is from Ying Huang with Bank of America. Your line is open. Ying Huang : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First one I have a housekeeping question. Can you spell out the TECFIDERA U.S. inventory impact exactly? And then also maybe for Al, what\u2019s your consideration behind the decision to proceed for MS indication for MT-1303? Is that conditional on the readout from LINGO, or the other programs in MS programs. And lastly, can you update on the timing for the antibody BAN2401 and also the base emitter E2609 in second-half? Thank you. George Scangos : All right. I think, I\u2019ll take the first of your four questions, Ying. So that\u2019s a pretty easy one. What our best estimate on the essentially the tailwind we had on TECFIDERA inventory in SPP this quarter was about $10 million to $15 million. Al? Alfred Sandrock : So, on 1303 and MS, there\u2019s a number of option for that, and we\u2019re looking at all of them. And well, first, we have to wait for this deal to close. But in the meantime, we\u2019re considering a number of options. In terms of the other Alzheimer\u2019s program BAN and the base inhibitor, I think the best thing to do, we\u2019d ask a sigh actually what their timelines are. My understanding is that sometime next year, we\u2019ll see some data from the base inhibitor. And in terms of the BAN, I mean, there\u2019s sort of interim analysis that are based on events or numbers of people randomized I believe. So that\u2019s my understanding. But I think we could see something next year as well. Operator : The next question is from Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Eric Thomas Schmidt : Thanks for taking my question. It sounds like you guys spoke a little bit more about SMNRx on this call than in the past. I think I actually heard Paul say something about commercial preparation or potential, of course, preparation next year. Has your optimism around the program changed? And is there a chance for filing prior to the Phase 3 data? Alfred Sandrock : Well, we\u2019ve been fairly optimistic \u2013 I\u2019ve been fairly optimistic for quite sometime, and with every passing day, as we look at the open label of the data from the Phase 1 studies, my optimism remains. And but I still think that we\u2019re going to need data from the Phase 3 program. I mean, these are the definitive controlled clinical trials, and I would not want to raise any expectations that we could do anything without looking at that data. Paul Clancy : And then, Eric, this is Paul, just to kind of, the other part of your question was commercial preparedness. We would characterize this, as I mentioned that, this would be at risk commercial prelaunch activity, and it\u2019s a specialty market. So I think it\u2019s in a manageable amount of money, but we would likely look towards doing that sometime in 2016. Operator : The next question is from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Terence Flynn : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just two from me. Paul, you gave us some of the drivers for next year spend and recognized you don\u2019t want to give guidance at this point, because you\u2019re in the midst of planning. But net-net, as you think about just OpEx, can you comment directionally if we should think about it up or down versus this year? And then the second question I had relates to ocrelizumab, now that we\u2019ve seen the full Phase 3 data. Al, just wondering if you can frame for us, how you think about this as a competitive threat to either TECFIDERA and/or TYSABRI? Thanks. George Scangos : Yes, Terence, it\u2019s hard for me, I think, we\u2019re obviously right in the middle of planning. So we did want to provide some context, given we\u2019ve got all these moving pieces coming out of the restructuring right now. But I think it goes back to it likely is operating expenses that are up. It is likely a very manageable number up. I don\u2019t want to give a specific number until we really get kind of to the end of year call and the 2016 guidance call. But the restructuring provides real benefits in the magnitude what we announced today of $250 million. We\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019re working now, that is very much about head count reduction in some of the program decisions. We\u2019re working now to \u2013 during our planning process to look at fees and services, what we call external expenses as well and put it under similar type of lens. And then we\u2019re very happy that we simultaneously on the flipside of all these great opportunities is the mid- and late-stage pipeline starts to mature. So I think we\u2019re attacking the efficiencies and working towards investing wisely towards driving sustainable growth for the future. And what we\u2019re trying to do is essentially make that all work as George had mentioned towards getting some earnings leverage as well. Alfred Sandrock : On ocrelizumab, first of all, I think, Roche did a very nice job of the Phase 3 program in both relapsing MS and PPMS. I do think, I believe it will if approved will be a major contribution from MS patients,, which is good. The \u2013 on the efficacy side, it did lineup with our expectations. It\u2019s pretty similar in many ways to what\u2019s already been shown in the Phase 2 program for not only ocrelizumab, but RITUXAN. And so it\u2019s in line with our expectations. As with any program, there\u2019s always some safety issues. And we\u2019ll see how the label shapes up in terms of the benefit risk, and then that will determine, how it relates to other products in the market. Operator : The next question is from Matt Roden with UBS. Your line is open. Matthew Roden : Great. Thanks very much for taking the question, and congrats on a nice bounce back quarter here. So one of the biggest questions I\u2019ve gotten in the last quarter or couple of months here has been industry-wide just on drug pricing and the contribution of pricing and volumes to growth. And obviously, this has been industry-wide, but you guys have been included as part of that discussion. So, George, or Paul, can you just add some perspective to this debate from your point of view, it seems like industry isn\u2019t really stepping up and telling their side of the story. And then more specifically, if you can comment on how you expect the net pricing environment to evolve in MS. How you see the relative contributions of pricing and volumes on a forward-looking business? Thanks. George Scangos : Okay. This is George. I can take the first part of that question. Look, obviously, there has been a lot of rhetoric about drug pricing recently, part of that is the presidential campaign. I don\u2019t expect that rhetoric to go away anytime soon. I think the industry is preparing a thoughtful presentation of a different perspective on drug prices, and the value that we bring to patients [indiscernible]. And \u2013 look, I mean, that\u2019s what everybody says, but it\u2019s true. In the end, things are going to be priced according to the value that they bring to patients. And if I \u2013 we \u2013 I believe that if we bring forward innovative drugs that make a difference in the lives of patients that those will continue to get attractive pricing. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re working on the kinds of drugs that we\u2019re working aducanumab and SMNRx and LINGO for MS. Those potentially can make a magnitude of difference that will continue to justify good reimbursement even in a tough pricing environment. So I think that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it generally. In terms of gross to net, I\u2019ll let Paul take that part of the question. Paul Clancy : Yes, I mean, hi, Matt, I think, we don\u2019t have too many different comments than we\u2019ve had in the past in terms of the near-term dynamics. We obviously we\u2019ve talked about how United States and Europe dynamics are slightly different. We see a similar dynamics, as we have in the past, and we\u2019ll continue to be very, very thoughtful on what is a critical judgment. Operator : The next question is from Cory Kasimov, JPMorgan. Your line is open. Cory Kasimov : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. George, you mentioned in your scripted comments that you continue to actively look for late-stage or commercial assets. So when thinking about business development in the context of your existing commercial franchising and clinical pipeline, what do you consider the sweet spot in terms of the size of potential deals? And does the restructuring you announced today in anyway impact your willingness to engage in the M&A? Thanks. George Scangos : Sure. Look, we are constantly looking for interesting opportunities that are consistent with our strategy that are in our areas of expertise. I would say there is no sweet spot, it\u2019s a question of value of what you get for what you pay. And we\u2019ve been financially disciplined in the past. I think, we brought in some attractive assets MT-1303 and Raxatrigine in the past several months. I think, those are very interesting compounds. We will continue to look for compounds like that that we believe are high-quality compounds with reasonable chances of success and making a difference on the marketplace that we can acquire at \u2013 also make sense for us. So we\u2019re looking at some small things, we\u2019re looking at some large things. And there\u2019s not so much question of the size, but as of making solid, strategic, medical, and financial decisions. Operator : The next question is from Brian Abraham with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brian Abraham : Hi. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Two questions for 1303 you talked about heart rate changes. Can you just talk about any other elements of the compounds profile that you found most attractive? And what you believe differentiates that drug from the other market and developments S1Ps with respect to sell activity in bio-distribution? And then secondly, what proportion of the use of TYSABRI and your other MS therapy today is in primary progressive MS? Thanks. George Scangos : On 1303, we were \u2013 first of all the \u2013 on the efficacy side, we felt that the efficacy was similar to all the \u2013 to the other S1P1 modulators, and certainly when you look across the MS trials, and even when you look across, say, psoriasis. The most attractive thing was the fact that Mitsubishi Tanabe with their expertise figured out a way to \u2013 it\u2019s not simply taking out the S1P3 activity, because a lot of people have done that. But there are other characteristics of the molecule that needed to have a \u2013 we think an interesting effect on the heart rate, which we believe is one of the key issues associated with first dose administration. And so it was that, that was attractive. On TYSABRI, I don\u2019t think TYSABRI is used very much in PPMS. In fact, there are no effective therapies for PPMS. And I think I\u2019m pretty \u2013 I don\u2019t think that any of the immunomodulatory therapies are used very much at all and PPMS is my understanding. Operator : The next question is from Chris Raymond with Raymond James. Your line is open. Christopher Raymond : Thanks, guys. I just have a couple of quick questions here. First on TECFIDERA, thanks for quantifying that inventory impact. But I\u2019m just kind of curious, you guys had a mid-quarter price increase oftentimes that\u2019s \u2013 that can be seen as a driver for wholesaler inventory moves. Can you just clarify maybe some of the drivers for the inventory increase? And then on BAN2401, besides identifying a dose, can you talk a little bit about what kind of \u2013 what success might look like here, I know this trial could be as few as 350 patients, but as many as 800, I believe. And so, there\u2019s a lot of sort of differences with this trial, you\u2019ve got a different sort of cognition endpoints et cetera. I guess, just basically talk about how we should be success with that? Thanks. Alfred Sandrock : Chris, I\u2019ll start with the TECFIDERA inventory question and whether or not, it was driven by pricing, we don\u2019t believe so. Our best understanding is actually the driver of the increase on inventory in the specialty channels was more driven by some government purchases, that really actually potentially relate to fiscal year for certain government institutions. So that wasn\u2019t \u2013 as I noted, it wasn\u2019t a lot $10 million or $15 million, so that\u2019s our best understanding at this point. George Scangos : On BAN, I think, there\u2019ll be several endpoints. One is that there\u2019ll be \u2013 we\u2019ll be looking at amyloid plaque load \u2013 amyloid plaque burden, which I think is important. And there is an examination of cognition using a composite endpoint, which includes things like the CDR sum-of-boxes. And the number, my understanding of the interim analysis or these analysis is based on a number of patients randomized. And so \u2013 but, again, I think, any detailed questions on that, I would rather that you ask [indiscernible] Operator : The next question is from Joseph Schwartz with Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Joseph Schwartz : Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could talk a little more about aducanumab and particular, it seems like you\u2019re shifting your strategy by targeting even more mild patients, or earlier-stage patients in Phase 3. How should we think about this in terms of the enrollment rate and probability of success in the market opportunity? And are you building in a interim analysis here? Thanks very much. Alfred Sandrock : Yes. Well, we are targeting prodromal and the milder sort of segment of the mild populations based on an EDSS, I mean, sorry, MMSE cut off. And that\u2019s because our belief is that the drug \u2013 these drugs will work better in the earlier stages of the disease. And in terms of enrollment, we\u2019re pretty encouraged by what we see in early days. There\u2019s a lot of excitement about our drug, and our enrollment line rates are in line or slightly ahead of what we anticipated. So far it\u2019s still early days on the enrollment, and there\u2019s a lot of competition for similar types of patients, nevertheless, we\u2019re encouraged by what we see and\u2026 George Scangos : And baked on accrual? Alfred Sandrock : Well, I just, yes, I think I answered the phone question. Operator : The next question is from Brian Skorney with Robert Baird. Your line is open. Brian Skorney : Hi, guys thanks, for taking my question. I guess I was just wondering if you could provide any commentary on in the U.S. MS market. How are you seeing any impact of generic CapEx on October. Are we seeing this primarily impacting the brand right now, or do you think there\u2019s been any impact on your MS franchise. And just real quick on ocrelizumab. Could you just recall that the thresholds on the economics, that you\u2019re getting from Roche on worldwide sales of this program. Thanks. Paul Clancy : Brian, thanks for the question, it\u2019s Paul. Let me try to take both those in the \u2013 with respect it\u2019s relatively early I think we could say the same thing on the last call, so it\u2019s 90 days more than, it was relatively early last call. But we\u2019re seeing mostly exactly as you had alluded to the impact of a generic comp on comp. So and we\u2019re certainly keeping a very watchful eye on that. Ocrelizumab economics to us are 13.5% to 24% royalty rate it\u2019s a tiered royalty rate on net effectively net sales was a formula for it. We act interesting, we also, which I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve shared in the past we gave 3% royalty on ex-US sales, as well. So as Al, had alluded too in his prepared remarks, and we\u2019ve got a business interest in this. There could be impact on our existing therapies, but we do see this as very interesting financial interest, and certainly in primary progressive MS where there is a tremendous unmet need. There is a real opportunity as well a financial opportunity for us as well. Operator : The next question is from Tom Shrader with Stifel. Your line is open. Thomas Shrader : Good morning, you didn\u2019t actually answer the interim look question for aducanumab. But I\u2019m a little curious, if this gigantic trial going on with to looks at other drugs. So how do you think about that? George Scangos : I knew there was a second part of that question. I think we missed the market opportunity as well. So I \u2013 we I don\u2019t think it\u2019s great practice to be talking about interim looks and we\u2019re not really planning on anything like that for aducanumab, I think we have a robustly designed trial it\u2019s at the right duration. And so we\u2019ll go right to the end. Operator : The next question is for Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Michael Yee : Thanks, for the question. On commercial question for Paul, on TECFIDERA you had suggested I guess in the last call, that you really thought things were going to be flattish, I didn\u2019t really sort of hear certainly that tone here and thought a bunch of positive things, but maybe like it start to creep up on the volume side.  So two-part question one is are you seeing volumes creep up a little bit just trying to understand what\u2019s going on near-term and as to the end of the year. And then second part on one rebating the managed care you mentioned increases in rebating, so just maybe explain a little about what\u2019s going on there as it relates to TECFIDERA volumes and net price. Thanks. Alfred Sandrock : Yes, no thanks, thanks Michael, it\u2019s actually helpful the point of clarification. So we actually are to a large extent what we outlined in the middle of year is, that we\u2019re aspiring for much more. But we outlined on relatively flat patient demand in the United States, that is actually what we witnessed in Q3. We definitely saw continued solid growth in a number of the launch countries in Europe, U.K., Spain, Italy they\u2019ve had very, very good performance. But I\u2019d characterize that that is a launch countries, I think we still absolutely aspire towards much better performance in the United States, there continues to be a lot of big homework in. But until we see that result turnaround we won\u2019t really incorporated in our near-term financial outlook. The action plans, that we have under it is absolutely a priority number one, number in terms of our commercial efforts the action plans we have underway include DTC activity they include enhanced patient support around tolerability, and working that. We\u2019re focused hard on in our own patient services when working with SBP\u2019s of getting patients on therapy, that what we call cycle time. And we\u2019re certainly very focused on increasing sales for details across the world, but certainly in the United States. So we aspire towards, but we haven\u2019t yet actually seen it as George, had noted in his remarks as well. Operator : The next question is from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is open. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital : Hi, guys, thanks for taking the follow-up. I guess there\u2019s question for Paul. In the past you guys have given parameters around the level of the old licensing activity. Just want to kind of get a sense, I\u2019m assuming that tuck-in probably means in line with what you guys have done in the past and want to get that perspective from you. And then maybe how you would prioritize capital allocation with the stock where it is now versus buybacks with the stock where it is today versus deal activity. Thanks. Paul Clancy : Yes, it\u2019s a yes it\u2019s a tough question I mean look I think we\u2019re going to try to have our P&L in a way set up, that we can not have internal friction to do the classic tuck-in type deals that\u2019s how we\u2019ve done it over the last couple of years within. At this point for the fourth quarter it\u2019s essentially the Mitsubishi Tanabe expense, that we expect assuming HSR Clarence. We\u2019ll try to allow ourselves that the normal type as we go into 2016. In terms of capital allocation, we certainly don\u2019t want to be opaque, but I think this is in the category of it depends. We definitely aim towards all of our decisions on capital allocations is about driving intrinsic value, shareholder value creation. So when we see great opportunities in terms of doing that for returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases we\u2019ll execute against that, we\u2019ve certainly shown that action over the last 60 days. And as George had mentioned, we feel we have an absolute obligation to build the business in a financial disciplined ways with larger deployments, if we can achieve that. George Scangos : Yes, and this is George. Look, if you look out into next year, we\u2019ll have four compounds in Phase 3, that\u2019s not four Phase 3 trial it\u2019s more than four trials, but it\u2019s for Phase 3 programs. And we\u2019re hopeful if LINGO has data next year that justify moving that forward that will be a fit and we certainly want to leave capacity to move LINGO forward through the Phase 2 data justifying doing so. So I think anything that we would look to in-license that would go immediately into Phase 3, we\u2019d have to cross a pretty high hurdle right. We will, but we\u2019re continuing to look for compounds at all stages I think and at this point with particular emphasis on their earlier pipeline. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. We will turn the call back over to our presenters. A - Alfred Sandrock : Okay. Well, that was a lot to digest. Thank you all for your attention today, we have a lot going on here. And we\u2019ll keep you posted as we go forward. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Nick Abbott - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Operator : Good morning. My name is Dan, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen fourth quarter and year-end 2015 financial results and business update. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Matt Calistri, Senior Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Matthew Calistri - Senior Director of Investor Relations : Thank you, and welcome to Biogen's fourth quarter and full-year 2015 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of Biogen.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. George Scangos; Dr. Al Sandrock, our Chief Medical Officer; and our CFO, Paul Clancy. Now I'll turn the call over to George. George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. In 2015 Biogen generated revenues of $10.8 billion, an 11% increase over 2014, and non-GAAP EPS of $17.01, a 23% increase over 2014. Although the revenues were less than we'd anticipated at the beginning of last year, I'm pleased that we were able to take appropriate action in the second half of the year to maintain healthy earnings growth while we continue to advance the potentially transformative therapies in our pipeline. TECFIDERA's demand has been stable in the U.S., and combined with growth in Europe we expect TECFIDERA to continue to drive our global leadership in multiple sclerosis. TECFIDERA is now not only the most prescribed oral MS therapy worldwide; it is also the most prescribed of all MS therapies in Germany, France, and the U.K. Overall, more than 170,000 patients have been treated with TECFIDERA. Our hemophilia products, ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX, generated over $0.5 billion of revenue in their first full year on the market in the U.S. In November, the European Commission approved ELOCTA for the treatment of hemophilia A in the EU, which we believe will help to contribute growth in hemophilia this year as our collaboration partner Sobi commercializes ELOCTA in additional markets. We also made progress in business development. We acquired Convergence Pharmaceuticals and raxatrigine, their lead compound. Raxatrigine is an oral small-molecule Nav1.7 blocker with promising Phase 2 data that will move into Phase 3 this year. We licensed amiselimod, or MT-1303, from Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, a late-stage S1P1 inhibitor for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. We entered into a collaboration agreement with AGTC to develop gene-based therapies for multiple ophthalmic diseases. And this month BENEPALI was approved in the EU. BENEPALI, the first etanercept biosimilar approved in the EU, is the first of three potential anti-TNFs to advance under our Samsung Bioepis joint venture with Samsung Biologics. Under our agreements with Samsung Bioepis, we will manufacture and commercialize BENEPALI in the EU. Meanwhile, we continued investing in 2015. We purchased land in Solothurn, Switzerland, and this Friday, January 29, will break ground on an advanced, next-generation Biologics manufacturing facility there. And we purchased Eisai's drug product manufacturing facility and supporting infrastructure in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. We also took actions to return capital and change the capital structure of the business. We fully implemented our $5 billion share-repurchase program, and a portion of that repurchase was funded through the $6 billion debt offering that we completed in September. In R&D, we moved forward several exciting mid- and late-stage assets in our pipeline. It may seem like a long time ago now, but it was Q1 2015 that we presented the aducanumab data showing a statistically significant removal of plaque and slowing of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's patients. We presented data suggesting that our anti-LINGO antibody is biologically active in remyelination. And the Phase 2 data for nusinersen generated by our partner Ionis, looks increasingly encouraging as a potential therapy for spinal muscular atrophy. We also initiated Phase 1 trials in ALS and Parkinson's disease. Al will discuss the many advances we made in our pipeline in more detail, but I think this progress is a testament to our commitment to patients and our world-class capabilities across the breadth of R&D. We also continued to strengthen our early-stage clinical and research capabilities. We bolstered research talent in our neuroscience group and established collaborations with first-rate academic centers around the world. As a result, I believe we're now in a better position than ever to both discover novel therapies and accelerate drug development while minimizing risk. Lastly, summarizing 2015 would not be complete without commenting on the restructuring we implemented in October. Although it was a difficult decision, we've already seen positive results from the steps that we took. With the majority of the restructuring now completed, there's a palpable reinvigorated focus on our key commercial initiatives and high-potential pipeline candidates, and our operating expenses are trending at a rate that we believe can continue to provide healthy earnings leverage going forward. So all in all it was a busy and eventful year, and we believe that the progress we made and actions we took positioned us well for a potentially transformative 2016 and beyond. And with that, I'll pass the call along to Al for an update on R&D. Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer : Thanks, George. 2015 was a productive year for the R&D organization. We advanced the next wave of potential medicines through the pipeline, added important assets through business department and acquisitions, and expanded our research leadership by hiring world-class scientists. I believe our pipeline and our organization are stronger than they have ever been. Starting with Alzheimer's disease, last year we presented compelling interim Phase 1b data for aducanumab, the first investigational drug for Alzheimer's disease to demonstrate both a significantly reduction of amyloid plaque, as well as slowing of cognitive decline. In August, we began enrolling patients into two pivotal Phase 3 trials of aducanumab in early Alzheimer's disease. We are pleased with the progress of these studies but recognize the inherent challenges in recruiting patients with early Alzheimer's disease and the limited availability of PET scanners. Fortunately, owing to the strong results from our clinical trials to date, there has been substantial interest in the program, which we believe has helped with recruitment. That said, we continue to anticipate that the Phase 3 enrollment duration will be similar to other large clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease. Looking ahead, in the second half of 2016, we expect to share additional safety data from the ongoing titration arms of the Phase 1b PRIME study for aducanumab. Our other two midstage clinical candidates for AD that are partnered with Eisai continue to advance. Eisai has indicated that they anticipate releasing interim safety data this year for E2609, a small-molecule BACE1 inhibitor, and we're also expecting to see top-line efficacy and safety data for BAN2401, a monoclonal antibody targeting beta amyloid. Moving to anti-LINGO, you may recall that last year we presented Phase 2 data in acute optic neuritis. To our knowledge, this was the first clinical trial to show evidence of remyelination following an acute inflammatory demyelinating injury in humans, and we believe that these results support our ongoing development efforts. Our Phase 2 SYNERGY study in MS is a 418-patient double-blind multicenter study assessing four doses of anti-LINGO versus placebo when added to interferon beta therapy. It utilizes a composite endpoint comprising outcome measures of disability, cognition, and physical function. We believe that a separation from placebo on any of these measures could be clinically meaningful. We're also looking at imaging endpoints that reflect the integrity of myelinated nerve fibers. Any differences in treatment effect between pre-existing and newly acquired lesions will also be of interest. We believe that the robust design of this clinical trial will enable a better understanding of the therapy's potential in MS. And if the results are positive, the trial should provide valuable insight into the design of our Phase 3 program. Results for SYNERGY are anticipated in mid-2016. Now turning to nusinersen. Our partner Ionis recently completed target enrollment of the Phase 3 CHERISH study in children with childhood-onset SMA. And by the first half of this year, we hope to complete enrollment in ENDEAR, the Phase 3 study evaluating nusinersen in infants with infantile-onset SMA. This progress sets the stage for data from both of these trials to be available in the first half of 2017. Whereas the data from the early-stage open-label clinical trials are encouraging when compared to data from natural history studies, the well-controlled Phase 3 studies are designed to definitively assess the safety and efficacy of nusinersen. We are meeting frequently with regulators from Europe, Japan, and the United States with the goal of making the drug available to SMA patients as rapidly as possible. Moving on to our hemophilia therapies, last month at the 57th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting, we presented new data demonstrating that ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX effectively managed bleeding into joints and maintained low annualized bleeding rates in people with severe hemophilia A and B, reaffirming the benefits of these two therapies. In addition, teams from the University of Pittsburgh, the Hemophilia Center of Western Pennsylvania, and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center presented data showing that immune tolerance induction using ELOCTATE was successful in three children with inhibitors, including a child previously failing recombinant factor VIII immune tolerance induction. The time to achieving tolerance in the study was four to 12 weeks, which appears to be significantly shorter than with the standard of practice, which can take several months to several years. During the quarter we, in collaboration with Ionis, also announced the initiation of a Phase 1/2 clinical study of an antisense drug against superoxide dismutase, or SOD1, in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. I am pleased to announce that last week we dosed our first patient in the trial. Mutations in the SOD1 gene result in the second most common form of familial ALS, affecting approximately 2% of all ALS patients. We also continued to make excellent progress toward initiating multiple late-stage clinical trials in 2016. Next month we anticipate sharing additional Phase 2 study results for TYSABRI in acute ischemic stroke at the International Stroke Conference in Los Angeles. While a single dose of natalizumab administered up to nine hours after stroke onset did not reduce focal infarct volume, treatment was associated with meaningful improvements in clinical outcomes over the course of 90 days. The clinical profile and treatment window supports further investigation of natalizumab as a potential novel approach for treating acute ischemic stroke, and we intend to conduct a Phase 2b trial. Amiselimod, or MT-1303, an S1P1 inhibitor for inflammatory bowel disease, is anticipated to advance to Phase 3 trials this year. In the second half of the year, we plan to initiate Phase 3 studies for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. We currently have no plans for the asset in MS but expect to continue to evaluate other options for the molecule in collaboration with our partner Mitsubishi Tanabe. Raxatrigine, a small-molecule inhibitor of the Nav1.7 sodium channel, is in development for several pain indications. In the second half of the year, we anticipate initiating a Phase 3 trial to confirm the efficacy of raxatrigine in patients with trigeminal neuralgia. We also plan to initiate a Phase 2 trial in patients with sciatica later this year. I'll now pass the call over to Paul. Paul J. Clancy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Al. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.77 in the fourth quarter and $15.34 for the full year. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.50 in the fourth quarter and $17.01 for the full year. Total revenue for Q4 grew 8% year over year to approximately $2.8 billion and grew 11% for the full year to $10.8 billion. Foreign exchange, offset by hedging, weakened fourth quarter revenue by approximately $35 million versus prior year and by approximately $227 million for the full year versus prior year. Global Q4 TECFIDERA revenue was $993 million. We recorded revenues of $785 million in the U.S. and $208 million outside the U.S. TECFIDERA U.S. revenue benefited from an increase in wholesaler inventory by approximately $30 million versus prior quarter. At this point, we believe TECFIDERA's safety perceptions and physician intent to prescribe have largely stabilized in the U.S. We're seeing positive leading indicators for the recently launched marketing campaign for TECFIDERA, including increased visits to our website and higher call volume into our patient services organization. In Europe TECFIDERA continued its trend of solid patient growth this quarter, especially in more recently launched markets such as the U.K., Italy, and Spain. The European label for TECFIDERA was updated in December, and we're actively educating physicians on appropriate patient monitoring. For the full year, worldwide TECFIDERA revenues were $3.6 billion, consisting of $2.9 billion in the U.S. and $730 million in sales outside the U.S. Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened full-year TECFIDERA revenue by approximately $27 million versus prior year. Interferon revenues including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY were $740 million during the fourth quarter, which includes $506 million in the U.S. and $233 million in sales outside the U.S. For the full year, worldwide interferon revenues were $3 billion, consisting of $2 billion in the U.S. and $951 million in sales outside the U.S. Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened full-year interferon revenues by approximately $88 million versus prior year. TYSABRI continued to add patients this quarter, with worldwide revenues of $481 million. These results were comprised of $278 million in the U.S. and $203 million internationally. For the full year, worldwide TYSABRI revenues were approximately $1.9 billion. We recorded U.S. revenue of $1.1 billion and $783 million internationally. Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened full-year revenue for TYSABRI by approximately $90 million versus prior year. Physicians continue to choose TYSABRI for patients requiring high efficacy, and nearly 10 years after approval we believe its well-understood safety profile positions TYSABRI well. Turning to hemophilia business, ELOCTATE revenue for the quarter was $101 million and $320 million for the full year. ALPROLIX revenue in Q4 was $71 million and $234 million for the full year. Turning to our anti-CD20 unconsolidated joint business, which includes our profit share for RITUXAN and GAZYVA in the U.S., as well as our profit sharing royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. We recorded $334 million for Q4 and $1.3 billion for the full year. While there was a slight inventory drawdown for RITUXAN in the fourth quarter, we ended the year with a higher inventory level than we had anticipated. We also benefited from a $6 million payment from Roche in exchange for access to data supporting the development of ocrelizumab. Corporate partner revenues were $69 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $40 million in the prior quarter. The increase was related to contract manufacturing for Samsung Bioepis and another strategic partner. For the full year, corporate partner revenues were $189 million. During the quarter, we booked a total GAAP charge of approximately $93 million related to the restructuring announced in October. Now turning to the non-GAAP expense lines on the P&L. Q4 cost of goods sold were $332 million or 12% of revenue. For the full year, COGS were $1.2 billion or 12% of revenue. Q4 non-GAAP R&D expense was $542 million or 19% of revenue, which includes a $60 million payment to Mitsubishi Tanabe. For the full year, non-GAAP R&D expense was $2 billion or 19% of revenue. Q4 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $583 million or 21% of revenue. For the full year, non-GAAP SG&A expense was $2.1 billion or 20% of revenue. Other net expense was approximately $82 million in the fourth quarter, which includes $67 million in interest expense, primarily related to our recent bond offering. Full-year other net expense was $124 million, including approximately $96 million in interest expense. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 23% for the fourth quarter, as we benefited from the reinstated R&D tax credit. Our full-year tax rate was approximately 24%. During the year, we repurchased approximately 16.8 million shares of our common stock, completing our previously authorized $5 billion share repurchase program. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 221 million for Q4, 231 million for the full year, and we ended the year with approximately 219 million basic shares outstanding. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $4.50 for the fourth quarter and $17.01 for the full year, representing a 23% increase for the full year. We ended the year with approximately $6.2 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 40/60 between the U.S. and ex-U.S. So overall, we had a strong quarter benefiting from favorable inventory dynamics for TECFIDERA, stronger-than-anticipated contract manufacturing in RITUXAN revenue, and the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. Let me turn to our full-year 2016 guidance. We expect revenues of approximately $11.1 billion to $11.3 billion. Starting with multiple sclerosis. Our plan assumes relatively stable demand for TECFIDERA in 2016 in the United States. While we're hopeful our recently launched marketing campaign can reaccelerate growth, we remain cautious, as we believe we will not ascertain the impact until the second quarter of this year. In Europe, we anticipate constant pricing for the rest of the year and continued patient growth, particularly in recently launched markets. For TYSABRI, we believe the therapy will remain on a stable trajectory. We believe the number of patients using AVONEX and PLEGRIDY combined will continue to decline as patients move toward orals, though we remain well-positioned within this segment of the market. Our financial guidance assumes no U.S. price increases for AVONEX, PLEGRIDY, and TECFIDERA for the remainder of the year. With respect to foreign exchange, our plan is based on the current spot rates. Of note, we had an approximately $170 million in hedge gains in 2015. Given our hedges are usually placed 12 months forward, we expect limited hedge gains in 2016, so the year-over-year comparison is less favorable. Moving to our hemophilia therapies. We anticipate continued growth with ELOCTATE, as we believe there remains a significant portion of the patient population that can benefit from long-acting therapies. We're assuming moderating patient adds for ALPROLIX, given the rapid uptake and penetration so far. In 2016 we're assuming our profit share for RITUXAN and GAZYVA will decrease to 39% from 40% upon FDA approval of GAZYVA in RITUXAN-refectory indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Our plan assumes ocrelizumab will launch in 2017. Moving to an expense perspective, we anticipate slight upward pressure on cost of goods sold rate, largely due to increases in contract manufacturing, biosimilars, and increased hemophilia royalties. We anticipate R&D expense between 19% and 20% of sales, which includes approximately $100 million earmarked for business development activity. We plan to invest in a number of R&D programs across our late-stage pipeline, including aducanumab, nusinersen, raxatrigine, and amiselimod for inflammatory bowel disease. SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 17% to 18% of revenue. The head count reduction and restructuring announced in October is expected to benefit operating expenses by approximately $250 million. We've also planned to reduce targeted fees and services expenses, which are largely reflected in SG&A. From a tax perspective, we anticipate upward pressure on our 2016 tax rate, as our profitability mix shifts toward the U.S. We anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results between $18.30 and $18.60 and GAAP EPS to be between $16.85 and $17.15. Our plan assumes share stabilization with a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 219 million. From a cash perspective, we expect to pay $1.2 billion in CVR payments to Fumapharm in 2016 related to the sales of TECFIDERA, and we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $800 million to $850 million, an increase over 2015, primarily driven by the investment in the Swiss manufacturing plants. So the business plan is designed to provide investment to support TECFIDERA, surgically look to control spending, and ensure we're utterly focused on investing in and progressing the pipeline. I'll turn the call over to George. George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer : Okay, thank you, Paul. Clearly the commercial trajectory of TECFIDERA was not what we thought it would be at the beginning of last year, and as a result our revenues fell short of our initial projections. While obviously not happy with that, I'm very pleased with the way the company responded. We put additional marketing muscle behind TECFIDERA, we reduced costs and focused the company, and we accelerated our stock repurchase program. As a result, we maintained healthy earnings growth at the same time as we continued our investments in aducanumab, LINGO, and the other exciting programs in our pipeline. We also continued to invest in additions to our pipeline. We acquired Convergence and its lead compound raxatrigine; we licensed amiselimod from Mitsubishi Tanabe; we completed the gene therapy relationship with AGTC; and we brought additional compounds into the clinic from our own and our partners' research efforts. Our commercial portfolio continued to expand globally, as we extended our position as the worldwide leader in multiple sclerosis and significantly grew our hemophilia business. In 2016, we plan to remain focused on commercial execution and advancing our pipeline, which we expect to be the primary source of value creation over the long term. We're looking forward to many updates over the next year, including insight into the potential impact of TECFIDERA's recently launched marketing campaign by the second quarter; Phase 2 top line results for anti-LINGO in MS in the middle of the year; Phase 2 data for BAN2401 and E2609; continued Phase 2 data for nusinersen from Ionis, followed by Phase 3 data next year; and Phase 1b titration data for aducanumab in the second half of the year. We expect to launch up to three compounds this year : BENEPALI in Europe following approval from the European Commission earlier this month, ZINBRYTA pending approval in the first half of the year, and potentially an infliximab biosimilar also in Europe. Thinking even further ahead, we believe that we're entering the early years of a potentially transformative era in neurogeneration drug discovery and development, and we believe that our commitment to research has the potential to yield results that are truly meaningful for patients and shareholders. As I said at the recent JPMorgan conference, I believe that our pipeline and our approach, which has the risk inherent in all truly innovative and groundbreaking approaches, is measured and thoughtful. The combination of a much better understanding of disease biology, the focus on genetically validated targets, the use of biomarkers to learn early whether or not our compounds are having the desired biological effects, and the adoption of multiple therapeutic modalities may meaningful increase success rates and identify those projects likely to fail early in the process, before large amounts of time and money are spent. Our strategy is evident in the design of the aducanumab Phase 1b trial, the Phase 2 study of nusinersen, the Phase 2 studies of anti-LINGO, and our recently initiated Phase 1 trial for SOD1 ALS. We have additional examples, some of which we'll talk about as the year goes on. In closing, and as always, I'd like to thank our employees, who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patients' lives, and also the patients and physicians who were involved in our clinical development programs. The achievements we made together could not have been realized without their passion and commitment. So thank you all for joining us this morning, and the operator will now open up the call for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Your line is open. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just have a couple of quick ones, one on the commercial side. I know it's early days, but are there any initial metrics on the TEC DTC campaign when you look at things like new starts or returning patients? And then the second one is on the pipeline. When you look at the ENGAGE and EMERGE studies, Al, are there lessons to be learned from Lilly in terms of managing PET scan facilities? And what do you think identification of early-stage Alzheimer's patients means to the market opportunity? Thank you. George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Geoff. Let me start with the TEC DTC question. I guess I'd reinforce what we said in our prepared remarks around, that really to try to discern it we're going to be looking kind of in Q2 time period. I mean, clearly Q2's not a light switch to determine that. We're seeing early data with respect to, as I had mentioned, kind of hits to the website, conversations into our patient services organization, which lean us to think that it's positive. We haven't seen a discernible, yet, change with respect to specifically your question, but our judgment is that this takes a little bit of time. It was really first week of October. Obviously script data as we come through the holiday time period, as everybody knows, gets a little bit noisy in Thanksgiving and December. So we are going to look really hard probably 60, 70, 90 days out from now. Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer : Hi, Geoff. This is Al. Well, we have learned a lot from our predecessors, including Lilly and others, and we are employing actually pretty innovative ways of finding where the patients are and where the sites are, and which includes where the PET scans are, because the scanners have to be pretty close to where the ligands are made, and of course the patients have to get there. The other thing we're doing is to screen patients before they need PET scans by using a neuropsychological test battery to make sure that by the time they get to the PET scanner, there's a high likelihood they'll actually have amyloid. And then in terms of early AD, what we mean by early AD are prodromal and the earlier stages of mild Alzheimer's. And in terms of what it means for the marketplace, I do believe that there's going to be a change ultimately in the way the patients are diagnosed early. Perhaps, and certainly before there are functional deficits, but when they have mild cognitive impairment, I believe the healthcare system will set up ways of identifying those patients who need treatment early. And we're working on many of those, too, along with many colleagues outside who are also thinking about the same thing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC: Maybe another one for Al. It looks like you're going to be faced with a couple of go/no-go decisions on Phase 3 programs in 2016. I'm thinking specifically for LINGO and for the BACE compound E2609. I'm just kind of wondering what kind of hurdle you've set for yourselves in terms of going forward. And maybe you could also further justify, if the hurdle is going to be kind of the low-end hurdle \u2013 I sense that's what you've been signaling to investors \u2013 why it makes sense to move forward with two fairly risky programs of lowish-end hurdle. Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer : Well, I wouldn't say that the hurdle's very low. I think what I'm trying to say with LINGO is that this is a Phase 2 trial, and it's pretty novel territory we're on, where not too many people have looked at repair strategies for any neurologic disease, including MS. So I would say that we're going to look at the totality of the data. We're going to combine the clinical outcome measures along with the imaging outcome measures, learn as much as we can, and really decide, does the program deserve a continued investment? And if so, can we go to Phase 3? Are we ready to go to Phase 3? Because in Phase 3, we're going to have to employ outcome measures that everybody agrees \u2013 including regulators, obviously, but also the MS community \u2013 everybody agrees will provide answers on whether or not the treatment effect is clinically meaningful. And in the case of the BACE inhibitor, the main thing we're going to be looking at is safety, and I don't think it's uncommon \u2013 in fact, I think all of our competitors have gone from early-stage safety data right to large registrational trials, and I think there are good reasons for that. We are confident in the pharmacodynamic effect that we see, in that when we look at A beta 42 levels and CSF, we get nice, very strong dose-dependent decreases in A beta 42. So we're not going \u2013 I mean, as George said, we want to manage the risk by making sure we have the desired biological effect, and we're pretty confident already that we have that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from Jefferies. Your line is open. Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Two quick ones. On TYSABRI, it looks like you're seeing stabilization. Wondering if you could talk a little bit about the dynamics you're seeing there amongst patients since the SPMS data was reported? And then for Paul, just curious \u2013 you earmarked about $100 million for BD next year \u2013 how the sector pullback amongst the smaller biotechs might influence your capital allocation strategy this year. Thanks. Paul J. Clancy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, why don't \u2013 I'll try to take the TYSABRI one as well, but Al can chime in here. Thanks, Brian, for the question. Yeah, we did not see a discernible change kind of coming out of the SPMS readout. It may be early; it may not. I think that was to some extent our thesis as well. Patients that are doing very, very well and have an individual experience with TYSABRI that's generally quite positive. With respect to the earmarking for $100 million, it's \u2013 we always debate this internally. Should it be more than that? Should it be less? Should we trade it off against R&D dollars? All that type of stuff. But we try to earmark some level of money that obviously is expense money, which has been \u2013 we've been a little bit biased that way, with the earlier stage biotechs over the last number of years have had opportunities, right? The IPO window has been open. It's been very open for them to continue on. There's a potential that with the change in the biotech sector, that as we've looked at corporate development, business development type deals, clearly one of the last hurdles to get through is financial valuation. There's a change that that dynamic is changing in favor for us. George will maybe add some comments as well. George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Look, if you're in a smaller biotech company, and it's pre-commercial, and you have to raise revenue, there are only a couple of ways to do that. And as it gets more difficult and less attractive to raise money from the financial markets, obviously other alternatives become more attractive. And we hope that and we believe that will all move in the favor of companies like us who are out to in-license or acquire additional compounds. So we'll see. It takes a while for that to happen. We'll take the current views of the market to hold for a while or deteriorate further. If that happens, then I believe there'll be interesting opportunities for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Hey, guys. Hey, Paul, Al, George. Thanks for all the transparency after the guidance lowering last year and on the call today. Really appreciate it. I think the Street does, too. Just a couple questions since everyone's breaking the one question rule. George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer : I think you started that trend, Mark. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : No, well, I'm like the fifth question. Everyone's asked two. So it's not me. I'm a good boy. On TECFIDERA, Paul, I remember last year \u2013 I know you're not providing TECFIDERA guidance for 2016, but I think last year you gave some color on your expectations. I'd be curious to know if you'd be willing to do that this year. And specifically what are you expecting for price and volume in 2016 in the U.S.? Should we be modeling any price, any volume? And then on LINGO, Al, this has come up in prior questions, but just to push you a little bit, when you say separation, should we think of that as common-sense separation on the clinical endpoints would be clinically relevant? Or in that we don't necessarily need statistically a T-value of under 0.05 when you're analyzing the data in order to make a go decision into Phase 3? Thanks a lot. Paul J. Clancy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Mark, this is Paul. The only additional \u2013 I really don't want to provide anything additional, no comments further. Just \u2013 but reinforce what I did say in the prepared remarks. On TECFIDERA, our plan assumes stable demand for TEC in the United States, right? We're looking and aspiring for more, but that's what the plan assumes. And that's really what we've seen for a number of quarters. On the U.S. pricing side, our financial guidance assumes no U.S. prices for TECFIDERA for the remainder of the year. Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer : On LINGO, Mark, we have a trial with about 80 patients per arm. And so it's not \u2013 it's a robust trial. But, yeah, I think we're more on the common-sense side, as you put it. We want to know \u2013 and we can look at separation in several ways. I mean, we can look for proportion of patients who are improving relative to placebo, and we can look at patients who are slowing \u2013 their progression has slowed. So we can look at both ways. And that's sort of what I mean by separation. But I think it's more on the common-sense side. And I tried to indicate that there's a lot of exploratory pieces to this trial, because \u2013 and some of these endpoints have really never been employed in any significant way in large trials. So that's what I was trying to say, Mark. George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer : I think, Mark \u2013 this is George. The decision on the LINGO trial will be whether or not we have a meaningful clinical impact on endpoints that the regulators would consider approvable endpoints in a Phase 3 trial. All right? And there are many endpoints that we're going to be looking at in the trial, and there could be some combination of them. So we're not going to have a low bar, but it is a Phase 2 exploratory study, and as we look at those endpoints, we'll make decisions. But I wouldn't characterize it as a low bar. I'd characterize it right now as a little bit of an undefined bar until we see the data. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks for the question. On SMNRx \u2013 and I refer to it as that because I can't pronounce your new name \u2013 could you just talk a little bit about some of the data you've seen so far? And how you're \u2013 some of your commentary has changed around that a little bit to the positive, which is fine, but I guess it always comes down to comparing historical literature, and there's a lot of different things out there. So, Al, can you maybe just talk a little bit about your confidence in the literature and the range of median survival there and what you think is going on here? You previously talked about weight gain, but I haven't really heard about that. So I guess maybe talk a little bit about that and what you're seeing, and I guess why versus historical literature you feel I guess a little bit better. Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer : Yeah. So the main data we're looking at is the Type 1 SMA, or the infantile onset. And, as you know, we're comparing it \u2013 we and with our partner Ionis \u2013 are comparing it to natural history. And those things are always tricky, because natural history \u2013 the care of patients change over time and stuff like that, and you have to sort of find matching patients, patients that are similar to the ones that you looked at in your open-label study. My confidence grows with every passing day because, as you know, these children are supposed to \u2013 their median survival is two years. And so we're at the point where many of these babies are getting to that point or going beyond it, and so I think that if they're surviving, our confidence grows. And also \u2013 we're also looking at whether or not they're gaining, whether they're making improvements. These children generally don't improve, and they're hitting motor milestones that are not commonly seen in the natural history. So we believe the data are looking promising, but there are caveats to comparison to natural history studies, and we have to be cautious, because everybody, including parents and the whole world, wants to see a cure for these babies. So our bias is certainly leaning toward wanting to see something, and we have to be cautious about that. So the Phase 3 trials are sham-controlled, they're blinded, and I think that's where we believe the definitive data will come from. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, and good morning, everybody. So I'm going to ask two. One on Alzheimer's \u2013 we've recently had a handful of physician feedback that there's a dearth of skilled readers for some of these endpoints in these studies. Can you just talk a little bit about what you're doing to make sure the readers are well-trained, especially given that a small change in the endpoints is likely to demonstrate the benefit of the drug? And then just on LINGO, can you remind us what our expectations should be? I remember in 2015 when you moved out the timelines, you said that a small internal group would be seeing some of the LINGO data ahead of sort of the full analysis, and they'd be planning for Phase 3. Should we expect if you decide to move ahead for Phase 3 you'll be able to talk about that pretty quickly when we see the data? Thanks. Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer : Yeah. Let me get the second question first. I want to be sure that the trial remains fully blinded. Nobody at Biogen has broken the blind and looked at the unblinded data. So that small team \u2013 there's no small team looking at any data. And in terms of the AD, there are \u2013 it is sort of an art to read PET scans. I don't know if that's what you're referring to, but the readers of these images have to be trained, and we actually employed a quality-control step in a blinded way, where we had somebody in Minnesota, an expert, reviewing every single scan. Moreover, in terms of the cognitive testing, the clinical outcome measures, the main thing we want is consistency over time, and we're doing a lot of the things that we actually do in MS, where we do a lot of training, we have examining neurologists, and we separate them from the neurologists that actually treat the patients for side effects and things. So I think we've employed sort of state-of-the-art methods for collecting these data and hopefully avoided many of the pitfalls. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond from Raymond James. Your line is open. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, thanks, guys. Just a couple of quick commercial questions. Paul, on TECFIDERA you guys called out the $30 million of inventory during the quarter, and I think Q3 saw $10 million to $15 million, if I recall correctly. So how should we think, I guess, about Q1? Are we talking about $40 million to $45 million that needs to be burned off, or is there some other dynamic there that we should be modeling? And then also on PLEGRIDY, just wondering if you could share any insights on, as the launch has progressed, any change specifically in the source of patients, either from AVONEX or other beta interferons? And I guess I ask this question because some of our checks seem to indicate there's been a shift where PLEGRIDY is taking patients now from other beta interferons versus more from AVONEX early on. I'm just kind of wondering if that's what you're seeing, too, or if there's something else going on there? Thanks. Paul J. Clancy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Chris, great questions. It's Paul. TECFIDERA, let me just kind of level-set and just clarify, because you're exactly on it. What we had noted in Q3 is that our estimate at the time was that there was about $10 million to $15 million of build in the SPP, in the specialty pharmacy part of the combined channel. And that was mostly what we believe related to a government purchase related to kind of their fiscal year timing. I think our belief is that that's largely burned through. On a quarter-to-quarter basis within specialty pharmacies, there is sometimes ebbs and flows on inventory levels, and we'll try to do our best to point that out, but we think it's at \u2013 and I would think that we may have things like what we had in Q3. But I think that's largely burned through. What we noted in Q4 is actually related to the wholesaler portion of the channel, and on a quarter-over-quarter basis, that there was a little bit of build. So I think as we move into Q1, we're really probably dealing with the $30 million to get to kind of on a sequential quarter basis. We always \u2013 just to complete the thought \u2013 we always deal with kind of Q4-to-Q1 dynamics that sometimes we don't have great visibility on, the so-called shoebox effect, the change in Q1 with respect to the patients on insurance, and which is related obviously to shoebox. So Q1 oftentimes, in gross to net changes, so discounts and allowances rate goes up in Q1 as well, for us as well as the industry. So we're always \u2013 be mindful of that. On PLEGRIDY, it's very interesting. Your checks are probably are consistent with what we're seeing as well. We saw early on, and to some extent it was our marketing strategy early on, was a conversion of AVONEX patients. And we hit some speed bumps along that early on in the launch in the last quarter of 2014 and going into early into 2015. We're starting to see both from what we're trying to do in our marketing strategy, but we're also starting to see the benefits of PLEGRIDY being seen as sourcing volumes from the other interferons. Look, this is a great product vis-\u00e0-vis kind of capturing our, and penetrating and capturing share within that interferon segment of the marketplace. Great question. Thanks, Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Cameron Bradshaw - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, this is Cameron filling in for Terence. Thanks for taking our question, and congrats on your approval of your ENBREL biosimilar in the EU. I was wondering, is there anything you can share regarding your pricing and commercialization strategy there? Thanks. George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer : Cameron, obviously we're in discussions country by country, but really can't share anything, so no comment on that. We'll try to as we begin to post revenues, to try to provide some commentary. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Roden from UBS. Your line is open. Matt M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking the question, and thanks for delivering a nice quarter and guidance here. I think as a sector we needed some good news. So I had kind of a specific on the BACE inhibitor E2609. The Phase 2 study is in 700 patients, but my understanding is that the data that we'll get on this year's disclosures is just on safety from the initial cohorts, not the whole 700 patients. So can you just clarify what we should expect to see from this disclosure this year and help us understand what exactly you'll be looking for and how this information would pertain to a go/no-go decision? And then lastly just when we'll get initial efficacy findings from this program. Thanks. Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer : Yeah, you're right, Matt, were going to look at the first cohort. And the original plan was that the first cohort would then trigger a second cohort. The main thing we're going to look at is the safety data from the first cohort and also to confirm the pharmacodynamic effect that we saw with our Phase 1 study. So it's really safety and repeat, or confirmation of pharmacodynamic effect in the CSF. Matt M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then does that pertain to any go/no-go decision? Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer : Yeah. Matt M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC : And then when should we expect to see initial efficacy? Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer : Well, with the number of patients in the first cohort, I have low expectations in terms of efficacy, and it will lead to a go/no-go decision to Phase 3. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from the Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe for Al, you mentioned that you should expect the enrollment, a full enrollment of aducanumab Phase 3 similar to the timeline of the other Phase 3 trial. Does that mean we should probably expect 18 to 24 months or potentially even longer for the enrollment be accrued? And then also secondly, I was curious your thought on TYSABRI, because ocrelizumab could be approved probably towards end of this year. We know that about 30% of the JCV-positive patients are all on TYSABRI \u2013 I mean, sorry, 30% of TYSABRI patients are JCV-positive. And then there's also a certain level of off-label use from PPMS and SPMS. So if you could provide some thought on that. Thank you. Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer : So in terms of enrollment, I don't want to hazard a guess as to exactly how long it's going to take to enroll patients. I think we're pleased with what we've seen so far, but it's early days. And right now our timelines are assuming the enrollment rate on a patients-per-site basis to what we've seen with other Phase 3 trials. And then in terms of ocrelizumab, it's great to have a new drug for patients, particularly for PPMS patients. I don't think there were a lot of PPMS patients who were on TYSABRI, if that's what you're asking. There probably are some people who have SPMS on TYSABRI, because our label says relapsing forms of MS, and patients with SPMS have relapses in their early stages of SPMS. So it would be on label to be on TYSABRI if you have relapsing SPMS. Now, ocrelizumab I don't think will have a label for SPMS, as far as I understand. I don't recall that they did a trial on SPMS, so I don't see how that would affect the SPMS piece very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good morning, guys, and thank you for taking the questions. I guess first for Paul, on capital allocation, now that you've finished the $5 billion share repurchase program, do you have plans to start another one? I'm just curious how we should be thinking about share count in 2016. And then also, Paul, in your comment with regard to price increases not being assumed in your 2016 guidance, can you just remind us how you've build that into past guidance in prior years? And is this a change that's simply the result of the current pricing environment and controversy? Thanks. Paul J. Clancy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. With respect to \u2013 let's kind of start on capital allocation and share repurchases. And you're right, we've exhausted the $5 billion share authorization that was authorized and approved by the board back in the spring of 2015. George and I are in constant contact and constant dialogue and constant discussion about best deployment of capital. I think our thinking right now is a bit focused on strategic deployment, but I would continue to emphasize that we always frame this as one or the other. And it's \u2013 over a long period of time, it's appropriately a mix. And I think the cash flow generation of the company remains quite robust such that we can deploy capital in a lot of different ways, all with the objective of increasing intrinsic value per share. So we'll look towards a lot of different means. I mean, I know I'm being a little bit vague and opaque, but I think it's just because that's a little bit where we are right now in thinking through all the dynamics of that. No real comment on the pricing dynamics for the balance of the year. The financial guidance for this year does not assume it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Nick Abbott - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, this is Nick in for Jim this morning. A couple of quick questions. In terms of the remyelination programs, you have the oral remyelination agent BIIB061. Clearly, remyelination is a very complex process. Have you looked at combining that with anti-LINGO? Do you see remyelination as a single-drug opportunity, or do you think it's going to need combination therapy in perhaps some subsets of patients? And if the Ionis SOD1 trial \u2013 for these kinds of trials where you're looking at these very rare defined sort of mutations or correction opportunities, do you see the pattern repeating that we saw with nusinersen that you can generate enough compelling data in a Phase 1 trial in affected patients that you can jump into a potentially registration enabling trial? Thanks. Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer : Yeah. Thanks for those questions, Jim. On the remyelination, right now we're thinking of it that we would use one agent for remyelination, based on our preclinical studies. Of course the remyelinating drug would probably be combined with an anti-inflammatory or an immunomodulatory drug, and that's exactly how we're conducting the SYNERGY study of anti-LINGO-1 in MS. We're adding it to interferon. But right now we don't have any plans to combine the two remyelinating drugs that we have in our pipeline. That may change over time, but that's our current plan. And then terms of the Ionis SOD1 Phase 1 trial, yeah, we've done a lot of work \u2013 \"we\" meaning Biogen, also the ALS community \u2013 on biomarkers and not only in human studies, because you'll recall that there was a prior antisense study with a less potent antisense in SOD1 patients. And there's been some \u2013 a lot of animal work. And we actually have CSF measures that we could employ that we think will predict parenchymal spinal cord SOD1 levels. The whole point of what we're trying to do is to reduce levels of SOD1, because we believe that the mutated forms of SOD1 are toxic. So we have actually validated, we believe, very good measures that we can use to take the program from the current trial to a registrational study. George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer : And this is George. I think that's often the case and the advantage of working on genetically homogeneous diseases, the result of a single gene. So look, I want to thank everybody for your attention this morning and for your interest. We are going to go back to work and do our best to deliver a great 2016 for everyone. So thank you.

Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Operator : Good morning. My name is Dan, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen first quarter 2016 financial results and business update conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Matt Calistri, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Biogen. Matthew Calistri - Senior Director- Investor Relations : Thank you, and welcome to Biogen's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP-to-non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP-to-non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. George Scangos; Dr. Al Sandrock, our Chief Medical Officer; our CFO, Paul Clancy; and our new Chief Commercial Officer, Michel Vounatsos is with us here today. Now I'll turn the call over to George. George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer : Okay, thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning. For the first quarter of 2016, Biogen generated $2.7 billion in total revenues, 7% increase from the same period a year ago. And our non-GAAP EPS was $4.79, 25% increase from the same period a year ago. As you've heard from us since the beginning of the year, a cornerstone to our strategy for sustainable growth is our healthy commercial business and a strong focus on thoughtfully managing expenses, and I think these results should reinforce that message. TECFIDERA continues to gain share globally, now with more than 190,000 patients having been treated. And at AAN this week, we presented compelling data that showcased its strong and sustained efficacy in newly diagnosed MS patients, emphasizing that earlier treatment with TECFIDERA improves long-term clinical outcomes. We also presented compelling data about TECFIDERA's real-world efficacy. Last month, we announced our new Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Michel Vounatsos, had joined us. Michel brings a wealth of experience from 20 successful years of increasing responsibility at Merck, most recently as president of primary care and customer centricity. Michel officially started on Monday, and we're excited to be working with him. He'll be instrumental in driving our near-term growth while helping to prepare the organization to support our exciting pipeline. In the first quarter, we launched BENEPALI, our biosimilar version of Enbrel, in six European countries : the UK, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and The Netherlands. And FLIXABI, our biosimilar version of Remicade, received a positive opinion from the CHMP, and we're awaiting approval from the European Commission shortly. And of course an important part of our strategy for sustainable growth is our pipeline potential future therapies. Notably, aducanumab is enrolling patients in two Phase 3 trials. Opicinumab, which is anti-LINGO, results are expected midyear. And nusinersen, in collaboration with Ionis, is close to completing enrollment of the Phase 3 trial called ENDEAR. Al will provide more color on the pipeline during his comments. Finally, I'd like to make a few comments to address some questions that I know will come. First, we're in the final stages of hiring an R&D head and expect to make an announcement shortly. Second, like you, we read the media reports about our hemophilia business and the subsequent analyst reports. As a matter of policy, we do not comment on speculation, and will not do so in this instance. We're in an exciting stage in the evolution of Biogen. We're encouraged by the trajectory of our commercial portfolio, and we'll continue to focus on cost containment to maximize our earnings. We're eagerly awaiting the data from opicinumab and nusinersen, and we're pleased with the early enthusiasm for our biosimilars in Europe. We've recently brought several new compounds into development, and we continue to look for opportunities outside of Biogen. And with that I'll turn the call over to Al, who'll update you on our progress in R&D. Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer : Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. This quarter, we continued to execute on our pipeline candidates and generate new data to support our commercialized products. Starting with opicinumab or anti-LINGO, we are looking forward to seeing the Phase 2 data, which is still scheduled for the middle of this year. I should note that no one has seen these data yet, but after more than a decade of work on LINGO, beginning with discovering the gene and then elucidating its biology, most of which was conducted at Biogen, we're excited to learn about opicinumab's potential as a reparative therapy for MS. In Alzheimer's disease, we are working diligently to enroll our aducanumab Phase 3 trials and are pleased with progress thus far. Looking ahead, we anticipate safety data from the titration arm of the Phase 1b PRIME study in the second half of this year. Amiselimod, or MT-1303, our S1P1 inhibitor for IBD, is currently being tested in a Phase 2 trial in Crohn's disease, and we are working toward the start of Phase 3 studies in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in the second half of this year. Raxatrigine, a small molecule inhibitor of the Nav 1.7 sodium channel, is anticipated to begin a Phase 3 trial to confirm its efficacy is in patients with trigeminal neuralgia, and we are also planning to initiate a Phase 2 trial in patients with painful lumbosacral radiculopathy later this year. Turning to our hemophilia products, we find the data that was presented at the December ASH meeting on immune tolerance induction with ELOCTATE quite encouraging. We believe that the Fc portion of these fusion proteins utilized in both ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX may offer additional benefits beyond half-life extension, although these preliminary findings will require confirmation from additional studies. At this week's American Academy of Neurology meeting, we presented important new data demonstrating the breadth and diversity of our marketed and pipeline multiple sclerosis therapies, including TECFIDERA, TYSABRI, ZINBRYTA and PLEGRIDY. Let me provide some of the highlights of our presentation. TECFIDERA was shown to provide sustained and strong efficacy in newly diagnosed MS patients, reinforcing that earlier treatment with TECFIDERA is important in improving long-term clinical outcomes. We also presented the results of another study that retrospectively examined the health insurance claims database of more than 5,000 patients in routine clinical practice. Annualized relapse rates one year after starting disease-modifying therapy were compared to the year before therapy initiation. These real-world data support the efficacy of TECFIDERA treatment seen in the controlled clinical trials, and this, combined with its safety profile and oral convenience, make it a very compelling therapeutic option for MS patients. Data presented at AAN reinforced the nearly 10 years of clinical experience with TYSABRI, confirming its high efficacy, reversible immune effects, and well-characterized safety profile. ZINBRYTA, with its targeted and reversible mechanism of action, was shown to be positive on key MS cognitive outcomes. PLEGRIDY was shown to reduce the conversion of newly acquired MS lesions into T1 black holes, which have been associated with axonal loss. Also at AAN, our collaboration partner, Ionis, presented an update on the ongoing open label Phase II trial of nusinersen in infants with spinal muscular atrophy. An analysis as of January 2016 showed no new events, as defined by progression to permanent ventilation or death, in the study since December of 2014, continued increases in muscle function scores, and achievement of new motor milestones when compared to natural history studies. We believe these data look increasingly encouraging, and that nusinersen could represent an important new therapy for spinal muscular atrophy. With respect to our earlier stage efforts, at our R&D Day last November, we talked about using human genetics to identify causal biological pathways, as we strive to discover and develop new treatment for difficult diseases. In February, we joined the Center for Therapeutic Target Validation, the pioneering public-private collaboration that fosters interactions between academic and industry members for the purpose of developing open, transformative approaches to selecting and validating novel targets in drug development. This collaboration expands on our strategy of using genetically validated targets, biomarkers, and multiple therapeutic approaches to decrease the risk of drug development. With that, I'll now pass the call to Paul. Paul J. Clancy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Biogen, Inc.: Thanks, Al. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.43 in the first quarter, while our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.79. Total revenue for Q1 grew 7% year-over-year to approximately $2.7 billion. Our revenue growth was driven by the stable patient trends we now see for TECFIDERA and TYSABRI in the U.S., and continued growth in ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX. Although PLEGRIDY showed meaningful growth, our overall interferon business declined compared to the first quarter of last year, as the market continues to migrate to orals. Overall, we're pleased that the breadth and strength of our product portfolio enabled us to absorb such fluctuations, expand our top line, and maintain our global MS market share of approximately 38%. As a reminder, we had $173 million in foreign exchange hedge gains in 2015, which has begun to impact our year-over-year comparisons. Compared to the first quarter of last year, we had $26 million less in hedge gains this quarter. Combined with the $24 million headwind from natural foreign exchange rates, overall revenue was weakened by approximately $50 million year over year. I'll highlight the FX impact for each of the therapies. Global first quarter TECFIDERA revenue was $946 million. We recorded revenues of $744 million in the U.S. and $202 million outside the U.S. In the U.S., we believe there was a draw-down of TECFIDERA inventory in the wholesale channel, representing approximately $20 million versus prior quarter. Despite an expected choppy start to the quarter, as we worked through the typical seasonality issues, we believe underlying U.S. TECFIDERA patient demand is largely stable. U.S. gross-to-net percentage was comparable to Q4 and largely consistent with our average expected rate for the balance of the year. Outside the U.S., foreign exchange impact, including the reduction in hedge gains, weakened full-year TECFIDERA revenue by approximately $14 million year over year. Last October, we bolstered our marketing efforts in the U.S. by launching a television campaign aimed at increasing patient awareness about MS and TECFIDERA. We believe we did increase awareness. Our current TV campaign will expire in the middle of this year. For various reasons, we plan to sunset this lever and don't currently plan to purchase additional TV spots beyond the middle of the year. We do, nevertheless, plan to continue our marketing efforts across other print and digital channels. Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $670 million during the first quarter, which includes $467 million in the U.S. and $203 million in sales outside the U.S. In the U.S., the results were weaker than anticipated due to a combination of lower underlying demand as patients continued to move toward orals, seasonality issues, and a draw-down of AVONEX wholesale inventory of approximately $20 million. Outside the U.S., foreign exchange impact inclusive of a reduction in hedge gains weakened Q1 interferon revenues by approximately $20 million year over year. Now moving to TYSABRI. With nearly 10 years of post-marketing experience, TYSABRI continued to add patients this quarter, with worldwide revenues of $477 million. These results were comprised of $288 million in the U.S. and $189 million internationally. We believe TYSABRI's well-understood safety profile and robust efficacy, position it well. Foreign exchange impact, including a reduction in hedge gains, weakened Q1 TYSABRI revenue by approximately $14 million year over year. Turning to our hemophilia business. ELOCTATE revenue for the quarter was $108 million, and ALPROLIX revenue in Q1 was $75 million. We recorded $329 million for Q1 in our anti-CD20 collaboration, which includes our profit share from RITUXAN and GAZYVA in the U.S., as well as our profit share and royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. As expected, our share of pre-tax profits in the U.S. on sales of RITUXAN decreased from 40% to 39% at the end of February, following approval of GAZYVA in RITUXAN-refractory indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Total other revenues, which include revenues from collaboration relationships, royalties, and contract manufacturing, were $88 million. We continued to benefit this quarter from contract manufacturing revenue related to a strategic partner. Now turning to the expense lines on the P&L. Q1 cost of goods sold were $313 million, or 11% of revenue, as we experienced lower-than-typical write-offs of manufacturing runs in inventory. Q1 R&D expense was $437 million, or 16% of revenue. Of note in Q1, we did not have any meaningful business development expense. Recall in the fourth quarter we made a $60 million payment to Mitsubishi Tanabe related to the in-licensing of MT-1303. Additionally, the lower-than-expected R&D run rate seen in Q1 was also favorably impacted by the timing of clinical manufacturing campaigns and other R&D activities. Q1 SG&A expense was $497 million or 18% of revenue. We remain focused on achieving savings in non-labor expenses, with the objective of reducing lower-priority fees and services for the balance of 2016. Other net expense was $53 million in Q1, which includes the interest expense related to our 2015 bond offering. In Q1, our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 26%. This rate was negatively impacted by approximately 150 basis points related to discrete items. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 219 million for Q1. And we ended the quarter with approximately $6.8 billion in cash and marketable securities, with approximately 45% of this in the U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $4.79 for the quarter, representing a strong 25% increase year over year. Over the last few years, we've gone through an unprecedented number of product launches, and thought it was the right strategy to not be penny wise and pound foolish. Starting in 2015, we pivoted to initiate a number of measures to curb operating expense growth. And late in 2015, we announced a restructuring, and we believe the benefits materialized this quarter. For the balance of the year, we're focused on commercial execution and diligent efforts to further reduce spending where appropriate, while ensuring we simultaneously support the advancement of the pipeline. I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments. George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thanks, Paul. Look, I'm pleased with the start of the year. And especially with the 25% increase in earnings versus Q1 of 2015. For the remainder of the year, we're focused on three areas : careful control of our costs, maximizing our revenues, and rapidly advancing the pipeline. The cost reduction actions that we took last year resulted in a meaningful increase in earnings this quarter, and as we move through the year we'll continue to focus on cost control to do all that we can to concentrate our resources on the activities that we believe will add the greatest value. On the revenue side, we're pleased to have Michel Vounatsos join us. I'm very confident in Michel and look forward to all that he and his team will do to maximize the value of our commercial portfolio as we move through this year and into next. We have great drugs that are benefiting a lot of patients, and we want to maximize the benefits to both patients and our shareholders. Additionally, we hope to launch two additional compounds this year, ZINBRYTA and, in the EU, FLIXABI. Since we think of revenue on a multiyear basis, we also will continue our focus on pursuing opportunities outside of Biogen. We continue to track companies and compounds that are potentially interesting for us, and we are in constant discussions with multiple parties, from the types of tuck-in acquisitions that we've done historically to later-stage assets closer to commercialization. And, as we said at previous calls, we want to be active in this area while remaining financially disciplined. This is a very important year for the advancement of our internal pipeline. And it's important to make sure that the enrollment in the two Phase 3 of aducanumab continues to go well. We're pleased with how we're tracking so far, but it's still early, and we want to make sure that we stay on or ideally ahead of schedule for patient enrollment. We aim to get the Phase 3 trials for raxatrigine and amiselimod started on schedule, and we need to make sure that our early pipeline progresses quickly and that we make fact-based go/no-go decisions. And of course once we have the Phase 2 data for opicinumab in the middle of the year, we'll quickly decide on the appropriate path forward for opicinumab itself and for the other remyelinating programs in out pipeline. As Al mentioned, the open label data for nusinersen continue to look encouraging, and we need to do everything that we can to minimize the time to see data from the Phase 3 trials and, if positive, to get the drug to patients as soon as possible. Although not so visible from outside the company, we'll continue to invest in R&D. We believe that our strategy of building world-class research and development will not only help us identify important new therapies ourselves, but will also help us to make thoughtful, sophisticated decisions about what to bring in from outside the company. So we have a lot to do. This is a year for us to keep our heads down and focus on execution in all of the areas that I just outlined. We have a great team and a dedicated group of employees. And as always, I'd like to thank our employees for making a positive impact on patients' lives, and thank the patients and physicians involved in our clinical development programs. The achievements that we've made together could not have been realized without their passion and commitment. So thank you all for joining us this morning. And, operator, we'll now open up the call for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So I'm going to ask a two-part question, which you'll probably give me a hard time for, but \u2013 so on TECFIDERA, can you just talk a little bit about what's gone on outside the U.S.? If you back out the FX movements that you were talking about, you only saw a sequential $9 million increase in revenues. Is volume substantially slowing outside the U.S.? And then maybe just related to that, you had some contracting changes across the portfolio, specifically with CVS last year. Any big impacts to gross-to-net or some of the trends that may have affected the interferon franchise? Thanks. Paul J. Clancy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Biogen, Inc.: Thanks, Matt. Great question. This is Paul. I'll try to take it. Outside the United States \u2013 we're actually pretty pleased outside the United States. I'd say Germany is a place where we'd like to see performance a little bit better. It probably looks a lot like the United States' performance of TECFIDERA, kind of getting darn close to a 20% share and not punching through over the course of 2015. That's an important market outside the United States, as you all know. When I go across other parts that really are the big contributors outside the United States, it's kind of obviously France, UK, Southern Europe countries of Italy and Spain, and we're very pleased with the performance in Southern Europe. Those are early days in terms of the launch curves for TECFIDERA specifically. We're very, very pleased with that. Performance has exceeded our expectations. And certainly, as we've pointed out in the past, our UK performance is exceptionally strong. We've got a \u2013 what we feel is a remarkable team there. They've kind of really kind of broken down the marketplace and attacked it quite vigorously across the suite of Biogen MS therapies. So I think very pleased, I'd say, with the performance outside the United States, with a little bit of homework to do in Germany, which \u2013 I think we're actually showing some early signs, very early signs late in the quarter, positive signs. With respect to contracting, it is, as people know, specific to AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, specific to newly diagnosed patients. I think that you combine that with typical seasonality issues in Q1, and we still feel we made the right choices there in terms of as we moved into 2016, and so we don't think there's been a meaningful impact. Certainly kind of working through prior authorizations and things like that for some of the patients has become a more active part of what we do in our patient services organization. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Sorry. Thank you very much for taking my question \u2013 not plural. Paul, congrats again on great P&L management. We all appreciate it, and your investors appreciate it. So many questions to ask. Maybe, Al, just because this is the one I get the most, just going back to the Eisai collaboration, and the A-beta antibody that may or may not have data shortly, the question that I've been getting \u2013 I'd just love to hear your thoughts \u2013 are, you emphasized a lot when looking at these competing A-beta antibodies, really understanding what the imaging data show post-therapy. That is, does it drain plaque from the brain? And if the answer to that's no, then the clinical outcome is perhaps less important because it doesn't do what your a-mab does, so to speak. But there's been some questions about specifically where the Eisai BAN antibody binds, which type of fibrils, and whether or not \u2013 given its specific binding affinities \u2013 whether or not you would expect necessarily to see changes on PET scan. So I was just wondering if you could talk us through that. Thanks so much. Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer : Yeah, Mark. The BAN2401, to my understanding, binds the protofibrils as well as oligomers, and I would expect it to reduce amyloid plaque burden. The question for me is does it do that, first of all, and second, to what degree? The thing that was remarkable about aducanumab was that we had a very substantial reduction in the course of one year, arguably 85% or so. Competitor antibodies have not done that, and I don't know where 2401 will land, but that's an important piece. And then we can then start to understand that the relationship between reduction in plaque burden and cognitive outcome. In our hands, in the aducanumab program, only the patients who reduced plaque burden by greater than one standard deviation changed relative to what the placebo patients did \u2013 in other words, beyond the noise. Those are the people who got cognitive benefit. The people who did not do that did not have any benefit that we could detect. So we think that's an important piece to look at. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the expense management as well. I guess from the DTC campaign that you had with TECFIDERA, what were some of the learnings that you took away for that campaign around the television form and why you chose to keep the print? And just kind of similar along that lines, do you have any color on what the average duration for TECFIDERA is right now in the United States? George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer : I'll take the first part of that question. Look, the main purpose of the ad campaign, television campaign, was to increase awareness of TECFIDERA. We were surprised, actually, at the beginning, by the low awareness among patients of TECFIDERA. And we had data suggesting that when patients did learn about TECFIDERA and went to their physician to discuss it, they often had it prescribed. So we wanted to get the awareness up. The ad did succeed in getting awareness up. And then the thesis is, once awareness is up and they have those discussions, they'll go to their physicians and we'll see an increase in prescriptions. We've said we would see that, if we do, in Q2. We're in Q2. And so I think we'll have a final verdict on the success of that TV campaign when we talk to you next quarter. And so those ads don't run forever. So we're taking a pause. We'll continue our other types of activities, and we'll see what we learn and make decisions about any potential future television ads. Paul J. Clancy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Biogen, Inc.: Alethia \u2013 and this is Paul. I'll try to take the second part of your question. Let me kind of answer it in a slightly different way that is a little bit more customary to the way we look at the data and probably more indicative. We try to triangulate on what we call discontinuation rates, the percentage of patients that leave a therapy, call it over the course of a 52-week period. And all the disease-modifying therapies have discontinuation rates, and we think that TECFIDERA experienced higher discontinuation rates than normal, as we moved through 2015, largely due to lymphocyte monitoring and kind of the label change. We actually, importantly, think that we're kind of on, hopefully, on the back side of that. That the medical education has largely been completed. It obviously never stops, but we're hopeful that actually that can provide a little bit of a tailwind as we move through 2016 and as it begins to get back to a more normal level. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Thank you very much, and thanks for taking the question. Paul, just \u2013 could you give us some color on how the rest of the year is looking now? You obviously have got a tailwind here with the significantly lower R&D expense, as you've tightened your belt on SG&A. But you did have what looks like $45 million of sequential currency headwind or loss of hedging from Q4. So how should we think about those drivers for the rest of the year? Can you keep at this sort of level on R&D and SG&A? And should we anticipate this kind of magnitude of currency effect through the balance of the year because of your hedge positions? Paul J. Clancy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Biogen, Inc.: Yeah. Great questions, Geoff, because it's kind of a dynamic that the loss of hedging \u2013 not a surprise to us. So that was actually part of our business plan as we swung into 2016. And fundamentally we don't make predictions about where currencies are going to go. But we fully anticipated the fact that we had hedge gains throughout the P&L in 2015, that really come about from the hedges that we put on in 2014. So it's essentially a wraparound effect of the currency changes, mostly in the EU, as we kind of ended, very ended \u2013 if you remember, the changes were very end of December of 2014 and January of 2015. So that was fully expected. And so we believe that that will just continue to be a bit of a headwind, which we had thought about. The R&D, I think I'd point out one key dynamic is it's always a little bit choppy, R&D as a percentage of sales, based on business development activity. And we certainly want to, and would welcome, really good business development activity. That's always a positive investment, a positive expense, if done correctly. With all that said, no doubt about it that, as I said, we have made cost control and feel like we're reaping the benefits of what we did late in 2015, as we came into this year. And I think it will continue to be a meaningful effort from me, from the whole organization, to make sure we focus on efficiencies throughout the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah, maybe on that R&D investment, either for Paul or George. We all appreciate the focus on the bottom line and costs, and appreciate also there were some puts and takes in Q1. But you're down at 16% of revenue in the first quarter. That's, I think, an all-time low for Biogen. Is that an appropriate rate for this company kind of long term, three to five years, in terms of investment? George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, thanks, Eric. Let me take that question. Look, R&D is choppy, and I don't want anybody to interpret that number as a deliberate effort to cut back on R&D and a de-emphasis on R&D. It is quite the opposite, actually. We are continuing to build a world-class research group. We will continue to invest in research. We believe that is a fundamental part of our strategy to build value. I think we've done a really good job so far. We'll continue that focus. Clinical development, we will spend whatever is necessary to move our pipeline forward \u2013 those pipeline compounds that are high potential, high value. We've talked about those. We're continue to invest in those. Frankly, the expenses there we would expect to go up over time as we move more compounds into Phase 3. So I think the trend is largely in that direction. And part of this quarter was also, as Paul said, the lack of BD. And there's not going to be a lack of BD forever. So it was a lack in one quarter. So I don't want anybody to interpret the one-quarter number as a change in our strategy or a de-emphasis of R&D. It's quite the opposite, actually. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Thanks for the question. I know you're not commenting on other outside reports on hemophilia, but I wanted to ask, bigger picture, there's been changes in the market. The incumbent's being acquired. There's gene therapy data yesterday. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the push-pulls for this business, and is this business the business you've been thinking about? And maybe talk a little bit about how this fits in overall in the growth that you see here, given all the changes going on in hemophilia. Thanks. George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, sure. Happy to take that. Look, ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX are doing well. They're gaining market share, and we're pleased with their performance. And they're continuing to gain share. So we're feeling good about there. We have not yet seen any impact on their trajectories from the introduction of other long-acting factors, so we take that as a positive sign. So I think the prospects for the business look quite healthy. In the longer term, there are a number of products, as there are in every therapeutic area, coming forward, and we're keeping a close eye on them. There's certainly \u2013 we saw BioMarin's data, which are interesting but early. I mean, I haven't seen anything that you haven't seen. I saw good Factor VIII levels that persisted for some period of time, and we saw some liver enzyme issues that needed to be treated with corticosteroids. So we'll see how that plays out over time. Those are early. I would say interesting data, but early. It's similar, I think, to our immune tolerance induction data that we have with ELOCTATE. We haven't talked about this a lot, but a fair number of hemophiliacs develop inhibitory antibodies when they're treated. And that results in the necessity for immune tolerance induction, which means high levels of factor that are given over 12 to 18 months before immune tolerance emerges. There've been a very limited number of patients, three, so I don't want to overstate this. Again, these are very early data, so \u2013 and I don't want to be here overstating the case. But, again, these are early data, but also encouraging. So of the three patients that have been treated with ELOCTATE for immune tolerance induction, they all became tolerant within three to four months. So much shorter period of time. If those data are confirmed in further studies, we believe that that could be an important upward lift for ELOCTATE. So I think there are lots of early data emerging. They all need to be confirmed with larger studies. And we feel good about the business and where we are. We have our own longer-acting factors coming. We talked about some of them. There are earlier ones that are in our research group now. So I think we feel good about the current products, and we feel good about the future of the business as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First one is, many investors think you guys have lost flexibility on balance sheet because you guys really don't have much net debt. I'm just probing maybe the question for Paul \u2013 what's the willingness here to do another significant share buyback given your balance sheet strength? And then, secondly, I want to ask about a TECFIDERA inventory situation here. So in fourth quarter you had a $30 million inventory built in the U.S., and then there's a destocking of $20 million this quarter. Should we expect another $10 million to go next quarter? Thank you. Paul J. Clancy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Biogen, Inc.: All right, Ying, why don't I try to clean up the clarity on the second part of your question. So the $30 million that I talked about last quarter was our best estimate at that time. In retrospect now, it probably is closer to the $20 million. In reality, it's probably in between. So I think that we've gone through the destocking of what we talked about last quarter and just wanted to kind of clarify it with the prepared remarks. With respect to the balance sheet, I think it gets to the broader question of capital allocation. Currently, we're actually sitting on a pretty high cash balance. As I pointed out, like many others, we have the peculiar situation of ex-U.S. cash is a little bit more than half of that. But aside from that, that largely arises out of two things : the great, strong cash flow generation of the company, coupled with the debt financing that we did in the fall of 2015. Look, I think we will look to strategically deploy it. And if we come up that there are not options to strategically deploy it, we will look towards returning capital to shareholders. We don't measure that, as we've talked about before, on a 90-day basis, just because that's not the kind of clock speed of things. In both situations, it depends on price and value. So it depends, and in both situations, the financial objective is to maximize intrinsic value per share. So we look towards investing in deployments of capital that really drive great internal rates of return. I think I'd also point out, look, over a longer period of time, I think this company, with the great cash flow generation it has, has flexibility to do both. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Citigroup. Your line is open. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. So just a question on strategy a little bit, and thinking about the company longer term. So you've got the MS business now stable, but it's faced some compression from new therapies. And you have hemophilia as a growing business and pipeline. I'm just wondering, how are you thinking about how important it is to diversify the business further? Do you have any concerns or no (42:17), or how are you thinking about, could there be something that puts pricing pressure on the MS market, and what could trigger it, and how are you thinking about maybe derisking the company from such an event? None of us think of it as a near-term event, but it's something that could happen over the long term. Maybe just help us think about the longer-term strategy of the company and your thoughts on price. George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Robyn. This is George. I'll start with that, and other people can chime in. Look, I think we're feeling good about the MS business as it exists today. We're going right. But if you look at our pipeline, you'll see that many of the things we're working on are not in MS. We think LINGO, actually, could be a transformative event in the treatment of MS, and we are not working in \u2013 beyond ZINBRYTA on novel \u2013 let's say additional drugs that would downregulate the immune system. I think there are enough of those on the market; there are more coming. For many MS patients, those don't stop the progression. They slow the progression, but they don't stop the progression. And so we believe things like LINGO actually are the types of compounds that could actually transform that market and give it additional vibrancy as we move out through the 2020s. That being said, if you look at what we're emphasizing now and what we have in Phase 3, it's nusinersen for SMA, it's aducanumab for Alzheimer's disease, it's raxatrigine for neuropathic pain. It's amiselimod for IBD and Crohn's disease. So we have deliberately brought in a series of compounds and are conducting late-stage trials in things that are outside of MS, partially for the reason you just outlined. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): (44:18) and your thoughts on price \u2013 anything that can trigger a pricing compression in the marketplace? George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer : We don't see anything in the near term, no. As you move out into the 2020s, certainly could be, but don't see anything near term. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Your line is open. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. A couple commercial ones. In the context of your DTC campaign, I was curious if you guys have any data on re-treatment of patients who went on TECFIDERA right at the launch? And then just with respect to \u2013 related question with respect to first quarter trends or even fourth quarter, any impact thus far from generic Copaxone on the interferon market vis-\u00e0-vis share? Thanks. Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer : Yeah, Geoff, I'll try to address that. Not a lot of data on re-treatment. So we have plenty of data, but I can't off the top of my head think of anything as it relates to that. With respect to generic Cop, the data would suggest that it's a pretty small percentage at this point in time. And the data would suggest that it very much is just impacting Copaxone. So that's how we see it anecdotally, as well as how the data from a market share and a patient trends suggests. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from Jefferies. Your line is open. Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. A question for Michel, if I may. First of all, congratulations on the new position. I know it's very early days, but I'm curious if you could maybe talk broadly about your objectives coming into Biogen, areas where see the potential to have the most impact on the commercial business under your leadership, and perhaps more specifically how you're thinking about potentially reaccelerating growth in MS and positioning for a potential ocrelizumab entry while still balancing the company's focus on achieving cost savings? Paul J. Clancy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Biogen, Inc.: Thanks, Brian. Brian, this is Paul. We had Michel prepared for wholesaler inventory questions. Michel?  So thanks for the question. Good morning, everybody. This is Michel Vounatsos, week one at Biogen. So as you can imagine, I am more on the learning and listening mode, and it's far too early for me to assess the strategy. I will be focusing a lot of time on the key geographies, obviously, and the key customers, to best understand and the key franchises. So I hope that in the near future, I'll be in a better position to assess the next steps. What I can tell you is that I'm extremely encouraged and honored to be part of this team and looking forward to engaging with all of you in the near future. Thanks for your understanding. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Jim Birchenough - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah, hi, guys. Maybe a question on the pipeline and some help in assessing the risk-adjusted value of nusinersen. And on the risk side of it, when you look at the data we saw at AAN and that we've seen over the last few years, how do you get comfortable with the comparison with historical controls? And then on the opportunity, perhaps you could speak to how you view that opportunity in SMA between the Type I and then the Type II/III patient. Thanks. Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer : Well, the comparison with historical controls is always a little bit dangerous to do, because you have to choose cohorts, and you try to match them to your patients but the standard of practice changes over time. So these patients might be getting better over time just by the clinical practice improving. On the other hand, when you start to see lack of events of the type that was shown at the AAN \u2013 since December of 2014, no new events. That's a pretty striking difference, and these are hard endpoints, like time to tracheostomy or ventilation and time to death. It's hard for me to see how that kind of thing could be happening due to simply improving medical care. So I think we're getting more and more encouraged, but I would note that we have these two well-controlled trials, one in infant-onset SMA and one in childhood-onset SMA. And that, to me, is a definitive data set that we're going to be looking at. And in terms of the opportunities in infant and childhood, I mean, I think they're both big opportunities, and I look forward to being able to help patients in both categories. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Actually wanted to follow up on nusinersen. George, in your scripted comments, when you talked about doing whatever you can to minimize the time to Phase 3 data for the product, is there anything specific that can actually be done to shorten that timeline, given that enrollment is complete for one of the trials and close to it for the other? Is there anything else you were referring to? George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer : Look, at this time, let me just say that we are cognizant of the need to get this drug to patients as soon as we can, if it works. So the first part of that is being confident that it works. And, as Al said, we're going to need to see data from the control trials in order to make that case to the agencies, certainly, and for us to be absolutely certain as well. So we want to get there as quickly as we can. And once we have those data, we absolutely want to minimize the time until these kids have access to it \u2013 again, if it works. And these are especially the Type I kids who don't have a lot of time. And so there are a lot of kids out there today who desperately need something. And so we're trying to shorten that timeframe. But I don't want to get into any of the specifics of how we're doing that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just on the LINGO MS data coming in midyear, I know you guys are looking at a range of endpoints here, including disability and cognition. I think disability's pretty easy for all of us to benchmark, as there's a lot of data there. But on the cognition side, I know you're using this PASAT-3 scale. Anything you can do there, just to help frame for us in terms of what would be a meaningful outcome on that measurement? Thank you. Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer : Yeah, we've had a lot of experience with PASAT. We've been using it in MS trials for about 20 years now. One of the things we know is that there's a practice effect. And so I expect to see some improvement on the score, even in untreated patients, just because of the practice effect. What I'm hoping to see with anti-LINGO, and I don't know whether we will or not, is that there would be an even better learning effect in the anti-LINGO-treated patients. And it would be great to see a dose response. That would make it even more compelling if we saw that. In terms of what is considered clinically meaningful, that hasn't been established in the world of MS yet. We have no established precedents on that. I will say that some compounds have shown some efficacy on this by virtue of preventing new MS lesions, but certainly not in this new era of reparative therapies. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks. Just a question for Al. On aducanumab, I was just hoping to get your thoughts on the targeting of A-beta. Specifically, I think you've implied, and I think there's plenty of data out there, suggesting that beta amyloid levels or amyloid beta levels might have actually plateaued by the time a patient shows any signs of mild cognitive impairment. Was just curious to get your thoughts, sort of the appropriateness of targeting A-beta in patients where plaques have already reached sort of a level-set, and what potentially could be driving the disease in these patients, in terms of their progression and whether there's another target that would make more sense? Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer : Yeah, so it's true that when you look at plaque burden, it does tend to plateau already in the prodromal phase. And certainly by the (53:43), it's pretty flat. And so, what drives the progression beyond that, we believe, is probably tau. Tau comes on later. If you look at the imaging studies, tau comes on later. And there's a lot of data, preclinical data, that shows that A-beta pathology triggers tau pathology. So we're learning a lot about tau now. We know that, in normal aging, there is some aggregated tau in the medial temporal lobe. But in patients with Alzheimer's disease, it spreads beyond the medial temporal lobe, and that spread is probably triggered by A-beta. And so that's the reason why we have some programs in tau. We have some preclinical, as well as early clinical programs. Both antibodies, as well as antisense. And so, in the later stages, we might need to treat for tau, perhaps in combination with the A-beta therapies, because I don't think you want to re-accumulate A-beta once you removed it. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Chris Raymond from Raymond James. Your line is open. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, thanks for letting me slip in here. So just a question on anti-LINGO. So at AAN, there was some interesting data on clemastine. That agent seems to have at least some sort of similarity in terms of mechanism to LINGO in terms of impacting the oligodendrocyte differentiation at least. Wondering, Al, if you had any thoughts \u2013 is there any kind of read-through we should be thinking about, with respect to that agent and the results there? Thanks. Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer : Yeah, so we've \u2013 the clemastine came from this micropillar assay that was developed in San Francisco, where they have oligodendrocytes wrapping myelin essentially around tubes. And what they found was that there were a number of antimuscarinic compounds that work, benztropine, as well as clemastine. We've actually tested clemastine in our oligodendroctye differentiation assay here, and in our hands it's less potent than BIIB-61, our oral compound that we have in early clinical trials, and it's also less effective overall in a side-by-side comparison in our hands. Nevertheless, I did look at the data. Crossover designs like the one that they did are probably not the best approach for looking at disease-modifying therapies, because when you switch from clemastine to placebo, I don't expect that the \u2013 if it is causing myelination, how would the placebo patients look? They would continue to get the benefits from the clemastine that they had received in the period prior. So nevertheless they did show a modest effect on latency of the conduction between the retina and the brain, and we're keeping a close eye on that. I think that these are all early-day experiments in reparative therapies, and I believe we have established one of the best ways of looking at this in our anti-LINGO program, both in acute optic neuritis, as well as the MS program. George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer : Okay. If there are no further questions, let me thank you all for your time this morning, and we'll sign off. Thanks.

LLC Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Operator : Good morning. My name is Dan, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen second quarter 2016 financial results and business update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. Thank you. I now would like to turn the call over to Mr. Matt Calistri, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Matthew Calistri - Senior Director- Investor Relations : Thanks, Dan. Thank you, everyone, and welcome to Biogen's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP-to-non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP-to-non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. George Scangos; Dr. Michael Ehlers, EVP of Research and Development; our Chief Commercial Officer, Michel Vounatsos; and our CFO, Paul Clancy. We'll also be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Al Sandrock. Now I'll turn the call over to George. George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'd like to begin with a personal statement. I'll be stepping down as CEO of Biogen sometime within the next few months. The board and I recognize that this is an excellent time for a transition. The company's doing well now. The management team is complete and extremely capable, the commercial and R&D activities are going well, and we're on our way to adding to the pipeline through internal and external opportunities. It's a good time for a new CEO to take the helm and see Biogen through to what I believe is a very exciting future. This also is an opportune time for me to return to the West Coast, take on one more set of activities, and spend more time with my family. I've been at Biogen for six years. I'm proud of the company and what we've been able to accomplish in that time. We've introduced six new products onto the market and increased our revenues, earnings, and stock price, all by several fold. And I believe that we're well-positioned to keep delivering on our potential to bring even more therapies to patients and returns to our investors. Our R&D and commercial organizations are now world-class, joining our already industry-leading biologics manufacturing capabilities. All aspects of the company are operating at a high level. We've brought several potentially game-changing compounds into later stage development and are in the process of adding further to that pipeline. With the addition of Michel Vounatsos, Mike Ehlers, and Paul McKenzie, the company has a full and vibrant leadership team that's capable of moving the company thoughtfully forward. I truly believe that the company has a bright future, and it's with mixed emotions that I leave at this time and not see that future come fully to fruition. We're making the announcement now in order to provide an orderly transition for the company and to allow the board to conduct an open and effective search. I'll work with the board to find a great successor who can continue to build on what we have accomplished. We expect to consider both internal and external candidates, and I'm confident that we'll identify an outstanding new leader. I expect to remain as CEO until a successor is identified and can begin. In the interim, I'll continue to work with the board and management team to accomplish Biogen's goals for 2016. I believe that we're on a good trajectory, that we have great new additions to the management team, and I look forward to a successful second half of the year. So enough about me. Let's turn to the business. Biogen had a solid second quarter, delivering strong financial performance and important advances in our pipeline. For the second quarter of 2016, Biogen generated $2.9 billion in total revenues, a 12% increase from the same period a year ago. Our GAAP earnings were $4.79 per share, a 22% increase year over year, and non-GAAP EPS was $5.21, a 23% increase year over year. We continue to grow our leading MS franchise and our hemophilia business. And our efforts to maximize revenues while thoughtfully managing expenses helped to drive attractive earnings growth. As a result, we've raised our financial guidance for the full year. And today we announced that our board of directors has authorized a program to repurchase up to $5 billion of our common stock. Looking back, we had quite an eventful second quarter. To begin, we welcomed three new members of our management team. A new head of commercial, Michel Vounatsos, joined us in April. He's completed a thorough assessment and has identified four key priorities for driving our MS business forward, which he'll share with you later in this call. Our new head of R&D, Mike Ehlers, joined us at the end of May. Mike is a brilliant neuroscientist and an established R&D leader who has excelled in both academic and corporate settings. Mike has demonstrated the ability to translate science into the development of important new medicines, and he's already bringing terrific leadership to the organization. And finally, with John Cox preparing to lead the new hemophilia company, we've promoted Paul McKenzie to oversee our Pharmaceutical Operations & Technology group. These three new leaders bring a wealth of experience and expertise, and we believe that they're poised to take Biogen into its next phase of growth. I'm proud to have them in our organization. Last quarter brought a number of positive developments for both our commercial products and our pipeline. We announced our intent to spin off our hemophilia business. That business continues to perform well, with combined second quarter revenues of over $200 million for ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX. ALPROLIX also was approved by the European Commission for the treatment of hemophilia B and will be commercialized in the EU by our collaboration partner, Sobi. We had a positive label update for TYSABRI in Europe, including an extended indication. We received regulatory approval for ZINBRYTA in both the U.S. and the EU for the treatment of relapsing MS. FLIXABI, an infliximab biosimilar referencing REMICADE, received approval in Europe. This will be the second anti-TNF biosimilar that we'll manufacture and commercialize in the EU. And SB5, an adalimumab biosimilar candidate referencing Humira, has been accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency. Aducanumab was accepted into the European Medicines Agency's PRIority MEdicines program, known as PRIME. It was one of only four applications accepted out of 18 submitted and the only Alzheimer's disease therapy in development that was accepted. On the early-stage research front, we entered into a broad collaboration and alliance with the University of Pennsylvania and two world-renowned gene therapy experts, Drs. James Wilson and Jean Bennett. This quarter we also reported the top line results of the SYNERGY trial for opicinumab. As you are all aware, opicinumab missed both the primary and secondary endpoints, which certainly was disappointing. However, the rigorous design and planning of SYNERGY has yielded an abundance of data that will help us make a well-informed decision about our path forward with opicinumab and our work in remyelination generally. These results are indicative of the significant challenge of targeting neural repair. During the upcoming ECTRIMS conference in September, we expect to present more detailed efficacy, biomarker, and safety data. I'll now turn the call over to Mike. And we're eager for you to get to know Mike and experience his passion for our business. Michael D. Ehlers - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Thank you, George. And good morning, everyone. By way of introduction, I spent a number of years in academia as professor and Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator at Duke University, where my research was focused on cell biological and circuit mechanisms of brain function and the normal, developing, and diseased nervous system. My career took an exciting turn six years ago when I joined Pfizer. I served as the Chief Scientific Officer for the company's Neuroscience and Pain research unit and ultimately became group leader for Bio Therapeutics R&D with responsibility over rare disease, the Centers for Therapeutic Innovation, and all large biomolecule sciences. I'm just now finishing my second month at Biogen, so there's still a lot I'm getting up to speed on. But I can tell you from the outset that I am working to reshape and progress our pipeline while aggressively pursuing promising assets both internally and externally. I plan to update you on progress on these fronts in the future. In the meantime, I will comment on the important clinical study readouts this quarter and note some good progress made in advancing our clinical programs. Starting with opicinumab or anti-LINGO, as George discussed, the top line results from the Phase 2 SYNERGY study were reported, in which opicinumab unfortunately missed both the primary and secondary endpoints. However, evidence of a clinical effect with a complex, unexpected dose response was observed. The SYNERGY top line efficacy safety and biomarker results will be presented at ECTRIMS in September. Continuing in MS, EC approval was received for an extended indication for TYSABRI in highly active relapsing remitting MS patients with an adequate response to prior MS therapy. TYSABRI was previously only indicated for patients who had failed to respond to beta interferon or glatiramer acetate. This label extension follows recent EC approval for a new patient management plan, including an updated risk algorithm based on JC Virus antibody index values. These changes will allow physicians to have more individualized benefit-risk discussions with their patients. Turning to other promising late-stage assets, our collaboration partner Ionis continues to execute the Phase 3 studies of nusinersen for infants and children with spinal muscular atrophy, both of which are now fully enrolled. In Alzheimer's disease, it was recently announced that aducanumab was one of only four applicants accepted into the European Medicines Agency's PRIority MEdicines program, or PRIME. PRIME aims to bring treatments to patients faster by enhancing the EMA's support for the development of investigational medicines for diseases without available treatment or in need of better treatment options. We continue to work diligently to enroll our aducanumab Phase 3 trials. Looking ahead, safety data from the titration arm of the Phase 1b study is anticipated by the end of this year. We are working toward the start of Phase 3 trials for amiselimod or MT-1303 in inflammatory bowel disease and BIIB074, formerly known as raxatrigine, in trigeminal neuralgia, and initiation of a Phase 2 trial with BIIB074 in patients with neuropathic pain from lumbosacral radiculopathy is planned for later this year. In further activities, natalizumab's clinical profile and treatment window supports its continued investigation as a potential novel approach for treating acute ischemic stroke. And the first patient was recently dosed in a second Phase 2 study in stroke called ACTION 2. Encouraging data was recently generated on earlier stage assets BIIB059 or anti-BDCA2 for systemic lupus erythematosus, and BG00011 or STX-100 for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Anti-BDCA2 data in healthy volunteers and a lupus cohort of 12 subjects has provided confidence to move into Phase 2, with trial initiation planned to begin over the summer. These data are anticipated to be presented later this year. The BG00011 study is enrolling its final cohort, and it is expected that data will be presented after the trial completes. Finally, as George mentioned, Biogen announced a broad collaboration and alliance with the University of Pennsylvania and Drs. James Wilson and Jean Bennett to advance gene therapy and gene editing technologies. The expansive research and translational development collaboration has multiple objectives and will primarily focus on the development of therapeutic approaches that target the eye, skeletal muscle, and the central nervous system. Again, I am pleased to participate in my first earnings call here at Biogen. I anticipate sharing more detail on the advancement of the Biogen pipeline in the coming months as the company works diligently to deliver new therapies to patients. With that, I will now pass the call to my good colleague, Michel Vounatsos. Michel Vounatsos - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP : Thanks, Mike. I'm very pleased to be with you this morning. I'll share my initial thoughts on the MS market and our MS portfolio, outline my priorities going forward, and then I will discuss this quarter's results for MS products. Since I arrived at Biogen three months ago, I have spent time in the field with our operations team meeting with patients, the neurology community, and many of the scientific leaders in multiple sclerosis. Also, I have engaged with the strong Biogen leaders across our commercial organizations. I have listened and learned a lot, and together with the team, we have prioritized immediate opportunities across four key areas. We believe these opportunities will benefit our MS franchise today and at the same time prepare the organization for potential future product launches. Before speaking about our therapies, I think it is important to note MS is a growing market, with approximately 850,000 treated patients worldwide out of a global prevalence estimated at 2.3 million, which includes progressive forms of MS. We estimate the number of treated patients worldwide is growing in the mid-single digits on an annual basis, driven by low single digit growth in the U.S. and high single digit growth in Europe. The relatively higher market growth rate overseas is largely due to increasing rates of diagnosis and treatment. And as a leader in MS, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from this trend over time. Using the U.S. as an example, where we have the most detailed data, we estimate that approximately three-quarters of the 300,000 treated patients are stable and presumably satisfied on their current therapy. We believe Biogen is holding a clear leadership position in the stable segment of the market. We believe the dynamic opportunity of patients in the U.S. is comprised of approximately 15,000 newly diagnosed patients and approximately 60,000 patients changing medication each year. We believe that Biogen also holds a leadership position in new-patient starts within this dynamic portion of the market. Turning to our MS portfolio, we believe that the value of our products is well-recognized in the eyes of many of our customers, as reflected in our leading global market share of approximately 38%. We believe the breadth of our portfolio is and will continue to be a source of strength in the marketplace by allowing physicians to describe the right drugs to the right patients at the right time. As the most-prescribed oral therapy for MS worldwide, TECFIDERA benefits from a compelling combination of efficacy, convenience, and relative safety. As a result, we estimate that TECFIDERA captures roughly 25% of newly diagnosed and switching patients. Our market research indicates that TYSABRI is clearly viewed and differentiated in terms of efficacy and retains an important role for patients with highly active disease, capturing roughly 30% of all patients switching for efficacy reasons. Our interferon products, AVONEX and PLEGRIDY combined, hold leading share amongst the interferon therapies. Despite facing headwinds due to the uptake of the orals, we believe these products will continue to play an important role going forward. We are also preparing to launch ZINBRYTA next month in the U.S. and Germany. ZINBRYTA is the first in a new class of MS therapies. We believe it will be used by patients switching for efficacy reasons, benefiting from once-monthly at home subcutaneous administration and a differentiated mechanism of action. Going forward, we will concentrate our work in the commercial organization across four key priorities, namely portfolio strategy, commercial excellence, medical leadership, trust and value. With portfolio strategy, we plan to further define our strategy for products, market segments, and geographies. We will work to ensure that our targeted growth opportunities drive consistency across our resource allocation, messaging, marketing tactics, and sales force execution. Within commercial excellence, we will work to increase our sophistication in multichannel marketing, including enhancing our digital capabilities while also strengthening our engagement with key customers at the local level. While clearly perceived as a leader in neurology research and clinical development, we believe we also have an opportunity to further enhance our medical leadership. This includes close collaboration with our medical field teams and partnership with scientific leaders. Finally, trust and value. We will work towards developing innovatives beyond the pill solution for our customers to enhance our reputation and strengthen our partnership and role as a leader in MS. I think that, as the leader in MS, we have this responsibility. Today we already have a well-defined plan outlining next steps and target dates, which we have started to implement across the organization. We are initiating this with the aim to accelerate our business to be more focused, to make conscious choices, and to be diligent in resource allocation. We believe that this work will be beneficial for our company and our shareholders. For competitive reasons, I am not prepared to go more into the details of these four initiatives, but I look forward to updating you on our progress at future meetings. Turning to the results for the quarter, total MS revenues were $2.2 billion this quarter, an increase of 9% versus Q2 of last year. We believe our global market share continued to grow. Starting with TECFIDERA, in the U.S. we saw a modest increase in demand compared to the first quarter, largely due to a normalization of seasonality typically seen early in the year. All of our metrics lead us to expect a continued stable trend for TECFIDERA going forwards. Outside the U.S., we continue to see increased adoption in the UK, Italy, Spain. In fact, the number of TECFIDERA patients in Europe has increased approximately 40% over the last year. PLEGRIDY is now available in roughly 20 markets in Europe and, well launched, we believe it is helping to slow the rate of decline of our interferons. TYSABRI continued to add patients this quarter. We recognize the potential for increased competition from other high-efficacy therapies, but we believe TYSABRI's 10 years of post-marketing experience and well-understood safety profile position it very well. In collaboration with AbbVie, we are actively preparing to launch ZINBRYTA starting next month. We are particularly encouraged by the broad indication and data reinforcing the product safety included in the EU label. We are also making progress in our biosimilar businesses this quarter. We are seeing strong initial uptake for BENEPALI, the first biosimilar approved in the EU referencing Enbrel, and we expect to launch FLIXABI, our biosimilar referencing Remicade, in the coming weeks. While we only expect a modest contribution from biosimilars in 2016, we do believe this is an attractive opportunity in the longer term. So the team delivered a very solid quarter. I look forward to taking Biogen into what I believe is an exciting future. With that, I turn the call over to Paul. Paul J. Clancy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Biogen, Inc.: Thanks, Michel. In the second quarter, our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.79, a 22% increase year over year, while our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $5.21, an increase of 23%. Total revenue for Q2 grew 12% year over year to approximately $2.9 billion. It's important to note we had $173 million in foreign exchange hedge gains in the full year of 2015, which impact our year-over-year revenue comparisons this year. In Q2, versus prior year, revenues were unfavorably impacted by $45 million from hedging. Combined with the $1 million benefit from foreign exchange rates, overall revenue was weakened by approximately $44 million year over year. I'll highlight the impact of foreign exchange and hedging on each of our major MS therapies. Global second quarter TECFIDERA revenue was $987 million, an increase of 12% versus the same quarter last year. This included revenues of $780 million in the U.S. and $206 million outside the U.S. In the U.S., TECFIDERA modestly benefited from an inventory rebalancing in the wholesaler channel versus prior quarter. Outside the U.S., foreign exchange and hedge impact weakened TECFIDERA revenue comparison by approximately $13 million. Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $728 million during the second quarter, an increase of 6% versus the same quarter last year. This included $519 million in the U.S. and $209 million in sales outside the U.S. In the U.S., AVONEX also modestly benefited from an inventory rebalancing in the wholesaler channel versus prior quarter. Outside the U.S., foreign exchange and the hedge impact weakened interferon revenue comparison by approximately $17 million. TYSABRI worldwide revenues were $497 million this quarter, an increase of 7% versus the same quarter last year. This included $305 million in the U.S. and $192 million outside the U.S. Foreign exchange and the hedge impact weakened TYSABRI revenue comparison by approximately $13 million. Turning to our hemophilia business, which generated $205 million this quarter. ELOCTATE revenue for the quarter was $125 million, and ALPROLIX revenue in Q2 was $80 million. We continue to work toward spinning off our hemophilia business and related assets and plan to file the Form 10 later this summer and complete the distribution in early 2017. Turning to our anti-CD20 revenues. We recorded $349 million for Q2, an increase from prior quarter, driven by solid demand. Total other revenues, which include revenues from collaboration relationships, royalties, and contract manufacturing, were $79 million. Now turning to the expense lines on the P&L. Q2 GAAP cost of goods sold were $370 million, or 13% of revenue. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold were $354 million or 12% of revenue. As a percentage of sales, COGS was impacted by increased inventory write-offs versus the low seen in prior quarter. In addition, based on our evaluation of our small-scale manufacturing capacity needs, we booked a GAAP-only charge for accelerated depreciation related to our intent to close or divest our small-scale manufacturing facility in Cambridge. Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense was $473 million or 16% of revenue, which includes $20 million related to the gene therapy collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania. Overall, R&D reflects relatively low business development expense, though this remains a critical strategic priority for us as we look to bring in high-quality assets. Q2 GAAP SG&A was $492 million or 17% of revenue. Q2 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $489 million, also 17% of revenue. We remain committed to achieving savings by reducing lower priority fees and services for the balance of the year. Recall, over the last few years we've gone through a number of product launches and thought it was the right decision to invest behind these products. Starting in 2015, we pivoted and took a number of actions to curb operating expense growth, including a restructuring and further efforts to reduce costs, which is reflected in our operating leverage for the quarter. This will also allow us to reinvest in the pipeline. Other net expense was $59 million in Q2, which includes $66 million in interest expense related to our 2015 bond offering. In Q2, both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were approximately 25%. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 219 million for Q2. This brings us to our diluted earnings per share, which were $4.79 on a GAAP basis and $5.21 on a non-GAAP basis for the second quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $7.3 billion in cash and marketable securities, with approximately 40% of this in the United States. Today we also announced a $5 billion share repurchase program, which we anticipate will be executed over the course of the next three years. We believe this leaves ample room for flexibility for strategic deployment. So, overall, we had a strong quarter driven by revenue growth from our MS therapies, rebounding from the seasonality seen in the first quarter; continued growth from our hemophilia business; and diligent cost controls. This now brings us to our full-year 2016 guidance. We now expect revenues of approximately $11.2 billion to $11.4 billion, a modest improvement from prior guidance. Our outlook assumes continued stable patient demand for TECFIDERA in 2016 in the United States. We believe TYSABRI will also remain on a stable trajectory for the balance of the year. Our outlook assumes AVONEX and PLEGRIDY patients combined will continue to gradually decline as patients move toward orals. For ZINBRYTA, we anticipate a modest revenue contribution in the U.S. and EU, as launches are expected to begin in August. And our revenues outlook is based on stable foreign exchange rates. From an expense perspective, we anticipate upward pressure on cost of goods sold due to the unexpected issuance by the U.S. Patent Office of a patent to a third-party related to recombinant interferon beta protein. This patent, issued on June 28 and expiring in June 2033, is relevant to AVONEX and PLEGRIDY. We will pay royalties in the mid-single-digits during the life of this patent. For the remainder of 2016, we expect the royalty payment to be approximately $50 million. We anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense between 17% and 18% of sales, and GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A expense to be between 16% and 17% of revenue. We anticipate GAAP EPS results between $18.10 and $18.40 and non-GAAP EPS to be between $19.70 and $20.00. Our outlook assumes a very modest reduction in our full-year weighted average diluted share count. Of note, this guidance assumes contribution from our hemophilia business through the balance of the year, as we expect the spin-off to complete in early 2017. Additionally, this guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or large, late-stage business development transactions, as both are hard to predict. Overall, this increase in guidance reflects the solid revenues seen this quarter, combined with the continued operating expense control. I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments. George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thank you, Paul. Financially, I'm pleased with where we are so far this year. Our results year to date have been better than expected. We've raised guidance, and we have a new share repurchase program authorized by the board. We've made good progress towards the three focus areas I discussed after the first quarter : careful management of expenses, maximizing revenues, and rapidly advancing the pipeline. As I look forward and think about the future growth of Biogen, I want to stress how those key focus areas will evolve. The team expects to continue managing expenses, but as you know we can't save our way to growth. Maximizing revenues and rapidly advancing the pipeline will become front and center, especially with Michel and Mike now in their respective roles. Michel's four key priorities of portfolio strategy, commercial excellence, medical leadership, and trust and value will be the pillars we use to maximize revenues. And, under Mike's leadership, we intend to reshape the pipeline, rationalize existing programs, and aggressively pursue promising assets, both internally and externally. We believe this focus will help advance more assets through the pipeline and ideally deliver more therapies to patients. At the same time as we're bringing focus and investment to our core area of expertise in neurology, we'll continue to be opportunistic when we see internal and external opportunities to enhance shareholder value. As a result, we've progressed some of the most promising earlier stage assets that we have in our pipeline, even outside of neurology. We've invested in our biosimilar joint venture to leverage our competitive strengths in manufacturing and commercialization. We've chosen to spin off our growing hemophilia business, because we believe it's the right decision to ensure fit and focus. And, as we've announced today, we'll buy back shares when appropriate. So we've delivered strong financial results this quarter while making progress advancing our pipeline and our commercial business. We have a great leadership team and a passionate group of employees who come to work every day to make a positive impact on patients' lives. It's been an honor and privilege to serve this organization as the CEO for the last six years, and I remain committed to leading the company until my successor is identified. I want to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication. And I want to thank you all for joining us this morning. And the operator will now open up the call for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC : Oh, hey, guys. Hey, just wanted \u2013 George, I wanted to say, I just \u2013 the stock only quintupled under your leadership. So I was wondering if you could \u2013 I think you should be held accountable for that. So I was wondering if you could address that. No, congratulations. You will be missed. Thanks for the honesty, transparency that you brought to Biogen over the years. And I'd like to know who your least-favorite sell-side analyst is, please. Or just assure me that it's not me. George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer : It's definitely not you. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Got it. George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer : Especially after that last comment. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Very good. And, Paul, if you could - Paul J. Clancy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Biogen, Inc.: You moved up from the bottom, Mark. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC : Patriots still suck. My question is \u2013 this has been asked before, but I just want to kind of engage you guys in a little bit of discussion. Why not release the efficacy data from the titration cohort of the amab trial, given that \u2013 I know it's small numbers, but the numbers aren't that much smaller than the individual dose arms that we've already seen. And the follow-up is just can you update us with any specifics on enrollment? Is enrollment tracking within your expectations? And can you just remind us at this point when you'd expect data readouts and if there are interims? Thanks. Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer : Hi, Mark, this is Al. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC : Hey, Al. Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer : Hey. So yeah, I mean, if \u2013 it makes sense that the number of patients is roughly the same. Our plan is to introduce the safety data, the tolerability data from the titration. But \u2013 and efficacy is an exploratory endpoint. I'm sure at some scientific meeting we'll be able to disclose that for completeness' sake. And in terms of enrollment, we're not really commenting on it except to say that we're pleased and that things are on track and we hope to update you more on that in the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. My congrats to George as well on all your accomplishments, and best of luck in the future. I guess a question on the business development front. As you talk about aggressively reshaping the pipeline and pursuing promising assets, I'm curious your latest thinking in terms of stage of development, sizes of potential deals, the types of assets therapeutically that you might focus on. How are you thinking these days about balancing maintenance of focus on neurology versus further diversifying the business, and how does the CEO transition potentially affect all these goals? Thanks. George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, well, first, let me take that last point first. I don't think the CEO transition affects these goals at all. The company's committed to bolstering the pipeline, and we're working aggressively to do that. And, actually, we would look at deals at all stages of development from pre-clinical through Phase 3. And we are currently doing that. We're in a number of discussions now, and we hope to bring some of those to conclusion. We are focused largely on neurology. That's where we have our core expertise. And I think we believe that the \u2013 you can make more sophisticated decisions about things in areas that you understand really in detail. So mainly we're looking in neurology. With Mike's arrival, we have a new person here who's got his own set of expertise, his own views on things. And I would say we wouldn't rule out things outside of neurology, but the bar gets higher as they get further from our center of excellence. As Mike put it yesterday, we want to have kind of laser vision, but we don't want to have tunnel vision. We want to be open to things that are interesting and can provide shareholder value. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges, from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Thank you very much for taking the question. And, George, we're not sure what's so special about California, but all the very best of luck with your next chapter. And thanks again for all the information you've shared with us and for the success you've had at Biogen. George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Geoff. I would say if you're not sure what's special about it, you haven't been there. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : So, one question \u2013 a couple of questions for Michel, actually. Michel, could you give us a sense of what your contributions from price and volume were on the MS franchise during the quarter on the U.S. side? And then what your price \u2013 contributional price effect was on the ex-U.S. side? And then could you secondly add, as you look at the MS franchise, presumably you will have no role in ocrelizumab's commercialization, but nevertheless they're your partner. Could you give us your view of how you see that playing out, in terms of the effect that that drug might have in the MS market and on the outlook for Biogen's own products? Thanks. Michel Vounatsos - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP : Thanks for the question. And let me start with ocre, and Paul will comment on the other part of the question. First, I would like to say that we are very pleased and we applaud any new innovation in MS, for which we have contributed, we contribute, and we continue to invest in our pipe. So this is a great news for patients in need, that there are still gaps in therapy. And I think this is a great news, and Roche's results on PPMS is even more encouraging. So we are very happy about that. Having said that, we have a strong presence in the high-efficacy segment of the market. And this is basically a market trend where we can see that basically providers are treating earlier \u2013 and physicians \u2013 treating earlier, more aggressively. And TYSABRI is holding a very strong position in the highest efficacy segment, and ZINBRYTA will come and will complement this presence here. So I anticipate that ocre will be playing into this segment also, and we will see how it plays. But, for the time being, there is no risk-benefit assessment. So we have to be very cautious before talking. So I'll wait to see regulator stands, but I would say the first approach from, again, a humble but leadership position is to take care of our assets and elevate the capability of the organization, and the four capabilities that we are launching will just do that. Paul J. Clancy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Biogen, Inc.: Geoff, this is Paul on the price versus volume question. I think the way you framed it is probably pretty accurate, is that it's a tale of two cities. In the United States, the lion's share from a change year-over-year basis is price, and is pretty stable unit trends on TECFIDERA, pretty stable unit trends on TYSABRI and modest, gradual decline on the interferon franchise. Ex-United States, we are not seeing any pricing on a year-over-year basis, and all of the gains are attributable to volume and unit expansion. TYSABRI is holding well outside the United States, as well as the interferon business. And we continue to, in a small way, penetrate some markets and get some accretive benefits of things, even outside of Europe. And TECFIDERA continues to expand on a year-over-year basis and gaining market share, particularly as we are moving into relatively early launch timing in Southern European countries and having very good success in the UK. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question, and congrats, George. Good to see you leave on a high note. Best of luck with the next opportunity. Maybe just a quick one for Paul on this new interferon patent that you're paying royalty on or expect to pay royalty on. Can you clarify a little bit whose patent that is and what happened to your own interferon patent that you thought was, at one point, going to be able to extract royalties from others? Paul J. Clancy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Biogen, Inc.: Yeah, great question, Eric. Thanks. It was, as I noted, unexpected that it is not actually related \u2013 despite it is on the recombinant interferon beta protein, it's actually not the same. It has to do with JFCR. In the Q this afternoon, we'll actually have the patent number for you. I just actually don't have it handy for myself, and it's a mid-single digit royalty. We aren't disclosing the name of the third party, but \u2013 so just a third party at this point in time. And we expect it will be $50 million impact, all in the second half, effectively, and will be a bigger impact as we go into 2017 on a full-year basis. The '755 patent, we continue to feel like that was a \u2013 despite its \u2013 was like back to 2009, when it was issued, but we still feel and we're still in litigation with other parties on that. But there's a chance that we're coming towards the end of that process; hope for something favorable. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Morning, guys, Thanks for the question. George, also want to offer my congrats. You will be missed. So I had a question for Michel, maybe a bigger-picture commercial question. Now that you've had a chance to look at the products, the assets at Biogen, and a fresh look at the MS market, maybe just give us some perspective on what you see as the bigger growth opportunities ahead on a volume basis. Is it geographic? Is it rest-of-world opportunities? Is it new product launches? And then maybe for Paul, just wanted to check and see what you guys learned from the DTC campaign for tech and the sustainability of that. Thanks. Michel Vounatsos - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP : Thank you for the great question. You know, in my 25 years' experience around the world, I have never seen such a situation whereby we have five or six assets in the same therapy area. The 20 years of very solid \u2013 unique, I would say \u2013 experience in MS, a solid portfolio today. A solid pipeline. A remarkable group of talent with clinical experience and scientific experience within the company. So it's a leadership position on interferons, a leadership position on orals. A leadership position on high-efficacy products. So this is a remarkable situation. And on top of that we are launching ZINBRYTA. So the dynamic is very good. Having said that, when you peel the onion and you get to discover the opportunity and the operations, you find ways to do better. And this is why together with the team we have prioritized four key areas, portfolio management, five, six assets in the same therapy area. It's a challenge on how to manage that well. Commercial excellence, medical leadership, trust and value. And I believe that, with those, we'll be able to make a further difference. Geographically, also, we can see that some parts are better managed than others. And I have already started to make some decisions. We don't wait. And you can expect that more will come. So this is what I would like to say \u2013 and, you know, the portfolio management doesn't mean that all the products will be resourced and promoted equally. It's all about the growth opportunity, the way that you outline. And this is where there will be a clear, I would say, alignment between those, resource allocation, and execution. Paul J. Clancy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Biogen, Inc.: Geoff, the beginning part of your question is \u2013 yeah, just to confirm, we have sunsetted the television campaign as it relates to TECFIDERA. I think our \u2013 I mean, look, it was a innovative \u2013 I'd applaud our organization for thinking about it and giving it a try. I think that our judgment at this point is that it didn't have a discernible movement on scripts. And potentially came \u2013 this more, as much from anecdotal \u2013 with some drawbacks as well. Michel actually confirmed his \u2013 from his perspective that there quite possibly is much other levers that are still like DTC-related and multichannel-related that we can reallocate resources toward. So I think that's probably our learnings in a nutshell. We didn't run the test case, so we'll see what \u2013 but I think that's our learnings. Michel Vounatsos - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP : Thank you, Paul. This is Michel. If I can add \u2013 I mean, at the outset, and I was not here, the main objective was increase awareness, and I think that this was achieved. But I didn't see any inflection on any trends. We need to circle back to the alignment of the organization on four priorities for which we need to have some very strict resource allocation decisions, and I don't think that broadcast TV will be there in the foreseeable future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Whitney G. Ijem - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. This is Whitney on for Cory. I'll add my congrats to George as well. I guess just to circle back on Alzheimer's. I guess, where are you with sort of combinations, and I guess what's the desire or urgency to get some of the combos into the clinic before you maybe have Phase 3 data on any of the individual components? Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer : This is Al, Whitney, and we like the idea of combinations. I think one day we will be using combination therapies for Alzheimer's disease. One of the reasons why we brought in BACE inhibitor into our pipeline with our collaboration with Eisai, the reason why we have tau programs internally and that we're in search of even other things potentially to add to the mix is based on, in part, on that belief, that combination could be helpful. And you can think of it in two ways. One is to combine two drugs, each of which are active, to increase the efficacy overall, or to reduce the dose of two active therapies so that you get better safety or tolerability for the same efficacy. And also there may be sequential treatments where you start early, perhaps even before symptoms, with one type of medicine and then treat with something else when you have a high plaque burden, and then something else still when tau starts to progress. When you start to think about combination therapy, though, it's often difficult to do the right studies without some evidence of efficacy of each drug as monotherapy. And then you can start to think about the right dosing regimen. And so I hope that's helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Oh, hey, thanks. Good morning. My appreciation to George as well. Happy to see you joining me on the West Coast. I'm lonely out here, so happy to have you back here. Hey, a question for Al. There will be LINGO data presented at ECTRIMS. Can you maybe revisit this briefly and give us some color about what is going on here in terms of what we saw? Because obviously that was a surprise. And I guess is there anything specific that we should pay attention to at ECTRIMS that you've done work on that would pique our interest back here? Or is there some issue here with the remyelination pathway and that would bring our questions into your oral. So how does this change our thinking about remyelination and what we saw here? Thanks. Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Neurology Discovery & Development Center, Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Area and Chief Medical Officer : Yeah, Michael, thanks for the question. So first I want to say this is a really large and rich data set. Really the first of its kind, not only in MS, but to my knowledge, in neurology where we're in the early stages of figuring out how to repair the brain and how to measure measurements of \u2013 outcome measures of repair. The things we're focusing on right now when we look at this rich data set are what are the right cohort of patients to treat? In this trial, we looked at relapsing MS patients all the way to secondary progressives. So it's a wide range of patients. What's the optimal cohort? What's the right dose? We studied four different doses, and we saw a complex dose-response curve. What we actually saw was a sort of a bell-shaped curve where we lost efficacy at the highest dose, and in the middle doses we think we see a signal of efficacy. And so we'll share some of that at ECTRIMS. What's the right concomitant medicine to use? We envision that these repair therapies will be added to immunomodulators, and so we'll be looking at that. And, in particular, whether ongoing inflammation in the brain impedes repair. And finally how do we actually measure the effects of repair if it occurs, particularly on clinical outcome measures? So some of these questions will be answered by doing further analyses, which we're in the middle of doing right now intensively. And we'll share whatever we find out at ECTRIMS, and some may need another study. And so what we're honing in on is what's the next step? What's the next study? And obviously this will be a judicious investment. If we can go to Phase 3, we would try. I don't know until I see the specific design. It could be a Phase 2, it could be a Phase 3, it could be a Phase 2/3. And that part we probably won't be able to share at ECTRIMS, but sometime soon we hope to be able to share that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question. I guess, George, I remember meeting you when you first became the CEO, and I remember you talking about refocusing the company and like getting rid of certain pipeline products, and it was so well-needed at the time. It really changed Biogen. And so now I think the company's a different company, and there's been pipeline success and there's been some failures. What do you think Biogen really needs from a new CEO at this point in time versus when you came in? George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer : Well, look, the company now is a very different company from what it was a few years ago. We have a full and excellent management team. We have a pipeline that is, I think, quite exciting but needs to grow. So I think the company needs good management. I think the strategy of the company is solid. And what we need is good leadership and somebody who can work with the people who are here \u2013 work with Michel, maximize the commercial potential, work with Mike, maximize the potential of our pipeline, grow the pipeline, and can work with the rest of the organization to ensure that we go forward in a way that is responsible, where we minimize expenses but that where we invest aggressively in those areas that really have the potential to add value. So being CEO is complicated, and I think those are the priorities I would set. Of course the search will be conducted by the board, but I don't think they would view it too differently. I think there'll be a continued focus on innovation, and I'm confident we'll get someone excellent. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Ronny Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning, and thank you my questions. Two questions first. Biosimilars, you had a pretty good first quarter. Can you describe a little bit to us where you've launched already, where you're still expecting to launch? And now that you have a little bit of \u2013 wetted your feet in that market \u2013 can you just give us a feel for your thinking about kind of the three- to five-year trajectory for this franchise and for biosimilar for anti-TNFs? In Europe in general, should this be 30% of the market, 50%, 70% of the market overall? And then separately, you kind of mentioned the impact of high detectible copays on the U.S. sales in the first quarter. Has there been still some impact to those in the second quarter? That is, as we look from the outside of revenue, should we see another step up in revenue per unit in the third quarter, or has it been fully incorporated in the first quarter, and kind of the run rate for pricing in the second quarter is roughly what we should see going forward? Michel Vounatsos - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP : So this is Michel. Thanks for the great question. So as you have seen, two great companies came together with complementary capabilities in order to launch anti-TNFs to get started with, and then we see what is the follow-up opportunities. So as far as Biogen involved together with the partners, we have launched the products; the three anti-TNFs for which we have the agreement on, two out of the three are approved and on the way to be launched. The preliminary results are very encouraging. As you can imagine, there is a tremendous level of variation \u2013 variability between countries in terms of tendering, in terms of [aggressivity of petition] in terms of provider decision-making, and it's difficult to take an overall, I would say, recipe on how to best launch. What I can say is that the three anti-TNFs that we'll have the opportunity to launch will be addressing a current market that is higher than $9 billion in Europe. So this is significant. And with Biogen quality. So we have put together a standalone BU that is flexible, agile, in order to launch the product, and we learn country after country. Today, mostly in the Nordics and Scandinavia, where we have had very, very good results. But, as I said earlier, it's still early to comment much on the results that are negligible for 2016 but will be more important moving forwards. Paul J. Clancy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Biogen, Inc.: Ronny, this is Paul. Thanks for the second part of that question. It's a good catch. I think the answer is that we absolutely saw our insurance dynamics mostly impact AVONEX in the first quarter. And we're pleased to see that that choppiness settled out and benefited the second quarter results. Don't expect it to be a meaningful difference for the balance of year now. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Chris Raymond from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in, and congrats, George, from us as well. Just a question I guess on TECFIDERA. In the context of \u2013 I think you highlighted in Q1 a $20 million inventory drawdown. Could you maybe quantify \u2013 I think you highlighted generally there was an inventory effect in Q2. Can you quantify what that was? And then also if I can on TECFIDERA, continuing, I hear what you're saying on the television ads, but one of the things that has struck us the most with our checks is TECFIDERA, for some time, has been sort of far and away the most requested disease modifying therapy among patients. I guess I'm wondering, what additional levers can you pull to sort of increase that? Or is there some other aspect like maybe working at better efficiency programs to get that request converted into a script? Is there some other aspect besides just getting patients to request the drug? Paul J. Clancy - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Biogen, Inc.: Yeah, thanks, Chris. It's Paul; I'll talk the first part. It's quite simply, I think we're at a \u2013 pretty normal inventory levels on TECFIDERA, so it's really just a sequential quarter rebalancing off of the seasonal low that we generally see in Q1. Michel Vounatsos - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP : So on the levers and the performance, 12% growth Q-over-Q is not bad. The share continues to grow to 15% globally, is also pretty good, mostly driven by the newly launched markets in Europe, 40% patient growth percentage is also very encouraging. I have, from my field visits and from talking to leaders, identified one major issue, which is the discontinuation due to GI safety. Those patients during the first phase on the product are suffering, for some of them, on abdominal pain, diarrhea, discomfort, that is leading, in some cases, with very high level of variability, to discontinue the product. And this impacts not only the outflow but eventually the inflow. Variability is tremendous. I was in the field lately, and on the Eastern coast in the U.S., 1.5% of the patient discontinued at six months. In some others, it was 30%. So, with Mike Ehlers, we are fully aligned in order to work together with the community, with the physicians, with peer to peer in order to best assist, best educate, and bring down an average which is at 20% today to lower levels. George A. Scangos - Chief Executive Officer : Okay. With that, thank you all for joining us this morning. Thanks for the questions, and we'll sign off now. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Operator : Good morning. My name is Dan, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen third quarter 2016 financial results and business update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I now would like to turn the conference over to Matthew Calistri, Senior Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Matthew Calistri - Biogen, Inc.: Thank you, Dan, and welcome, everyone, to Biogen's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. George Scangos; Dr. Michael Ehlers, EVP of Research and Development; our Chief Commercial Officer, Michel Vounatsos; and our CFO, Paul Clancy. We'll also be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Al Sandrock. Now I'll turn the call over to George. George A. Scangos - Biogen, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm happy to say Biogen delivered another solid quarter, complete with strong financial performance and significant advancements in the pipeline. For the third quarter of 2016, Biogen generated a record $3 billion in revenues, a 6% increase from the same period a year ago. Our GAAP earnings were $4.71 per share, a 13% increase versus Q3 last year. and non-GAAP earnings were $5.19 per share, a 16% increase. I'll come back to the financials in a minute, but first I'd like to highlight some of the important third quarter pipeline progress. One of the most exciting milestones this quarter was the positive interim analysis of nusinersen in the ENDEAR study. Recognizing the tremendous need in the SMA community, we moved quickly, established the Expanded Access program, and completed the NDA filing with the FDA in less than two months, the fastest filing time in Biogen's 38-year history. We continue to be grateful to the patients, families, investigators, and employees who worked tirelessly to bring this program to this point. We've also filed with the EMA, where nusinersen has received Accelerated Assessment status. If approved, nusinersen would be the first treatment for patients with spinal muscular atrophy, a leading genetic cause of death in infants. We were honored when one of our key pipeline programs was featured on the cover of Nature, specifically, the results of our preclinical research and Phase 1b study of aducanumab. This rare distinction was a first for Biogen research and one that I think further highlights the important work that we're doing in the area of Alzheimer's disease. We also announced that aducanumab was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA. Our commercial business continued to deliver solid results this quarter. We furthered our leadership in MS through the launch of ZINBRYTA in collaboration with AbbVie, and we continued to grow the number of patients benefiting from our full portfolio of MS products. Our third quarter hemophilia revenues grew to $217 million, and we've made further progress with the spinoff of our hemophilia business into a separate, independent, publicly traded company, known as Bioverativ, with the initial filing of the Form 10 in August. We continue to expect to complete that transaction in early 2017. In Europe, we doubled our biosimilars revenues over the prior quarter, as BENEPALI continues to launch in markets across the continent and pick up share at a rate previously unseen for a biosimilar anti-TNF. And we launched FLIXABI, our biosimilar of infliximab. We continue to believe that our work in biosimilars is an important growth opportunity for Biogen. So we've seen great progress in both our pipeline and our commercial portfolio during the quarter. As you'll hear shortly from Mike and Michel, our entire executive leadership team is focused on driving commercial performance, prioritizing our assets, advancing our clinical programs, and reshaping our pipeline. And our 7,000 employees globally remain committed to delivering therapies that we believe can make a positive difference in the lives of patients. I'll now turn the call over to Mike so that he can give you a thorough update on our pipeline. Michael D. Ehlers - Biogen, Inc.: Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. Let me provide some highlights from this quarter, starting with multiple sclerosis. Last month at ECTRIMS, we presented clinical findings from our broad portfolio of MS therapies as well as top line results for opicinumab, or anti-LINGO, a potential neuroreparative therapy for people with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. We presented real-world data and clinical evidence showing that TECFIDERA consistently demonstrates strong efficacy by reducing MS disease activity in patients that have had up to 9 years of treatment. These data also affirm TECFIDERA's well characterized safety profile. Importantly, we believe these findings provide additional support for the early use of TECFIDERA to improve patient outcomes. Data were also presented for ZINBRYTA, our newly launched once-monthly, self-administered subcutaneous treatment option for relapsing forms of MS. A new post-hoc analysis from the pivotal DECIDE study showed that a significantly greater number of people treated with ZINBRYTA showed no evidence of disease activity compared to those taking intramuscular interferon. Additional new interim data from the long-term extension study, EXTEND, show that treatment with ZINBRYTA had long-term benefits in the proportion of patients who remained relapse-free as well as those who did not experience 24-week confirmed disability progression. For opicinumab, we presented top line results from the Phase 2 SYNERGY study in MS, in which opicinumab missed the primary endpoint. However, we believe the robust design of this study has allowed us to identify an appropriate patient population and dose to move forward with development. Within the 10 milligram per kilogram dosing arm of the study, we identified a treatment effect in patients whose MRI scans had specific features suggesting evidence of reduced myelination and intact axons at study entry. This subset represented approximately 1/4 of all patients in the SYNERGY study. Based on these data, we hypothesize that patients with similar features may have the potential to benefit from treatment with opicinumab. We are in the final stages of designing the next study and look forward to providing an update in the coming months. Turning to another late-stage asset, we made significant progress advancing nusinersen this quarter. As George highlighted, in August Biogen and Ionis announced that we met the pre-specified primary endpoint upon interim analysis of ENDEAR. In the analysis, patients with infantile onset SMA, or SMA consistent with Type 1, who were treated with nusinersen demonstrated a highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the achievement of motor milestones as measured by the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination. The responder analysis looked at achievement of tangible milestones like kicking, head control, rolling, sitting, crawling, standing, and walking. And we believe the results provide a real demonstration of the value nusinersen could bring for patients and their families. Data from the other endpoints analyzed were also consistently in favor of the treated infants. The ENDEAR study remains ongoing and will be stopped once enrolled patients complete their next office visit, when it is anticipated to happen for all patients before the end of the year. Once this occurs, we will be able to provide more detailed efficacy data, including an analysis on survival. During the quarter, we also successfully completed the rolling submission of the New Drug Application to the FDA for nusinersen. The U.S. filing was submitted less than two months after the positive interim analysis of the ENDEAR trial, a significant accomplishment for the company and recognition of the urgent need in this community. We have applied for Priority Review, which if granted will shorten the review period for nusinersen following the agency's acceptance of the filing. Earlier this month, we also filed a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency. The EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has granted nusinersen Accelerated Assessment status, which can also reduce the standard review time. And we look forward to working with both agencies over the coming months to bring this treatment to patients as quickly as possible. For nusinersen, our regulatory submissions are comprised of results from the pre-specified interim analysis of ENDEAR as well as all other clinical and preclinical data currently available, including open-label data in both Types 2 and 3 SMA patients. We are seeking a broad label for the treatment of SMA in our current filing applications in the U.S. and the EU. Our other randomized placebo-controlled Phase 3 study, CHERISH, in children with later-onset SMA consistent with Type 2, was fully enrolled in March this year and remains on track for completion in the first half of 2017. Earlier this month, we presented additional data for nusinersen at the 2016 World Muscle Society Congress in Granada, Spain. The presentations included safety results from the interim analysis of the Phase 3 ENDEAR study, which demonstrated a favorable safety profile. Analysis of the ongoing Phase 2 open-label study NURTURE demonstrated a positive effect in genetically diagnosed and pre-symptomatic SMA infants. In the NURTURE interim analysis, all 13 infants have demonstrated increases in mean Hammersmith Infant Neurological Exam scores over time, and no infants have discontinued, withdrawn from the study, or reached the primary endpoint of death or respiratory intervention in patients who have been enrolled for a minimum of 64 days and up to 13 months. A recent analysis of data from the CS2 and CS12 open-label studies in patients with later-onset SMA, which included both Type 2 and Type 3 patients, was also presented at World Muscle. The data showed that children with SMA treated with nusinersen exhibited improvements on several measures of motor function for up to nearly three years. These results are in contrast to the stable or slow decline in scores typically observed in patients with later-onset SMA over time. We continue to be encouraged by the consistently positive results for nusinersen, which we believe support its benefit in SMA. Now turning to Alzheimer's disease, during the quarter, a number of exciting developments occurred for our lead candidate, aducanumab. As George mentioned, results from preclinical research in the Phase 1b study of aducanumab were published in Nature, a significant achievement for the program and recognition of Biogen's high-caliber science. Aducanumab was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA, an important step in bringing this potential therapy to patients as quickly as possible. And in a recently completed interim analysis from the Phase 1b study, which included the titration cohort Arms 8 and 9 and a portion of the long-term extension study, efficacy and safety were consistent with results previously reported and support the design of the ongoing Phase 3 ENGAGE and EMERGE studies. The data from both the titration cohort and a portion of the long-term extension study of PRIME have been accepted to the ninth Clinical Trials in Alzheimer's Disease [CTAD] meeting in San Diego, and we look forward to sharing additional safety and efficacy data with you in December. We're also making important progress across our pipeline, and we continue to shape our R&D engine for the future. Last year we announced an agreement to license amiselimod, an oral sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, from Mitsubishi Tanabe. Since announcing the license agreement, we assessed the compound for a number of autoimmune indications, with a particular interest in inflammatory bowel disease. As we prioritize our strategic objectives and the IBD landscape continues to evolve, we've decided to discontinue our current development plan for amiselimod. As we mentioned last quarter, we generated encouraging Phase 1 data on BIIB059, our anti-BDCA2 for lupus. The anti-BDCA2 Phase 1 study included both healthy volunteers and a cohort of 12 lupus subjects. We anticipate presenting these data at ACR next month, including results from the lupus cohort. A Phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety is BIIB059 is underway, with the first subject dose this month. We're also working to advance BIIB074, a novel investigational state-dependent subtype selective sodium channel blocker for neuropathic pain. We have initiated an open-enrollment Phase 2b trial for lumbosacral radiculopathy, also known as sciatica. We are also close to completing enrollment in a small exploratory Phase 2a study in erythromelalgia, and we are working toward initiating a Phase 3 study in trigeminal neuralgia in 2017. BG00011 or STX-100 for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [IPF] is enrolling its final cohort in a Phase 2a study, and we expect to present the data after the trial completes in the second half of next year. BG00011 blocks alpha(v)beta disintegrin, which is selectively upregulated in epithelial cells and fibrotic conditions such as IPF, and is known to be a key mediator of TGF beta activation. We believe early safety and biomarker results from this study evaluating BG00011 in IPF patients are encouraging. In summary, we continue to make strong progress across our pipeline, and we are working aggressively to optimize and reshape our R&D activities, focusing resources to rapidly advance assets that present the greatest opportunity and address unmet need. With that, I will now pass the call to Michel. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Thank you, Mike. This is a solid quarter for our MS business. Our portfolio of MS therapies delivered revenues of $2.3 billion, an increase of 3% versus Q3 last year and 2% versus Q2. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, MS revenues increased 5% versus Q3 last year and 2.5% versus Q2. Biogen maintained its global leading market share of 38% and remains the leader for both newly diagnosed and switch patients, representing the dynamic portion of the MS market. As I communicated during our last call, the commercial organization is now focusing on four key opportunities : portfolio strategy; commercial excellence; medical leadership; trust and value. Since the beginning of Q3, we are now in execution mode, especially for MS in the U.S. With portfolio strategy, we have progressed and now identified our prioritized growth opportunities for now and 2017. It is all about making hard choices, driving consistency in resource allocation, and following through with tactical plans and execution. With commercial excellence, in the U.S. we have piloted and defined a specific engagement model with key MS centers. The rollout is expected to be completed by year end. Additionally, we are currently enhancing our sophistication in multichannel marketing, with a strong focus on digital execution capabilities. We need to meet our customers where they are, defined by the customer journey, to provide a seamless and differentiated Biogen engagement experience, whether through direct, digital, or other media. These are important steps, not only to improve performance in the short term, but also towards the creation of a new go-to-market model that is more effective and at a lower cost. In terms of medical leadership, during the third quarter, our R&D colleagues have identified several key opportunities as to how to improve MS care today. We believe we have the opportunity to bring to use a regular and competitive measurement of disease progression, including cognition and imaging. In addition, we just launched our MS Paths initiative that we believe will create a standardized high-quality data repository from the very diverse real-world patient population in the U.S. and EU. We believe this will open new and differentiated engagement opportunities with major MS clinical centers in the U.S. and in Europe. And finally, trust and value, we are developing \"beyond the pill\" solutions that we believe will meet customers' day-to-day needs in living with or treating MS. We are working on establishing the leading ecosystem for patients and providers to improve patient outcomes. We believe that Biogen is the only company that has the position and commitment to MS to be able to provide this level of support in a trustworthy and valuable way. Across these four priority areas, we have well-defined plans. And as I said, since early Q3, we are now in execution mode. Delivering on those well means enhancing the fundamental capability of the commercial operation at Biogen. These priorities are intended to not only drive performance for our inline products, but also to prepare the organization for current and future product launches. Turning to MS performance, in the U.S., the overall MS market has experienced a 2% decline in commercial patients versus Q3 last year; while in Europe, the market continues to grow, with a 7% increase in patients versus Q3 last year. For TECFIDERA, global market share has increased by approximately 1 point to 15% versus Q3 last year. In the U.S. we had a stable TECFIDERA performance. TECFIDERA continues to capture roughly half of all patients starting on an oral, with a current oral share of 51%. And overall patient share remains relatively stable at 20% since the beginning of the year. This is a clear leadership position for all three metrics. In Europe, there are approximately 65,000 patients on TECFIDERA, an increase of approximately 30% versus Q3 last year and approximately 4% versus Q2. TECFIDERA is now the most prescribed MS therapy in Germany, France, the UK, and Italy, with more recently launched markets continuing to drive patient growth. We do aspire to restore growth to the more mature markets, and we are very pleased to see early indicators that TECFIDERA gained share this quarter in France following two quarters of lagged performance. Over the past year, TYSABRI has seen steady incremental share gains globally as it continues to add patients, driven by increased share in the U.S. as well as in the emerging markets. As we continue to see a shift towards increased use of high-efficacy therapies, we believe TYSABRI is benefiting from growing first-line use in the U.S. In Europe, we are also encouraged by the recent update extending the indication for TYSABRI and allowing physicians to better optimize risk management based on JC virus antibody index values. Following the EU label approval, we have also received similar label updates in Japan, Canada, and Switzerland. Our interferon therapies continue to play an important role amongst the injectable portion of the market. We believe PLEGRIDY is helping to slow the decline of our interferons, though it does not completely compensate for the loss of AVONEX patients. In collaboration with AbbVie, we launched ZINBRYTA in August in the U.S. and Germany, and we just recently obtained approval in Australia. We believe the launch of ZINBRYTA comes at the right time, as we see a trend towards increased use of high-efficacy products with both current therapies and future entrants. While early in the launch, we are encouraged by the level of physician and patient interest in the strong product profile. In the U.S., for example, over half of our target physicians have completed enrollment on our REMS [Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy] program, enabling them to begin prescribing. These are early data, but we see indications that we are capturing many switching patients who otherwise might not have chosen a Biogen product. So it appears that our positioning and execution is working. Looking forward, we expect to receive reimbursement for ZINBRYTA in all the major European markets within the next 12 to 18 months. So overall, we had a solid performance this quarter across our MS business despite the recent slowdown in the overall MS commercial market in the U.S. We are also very excited about the continued progress of our biosimilar business. BENEPALI is now available in 13 countries. And in most markets, we are seeing a conversion rate superior to the first infliximab biosimilar launch in Europe, with up to 60% to 80% conversion in markets such as Norway or Denmark. With BENEPALI, we believe we are able to compete beyond price. We are seeing a strong preference for the BENEPALI auto-injector versus that of the originator, with our research indicating that 86% of the nurses prefer our device. We recently also launched our infliximab biosimilar, FLIXABI, which is now available in Germany, the UK, and the Netherlands, with three additional countries anticipated in Q4. We believe our ability to potentially be the first company to offer all three major anti-TNFs in Europe could put us in a position of strength in the market. We believe biosimilars are an important growth opportunity for Biogen as we work to optimize our engagement with stakeholders across the healthcare system. In summary, we had a very productive quarter across our MS business in terms of performance. We are encouraged with our new product launches, and we see clear progress as we work hard to elevate our commercial execution capabilities to new levels and as we improve our go-to-market model. Also, we are particularly excited about the potential to soon launch nusinersen for SMA. With approximately 20,000 patients across the U.S., Europe, and Japan, and no available treatments today, we believe nusinersen represents a significant opportunity for both Biogen, and more importantly, for the patients who today have no treatment option. With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul. Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: Thanks, Michel. In the third quarter, our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.71, a 13% increase versus Q3 last year, while our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $5.19, an increase of 16%. Total revenue for Q3 grew 6% versus Q3 last year to approximately $3 billion. Global third quarter TECFIDERA revenues were $1.034 billion, an increase of 10% versus Q3 of last year. This included revenues of $845 million in the U.S., an increase of 12% versus Q3 last year, and $189 million outside the U.S., an increase of 3% versus Q3 last year. In the U.S., we believe TECFIDERA benefited by approximately $40 million to $50 million versus Q2 due to inventory build in the channel. Outside the U.S., Q3 TECFIDERA decreased by $17 million versus Q2, largely driven by parallel trade dynamics. Versus Q3 last year, foreign exchange and hedge impact weakened TECFIDERA revenues by approximately $17 million. Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $708 million during the third quarter, a decrease of 10% versus Q3 last year. This included $506 million in the U.S. and $203 million in sales outside the U.S. In the U.S., we believe there was a drawdown of AVONEX inventory in the wholesale channel, resulting in approximately $10 million versus Q2. Outside the U.S., foreign exchange and hedge impact weakened interferon revenue by approximately $20 million versus Q3 last year. TYSABRI worldwide revenues were $515 million this quarter, an increase of 7% versus Q3 last year. This included $301 million in the U.S. and $214 million outside the U.S. Outside the U.S., TYSABRI revenues benefited by $20 million due to a favorable adjustment to our discounts and allowances. Foreign exchange and the hedge impact weakened TYSABRI revenue by approximately $16 million versus Q3 last year. Our hemophilia products continued to perform well this quarter. ELOCTATE revenues for the quarter were $132 million, an increase of 46% versus Q3 last year. This includes $110 million in the U.S. and $22 million outside the U.S. ALPROLIX revenues in Q3 were $85 million, an increase of 30% versus Q3 last year, including $67 million in the U.S. and $19 million outside the U.S. Our biosimilar business generated $31 million in revenues this quarter, driven primarily by BENEPALI. Turning to our AFICD-20 revenues, which include our profit share for RITUXAN and GAZYVA in the United States as well as our profit share and royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S., we recorded $318 million for Q3, a decrease from Q2, driven by a reduction in inventory from the second quarter. Total other revenues, which include revenues from collaboration relationships, royalties, and contract manufacturing, were $99 million in the third quarter. The increase versus Q2 was related to contract manufacturing for a strategic partner, slightly offset by a $13 million loss in our AbbVie collaboration profit share. Now turning to the expense lines on the P&L, Q3 GAAP cost of goods sold was $417 million or 14% of revenue. Non-GAAP COGS was $396 million or 13% of revenue. The increase versus Q2 was primarily attributable to a mid-single-digit royalty on U.S. sales of both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY. Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense was $529 million or 18% of revenue. Both GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense included a $75 million payment to Ionis related to the exercise of our opt-in right to develop and commercialize nusinersen globally. I'd like to note that our collaboration partner Eisai has stated their goal to start a Phase 3 trial for E2609. A $50 million milestone payment is expected to be triggered once the first patient is dosed in the E2609 Phase 3 trial, and there's a potential chance they could dose the first patient by the end of this year. The $50 million milestone was not considered in our midyear 2016 R&D guidance. Q3 GAAP SG&A expense was $463 million. Q3 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $461 million or 16% of revenue. Other net expense was $58 million in Q3, which includes $66 million in interest expense, primarily related to our 2015 bond offering. In Q3, both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were approximately 25%. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately $219 million for Q3, which brings us to our diluted earnings per share, which were $4.71 on a GAAP basis and $5.19 on a non-GAAP basis. We ended the quarter with $7.4 billion in cash and marketable securities, with approximately 40% of this in the United States. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of the company's common stock for a total value of $349 million. So as often, we had a number of puts and takes in the quarter, nevertheless a very solid financial quarter. I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments. George A. Scangos - Biogen, Inc.: Okay, thank you, Paul. I'm very pleased with what we've accomplished this quarter. We delivered solid commercial performance, strong financial results, and important advances in the pipeline. I'm particularly excited about the direction we're heading as we finish 2016 and look forward to 2017 and beyond. As I've said, I believe we're at the beginning of a transformative era in neurodegeneration, which could result in a new era for Biogen as well. We're already starting to see the types of discoveries that can be expected as science advances and innovative trial designs yield previously unseen results and insights. We believe the early data for aducanumab point to additional opportunities to invest in novel science to address Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. The insights we've gained from the SYNERGY trial are teaching us more about remyelination, and we're enthusiastic about moving opicinumab forward. And the encouraging results we're seeing from nusinersen point to the possibility that there can be entirely new mechanisms and modalities for treating the many daunting diseases of the central nervous system. I'm proud to have led Biogen for more than 6 years now, and it's gratifying to me to be in a position to turn a high-performing organization over to a successor. Our board search for a new CEO is progressing. We don't have a formal update on timing yet. But as you'd expect, the opportunity to lead Biogen is generating plenty of interest. And in the meantime, I'm working closely with our management team as we strive to realize our goals for 2016 and kick off a busy and productive 2017. We're fortunate to have a great leadership team and a passionate group of employees who come to work every day to make a positive impact on patients' lives, and I thank all of them for their hard work and dedication. Thanks to all of you for joining us this morning, and we'll now open up the call for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Eric Schmidt, Ph.D. - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks for the question and congrats on a solid quarter. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the parallel trade issue associated with TECFIDERA. Is that something new? Is there anything you can do about it? Is it going to get worse in the future? Thanks. Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: Thanks, Eric. This is Paul. I'll try to take a crack at it. We didn't point it out last quarter. So in fairness, looking at the numbers this quarter, we noticed it in looking backwards. It effectively happens when a low-priced country gets extra purchasing patents and it ends up in a more higher-priced company. Across all of our products, we look hard at this, and we try to, to the extent we can, manage it. We haven't, across the whole time in multiple sclerosis, for 10 or 15 years, seen this to be a big issue, but we'll continue to try to manage it. I don't expect it to be a meaningful issue as we go forward over the next bunch of quarters. It could bounce around every now and then though. Thanks for the question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for the question. Just on the remyelination side for Mike or Al, so what are the puts and takes of finding a population for anti-LINGO versus expanding the program for BIIB061? I'm just curious if you can use the lessons from SYNERGY to optimize BIIB061 development or if you have to prioritize one over the other. Thank you. Michael D. Ehlers - Biogen, Inc.: Geoff, this is Mike. That's a good question. So my comment on the SYNERGY results is we've been using that data to really look at the potential for an identified population. We think we've found that. We think this is really going to inform our development of BIIB061. We're thinking about that very closely. There's reason to believe that the same population may be something we can investigate similarly with BIIB061. We think it will inform the development. That's going to be part of the plans for how we would develop opicinumab as well. Alfred W. Sandrock - Biogen, Inc.: Maybe I could add to that. This is Al. The subpopulation that we identified has really good biological plausibility. In other words, these are patients who have evidence of intact axons. They have evidence of demyelination. This makes sense to us that both of these drugs would work better in this population, and that's why we're encouraged by these results. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks very much for the question. I just want to throw a few questions in on nusinersen. First, what would be the earliest that you would be in a position to actually launch the product if the FDA acted with the speed that they've acted on some other recent applications for high unmet need medications? Secondly, could you give us a sense of the number of patients continuing from the trials on an open-label basis and also the number of patients in the Expanded Access program, and when you would expect those to be converted to commercial patients? And then lastly, you mentioned the 20,000 patients with SMA in North America, Europe, and Japan. But what proportion of those do you consider to be really addressable with the label that you're filing for? Is that the population under 10 or infant onset, or is that just all now the different forms of SMA? Thanks, sorry for the multi-part question. Michael D. Ehlers - Biogen, Inc.: Okay, Geoffrey, this is Mike. I'm going to start and then we're going to tag-team the multi-part question here. Hopefully we'll remember each of the parts. Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: We need all members of the management team to address it, so chime in. Michael D. Ehlers - Biogen, Inc.: So first of all, on the filing, I do want to emphasize that we've submitted the file. We've applied for Priority Review. We haven't heard back on the determination of that. That will obviously dictate when we will get approval for that in the U.S. Similarly, the Accelerated Assessment application we have in Europe, again, that would potentially reduce the review time. But we're expecting that finally to be validated in the coming weeks. So there's some timing dependence on regulator acceptance of these Priority Review and Accelerated Assessment. With that, I'm going to let Michel talk about the launch based on that, but let me address a couple of the other things you mentioned. Our Expanded Access program is active. We've got patients who are receiving drug. This is obviously country-by-country specific in how they're administering it. And it's an ongoing work in progress. That program will really be relevant during this period while we're filed but before we've got approval. We anticipate that that's going to be a small number of patients that we can get in the relevant countries based on the criterion established in our Expanded Access program. On the incidence and prevalence and the label, what we would say is this is 20,000 patients prevalence today in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. SMA as a whole has an incidence of about 13,000 patients a year across those roughly. The data that we've submitted were from the interim analysis of ENDEAR. These were Type 1 patients. We've included data across all of our studies as well as preclinical data. We are going to seek a broad label for the treatment of SMA. This obviously will be something under review. And based on that, that will determine the overall size of the patient population, which I'll also let Michel comment on when I turn it over to him. My final comment on that would be we expect that if successful and launched that these prevalence numbers will increase over time to the extent that we have an impact on survival in these populations. So the label, there's a lot of open questions. We'll have to wait and see, and that is going to determine what the ultimate upside is. So, Michel, maybe I'll turn it over to you on the label. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Thank you, Mike. So basically, the label is a question mark. The timeline is also a question mark. I had the opportunity to review lately the U.S. operation in terms of launch readiness. And I can tell you that I'm very pleased with the team that is getting together, a high qualified, highly committed team in order to best serve the unmet medical needs together with hopefully a good product with a good label and approved on time. So the launch readiness is there. And basically the label will determine which proportion of the current prevalence we can address at launch. So for that, we have to wait a little bit. 20,000 patients in terms of prevalence in the year so actually that we have qualified, but there are many more beyond, and we are also looking into that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning and thank you for the questions, so first a quick clarification. On the anti-LINGO, is this another Phase 2, or are you actually starting a pivotal program with that? And then my question is really on market access for multiple sclerosis in 2017. Now that those contracts have been written, can you give us a directional view as to your formulary access versus 2016 and the pricing environment for your products during that year? Michael D. Ehlers - Biogen, Inc.: Okay, Ron, thanks for the question. This is Mike, and then I will probably let Al comment as well on opicinumab anti-LINGO. We're very much in the design phase of this, looking at the potential of a trial. We're looking at timing. We're looking at cost. We're looking at feasibility. We don't have an answer today, but we think in the coming weeks we'll have a determination about whether we conduct a Phase 2b trial or whether we look to go straight into Phase 3. Alfred W. Sandrock - Biogen, Inc.: I don't have any further comment. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: So concerning the formulary access in the U.S., we do not comment on the way 2017 will look like nor on the gross-to-net. What I can tell you is that the organization is committed to continue to generate profitable growth. And for that, we go after the cost picture forcefully, how we supply and how we procure our business. And as I explained earlier, we are working on our go-to-market model. We don't believe the reach and frequency model that prevailed in the past is sustainable, and we are basically, step by step, building a new go-to-market model. So we are working on that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC : Hi, thanks very much for taking my question. I guess a question for Mike. I was hoping you could clarify what you guys have meant on the aducanumab titration data, what you meant by efficacy results that are consistent with results previously reported. Are you referring to imaging or cognition? And then on the safety side, when you talk about safety looking consistent with what's previously been reported and supporting the design of the Phase 3s, does that suggest that the ARIA is consistent with what you're seeing, or does it support the idea of titration potentially reducing the risk of ARIA in certain populations? Thanks. Michael D. Ehlers - Biogen, Inc.: Brian, thank you. Thank you for that. And by the way, these are all things which we will have a lot more to talk about at CTAD in San Diego in December. So let me comment on that. So when we say consistent with, we're referring to both imaging and functional endpoints in cognition. As you know, what we've looked at before is the CDR [Clinical Dementia Rating] sum of boxes and the MMSE [Mini-Mental State Examination] as well as amyloid PET. On the titration side and safety side, again, we'll have a lot more details on this. But what I'd say is what we're seeing is consistent with what we had hypothesized around for the safety basis of aducanumab. In other words, it's within the range of what we've seen and reported before with the Phase 1b study. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks for the question, a follow-up on the Alzheimer's prior question. I just wanted to understand the context of the efficacy comments, in particular given that I think there are still some questions around the placebo arm, and I think that you're still using partly the pool of placebo from before. So I just want to understand the caveats and I guess how confident you are versus that arm. And then just a quick follow-up is you did mention the line about MT-1303. So I just wanted to understand what happened there. Is that a commercial competition thing, or what happened in that decision? Thanks so much. Alfred W. Sandrock - Biogen, Inc.: Hi, Michael. This is Al Sandrock. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yes. Alfred W. Sandrock - Biogen, Inc.: The additional cohorts included some additional placebo patients. So we will show the data from the additional placebo patients as well as the placebo patients from prior cohorts, and that will be shown at CTAD. And the efficacy is on PET imaging as well as on the clinical cognitive assessments that we looked at previously, MMSE and CDR sum of boxes. That will all be shown at CTAD. Michael D. Ehlers - Biogen, Inc.: So, Michael, this is Mike. I'll comment on amiselimod. As we looked at how the landscape was evolving, both in terms of the regulatory competitive landscape, changing features there, and the corresponding fit with our strategic priorities about where we could best allocate resources based on our own expertise and competency. We just determined that it wasn't as good of a fit as other things which we could allocate our resources towards. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good morning. Thanks for my question as well. Just quickly, we're all anxiously waiting for the top line from solanezumab Phase 3 in December. Can you frame us on what could the reason be for the Phase 3 program for aducanumab? And then secondly, what's your view on the recent data from AveXis gene therapy in SMA, and what that could mean for nusinersen in the commercial opportunity? Thank you. Michael D. Ehlers - Biogen, Inc.: Okay, thanks for the question. Maybe I'll take a stab at this and see if anyone wants to open up. First of all, I don't think we'll speculate on the potential results of the solanezumab trial based on that. There are scenarios that one can envision that we are certainly taking into consideration. We very much look forward to seeing their data. A couple things I would point out on this is, although both are a-beta [amyloid beta] antibodies, these are actually fundamentally quite different mechanisms of action. So whereas we think if there were positive results out of the solanezumab trial, this would give great credence to the amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease, and I think bode well for the potential results of aducanumab. However, because these are fundamentally different mechanisms they're going at is that it is far more difficult to interpret a negative result if solanezumab were to find it, as we would be able to see it. We believe it will be much more difficult to make a conclusion about a negative result on solanezumab vis-\u00e0-vis the potential results of aducanumab. On AveXis, I think what we would comment is look, we welcome innovative therapies for SMA. We think this is a very serious, very important disease area. We're highly committed to this disease area and to the patients and families. We think that gene therapy has an overall approach is a viable one in spinal muscular atrophy. And in fact, we're quite excited about our own internal program that we have and our collaboration with UPenn in that regard as well. So we look forward to seeing how the combination of nusinersen potentially being launched and the next-generation therapeutics that we are certainly working on will play out over time. We see great prospect for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy. Alfred W. Sandrock - Biogen, Inc.: And the only thing I would add on the Alzheimer's is the population is a little different than solanezumab. They're studying the mild patients, which makes sense because that's where they saw some evidence of efficacy in EXPEDITION-2, whereas in the case of aducanumab, we're studying prodromal in the early mild patients. And I agree with everything Mike said about the differences in the antibody. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thanks for taking the question. I appreciate it. I just wanted to go back to SMA for a second again and just try and better understand your comments around a broad label. I guess what data supports a label outside of SMA-1 patients? And what's the rationale that you might be able to achieve a label outside of SMA-1 patients ahead of the randomized study data? Thanks. Michael D. Ehlers - Biogen, Inc.: Okay, Matthew, thanks for the question. I guess I would first start by saying we really are not going to comment on the data prospects for our label. What I will say is that we have ongoing studies in Type 2 patients where we're looking at the potential efficacy of nusinersen. As you know also, we have an ongoing trial, as I had mentioned, in pre-symptomatic genetically diagnosed infants. And so all of that data is data that we look to include in our filing application. And from that, the extent of the label that we achieve, that will be based on the agency's review of the totality of the data and the evidence. We will present evidence based on those populations in our effort to seek a broad label. What that data is we will be able to present at the appropriate time. Many of these studies have not completed. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Scotti with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. John Scotti - Evercore Group LLC : Great, thanks for taking my questions. On the CEO search, could you just elaborate a bit more? I'm not sure what exactly, but I know this is a big topic for investors right now. On timing, is it unreasonable to hear something by year end? And then exactly what is the profile of the person you're looking for? Is it someone from industry, out of industry, et cetera? And on the MS market, Michel, I had a quick question. You said that in the U.S. that volumes are declining year over year. Do you see this trend continuing? And if so, is it fair to say that any growth from TEC [TECFIDERA] with stable patient share and then I guess also perhaps the entire MS market as a whole would come from price going forward, or do you see volumes inflecting at some point? And if so, what would be the catalyst? Thank you. George A. Scangos - Biogen, Inc.: Okay, this is George. Maybe I'll comment on the CEO search first. Look, I'm not going to comment on the specific timing. I can tell you that I think we all believe that the sooner we can get through this and have a new CEO come, the better it is for all of us. So it's a very active search. The board is interviewing a number of candidates. There are, as you would expect, very high-quality candidates coming in and being interviewed from a variety of backgrounds actually. And we'll give you an update on that as soon as we can. But I don't want to comment any more on the specific timing today. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: So concerning the U.S. market, thanks for the question. What we had seen during the past quarters was basically a slowdown towards low single-digit market growth in the U.S. What we have seen during the past months or weeks was a shift in the mix between commercial and free that is impacting basically the commercial unit's performance. So I don't know if it's an overall market trend, but this is what we have seen internally. What I can tell you is that TECFIDERA remains the number one priority for the organization. We have a plan. As alluded to last time, we are working based on the portfolio work that we are doing on TEC GI discontinuation. That remains at an average of approximately 22%. We have a good opportunity to make some inroad there because basically the scope goes from 5% to 35%. So there are some MS centers where they are able to manage with the right engagement, and here there are different type of engagements that are being practiced in the different centers. There is no evidence yet. One can speculate that we can see a temporal association between the increase of eosinophil and the GI symptomatology, but this was not confirmed by clinical trials because of many different controlling factors. So we work on TEC GI. We see early signs that it's heading towards the right direction also in Europe, but it's too early to claim any big success here. We are working on the capture risks, and one balanced the other. That's why we have a stable patient base. And the base of the market is certainly lower than what we have estimated in our assumptions, but it's not an excuse for not increasing share. So we do not give up. We invest. We are committed. I can tell you the team in the U.S. is all up and running. They have piloted a new engagement model with the critical MS centers. I'm very pleased to see the perception improvement, and now we have to continue to execute. And the full rollout of this new plan will be towards the end of the year, or by latest early January. So we are committed. We don't give up on the large mature markets where the share of TEC is relatively stable versus the latest launch markets where we continue to make fast inroads, like in Italy, Spain, or the UK. And the good news is that we returned to positive France. And we continue for Germany and we continue for the U.S. We are committed. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, guys, thank you. So just to follow up on market trends in MS, so help us understand. Why do you think \u2013 is there anything going on with the MS market? Why is it shrinking in the U.S.? Are you seeing any people who are trying the orals and then hopping off and not getting back into the MS treatment bucket? And then on PLEGRIDY, the market, having a certain small percentage of the market is interesting, but do you think you can grow that? And what are you specifically doing to grow the PLEGRIDY market share? Thank you. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: So thanks for the question. It's very difficult to speculate on the future trend of the market. So we have seen a couple of points negative for the quarter versus the prior year. This was not a situation during the prior quarters, so time will speak. We'll see over time, but I don't believe that this will be sustained. And again, I spoke about some trends in the marketplace between commercial units being commercialized and other channels. So we are committed to gain market share in a slower base of the market in all our mature markets, including the U.S. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, thanks for letting me ask a question. Just back on to SMA and nusinersen, you guys have talked about your Expanded Access program and moving that forward. And it sounds like there's a desire here to get more patients on. We ran across some social media chatter from parents that seem to be complaining about at least some PIs that were looking to restrict access to this program. I wonder if you could \u2013 it seems to be a little bit at odds with what you guys have talked about. Can you maybe comment on that and maybe help explain what exactly is going on? Thanks. Michael D. Ehlers - Biogen, Inc.: Chris, maybe I'll start. The essence is we're not going to comment on specific investigators or specific sites around this. I would say that our Expanded Access program was really designed to, in cases and at sites and countries where we were able to with this severe disease, before we're able to successfully launch hopefully if we get a favorable review, to maximize the access that we could based on criteria that were medically established at relevant sites. A lot of that is determined at the site and the country level. They determine that. And we are doing our best to ensure access in a way that makes sense but that does not jeopardize our filing and the potential approval of this for broad access. Our hope, by the way, is that this period will be short and that we'll be able to utilize the Priority Review and the Accelerated Assessment of the EMA to bring this to patients as quickly as possible so that this EAP program can be as short as possible. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good morning and thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about your broader biz-dev intentions. Obviously, you had the setback with MT-1303. But as we look forward, can you talk about your strategy here and how much you're able to act on it, if at all, while you have a CEO search ongoing? I guess is this part of the business that we should assume is on hold for the time being until you get someone in who can take stock of the overall organization, or are you still proceeding with diligence of other companies as usual? Thanks. George A. Scangos - Biogen, Inc.: No, you should not assume this is on hold. We all believe this is an important part of what we have to accomplish. We are continuing with diligence on several companies as we speak, and that will continue. And we will continue to work aggressively to finalize some of these issues. I think the areas in which we are interested are clear. We have a very good R&D team now who can make the technical assessments. We have a great ability now to make the accurate commercial assessments. And so we are full speed ahead. Matthew Calistri - Biogen, Inc.: All right, Dan, that should conclude the call for today. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you to everyone for attending. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Operator : Good morning, my name is Dan, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen fourth quarter and year-end 2016 financial results and business update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Matt Calistri, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Matthew Calistri - Biogen, Inc.: Thank you, and welcome to Biogen's fourth quarter and full-year 2016 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Michael Ehlers, EVP of Research and Development; and our CFO, Paul Clancy. We'll also be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Al Sandrock. Now I'll turn the call over to Michel. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In 2016, Biogen generated revenues of $11.4 billion, a 6% increase over 2015 and, on a constant currency basis, an increase of 9%. GAAP earnings were $16.93 a share, a 10% increase year-over-year, and on non-GAAP EPS was $20.22, a 19% increase versus full-year 2015. I am proud that the team was able to deliver such a strong results, and I aim to building on Biogen impressive track record as we move forward. 2016 was an eventful year for Biogen. Let me review some of our most important achievements. We announced the spinoff of our hemophilia business, now called Bioverativ, and aim to complete the transaction next week. We presented results from the SYNERGY study of opicinumab, a potential remyelinating therapy for MS. We presented updated a-beta (03:15) data from the Phase 1b PRIME study of aducanumab for Alzheimer's disease and made significant progress enrolling the Phase 3 trial, exceeding our goal for the year. Aducanumab also received fast track designation in the U.S., and was accepted in the PRIME program in the E.U. Our partner, Eisai, initiated and began dosing patient in the Phase 3 program for elenbecestat, or E2609, a BACE inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease, and important complementary mechanism to our a-beta [amyloid beta] antibodies. We received additional IP protection for TYSABRI as we were granted with a new patent in the U.S. with coverage to 2027. And we launched four new products : ZINBRYTA for MS, two biosimilars, BENEPALI and FLIXABI in European markets; and most recently, SPINRAZA, the first treatment for SMA, which was approved only three months after filing in the U.S. 2017 is already off to an exciting start. In the last two weeks, we began dosing the first SPINRAZA patient in the U.S. Further, we announced that we have agreed to enter into a settlement and license agreement with Forward Pharma, which we believe will help clarify our IP position for TECFIDERA. Let me now provide you with a brief review of our commercial performance. Biogen remains the leader in MS as we've maintained our global market share of approximately 38% in a highly competitive market, and that number rises to 42% in those markets where we have a direct presence. Biogen remains the global category leader in the orals, high efficacy and interferon segments of the MS market. MS revenues for 2016 grew 3% year-over-year, or 5% on a constant currency basis. While the revenue growth has attenuated recently, our portfolio delivered global patient growth of 4% in 2016, driven by patient growth for TECFIDERA of 9% year-over-year. In the U.S., we saw a slight decline in TECFIDERA patients year-over-year, attributed to competition among the orals, as well as continued moderation in the overall market. Total TECFIDERA patients outside the U.S. grew by 20% year-over-year, a major driver of revenue growth. Outside the U.S., our efforts are aimed at both new country launches and a renewed focus on early launch European markets such as France and Germany. Looking to 2017, we are pleased to have just received approval in Japan and plan to seek approvals and reimbursement in additional markets throughout the year. TYSABRI added over 4,000 net new patients globally year-over-year and further strengthened its position in the marketplace. Our research indicates that the safety perception for TYSABRI in the U.S. is gradually improving as physicians become more comfortable with risk stratification of their patients. TYSABRI is also benefiting from a shift away from the platform therapies including our interferons to high efficacy products and the orals. We are also continuing to advance our leadership position through new product launches in the U.S. Our data indicates high brand awareness for ZINBRYTA and that physicians are generally prescribing it consistent with the label for switch patients. Outside the U.S., we are encouraged by the launch in Germany, and we expect to receive reimbursement in all major European markets by the end of 2017. Across our MS portfolio, we are focused on operational execution and reinforcing our commitment to MS by pursuing life cycle management opportunities. Switching to our biosimilar business, we are very excited with the continued progress as revenues grew by over 70% quarter-over-quarter, driven by BENEPALI. Our biosimilars operation in Europe is already profitable, and we are pleased with the progress of the JV in advancing additional compound. The most exciting commercial opportunity for 2017 is clearly the launch of SPINRAZA for spinal muscular atrophy. And we moved quickly to make the product available in the U.S. We appreciate the anticipated demand for SPINRAZA in a disease area with such a high unmet medical need, but also realized it may take some time for the treatment centers to manage the complexities in administration, setup, scheduling of patients, as well as for insurers to develop coverage policies. We are working with clinicians, payers and patient advocacy groups to try to expedite access to treatment given some likely capacity constraints in the system, as well as the need to secure reimbursement. Our goal is that no patient will forgo treatment because of financial limitation or insurance status. And we are pleased with the progress made so far. These coverage decisions are made on a case-by-case basis with each payer. While we have seen some early challenges, such as the recent decision from Anthem, we have seen some early successes as well. We continue to expect a gradual uptake throughout the year as we work step-by-step over these launch dynamics. Beyond the U.S., we aim to make SPINRAZA available to patients around the world as soon as possible. We have already filed in the EU, Japan, Australia and Canada as we see (09:51) broad global patient population that we believe will benefit from this therapy. We hope for immediate approval from the EU. I'll now turn it over to Mike for an update on our efforts in R&D, the true engine of value creation for Biogen. Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: Thank you, Michel, and on behalf of employees and stakeholders around the globe, let me congratulate and welcome you to your new role and share the excitement and enthusiasm for the vision, energy, rigor and commitment you are really bringing to the helm of this great company. And good morning to everyone on the call. 2016 was a productive year for Biogen as we made important progress advancing our understanding of several key diseases and assets, received approvals for a broad range of therapies, and continued to shape our pipeline toward areas of high unmet medical need. Let's begin with SPINRAZA. With FDA approval, SPINRAZA became the first and only treatment approved in the U.S. for spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA. We plan on submitting additional data this year to the FDA, including the final analyses from ENDEAR and CHERISH, the Phase 3 study evaluating SPINRAZA in later-onset SMA, with the goal of updating the label. Earlier this month, we also presented new data from the final analysis of ENDEAR at the British Paediatric Neurology Association conference in the U.K. SPINRAZA met the prespecified primary endpoint in the final analysis, demonstrating a statistically significant reduction of 47% in the risk of death or permanent ventilation. In this analysis, 68% of untreated infants died or required permanent ventilation compared to 39% of infants treated with SPINRAZA. Commonly reported adverse effects were generally consistent with those expected in the general population of infants with SMA. We plan to present further efficacy and safety results from ENDEAR in addition to CHERISH later this year. Specifically, we are submitting both ENDEAR and CHERISH to AAN for presentation in April. In addition to being the first medicine for the treatment of SMA, SPINRAZA represents the first intrathecal antisense oligonucleotide approved for any indication. The success and favorable benefit risk profile of SPINRAZA highlight the potential for this previously untapped therapeutic modality in severe nervous system diseases more broadly. Working together with our collaboration partner, Ionis, we intend to leverage our leadership position to advance new therapeutics. Moving on to our efforts in MS repair and regeneration, we are planning to initiate a Phase 2b study for opicinumab, or anti-LINGO, in the fourth quarter. We are also advancing BIIB061, a novel oral remyelinating agent with a different mechanism than opicinumab. We are applying learnings from the opicinumab trials to inform next steps for this asset and look forward to updating you in the coming months. Across our MS franchise, we remain committed to fully understanding and maximizing the medical value and impact of our products as we continue to generate new clinical data and prioritize life cycle management opportunities. Although not within MS, we believe the pursuit of natalizumab, or TYSABRI, for acute ischemic stroke is an example of how we aim to derive additional value. With over 1.7 million cases each year, stroke remains one of the leading causes of death and neurologic disability worldwide with limited treatment options. We believe natalizumab may be able to address the post-ischemic inflammation that leads to neurotoxicity. We previously reported that in our Phase 2 study ACTION, natalizumab, when administered up to nine hours after stroke onset, failed to meet its primary endpoint of MRI infarct volume, but did show benefit on key prespecified secondary clinical outcomes, including the modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index. We expect the follow-on Phase 2b dose-ranging study ACTION 2 to be fully enrolled in 2017 and hope to show the results shortly thereafter. This study is assessing the clinical impact of natalizumab on functional independence and cognition when initially dosed within up to 24 hours of stroke onset, which would be a major advancement over the current standard of care, such as tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, which has a limited time window. Now, turning to Alzheimer's disease, during the quarter, a number of exciting developments occurred for our lead assets. We presented new data from the Phase 1b PRIME study of aducanumab, our investigational treatment for early Alzheimer's disease, at the CTAD meeting in San Diego. We believe the totality of the data presented at CTAD, including additional data from our competitors, continue to support the a-beta hypothesis, as well as the design of our Phase 3 trials. Also in Alzheimer's disease, as Michel mentioned, our partner Eisai recently initiated began (14:51) dosing in the Phase 3 program for elenbecestat, or E2609, an oral BACE inhibitor which aims to prevent the production of beta amyloid. Eisai has also recently completed enrollment in the Phase 2 adaptive design trial for BAN2401, a humanized beta amyloid antibody which exhibits a strong binding preference for protofibrils. Data from that trial are expected in the next 12 to 18 months. We're working to advance BIIB074, a novel investigational state-dependent subtype selective sodium channel blocker for neuropathic pain. We completed enrollment in a small exploratory Phase 2a study in erythromelalgia and anticipate data in the coming months. We continue to enroll a Phase 2b trial for lumbosacral radiculopathy and are planning to initiate two Phase 3 studies in trigeminal neuralgia this year. Startup activities will initially be focused outside the U.S. BG00011, or STX100 for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is enrolling its final cohort in a Phase 2a study and we expect to present the data after the trial completes in the second half of the year. We're also making important progress across our early-stage pipeline as we continue to shape our R&D engine for the future. With that said, although we are pleased with our pipeline, there's always room for improvement. We are building out our R&D leadership team and remain laser-focused on delivering meaningful new molecules to and through the clinic. Working closely with Michel, we are making important progress to refresh and augment our pipeline. We are looking to add assets across our pipeline and are working aggressively to optimize, prioritize, and reshape our R&D activities, focusing resources to rapidly advance assets based on compelling science and medical impact that present the greatest opportunity. Expect to hear more from us in the coming months. With that, I will now pass the call to Paul. Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.99 in the fourth quarter and $16.93 for the full year. GAAP earnings per share were negatively impacted by $1.55 related to the settlement in license agreement with Forward Pharma. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $5.04 in the fourth quarter and $20.22 for the full year. Total revenue for Q4 grew 1% year-over-year to approximately $2.9 billion and grew 6% for the full year to $11.4 billion. Global fourth quarter TECFIDERA revenues were $1 billion. This included revenues of $800 million in the U.S., an increase of 2% versus Q4 last year, and $202 million outside the U.S., a decrease of 3% versus Q4 of last year. As a reminder, in Q3, we believe TECFIDERA U.S. revenue benefited by approximately $40 million to $50 million due to inventory build in the channel, which impacts the sequential quarter comparison. On a sequential basis, we believe inventory levels remained relatively constant. For the full year, worldwide TECFIDERA revenues were $4 billion, an increase of 9% versus prior year. This included $3.2 billion in the U.S. and $799 million in sales outside the U.S. Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $688 million during the fourth quarter, a decrease of 7% versus Q4 last year. This included $488 million in the U.S. and $200 million in sales outside the U.S. For the full year, worldwide interferon revenues were $2.8 billion, consisting of $2 billion in the U.S. and $815 million in sales outside the U.S. TYSABRI worldwide revenues were $474 million this quarter, a decrease of 1% versus Q4 last year. This included $289 million in the U.S. and $185 million outside the U.S. In the U.S., Q4 TYSABRI revenue was unfavorably impacted by an increase in discounts and allowances specific to this quarter. For the full year, worldwide TYSABRI revenues were $2 billion, a 4% increase versus the prior year. We recorded U.S. revenues of $1.2 billion and $781 million internationally. Foreign exchange and hedge impact weakened full-year revenue by approximately $66 million for TECFIDERA, $79 million for interferons, and $62 million for TYSABRI versus prior year. As a reminder, with respect to ZINBRYTA, in the United States, we don't book in market revenue, we book a profit share. And in Q4, we experienced a contra revenue to the total revenue line. Our Hemophilia products continued to perform well this quarter. ELOCTATE revenues for the quarter were $149 million, an increase of 47% versus Q4 last year. This includes $126 million in the U.S. and $23 million outside the U.S. For the full year, world-wide ELOCTATE revenues were $513 million. We recorded U.S. revenue of $445 million, and $68 million internationally. ALPROLIX revenues in Q4 were $93 million, an increase of 31%, versus Q4 last year, including $74 million in the U.S. and $20 million outside of the U.S. For the full year, worldwide ALPROLIX revenues were $334 million. We recorded U.S. revenue of $268 million and $66 million internationally. Our Biosimilar business generated $53 million in revenues this quarter, and full-year Biosimilar revenues were $101 million. Turning to our Anti-CD20 revenues, we recorded $318 million for Q4 and $1.3 billion for the full year. Total Other revenues were $51 million in Q4 and $316 million for the full year. Now turning to the expense line on the P&L. Q4 GAAP cost of goods sold was $378 million; non-GAAP cost of goods sold was $363 million; both 13% of revenue. Full-year GAAP COGS were 1.5 billion or 13% of revenue. And full year non-GAAP COGS were 1.4 billion or 12% of revenue. Q4 GAAP R&D expense was $534 million or 19% of revenue. Q4 non-GAAP R&D was $531 million or 18% of revenue. Both GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense included a $50 million payment milestone to Eisai in Q4, following the dosing of the first patient in, in the Phase 3 program for the BACE inhibitor. Full year GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense were $2 billion, both 17% of revenue. Q4 GAAP SG&A was $496 million; Q4 non-GAAP SG&A was $484 million; both 17% of revenue. Both full-year GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A were $1.9 billion or 17 % of revenue. Throughout the year, we continued to execute on a number of measures to curb operating expense growth, while continuing to invest in R&D in key commercial priorities. We believe the benefits materialized in both the fourth quarter and full year results. We booked a GAAP-only charge in Q4 of $455 million related to our recent settlement and license agreement with Forward Pharma. Upon effectiveness of this agreement, we've agreed to pay Forward Pharma $1.25 billion plus potential royalties. The charge in Q4 represents the portion of the payment attributable to the sales of TECFIDERA during the period April 2014 through December 31, 2016. GAAP other net expense, which includes interest was $48 million in Q4 and $217 million for the full year. Non-GAAP other net expense was $52 million in Q4 and $222 million for the full year. In Q4, our GAAP tax rate was approximately 23%, and our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24%. For the full year, both GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were approximately 25%. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 217 million for Q4 and 219 million for the full year, which brings us to our diluted earnings per share. For Q4, we booked $2.99 on a GAAP basis and $5.04 on a non-GAAP basis. For the full year, GAAP EPS was $16.93, and non-GAAP EPS was $20.22, representing a strong 10% and 19% growth year-over-year, respectively. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of the company's common stock for a total value of $651 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $7.7 billion in cash and marketable securities, with approximately 30% of this in the U.S. In 2017, we expect to continue repurchasing shares as part of our previously announced $5 billion share repurchase program. Let me turn to our full year 2017 guidance. Guidance this year has a few more moving pieces due to the spin-off of Bioverativ : Our focus on Biogen's 2017 guidance; but also provide additional context on Bioverativ in what we call WholeCo, the combined companies. I'd refer you to the slides for today's call for reference. There are a couple of items of note before I go into the substance of the Biogen guidance. First, there will be a stub period for the full month of January, where Hemophilia will be part of Biogen, not Bioverativ. Second, our, our GAAP guidance includes the minimum expense we expect to record in 2017 upon the effectiveness of our settlement and license agreement with Forward Pharma. The actual charges for this recorded will depend on the outcome of the patent office proceedings in the U.S. and EU. Third, our guidance does not include any impact from potential corporate tax reform in the U.S., repatriation or changes to the Affordable Care Act. And our plan is based on recent rates for foreign exchange. Now, let's get into Biogen guidance, starting with revenues. We expect revenues of approximately $11.1 billion to $11.4 billion. This includes one month of Hemophilia revenues, which equates to approximately $75 million. This represents 5% to 7% growth on a pro forma basis, when you adjust for Hemophilia revenues, for both 2016 and January of this year. Starting with MS, our plan assumes OCREVUS is approved this year and launches in the U.S. and Germany in the first half of 2017. We anticipate relatively stable demand for both TECFIDERA and TYSABRI in 2017 on a global basis. This is comprised of ex U.S. patient growth, offsetting modest patient declines in the U.S. We believe the number of patients using AVONEX and PLEGRIDY combined will continue to decline, as the market continues to shift away from the platforms. We anticipate continued strong growth from our Biosimilar business, predominantly driven by BENEPALI. Moving to SPINRAZA. We're very excited about bringing this therapy to patients, with such high unmet need. We're assuming the vast majority of SPINRAZA revenue this year will be in the U.S. We're cognizant that there are near-term capacity constraints in the system and the need for patients to secure reimbursement. So, we expect the revenue uptake to be gradual in 2017. Nevertheless, clearly, the kinetics of the launch are the biggest ambiguity in our outlook. Now, moving to expenses. We expect upward pressure on cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales in 2017, largely due to the increase in royalties related to the sales of SPINRAZA and our Biosimilars revenue becoming a larger portion of the business. We anticipate R&D expense between 16% and 17% of sales. We anticipate additional expense driven by advancing our Alzheimer's programs, notably, aducanumab and the BACE inhibitor; as well as the desire to build our pipeline to business development. Guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or large late-stage business development transactions, as both are hard to predict. SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 15% to 16% of revenues, a decrease from 2016, driven by the reduction in head count related to the Hemophilia spin and continued diligent focus on improving inefficiencies. We're re-allocating resources to maintain our leadership position in MS. Ad we have resourced SPINRAZA for an excellent launch. From a tax perspective, we anticipate our tax rate for 2017 to be largely comparable to 2016. For Biogen, we anticipate GAAP EPS results of $18 to $18.80, and non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $20.45 and $21.25. Our shareholders will also benefit from the earnings of Bioverativ. As a reminder, eligible shareholders will receive one share of Bioverativ common stock for every two shares of Biogen common stock. On an apples-to-apples basis, we aim to grow earnings per share for Biogen in the double digits on a pro forma basis. I'll now turn the call over to Michel for his closing remarks. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Thank you, Paul. The following is my take on how Biogen is opening the page for 2017. We have a stable leadership position in MS, with the remaining lifecycle management opportunities, for which I'll come back to you at a later stage. Our Biosimilars business is growing strongly. We are now the standard of care for SMA, and we believe intrathecal delivery opens up potential limited treatment modalities. I am very encouraged by the progress in our Phase 2 and 3 programs, such as (31:00), acute ischemic stroke, neuropathic pain, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and last, but not least, our Alzheimer's disease program. All of these are breaking new ground in important areas of medicines and aiming to address significant unmet medical needs. We have reinforced our IP position for TECFIDERA and TYSABRI; we continue to be disciplined on expense management; and we aspire to continue delivering double-digit earning growth. With that said, good is not good enough, and we aim to do more. In 2017, we'll be focusing on flawless near-term execution, while laying the groundwork for Biogen's long-term sustainability and success, including our renewed prioritization on business development activities. 2017 will be a big year, and I could not be more excited to be taking over as CEO during such a critical time, as we continue to build our company and drive leadership in neurology and neurodegeneration. You can expect to hear more from me over the next six months as I work with the leadership team to reevaluate our strategy for long-term shareholder value creation, including efficient R&D investment and high return business development activities. In closing, I'd like to thank our employees around the world, who are dedicated to make a positive impact on patients' lives; and all of the physicians, caregivers, and participants in our clinical development programs. The past and future achievements could not be realized without their passion and commitment. With that, we open the call for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Oh, hey, guys. How are you? First, thanks to the Biogen organization for all your support while I was out. You guys were just fantastic to my team and to me, especially to Paul, Al, and Matt. Second of all, I know you've been asked this before, but I just think it's so important that I'd love to hear you say it in front of the broadest audience possible. And that is just comment on the solanezumab results, and what implications they may or may not have for aducanumab. And then I'd like to know if Michel is a Patriots fan. Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: Mark, look... Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Because if he is, we're downgrading the stock. Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: Al will take the sola. But just on behalf of everybody here at Biogen, it's great to hear your voice, great for you to be back, and well wishes. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Thanks, Paul. Alfred W. Sandrock - Biogen, Inc.: Hey, Mark, it's Al. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Hey, Al. Good to hear your voice. Alfred W. Sandrock - Biogen, Inc.: I agree with Paul. It's great to hear your voice again. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Thank you. Alfred W. Sandrock - Biogen, Inc.: So, on sola, there's a few key differences, right, between the sola trials and aducanumab. First of all, the patient population they studied was mild, with mild patients. We're studying the prodromal and the early mild. We continue to believe, and I think most of the community believes that the earlier the better, particularly for a-beta lowering therapies. The second is the outcome measure they used ADAS-Cog. And they actually looked at CDR sum of boxes as a secondary endpoint, I believe. And we believe CDR is a very good endpoint for early-stage Alzheimer's, and that's what we're using in our Phase 3 trial. I believe the Lilly results showed a P-value less than 0.05 on the CDR sum of boxes, even in the mild population. So, I thought that was encouraging. And finally, the difference in the antibody. Sola binds to soluble monomeric forms of a-beta, which means it binds to a lot of antigen in the circulation. The antibody probably, therefore, has a hard time getting to the brain. They actually couldn't show a lowering of amyloid plaque to a significant degree in the brain. Our antibody, in contrast, doesn't bind to the soluble monomeric form; it binds to the soluble oligomers. Binds also to the insoluble fibrillar forms. As a result, the antibody does get into the brain, and we have a substantial robust reduction in amyloid plaque in the brain at one year, which we published, dose-dependent. So, I think for all those reasons \u2013 I'm not sure you can read too much into the sola result and infer anything on what we're going to see with aducanumab. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: And concerning your second question, I will not enter into the debate on what real football is, but I'm a fan of all the teams around here, including the Celtics and the Patriots. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Aaron Gal, Ph.D. - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. I got three quick ones. The first one, Abbey just moved their TAL program into Phase 2. We've been talking a lot about the strength and weaknesses of the amyloid beta hypothesis. I wonder if you would review for us how you think about the anti-TAL as a target. What has been proven about that target, and what has not? And what is generally your feeling about that overall field as a kind of secondary field in the Alzheimer's field? Second, quarterly seasonality, we've seen it in the first quarter with the multiple sclerosis drugs. As we think about your revenue for 2017, should we think about the first quarter as being a lot weaker and growing over time? And then last but not least, I'm not sure you're going to be willing to say that, but as you're accelerating the quarter (37:23) for aducanumab, can you just discuss with us the stopping criteria both for fertility and early-stop conditions for this trial? Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: Okay, Ronny. This is Mike Ehlers. I'll start with the TAL question. So, we're very interested in TAL, because as you may know, one of the hallmarks of TAL pathology is that the pathology in the brain is more related to clinical status and progression. That's been one of the reasons why there's been such an interest in TAL. There's also a potential notion that this might be a mechanism that could intervene a little bit later than a-beta. And those have been some reasons for a lot of the excitement. Other parts of this that get us interested is the data around the potential spreading of TAL extra-cellularly that leads to progression of the pathology. And I think that's led some additional credence to the notion that a monoclonal antibody might be able to intercept the core disease process. There's some open questions about the relevant TAL species and the best epitopes. And a lot of that will have to play out clinically. There's tremendous advance, and we're certainly active in this in imaging agents for TAL pathology. And we think that if that comes to fruition, that has the chance to be as important to the field as amyloid imaging. I would say that in our portfolio, we have both the TAL monoclonal antibody, and we're also progressing, soon to get to a clinic, an antisense oligonucleotide type of TAL and our collaboration with Ionis that I kind of referred to in the line of the potential for intrathecal antisense oligonucleotides. So, we think there's great potential. A lot of it will play out in the clinic, and we're generally excited about TAL as a target. Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: Ronny, this is Paul. I'll try to address the seasonality question. Yeah, I think you're basically right that in multiple sclerosis, and in our expectations, we expect some normal seasonality headwinds in the United States. We generally anticipate seeing gross to net as a percentage move up just in Q1. That's pretty normal. U.S. patients are oftentimes moving around with respect to changes in insurance. And sometimes, there's a little bit of a unit slippage on that. And the TECFIDERA inventory levels in the U.S. that I had pointed out that got high in Q3 and stayed in Q3 could experience a little bit of a drawdown. That doesn't change anything with respect to the fundamentals going through the rest of the year or over the long term. Alfred W. Sandrock - Biogen, Inc.: Yeah, sure. You guys gave me the toughest question. This is Al, Ronny. We don't want to comment on interim analyses or futility analyses, or any of those kinds of things, so sorry. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Co. Please go ahead. Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks for the question. With the spin, was the revenue of $5 million in the first week on the market, is that a real sort of end user number? And when Michel says expecting immediate EU approval, are we thinking next week? Thank you. Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: Why don't Michel and I tag team this. This is Paul. The $5 million in Q4 was all channel build, Eric. So, as everybody knows, approved a couple of days before Christmas, 12/23. Our team worked real hard the week between Christmas and New Year's. Inclusive of that was just some small channel fill that wasn't related to anything, with respect to patients. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: And concerning the EU approval, it's probably my accent. It's mid-year that we expect to have SPINRAZA approval. Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for the question. And thanks to Paul for all the detailed guidance. And I'll say upfront, go, Falcons. Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: Next question. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Exactly. Exactly. Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: All right... Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So question for Mike or Al... Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: We'll talk to you after the call and put some money on it, Geoff. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Let's talk later on that, Paul. Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: All right. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So, for Mike or Al, just again to focus on Alzheimer's. For aducanumab, for enrollment, looks like you guys are more than one-third ways enrolled. Is there anything that's changed relative to some of the initial challenges that you faced? And does that make you feel better when you think about the patient identification down the road? And then just a real quick one. Have you guys have had to make any changes when you look at the protocol for engage or emerge to account for the seizure that you saw from the prime study? Thanks. Alfred W. Sandrock - Biogen, Inc.: Hi, Geoff. This is Al. We have not made any changes in the protocol to account for the seizure. Look, I mean, enrollment, as Michel said, we exceeded our stretch actually goal for 2016. Things are improving, I think, in terms of two fronts. Since we require a positive PET scan, it's hard to get PET scans lined up for people in certain countries. And with time, we've been able to sort out a lot of the issues related to getting PET ligand to the centers, where they have the PET scans and getting patients scanned. And I think that is improving. And hopefully, that'll help with enrollment. And then the other thing is that our publication last year really kind of continued to build excitement around our molecule, because we showed all the data we had from the preclinical studies and much of the data from the prime studies. So, that plus the CTAD results. So, think both of those things, I think, are encouraging, although, we still have, as you pointed out, a ways to go. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just was wondering, on 2017 guidance, recognize you guys don't typically give product guidance, but just wondering at a high level, if you can give us your thoughts on the MS franchise, volume price, the impact of the TECFIDERA label update and OCREVUS as well? Thanks. Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: I think, Michel, and I will try to tag team this, a bit. We don't give product guidance, Terrence. I think, what you didn't ask, and what we think is the biggest ambiguity is what I kind of pointed out in the prepared remarks, is SPINRAZA, obviously. I think the MS business is a stable business that we certainly, have thinking around OCREVUS is coming in. And we'll kind of take some share and probably hopefully expand the market, particularly around PPMS. The ambiguity there, obviously, is what the label looks like at the end of March. Michel, any other additional comments? Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Yeah. So, on MS, it's all about implementation and execution. And what we can see is that when we do that well, and we can always do better, then we are able to start improving. For example, in Germany, with the launch of ZINBRYTA, this is now four months that we can see the share grow up to two years of being stable. In France, improved implementation for TEC, all-time high during the last results, during the prior audited results. But it's not the case everywhere. In the U.S., we've been a bit penalized as a market leader, with the contraction of the market in 2016. We believe this will normalize with the launch of OCRE, the way Paul said. This will expand the market, and the market will return to low single-digit growth. And the market leader will also benefit from that. So, it's (46:03) situation based on a very respectable competitor that will be launched this year, and with very good data in clinical trial setting that has to be confirmed with the label, we'll see, but also in real world. So, but in the meantime, we have 250,000 patients on TEC. The safety perception and efficacy perception on our product is well characterized. And we have many cards to play and play well. And we are launching in Japan. And last, but not least, for OCRE don't forget that we have tiered royalties in the U.S. from 13.5% to 24%. So, will be an exciting year. And again, I want to reassess that we remain fully committed in MS with the current portfolio and a lot of the current launches and lifecycle management opportunities. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. And appreciate all of the guidance clarity, as well. Wanted to ask a little more on SPINRAZA. You made some comments about managed care and things like that and some headwinds with the launch to get ramped. But I wanted to just ask, how many sites are available? How are you ramping this? How fast you think that could by the end of the year? And are people trying to write for Type 2 patients? And how is managed care handling all of that? Thanks so much. Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: Gosh, Michael, I mean, we don't have many more calls to be able to say, it's early days, but it's still pretty early days. As we've pointed out, it's 40 or 50 sites that is a big percentage of the business in the United States, and then it broadens out from there. We are doing meaningful medical education across United States. We have a go-to-market, if you will, that includes going and providing care to the families and understanding. But I would say, we're early days in trying to get through these capacity constraints and early days with respect to reimbursement in all the insurer coverage. I know it's a very important thing, and what we'll try to do is in Reg FD settings, update people along the way, as we move through the launch. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: So, what we can see is that it's a state-by-state opportunity, and this varies, obviously . This week we had the approval from a very large Medicaid coverage, but I will not say more at this stage on this one, because you saw also the Anthem decision. So, we believe that over time, logic will prevail in terms of having the patient access in therapy that is proven to save lives. And the demand from the patient side is there and is strong. This I can tell you. Concerning the early access program that we have open, in the U.S., we had 62 patients in 15 sites and ex U.S. we have 146 patients in 13 countries. So, all of those factors are coming into play. And so far, we are satisfied with the progress that we are making. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Good morning, everybody Thanks for taking the question. I'm going to ask one, and I'm not sure if you'll answer, but I'll ask anyway. I think one of the major questions people still have after the TECFIDERA settlement is a scenario where you guys win the interference but lose the IPR. And I think a lot of people are wondering what that outcome could look like vis-a-vis the settlement with Forward, and if there really is any extended protection in that scenario. And why you might structure the settlement with Forward to allow that as a potential outcome? So, any confidence you can give us that, that sort of downside scenario can't happen? Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: Okay, Matt. This is Paul. We're going to have a hard time really engaging on this, obviously. So, I can't really get into specifics, because it does get into kind of legal strategy and all of that type of stuff. The way to think about the announcement that we made a couple of weeks ago on Forward Pharma, I think, is probably twofold. One is which, obviously, you're getting at. But one is the economics, which we laid out. And that was all about trying to reduce uncertainty in what we thought was a very prudent deployment and a good structuring of the economics. The second was kind of the structure and kind of keeping the interference going, and so on and so forth. And that was designed to attempt to ensure certainly, and that's what we believe, that we have the strongest patents over the long term across various scenarios, both in the U.S. and in the EU. So, there's lots of different scenarios. People have written about it. But that's probably about as far as I can. Thanks for the question. Operator : Your next question comes from Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks for taking my question. I just want to come back to SPINRAZA. I guess I'm a little confused by some of the comments that you're obviously excited and well-resourced. You even expect upwards COGS pressure from the SPINRAZA royalty, but also projecting slow and gradual due to access reimbursement. I guess, given the evidence that suggests high misfunction in SMA, I'm surprised there'd be any tolerance for delayed uptake, either for logistics or reimbursement in this population. Maybe you can discuss whether awareness and urgency to treat this disease is really where it should be? And if not, why not? Thanks. Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, I think that, Josh, what you laid out is what we'd agree is this is the ambiguity of the uptake. And we're only weeks in. The awareness of SPINRAZA, I think, is absolutely there, tight knit community, extremely tight-knit set of physicians as well. As people know, when we talked about and provided top line data on the second interim readout, we alluded to that there was a chance we'd get approval in the fourth quarter or early 2017. Even though we conveyed that, that actually was not the general belief in the physician community. I think people were thinking more like spring. So, we went to work, trying to get that ready. But there's still a little bit of work around capacity constraints. And then what you point out is obviously the other big countervailing force, right? This is tremendous unmet need to patients that have a dire outcome. And I think we talk about that in Type 1, but I would say, that Type 2 is similar for any family that's burdened with this disease. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: So, a gradual uptake throughout the year is that we should envision realistically, and this is of course (54:22) that this is absolutely the way that we (54:26) And again, the demand is there, and patients, through the doctors, through the providers, or directly to the call centers are getting engaged. So, these are very positive signs, obviously. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: He's probably an Atlanta Falcons fan. Matthew Calistri - Biogen, Inc.: You might be on mute. If you're asking a question right now, we cannot hear you. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yep, you're right. I was on mute. And no, my Giants lost early, so. (55:12) So, I was really hoping to just get your thoughts on other Alzheimer's approaches, specifically the a-beta pros that probio drug is taking, and just given the interest there. And separately, the recent advancement of a gene therapy product targeting TAL. Just your thoughts and your inclination in terms of maybe duplicating those efforts. Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: Well, let me start, and Mike, I'm sure, will have other things to add. The probio drug approach is to go after plaque, essentially. The pyroglutamated form is thought to be (55:53) for the plaque. And it's a way to get after the plaque. I think in that sense, it's not that different from the aducanumab approach, which is to go after the plaque. I think it's an interesting approach. But as I said, I think it overlaps significantly with our approach. And the other approaches to AD in addition to TAL, one of the things we're very interested in is neuroinflammation. There are genetics that point to neuroinflammatory pathways. Biogen has a strong history in inflammation and in neuro, and we have some real expertise internally. And so, we're going after some targets that are related to neuroinflammation. And then I think we like the idea of combining things ultimately. I think, ultimately, we're going to see AD treatment being a combination of approaches and all with different mechanisms of actions. So, that's how we're looking at things, but Mike? Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: Well, I guess, the only thing I would say specifically on this is, as Al mentioned, the pyroglu a-beta antibody is largely a similar core hypothesis, going after plaque beta amyloid. There may be some differences in specific epitopes that would have to play out. It's also kind of less clear how that intervention causes biomarker changes typical of other a-beta antibodies. That's another thing that would have to play out. I think that things with gene therapy as a general approach was the other question you asked about. We're very interested in gene therapy. AAV is a modality, in general. I think there's a lot of excitement around that. We have very active programs in our collaboration with UPenn. There's still a lot of things that have to be worked out in terms of the technology, the safety profile, the manufacturing and bioprocesses. My own feeling is that this will initially be most beneficial in more severe genetic diseases, rather than genetically heterogeneous common diseases. That's the way that we're thinking about it, but we like AAVs as a general approach. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thank you. And I appreciate the comments that you've made on this market so far, but I had one more. So, if you look at IMS, it appears that TECFIDERA's declining, and I think AUBAGIO is growing. So, maybe you could help us understand what you're seeing on this trend, and what you might be doing to control the trend? And if there's any pricing pressure or anything like that on the orals from this on TECFIDERA in the U.S. and the EU? Thanks. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: So, I will not comment on the third-party's data. Let's have them answer. (58:50). They had a methodology change, so I have noticed what you have noticed. What is important is that we continue on the demand generation to perform, and that the team is able to generate the demand as expected. From the data we have, we see a very slight erosion of TEC around the 19.2%, 19.1% (59:14) slight erosion. We can certainly see the inroads of AUBAGIO from the whole activity low base. This we can see. And we have to do a better job at that. Matthew Calistri - Biogen, Inc.: Yeah, we're going to take one more question. Operator : And your final questions comes from Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, I was curious if you could provide maybe some potential color around like when you think about some of the prevalences in some of the other markets for SMA, like Japan, Canada, or Australia, which could be on the horizon in the next 12 to 24 months? Thanks. Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: Well, I know of no regional differences in the incidents of SMA or the prevalence. We actually have filed for approval in Australia, Canada, and Japan, as well as Europe. And so, yeah, I mean, we would love to ultimately \u2013 I think every child with SMA deserves treatment. And so, that would be our goal. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: So, we want to provide the product for the patient in need all around the globe. And in Asia-Pac, there are plenty of opportunities. I'll be with Al and all the members of the team flying at the end of the week to Japan to meet authorities to discuss also SMA, so we are committed. We are meeting with authorities, and we are working on that. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Thank you, all. Thank you for attending our call. And talk to you very soon. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This will conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Dan and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen first quarter 2017 financial results and business update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Matt Calistri, Senior Director, Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Matthew Calistri - Biogen, Inc.: Thanks, Dan. Thank you and welcome to Biogen's first quarter 2017 warnings conference call. Before we begin I encourage everyone to go to the Investor section of biogen.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in tables one and two. Table three includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We've also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Michael Ehlers, EVP of Research and Development; and our CFO, Paul Clancy. We'll be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Al Sandrock. Now I'll turn the call over to Michel. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am especially pleased to welcome you to this call as the CEO of Biogen. Before I turn to the details of the quarter I would like to share some initial thoughts on how Biogen is positioned today and where we see the company progressing. We do have a differentiated expertise in neuroscience and expect this to remain our core moving forward. We intend to maximize the potential of our R&D assets and bolster our pipeline through both internal and external opportunities. We are focused on flawless commercial execution in our priority geographies across MS, SMA, and biosimilars. We are aligning the organization around these goals including building our senior management team. We want our actions to speak louder than our words. As you will see throughout the rest of the call, I think we are already off to a great start. Q1 was a very good quarter financially and also a quarter with exciting events. For the first quarter of 2017, Biogen generated revenues of $2.8 billion, a 3% increase from the same period a year ago. On an apples-to-apples basis, when we exclude all hemophilia revenues from both period, we grew revenues 8% from the same period a year ago. GAAP earnings were $3.46 a share, a 22% decrease from the same period a year ago, driven by the charge we took related to our settlement and license agreement with Forward Pharma which Paul will discuss later. Non-GAAP EPS was $5.20, a 9% increase versus the same period a year ago. Excluding hemophilia, non-GAAP EPS growth will have been even higher. I am pleased with our results and achievement this quarter. Let me highlight what we think are the key takeaways for the quarter. First, financial performance. We saw continued stability in our MS franchise this quarter with a 38% global market share. MS revenues grew 3% year-over-year. We continued to add patients globally with a 2% increase versus last quarter and a 5% increase versus prior year. Biogen remains the global leader amongst the oral high efficacy and interferon MS therapies. Our SPINRAZA launch is off to a promising start with a first quarter revenue of $47 million. I am very proud of what our team has already accomplished, but we are still in the early days of the launch and have much more to achieve. We will not be satisfied until all of the patients and families that seek this treatment are able to receive therapy. This will take some time and tremendous effort from many, such as the dedicated medical teams that treat SMA, the passionate families, the remarkable advocates that rally for these patients, and our team of committed Biogen professionals, all of whom have been working seemingly nonstop to secure access and building up point of care. Our biosimilars business continued its strong trajectory and grew revenues 25% quarter-over-quarter. Next, I want to talk about non-financial achievement during the quarter. First, we recently enhanced our pipeline with the announcement of the license agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb for a Phase 2 anti-tau asset which we expect to close this quarter. We believe this transaction positions Biogen to be at the forefront of Alzheimer's research in terms of both mechanisms of action and time to market. I am really proud to see us deliver on this deal and we are just getting started. And with that said, I also want to add that we are working to add more assets our pipeline. Second, we are very pleased with the favorable outcome of the IPR proceeding and the interference. We believe these rulings underscore the strength of our patent portfolio for TECFIDERA. Additionally, we believe this will give us an ability to defend against potential challenges from MMF prodrugs that deliver a similar dose of MMF. Third, we are progressing and prioritizing our pipeline and Mike will be giving you an update. But before I turn it over to Mike, let me provide you with more details on our commercial performance. Starting with MS, first, we believe underlying demand for TECFIDERA remains stable in the U.S. with continued growth overseas. We remain focused on maximizing TECFIDERA's growth potential and we believe we are ready and well equipped to compete in an increasingly crowded market. Second, we are very pleased with the increased demand seen for TYSABRI this quarter in both the U.S. and overseas. Our research indicates a consistently positive benefit to its profile in the eyes of prescribers, and we believe physician confidence in patients' management may be increasing, especially in light of the updated label in Europe. We continue to launch ZINBRYTA in the U.S. and in an increasing number of international markets. We believe ZINBRYTA fulfills an important unmet need for patients transitioning from one of the platform or orals to a high-efficacy agent. Overall, we maintain our global market share in MS. We are committed to resourcing and focusing the Biogen team on maintaining our position as the market leader and growing the business, even with the entrance of new competition. Moving on to biosimilars, BENEPALI is now available in 16 countries with market share growing steadily particularly in Germany, the UK, and Sweden. We estimate there are now 40,000 patients on BENEPALI across Europe and growing. Now on to SPINRAZA. The initial underlying demand has been robust. We notice a solid progress in terms of both infrastructure and insurance coverage. Infrastructure, in the U.S. as of last week, there were 88 sites across 36 states that have administered SPINRAZA and 203 sites that have submitted start forms. These numbers have been increasing every week. Some leading centers are already dosing more than 10 patients, but most sites have only dosed one or two patients so far. From a coverage and reimbursement perspective, there are now over 165 plans that have an approved individual use of SPINRAZA, 100 commercial plans, and 65 Medicaid plans. Broadly speaking, of all the commercially insured lives across the U.S., not just the ones covered by the 100 plans I mentioned, we estimate 75% have a plan with an established policy regarding SPINRAZA and half of those have a policy with broad access. The 65 Medicaid plans I mention span 35 states and approximately 20 of those Medicaid plans have a formal policy in place with about half of the covered life under these policies having a broad access. To date, the majority of the dosed patients are Type 1, and we continue to see approval for Type 2 and Type 3. For plans without a policy or with a restricted Type 1 policy, often patients are still able to get approval through an appeal process or medical necessity request. We will be presenting CHERISH data later today at AAN which includes control data for patients most likely to develop Type 2 and Type 3 SMA. The FDA has already granted a broad label for all SMA patients and it is our hope this new data will convince the payers who have developed narrow medical policies to offer broader access to patients. In the U.S., it continues to be our goal that no patient will forego treatment because of financial limitation or an insurance denial. To date, roughly 25% of units dispensed have been provided through the free drug program. There is plenty of attention on the launch of SPINRAZA in the U.S., but we cannot forget about the demand outside of the U.S. Our expanded access program outside of the U.S. now has 353 Type 1 patients across 20 countries, of which 306 of those patients are in Europe. And last week the CHMP in the EU adopted a positive opinion for SPINRAZA, recommending a broad indication. We are preparing for potential EU markets approval in the coming months. We are also getting ready for potential approvals in Japan and Canada this year and anticipate filing in at least 10 additional countries throughout 2017. It is still early in the SPINRAZA launch, and we have a lot more work to do to get patients in need on therapy. So, all in all, a rich quarter with solid financial performance, stable leadership in MS, a promising launch of SPINRAZA, a steadily growing biosimilar business, progress in business development, and two important patent victories. I now turn it over to Mike for an update on our progress in R&D, the true engine of value creation for the company. Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: Thank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with some broad comments on the evolution of Biogen R&D. I am extremely excited about how we're becoming more entrepreneurial. Our approach is to blend strong science with a medical mindset and an entrepreneurial emphasis on innovation. We will be agnostic to whether we find innovation internally or externally. The goal is to continue our tradition of applying our deep scientific expertise as we aim to discover and develop the very best medicines for patients. We're laser focused on neuroscience and value creating adjacencies. I believe this makes abundant sense and positions Biogen uniquely in this breaking area to leverage our leadership in multiple sclerosis, to capture broad opportunities in neuroscience. There is arguably no bigger area of unmet medical need than diseases of the nervous system, and I believe Biogen has a tremendous competitive advantage to be the leader in this space. The genetics of neurological disorders has exploded yielding critical insight into new therapeutics and we can now measure and monitor disease states of the brain with unprecedented precision. We believe the SPINRAZA experience provides a glimpse of the future for targeting severe neurological disease and we aim to capitalize on this changing paradigm. I'm now going to walk you through the significant progress we made this quarter advancing, prioritize and building out our pipeline. Like the amyloid pathway, we believe tau pathology is central to Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Similar to our investments in a-beta antibodies and base inhibition, our commitment to tau is strong. Earlier this month we expanded our portfolio beyond BIIB076 in our preclinical anti-tau, antisense oligonucleotide with Ionis by entering into a licensing agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb for an advanced tau asset BMS-986168 as Michel mentioned. This new antibody is aimed at lowering tau and slowing progressive diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy or PSP, rare and devastating condition that affects movement, speech, vision, and cognitive function. PSP is currently an untreated orphan indication with a tremendous need for an effective therapy. BMS-986168 has shown compelling clinical data, robust lowering of tau in cerebrospinal fluid, and an appropriate benefit/risk profile in a Phase 1 study. We plan to rapidly initiate Phase 2 studies in both Alzheimer's disease and PSP. This licensing agreement reflects one of the most significant external additions to the Biogen pipeline in many years and highlights our heightened activity to seamlessly integrate business development with internal R&D. We expect more pipeline augmentation in the coming months. We also advanced BIIB076 into a Phase 1 trial this quarter. BIIB076 is a human recombinant monoclonal antibody targeting tau that was developed using Neurimmune's reverse translational medicine platform. The study is designed to evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics in both healthy volunteers and Alzheimer's disease patients. We continue to advance assets targeting the beta-amyloid pathway, which we believe plays a particularly important role early in the disease course. Phase 3 enrollment for aducanumab is going well and we expect both ENGAGE and EMERGE will be 50% enrolled by mid-May. We anticipate the studies to be fully enrolled by mid-2018. And we're honored that just last week aducanumab received a SAKIGAKE designation by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in Japan. Under the SAKIGAKE system, the target review period for designated products may be reduced from the standard review period of 12 months to as short as six months. Our collaboration partner Eisai is progressing a Phase 2 study of BAN2401, a humanized a-beta antibody which exhibits a strong binding preference for protofibrils. We expect data from this trial by the end of the year. Also, under our collaboration, Eisai has recently initiated the second Phase 3 study of elenbecestat, an oral BACE inhibitor. Now moving to multiple sclerosis. This week at the 69th annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology, or AAN in Boston, we will be presenting over 50 presentations and posters from our portfolio of treatments and investigational therapies. Specifically with MS, new data includes real-world evidence that supports TECFIDERA's efficacy profile and we believe underscores the importance of early treatment. Results show TECFIDERA significantly reduced the risk of relapse by 30% compared to teriflunomide in newly diagnosed patients and those previously treated with a prior disease modifying therapy. TECFIDERA also demonstrated comparable efficacy to fingolimod. New data from ENDORSE, a long-term extension study, also affirmed the well-characterized long-term safety profile of TECFIDERA use for up to nine years. New data from the TYSABRI Observational Program, or TOP, shows treatment na\u00efve patients who began taking TYSABRI within one year of symptom onset had a significantly greater likelihood of disability improvement than those who initiated treatment later in the course of their disease. Importantly, data also showed patients who continued TYSABRI treatment experienced better clinical outcomes than those who switched to another therapy. Also in MS as part of our ongoing portfolio prioritization effort, we have decided not to advance BIIB061, an oral remyelinating agent, into a Phase 2 MS study, and instead have chosen to prioritize opicinumab, or anti-LINGO. No new data on BIIB061 has driven this decision. We expect to initiate a Phase 2b study for opicinumab in the fourth quarter. After much diligence, we believe the feasibility of running studies for both BIIB061 and opicinumab in similar patient populations would ultimately slow down development for both compounds. We have more robust data and a greater clinical understanding of opicinumab, and thus have chosen to prioritize this program. We're exploring other indications for BIIB061 where remyelination and repair are important. Also, as Michel noted earlier, we will present significant data on SPINRAZA at AAN this week. We believe the overall findings continue to support the robust efficacy and benefit risk profile of SPINRAZA, a suite of remarkable data made possible through our close collaborations Ionis. Specifically, later today, we will present the end-of-study CHERISH results which we believe further demonstrate the meaningful impact SPINRAZA can have in individuals with later-onset SMA. CHERISH was a Phase 3 study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of SPINRAZA in individuals most likely to develop Type 2 or Type 3 SMA. The end-of-study analysis demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in motor function as assessed by the treatment difference of 4.9 points in the mean change from baseline to month 15 in the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded. From baseline to month 15, individuals who received SPINRAZA achieved a 3.9 point mean improvement while individuals who were not on treatment experienced a mean decline of one point. Data from the other endpoints analyzed including upper limb motor function and attainment of new motor milestones were consistently in favor of children who received treatment. No patients discontinued the study due to adverse events and the results demonstrated a favorable benefit/risk profile. This Thursday, we will present new interim data from the Phase 2 NURTURE study evaluating SPINRAZA for the treatment of infants under six weeks old with genetically diagnosed and pre-symptomatic SMA at initiation of treatment. At the time of the interim analysis, 20 infants were enrolled for a median of 317 days and all infants in the study were alive and none required respiratory intervention. Additionally, most infants achieved motor milestone and growth parameter gains generally consistent with normal development such as head control, independent sitting, standing, and walking independently. These results are dramatically different from the known course of SMA infants with Type 1 SMA where motor milestone achievement of any sort is absent. In this study, no infants have discontinued or withdrawn from the study due to adverse events and no new safety concerns have been identified. These results are encouraging and we believe continue to highlight the need for newborn screening. Importantly as we look to expand our presence in SMA, we are also excited about the potential for gene therapy as a complementary mechanism. Through our collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania, we plan to advance our SMA gene therapy program into the clinic by the first half of next year. We're also working to advance BIIB074 for neuropathic pain. We recently completed the topline data analyses of the exploratory Phase 2a in erythromelalgia, a disease characterized by Nav 1.7 mutations. In this study, of the seven patients analyzed, no statistically significant treatment effect was observed for the primary or secondary endpoints and the variability in the responses was notable. No new safety signals were observed. We're planning to initiate another Phase 2 study in small fiber neuropathy towards the end of this year as we continue to explore multiple potential indications for this asset. We have previously seen compelling efficacy signals for BIIB074 in Phase 2 studies of both trigeminal neuralgia and painful lumbo-sacral radiculopathy or PLSR. Results for trigeminal neuralgia were recently published in Lancet Neurology. We continue to enroll the Phase 2b PLSR study with data expected next year. For trigeminal neuralgia, we now intend to initiate the Phase 3 studies simultaneously in the U.S. and Europe. As a result, we now expect patient enrollment to begin in 2018. Lastly, in our effort to develop new therapies for neurologic diseases, we believe there is opportunity in stroke. We expect the follow-on Phase 2b dose ranging study for natalizumab in acute ischemic stroke, ACTION 2, to be fully enrolled this year and hope to share the results shortly thereafter. We're making good progress advancing our early clinical pipeline with 13 programs in Phase 1 or Phase 2 development. I look forward to sharing updates on these programs as they progress. Overall, I'm very excited about our pipeline, but good is never good enough. We'd like to see more later-stage candidates. We aim to continue prioritizing the most promising assets while looking externally to expand our pipeline. With that, I will now pass the call to Paul. Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.46 in the first quarter. GAAP EPS was negatively impacted by $1.22 related to the settlement and license with Forward Pharma in the U.S. PTO ruling in favor of Biogen in the interference proceeding. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $5.20 in the first quarter, an increase of 9% versus prior year. Total revenue for Q1 increased 3% year-over-year to approximately $2.8 billion. Excluding hemophilia revenues from both periods, total revenue grew 8%. Global first quarter TECFIDERA revenues were $958 million. This included revenues of $751 million in the U.S., an increase of 1% versus Q1 last year, and $207 million outside the U.S., an increase of 3% versus Q1 last year. On a sequential basis, U.S. TECFIDERA revenues were negatively impacted by approximately $50 million to $60 million due to lower levels of inventory at the specialty pharmacies. Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY were $648 million during the first quarter, a decrease of 3% versus Q1 last year. This included $465 million in the U.S. and $184 million in sales outside the U.S. TYSABRI worldwide revenues were $545 million this quarter, an increase of 14% versus Q1 last year. This included $306 million in the U.S. and $239 million outside the U.S. Outside the U.S., Q1 TYSABRI revenue benefited by approximately $45 million, due to reaching an agreement with the price and reimbursement committee of the Italian National Medicines Agency related to prior periods. SPINRAZA revenues for Q1, its first full quarter on the market, were strong as we reported $47 million. SPINRAZA U.S. revenue was $46 million. This represents very strong underlying demand combined with some natural inventory build as the launch ramps. We estimate that less than $10 million of the SPINRAZA revenue was due to inventory that was built up in the channel in the U.S. We also had $1 million in sales outside the U.S. related to named patient sales. Hemophilia revenues for the sub-period, prior to the spinoff of Bioverativ, were $74 million. Our biosimilar business generated $66 million in revenue this quarter. Anti-CD20 revenues were $341 million for Q1 and total other revenues were $90 million. Now turning to the expense lines on the P&L. Both Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP cost of goods sold were $385 million or 14% of revenue. Q1 GAAP R&D expense was $423 million or 15% of revenue. Q1 non-GAAP R&D was $421 million, also 15% of revenue, a decrease on a sequential basis as we had no meaningful milestone payments or BD activity in Q1, and as the Phase 3 studies for SPINRAZA wound down. Q1 GAAP SG&A expense was $499 million or 18% of revenue. Q1 non-GAAP SG&A was $483 million or 17% of revenue. Both GAAP and non-GAAP other net expense was $38 million in Q1. In Q1, our GAAP tax rate was approximately 24% and our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 23%, which includes some modest favorability from discrete tax items related to Q1. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 216 million for Q1. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2 million shares of the company's common stock for a total value of $584 million. And since March 31, we've purchased an additional approximately 2 million shares for a total value of $543 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.7 billion in cash and marketable securities with approximately 24% of this in the United States. As we go forward, we'll be closely watching the launch of OCREVUS. Overall, we anticipate a negative impact to our portfolio that'll be partially offset by the royalties that we receive. In conjunction with the recently announced agreement to exclusively license the BMS anti-tau molecule, we expect to make an upfront payment of $300 million to Bristol-Myers Squibb in the second quarter and a near-term $60 million payment to the former stockholders of iPierian. These will impact both our GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense assuming deal closure. These amounts exceed the $100 million we earmarked for business development expense in our previously announced 2017 full year financial guidance. We plan to update our annual financial guidance on the second quarter earnings call. I'll turn the call over to Michel for his closing comments. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Thank you, Paul. I will venture to say that 2017 is off to a strong start for Biogen, but we have much more to do. We are refocusing the organization and I am building my management team. We are all energized and are working to develop the strategy and priorities for both short-term and long-term shareholder value creation. We plan to update you on our progress when we report our second quarter earnings in July, but we do not wait with obvious actions to be taken to support Biogen in terms of R&D, BD and commercial. Our actions will speak for themselves. For July, we hope to provide you with clarity on our priorities and plan. I aim to communicate a clear picture of the Biogen of tomorrow, a company that can meaningfully improve patients' life in the increasingly important field of neuroscience through new, innovative therapies and create long-term sustainable value for our company and our shareholders. And I believe strongly that this is the new Biogen, a clear leader in a well-defined and fast-growing space. We do tackle big challenges. We are laser focused on execution and we aim to deliver strong results. In closing, I'd like to thank our employees around the world who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patients' lives, and all of the physicians, caregivers and participants in our clinical development programs. The past and future achievements could not be realized without their passion and commitment. With that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator : As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. Your first question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC: Oh, good morning. Congrats on the fine launch for SPINRAZA and the overall quality of Q1 results as well. My question's on SPINRAZA. I guess we've gone, in the last three months, from thinking the launch would be gradual to today calling it robust. So what's going better than you expected? Is it access to reimbursement or your ability to work through the logistical issues at the centers or greater urgency to treat, greater demand? Please comment. Thanks. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: So a couple of months ago, and since the beginning actually \u2013 this is Michel \u2013 we did identify two bottlenecks. And number one was infrastructure due to the intrathecal therapy injection modalities that were not performed into the SMA northern (33:30) neuromuscular centers, and in addition, the insurance coverage. Those two bottlenecks remain and they will be also relevant for the other markets where we're going to launch SPINRAZA hopefully soon. Having said that, motivated families, patients, parents, advocacy groups, a professional team at Biogen, dedicated providers, the leadership of the hospital and the providers were able to accommodate, not as a linear fashion, some bigger centers with a certain pattern, smaller centers eventually with more speed and flexibility, one size does not fit all. But all in all, this is where we stand today. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks very much, and share my congratulations on SPINRAZA. Could you give us a little bit more detail on the MS business, particularly the contribution of price and volume in the U.S. for the brands there, and comment on price? Previously you'd said that you anticipated taking one price increase a year. Is that still the company's view? And is that something that we should continue to plan for the balance of the year? Thanks. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: So in the U.S., that remains our largest and stable market for which we remain fully dedicated to continue to improve the picture. First of all, on the market dynamic, if you recall well, I did mention that in 2016 we saw a slight contraction of the market in terms of commercial goods versus the prior period. Well, we did see that sustain during Q1 versus Q4 of 2016, probably, and by a few percentage, nothing dramatic. One of the reason might well be that there was a bit of warehousing due to OCREVUS. I don't know by facts, but this might be a reason. All in all, the assumption within the company is that the market will return to low-single-digit market growth for the remainder of 2017. For Biogen business, a very strong defense of our performance. And actually, I am pleased by the momentum I see in a slightly declining market of our NTRx and TRx shares and you can have a look into those. I think that TECFIDERA defended very well, TYSABRI rebounded. Overall, Biogen is holding very strong and we continue to see a slight erosion of the interferons as expected. So all in all I will say a good performance that I want to see improved. Capture rate is holding very well, slightly improving. Discontinuation due to TEC GI did not really improve and I'm not satisfied by that. But I do not give up. So we are working hard to improve on this figure. But all in all, I will say it's very solid engagement while the team has the plate full of tactical plans in order to be ready for an increased competition while we speak. Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: And then, Geoff, this is Paul. Just second part of your question, we understand it's an important question, and I know we've commented in the past, but we're not going to comment on any kind of perspective of forward pricing in the MS market. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: If I may add just a small comment on this important dynamic that we see in the marketplace, is that Biogen has the opportunity to benefit from a complete portfolio in MS, and we are working very hard. And if we want to change the landscape, we need to move away and try to progress on value-based and innovative type of contracting. It's difficult. The team is making some progress, but today I have nothing to report except that some progress and some discussion with different PNs. So we are working on this dimension. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Morning, guys. Thanks for the questions and also want to give my congrats on the quarter. Michel, you talked about filling out the pipeline more and with the launch of anti-tau, are you comfortable with the number of assets or mechanisms that you have in the Alzheimer's portfolio? And is it reasonable to assume that biz dev may be neurology focused or is it likely that you guys will look more broadly at the orphan space just given the SPINRAZA launch? Thank you. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Thanks for the question. I'll get started, and obviously, Mike will comment more thoroughly. First, I would like to say that I'm very pleased that Biogen was able to pull it in a very competitive setting. Anti-tau is an important mechanism that complements well via all the programs we have with the same target, but also the a-beta assets that we have with aducanumab at the forefront and the BACE inhibitor that we have partnered. So these positions, Biogen's I will say pretty well in AD and Mike will complement. We continue to work hard and we are doing that in order to improve the footprint of our phase early stage which is a sweet spot on where we can add much value with the development. Biogen's, at Biogen neuroscience is dimension in life, and this is where we can add most of the value with meaningful development because we have great people, great team. And the partners see that. So before we move beyond, we're looking to neuro space. And in the neuro space, we look first at MS, SMA and neurology. Mike? Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Geoff, for the question. On the tau side, I'd say we're very excited now to have this more advanced tau antibody in the portfolio. And as I'd mentioned, we've got an earlier second antibody, BIIB076 and in our collaboration with Ionis, an antisense oligonucleotide against tau which we're looking to advance to the clinic in the coming months. So we're quite excited about that. Michel said it well. We're really concentrated in neuro as an area. I'd say when you look across the opportunity landscape externally, we really try to focus on things that are in the early clinical asset space. That's kind of our core, where we believe that we can identify things with a bit of asymmetric knowledge and apply some asymmetric capabilities to that. We don't exclude other areas, but that's just where we're concentrated. So if we see a good opportunity that's a little bit later in a more adjacent area or even something that's earlier, we're quite open to it. On the question around more orphan diseases or other things, I think that the experience with SPINRAZA highlights to us the real potential advantage of intrathecal ASOs as a modality. We've got an early Phase 1 ongoing study in SOD1 mutant ALS as just another example of that. So we see great opportunity in that intersection between neuroscience and certain orphan diseases. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC : Hi, guys. Congrats on the SPINRAZA launch. So, since I was totally off on my end, I thought I'd ask you how to understand SPINRAZA numbers some more. So Paul, thank you. You mentioned it was about less than $10 million worth of inventory of the $46 million in U.S. So that would imply $36 million in sales or perhaps something like 360 infusions. So I guess what I'm trying to understand is if there were 30 centers enrolled as of early March and 88 centers as of April 21, that implies most of the patients have probably not had more than three infusions. So is it unreasonable if I were to say 360 divided by 3, perhaps about 120 patients on therapy as of Q1? And I'm partially doing that to understand if there's a spillover into 2Q or not. And maybe one, just a quick one on R&D. Just wanted to understand the significance of the midway enrolled on aducanumab Phase 3. Does the protocol enabled an interim analysis of sorts on week 52 or week 76 for these first 1300 patients? Thank you. Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: Umer, this is Paul. Let me kind of do a couple things. One is the inventory, I know it was important for every \u2013 on SPINRAZA was important, but it literally is a triangulation of data. So I wouldn't \u2013 it's not as precise as our knowledge of kind of the inventory on TECFIDERA in the specialty pharmacy channel, but it is our best estimate at this time that it's something in the less than $10 million range. And while we have a closed system on SPINRAZA, sometimes the patient data lags and we're estimating things along the way. No doubt as we move through Q1 the patients began to ramp and the dosing schedule, as you point out, the loading dose schedule does likely have some level of spillover effect. But I think that's kind of small dynamics and broadly what we're trying to do is get patient access and get through the infusion capacity constraints, get through the access constraints, get as many patients across all the different types of SMN patients on therapy. Alfred W. Sandrock - Biogen, Inc.: And Umer, this is Al, on the aducanumab question. We have a policy here that we're not talking about interim analyses. I'm afraid I can't answer that question. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Ronny Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein Limited : Good morning, everybody, and thank you for taking my question. I'm going to stick with nusinersen. First, do you have any better feel right now for how long the effect of nusinersen is? Given that we kind of are done with the question of the early launch, the question now is how long can you actually keep those patients alive and therefore, what should we model for those product's accumulation of patients long-term? And second, you've mentioned that you're about to take your gene therapy into the clinic. I guess the question is what is the differentiation of your program versus the existing gene therapy which is already in the clinic? What are you doing better than they that will allow you to differentiate versus their product? Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: Okay. Ronny, this is Mike. I'll start with that a little bit. On the question of SPINRAZA durability, I guess what we can say is that we started the first patient dose just about five years ago, and from what we've seen for that, there's been, essentially, sustained effects with those patients to date. There's a lot that's not known here. Obviously, this is kind of an ongoing clinical experiment and many of these patients are being rolled over into an open label kind of observation period for this. So the fact is, is that we just don't know what ultimately the durability would be, but everything that we've seen is a durable effect of continued dosing of SPINRAZA. So I'd say on that, on the gene therapy side of this \u2013 so there are a lot of things. One is we're very encouraged by the gene therapy data that is out there, of what AveXis has publicly reported. We are quite bullish in general on the modality of AAV-based gene therapy. We do believe that there's the prospect for differentiation in terms of tissue tropism, serotype, delivery routes, dosage, viral load, manufacturing, and so forth. So we think there's ample room for differentiation and time will tell. The other thing we would say is we believe that there can be a future out there where these are used in combination in certain settings that will depend very much on the stage and type of SMA. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions. Just curious, what are the qualifications for the free drug program for SPINRAZA? And do you anticipate the 25% of units flowing through now will kind of remain the steady state going forward? Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: Ronny (sic) [Cory] (47:23), this is Paul. Good. Thanks for the question. It's kind of tied up in if there's denial, effectively. There's obviously also some normal, as you would expect, income for people that can't afford it. With respect to the kind of free goods, I think that is an estimate that we won't know until we get much farther, and I would guess it wobbles quarter to quarter. I mean, it even wobbled within the quarter, so I think it wobbles around a little bit quarter to quarter as well. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Specifically maybe Mike, can you comment on what's the difference between BIIB076, your anti-tau antibody that just entered Phase 1 and then the anti-tau antibody license from Bristol-Myers, what really caused the decision to out-license that compound? And then secondly, maybe, I think, Michel, you commented on roughly half of the Medicaid plans now cover SPINRAZA. Can you provide any color on what's the percentage of commercial plans that cover SPINRAZA now? Thank you. Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: Okay, Ying, so I'll start with that. Thanks for the question. A few things, the reason we like \u2013 I mentioned about how we just in general see intersecting tau as a very important feature of neurodegenerative disease including Alzheimer's disease. I'd say three or four core things. One, it was a more advanced clinical stage asset that was of interest. Two, it was really quite clear that you had a very potent antibody here where they had generated a very compelling biomarker data in terms of robust lowering of CSF tau. There'd been more clinical experience and a known kind of benefit/risk profile that had been seen in many patients to date, as you would expect from a more advanced clinical asset. And then it also gave us this kind of accelerated opportunity in progressive supranuclear palsy as another very exciting indication for us. Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: Ying, this is Paul. Let me kind of try to tackle the second part of your question in terms of coverage on SPINRAZA in the commercial plans. Our estimate is that about 75% plans that cover the lives across the United States have coverage and approved SPINRAZA. Of that, about half of those have a narrow, call it Type 1 type coverage and about half of those have broad coverage. Importantly, as Mike pointed out, we'll be presenting data tonight that will hopefully start to get a more broad coverage as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Schimmer with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Can you please estimate the size of the SPINRAZA patient backlog? And do you believe you can address infrastructure bottleneck issues so that it's no longer a gating step by end of the year? And then for Europe, how are you handling this so it doesn't slow launch there, too? Thank you. Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: Yeah. Josh, actually we'd prefer not to. We obviously have internal data on start forms and we have a sense for that, but we'd prefer not to because I just don't know the accuracy of it all at this point in time. With respect to Europe, we are effectively have been putting pre-launch efforts in place on a country by country basis, prioritizing, obviously, those countries that we expect to get reimbursement earlier as opposed to later. So tremendous amount of energy in Germany, energy in the Nordics, energy actually also in UK for some relatively unique circumstances. And I think it's going to be a very similar dynamic with respect to trying to accommodate and get through infusion capacity. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: If I may add very briefly, I am monitoring very closely the ability of the organization to implement and to execute, being for SPINRAZA, and I think that the data to date speaks for itself, and we'll continue to do the same in Europe with the individual regulators to follow up following the CHMP endorsement with a broad label and including reimbursement. So we'll get started hopefully we believe this summer with Germany and Scandinavia with an access condition. And we have an early access program with more than 300 patients. And gradually the countries will come with market access condition one after the other. And it's all about execution from the Biogen team, it's execution on SMA, execution on biosimilar and execution obviously on MS. I just want to reiterate that for TECFIDERA, we are working very hard. TECFIDERA is now the market \u2013 is growing share in 17 out of 21 markets in Europe, okay? Germany is growing share six months in a row. We have hit within France the highest ever share for TECFIDERA. So it's all about the ability for the team to implement well with what we have in the bag in the portfolio today in a very focused manner and the right way. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Salim Syed with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Hey guys, congrats on the quarter. Just two questions. Paul, I think both of these are for you. You mentioned OCREVUS having a negative impact. Can you just go into a little bit more color there? And what products in particular do you see OCREVUS impacting? Is it mostly TYSABRI, or do you think it's TECFIDERA? And then second, just on SMID-cap valuations, it sounds like now you guys are approaching M&A a little bit more aggressively. Paul, can you maybe comment on your thoughts on SMID-cap valuations at these levels? Thank you. Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: Yeah, let me take the second one first. I mean, no comment that one. So, I mean, I have points of view on it, but we obviously don't talk about it. It's kind of like one step away from talking about names. Look, OCREVUS, we've done a lot of work on it. Again, we do think a new entrant that has an interesting profile for patients and physicians will get a place in the marketplace and inevitably as we have plus or minus 40 share across our existing portfolio of products, there'll be an impact on that. We think that OCREVUS plays in the high efficacy segment. And as a result, the likelihood is that it impacts TYSABRI vis-\u00e0-vis the products in our portfolio more than others as well. There's a chance it impacts TECFIDERA as well. We think that the platform therapies inclusive of AVONEX and PLEGRIDY are the least impacted. All of that is obviously a total forecast and we're going to be monitoring it very closely as we move forward. And, look, this is not a surprise, right? So I think that I would characterize it as similar to way Michel has characterized it as that the best thing that we can do is just simply continue to really put forward the strength of our own products and we have a great, great suite of products across a bunch of different kind of segments and kind of patient needs in the marketplace. And then certainly in the United States, we're heartened that we're somewhat hedged from the royalties that are gained from OCREVUS. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: If I can just briefly add to what Paul rightly said, towards the higher end of the spectrum, I reinforce that, at least at the beginning, patients with high level of the (56:06) positivity that have to be switched, and this is a good thing, and obviously the PPMS, for which we'll get a benefit. So this is what we see, this is the very early days. The label is in line with what we did assume. We are monitoring very closely but we are monitoring more our assets than the competition. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the SPINRAZA launch. Just one around the S1P class in general. I know Celgene has a drug, ozanimod, and you've talked about potentially going forward in partnership, but what do you think makes for a differentiated S1P1 in general? I know you had experience with Mitsubishi as well. Thanks. Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: So I will start with that just to say that, I don't know that we're going to really comment that much around... Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: I think it's a good question for Celgene. Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: Yeah, exactly. I think that's right. Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Was just wondering on SPINRAZA if you can give us any color on the percentage of new starts versus rollover patient. And then I noticed there was an uptick in cost of goods this quarter. Paul, was there anything notable there or is that going to trend down over the rest of the year? Thanks. Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: Terence, thanks for the question. This is Paul. Let me try to take both of them. I think what you're referring to on SPINRAZA is with respect to rollover patients of those that were in the trial or in our EAP program. And on both dimensions, it was a very small number actually. The trial patients are continuing on in a trial. The EAP patients, because that if you recall, it was approved in such a short period of time from filing, we actually in the United States had well below 100 patients on EAP and only a handful of them actually have moved into commercial patients. So the vast majority of the sales for Q1 on SPINRAZA are due to, in effect, de novo new patient. Cost of goods sold is a bit a function of a number of things. The biosimilar business, which is growing quite strong, comes with a high cost of goods sold. We have had \u2013 the AVONEX business actually has an additional royalty that started in the second half of 2016 and when we compare it to the first half of 2016, we kind of have unfavorable comps. So I think that's indicative probably of what we're going to see over the next number of quarters. Matthew Calistri - Biogen, Inc.: And Dan, we're going to have time for one more question. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for fitting me in. I appreciate it. I just wanted to try and sort of group together sort of all the comments you've made on SPINRAZA and just try and understand sort of a broader question, which is obviously there are some of these dynamics that you've talked about including insurance and infusion which is sort of limiting some of the uptake, though you've obviously worked through that with patients. And I guess what I'm trying to understand is how should we think about if there was a bolus in this quarter and the new start rate should decline or if you still think that the dynamics you talked around insurance and infusions are still holding back a substantial portion of patients and that the new start rate should continue to increase as we think about for maybe the next quarter or through the rest of the year. Thanks. Paul J. Clancy - Biogen, Inc.: Matthew, thanks for the question. This is Paul. Quite frankly, it's hard to really tell on that, the kinetics of this. And we've said it all along, it's hard to tell. We're very pleased with Q1. I personally would expect it continues to ramp if you look at the number of patients in the United States. So you just look at the number of patients, the number of centers that still haven't, that we're still working through plans, I would. The kinetics of it \u2013 and also, we always have to keep in mind the kinetics of kind of the cohort of patients going through loading dose then moving to maintenance dose and so on and so forth. I think we'll see some level of we'll all be interpreting the data as we go quarter by quarter. But broadly speaking, I think what this really pulls out is the tremendous value of the drug in the tremendous unmet need in the patient population. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: And if I may just add and conclude, the two bottlenecks that we did identify at the outset remain. It's a battle every day, and we are not yet where we want to be. Some of the largest plan or the largest facilities in terms of infrastructure are still not dosing the way the patients deserves and the way the families and the advocacy group expect. So there is still a way to go, but it's unlocking and progressing week after week. I think the key element that first of all the country deserves, the patient deserves is newborn screening. The day we have that, we can really change the treatment and the evolution of SMA. And if you look at the NURTURE data the results speaks for themselves. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Thank you all for your attention today. Operator : Thank you to everyone. This will conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of a GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in tables one and two. Table three includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We've also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. Given that we have a lot to cover today, we'll only be covering the key financial results for the quarter. For further detail, I encourage you to refer to the press release and slides. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer Michel Vounatsos and Dr. Michael Ehlers EVP of Research and Development, who'll also be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Al Sandrock; Dr. Paul McKenzie, EVP of Pharmaceutical Operations and Technology and Dr. Jean-Paul Kress, EVP, President of International and Head of Global Therapeutic Operations. Now I will turn the call to Michel. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I am very pleased to discuss our Q2 results and recent events and increase to our 2017 revenue guidance and as promised an update on our strategy for long-term growth. At Biogen we are increasingly focused on execution, maximizing the potential of both our commercial business and our pipeline and building new growth drivers for the future. We had a great first half of the year and we are excited to build on this momentum for the rest of 2017 and beyond. For the second quarter of 2017, Biogen generated record revenues of $3.1 billion. On an apples-to-apples basis excluding hemophilia, revenues grew an impressive 15% from the same period a year ago, our highest quarterly growth in over two years. Revenues grew 6% when we include hemophilia revenues in the prior period. GAAP earnings per share were $4.07, and non-GAAP EPS was $5.04. Earnings this quarter were impacted by the charge related to our recent licensing deal with Bristol-Myers Squibb for their anti-tau asset, now BIIB092. We believe this is a critically important investment as it gives us two new opportunities, one in progressive supranuclear palsy and one in Alzheimer's disease. This is a great example of the growth driving deals we are pursuing. Let me now highlight how we think are the key takeaway for the quarter. First, financial performance. We saw continued growth in our MS franchise this quarter. MS revenues grew 5% year-over-year to $2.3 billion, a record quarter. We continue to add patients globally with a 4% increase versus the prior year and a 1% increase versus last quarter. We are pleased with the progress we are making with the launch of SPINRAZA as we generated $203 million in revenue in the second quarter. We saw significant uptake in the U.S., and we are working with patients, physicians and payers to expand access to as many SMA patients as possible. And we are now building on this momentum outside the U.S. with recent approvals in Europe, Japan and Canada. We are preparing our launch efforts in these markets, and over time, we aim to make this therapy widely available across the globe. Our biosimilar business delivered revenues of $91 million, and we recently received a positive CHMP opinion in Europe for our adalimumab biosimilar, IMRALDI. Assuming IMRALDI is approved, Biogen will become the first company to offer access to biosimilars of the three major anti-TNFs in Europe. As we will discuss later, we are actively reallocating resources to high-priority R&D BD and commercial growth opportunities. For the second quarter, we recorded $430 million in SG&A expense along with $796 million in R&D expense. R&D expense included $360 million related to our licensing agreement with BMS. We also booked a $120 million GAAP charge related to our acquisition of BIIB093 from Remedy Pharmaceuticals. Next, our nonfinancial achievement during the quarter. First, we expanded our efforts in acute neurology by acquiring Remedy Pharmaceuticals Phase-3 ready asset, BIIB093 for large hemispheric infarction, a severe form of stroke with no available therapy. We completed this deal shortly after entering into our licensing agreement with BMS for the anti-tau antibody, now BIIB092. We aim to do much more business development as we execute on our priority to bolster our pipeline. Second, we announced two positive update on aducanumab for Alzheimer's disease, including an update on enrollment and a protocol change of the Phase 3 trials which Mike will cover in more details. Third, we have made significant progress in building our new senior management team. Jean-Paul Kress has joined as EVP, President International and Head of Global Therapeutic Operations. Ginger Gregory has joined as our new head of HR. Alisha Alaimo will be joining us as Senior VP of U.S. Therapeutic Operation. And we are also making progress in our search for a new CFO. Now more details on our commercial performance starting with MS. First, global TECFIDERA revenues were a record $1.1 billion this quarter, a 13% increase versus the prior year with approximately half of that growth driven by volume. U.S. revenues increased 16% to $875 million versus the prior quarter. We were pleased to see revenue growth for TEC (7:41) in the U.S. as strong commercial execution and recovery from the Q1 seasonality led to significant increased volumes. TECFIDERA also benefited from improved gross to net this quarter. As a reminder, Q1 was impacted by lower inventory levels in the channel, which remain relatively flat in Q2. Outside the U.S., TECFIDERA continued on its trends of positive patient growth driven by recently launched market such as Italy, Poland and Japan. In Europe, the number of TECFIDERA patients grew 17% year-over-year. While in Japan, TECFIDERA has rapidly grown to nearly 8% market share in its first few months on the market. 250,000 people living with MS have now been treated with TECFIDERA. This is a remarkable achievement. As the market-leading oral (8:48), TECFIDERA has a wealth of real-world experience including almost 400,000 patient years of exposure. Second, global TYSABRI revenues were stable versus the prior year. As anticipated, we did see some modest pressure on TYSABRI in the U.S. this quarter following the launch of OCREVUS. This quarter, TYSABRI was also negatively impacted by approximately $10 million due to a charge to discount and allowances related to prior periods. In Europe, TYSABRI continued to add patients as it benefited from the updated label providing improved clarity on risk stratification and patient management. As a reminder, last quarter ex-U.S. TYSABRI revenues benefited by approximately $45 million related to the AIFA settlement. Third, we are delivering on our plan to demonstrate leadership in MS through value-based contracting with four agreements executed in July. We are piloting two separate approaches, the first aligning price to patient outcomes. And the second, adjusting price for patients initiating therapy who discontinue. We believe this pilot will provide valuable information that we can apply to future contracting approaches as we work to tie the pricing of our products to the clinical value and expand formulary access for patients. Overall, we maintain our global market share in MS. You will hear more from us shortly in our strategic update on our plans and our commitment to maximize the resilience of this critical business. Moving on to biosimilars, revenues grew 37% in the second quarter. BENEPALI is now available in 20 countries and is the market leader in the UK, Norway, Sweden and Denmark. In Germany, BENEPALI's share of the etanercept market now exceeds 30% as we are capturing almost two thirds of na\u00efve patients starting therapy. We estimate there are now 50,000 patients on BENEPALI across Europe and growing. FLIXABI is now available in eight markets, and we are working hard to drive adoption. Now onto SPINRAZA. Global revenues were $203 million including $195 million in the U.S. and $8 million outside the U.S. U.S. revenues included approximately $30 million related to an inventory build reflecting the strong demand. Ex-U.S. included the initial launch in the Nordics and named-patient sales in the Middle East and Latin America. We continue to make solid progress in the U.S. in terms of infrastructure and insurance coverage. With regards to infrastructure in the U.S., as of the middle of July, there were 145 sites that have administered SPINRAZA, a significant increase from 88 sites last quarter. And we now have a total of 233 sites that have submitted stat forms. We are pleased to communicate that the top 30 SMA centers are now all up and running and able to dose patients. From a coverage and reimbursement perspective, we have seen strong progress towards expanding access. Over 80% of commercially-insured lives across the U.S. now have a policy in place, with roughly two thirds having broad access. And for Medicaid, approximately two thirds of covered lives have a formal policy in place with 60% having broad access. Very strong demand across patient types with roughly two third of patients treated to date having Type 2 or Type 3 SMA. However, we believe that up to 60% of the Type 2 SMA population has already undergone some type of spinal surgery, creating challenges in intrathecal administration. As leading physician are transitioned to some of these more challenging cases, we expect slower uptake in Type 2 patients through the balance of the year. We are working closely with physicians to understand best practices to help these patients including alternate delivery options. As the new standard of care for SMA, SPINRAZA is fundamentally changing the treatment paradigm for patients requiring spinal surgery. The SMA standard of care guidelines are being updated to acknowledge the availability of an intrathecally administered therapy and will reinforce the need to use surgical techniques that can provide access for intrathecal delivery. As a result of improved coverage, we have seen a decrease in utilization of our free drug program. In Q2, approximately 20% of units were dispensed as free drugs as compared to 25% in Q1. This reflects our broader efforts to make SPINRAZA available to as many patients as possible. We continue to see important advancements in establishing newborn screening guidelines for SMA in the U.S. This is critical in our efforts to treat patients as early as possible. We are pleased to report that this quarter SMA was accepted into the review process for the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel. We intend to support this continued efforts with several pilots already established in Massachusetts, Georgia, Michigan and New York. Missouri passed a bill earlier this month and became the first state to institute newborn screening for SMA and we hope this is just the start. Outside the U.S. following recent regulatory approvals, we are quickly ramping up launch efforts in Europe, Japan and Canada. We estimate there are approximately 12,000 SMA patients across the geographies. In Europe, we have now launched in Germany and the Nordics with more countries to come as we secure reimbursements. During this transitional period, our Expanded Access Program will remain open for infantile patients where possible. We now have almost 600 patients across 24 countries of which over 460 are in Europe. So far this year, we filed in Brazil, Switzerland, Israel and South Korea, in addition to Australia, which was filed late 2016. We anticipate filing in a number of additional countries for the rest of 2017. Biogen is implementing a successful launch strategy across multiple geographies working hard to maximize the number of patients who are able to benefit from SPINRAZA. While we are pleased with the progress we have made, our hope is that all patients with SMA will have access to this life-changing therapy. There is still much more work to be done. In conclusion, it was an exciting quarter with strong execution. We saw continued leadership and growth in MS, a rapidly progressing launch of SPINRAZA, a growing biosimilar business and further progress in business development. Last but not least, Biogen's new leadership team is coming together. I will now turn the call over to Mike for an update on our recent progress in R&D. Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: Thank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by walking you through the significant progress we made this quarter advancing, reshaping and building out our pipeline as we further strengthen our leadership in neuroscience, starting with Alzheimer's disease. Last week, we presented a new post hoc analysis of the Phase 1b PRIME study of aducanumab at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in London. This analysis looked at changes in cognitive and functional subscores of the clinical dementia rating scale, which is the primary endpoint of our Phase 3 trials. The data showed that aducanumab slowed the decline on both the cognitive and functional assessments compared to placebo, and the results of all subgroups studied were consistent with the overall study population. We also received, recently submitted a protocol amendment for the Phase 3 aducanumab clinical studies ENGAGE and EMERGE that will titrate the high-dose ApoE4 carrier cohort up to 10 milligrams per kilogram. Previously, the cohort was dosed up to six milligrams per kilogram. This change was made based on the results from the titration arm of the placebo controlled portion of the Phase 1b PRIME study that showed patients who were treated with aducanumab using a titration regimen had a lower instance of ARIA at 12 months than those patients treated in the higher fixed-dose cohorts. Based on data from PRIME, higher dose titration of APoE4 carriers may increase the likelihood of demonstrating meaningful clinical efficacy. Importantly, Phase 3 enrollment for aducanumab continues to progress well thanks to operational excellence from our team. Our strategy was to identify exceptional sites that we believe had high potential to enroll patients and to amplify the strength of our data by raising awareness. This plan appears to be working very well. We have sites telling us this is the first time they've had patients come in and request a specific Alzheimer's disease trial. Across ENGAGE and EMERGE, we added over 400 patients in the second quarter, enrollment continues to surpass our original expectations. Further adding to our portfolio and as announced in our Q1 call, we entered into a licensing agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb for an advanced tau monoclonal antibody asset, BIIB092, as Michel alluded to. The deal closed in the second quarter and we have made important progress advancing the asset further into the clinic. In Q2, we dosed the first patient in the Phase 2 study for progressive supranuclear palsy, a devastating telepathy neurodegenerative disorder without treatment options. And we're on track to initiate a Phase 2 study in Alzheimer's disease early next year. Our collaboration partner Eisai, is also progressing the Phase 2 study of BAN2401, a humanized anti-A-beta antibody which exhibits a strong binding preference for protofibrils. We expect data from this trial by the end of the year. Moving on to our efforts in spinal muscular atrophy, last month at the 2017 Annual SMA Conference hosted by Cure SMA, by we provided a deeper understanding of the efficacy and safety of SPINRAZA across a broad set of SMA populations. New data presented from the ENDEAR study demonstrated motor function improvements in infants on permanent ventilation with 61% of SPINRAZA patients demonstrating an improvement of one or more motor milestones versus 27% for those in the sham-control. As measured using CHOP INTEND, 78% of SPINRAZA patients demonstrated an improvement of four or more points versus 9% of those in the sham-control. New data from the NURTURE study in genetically-diagnosed infants with pre-symptomatic SMA continue to demonstrate that the greatest benefit with SPINRAZA occurs among infants who initiate treatment prior to symptom onset. At the time of the interim analysis, most infants achieved motor milestone and growth parameter gains generally consistent with normal development such as head control, independent sitting, standing and walking independently. These results are dramatically different from the known course of SMA infants with Type-1 SMA. New data from the CHERISH study in children with later onset SMA demonstrated improvements in motor milestones among patients who received SPINRAZA compared to a loss among those on sham-control. Specifically, there was a significant and clinically-meaningful difference of 4.9 points in change from baseline to 15 months in mean Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded scores for children treated with SPINRAZA. We also presented additional safety data for SPINRAZA including data demonstrating no increased risk of adverse events in children with scoliosis and overall the data presented reinforced the significant and clinically meaningful efficacy of SPINRAZA on the achievement of motor milestones and measures of motor function across a broad spectrum of SMA and on survival endpoints in infantile onset SMA as well as its favorable benefit risk profile. We are continuing to expand on the clinical development program for SPINRAZA which has quickly become the largest body of data in SMA ever assembled for any interventional approach. Biogen has led the way with over twice the number of patients in our trials as compared to any other program with some patients now on SPINRAZA for over five years. We are continuing to gather data through the SHINE study which we believe will be the longest observational cohort in SMA and we are planning additional studies as part of our long-term strategy in SMA which we will discuss momentarily. We believe this growing body of data solidifies SPINRAZA as the standard of care in SMA and highlights our commitment to SMA patients and families. Moving on to other advances, we are committed to enhancing our pipeline through business development and once again I'm pleased to report substantial progress. As Michel discussed, we continue to see breakthrough potential in acute neurology including stroke. During the quarter, we acquired Remedy Pharmaceuticals' lead asset, a Phase-3 ready novel IV formulation of glibenclamide or BIIB093, being developed for large hemispheric infarction. Large hemispheric infarction is a severe form of ischemic stroke that impacts approximately 15% of the roughly 1.7 million ischemic strokes that occur across the U.S., Europe and Japan each year. The data supporting the potential of BIIB093 are compelling. In preclinical studies, BIIB093 blocks SUR1-TRPM4 channels that mediate stroke-related brain swelling. In Phase 2 clinical studies, we believe there is strong evidence for positive effects on functional outcomes as measured by the modified Rankin Scale, mortality and imaging measures of brain swelling. If confirmed in Phase 3, these benefits would represent a significant advancement over the current standard of care which is largely palliative with no approved pharmacological therapies. BIIB093 has been granted orphan drug designation and fast-track status in the U.S. which we believe should facilitate rapid development. We are currently working with regulators across the globe as we design a registrational program and we plan to initiate a Phase 3 study early next year. We believe this transaction is a great example of matching mechanism with disease pathophysiology and the right patient population to address a significant unmet need. The BIIB093 transaction complements Biogen's broader efforts to build a portfolio of best-in-class treatments for stroke and acute neurology. We're also currently conducting a Phase 2b trial with natalizumab with the aim of improving functional outcomes by limiting brain inflammation in the post-stroke period. We expect data early next year. If successful, we anticipate that natalizumab and BIIB093 will provide new approaches to treating complementary populations of stroke patients. Natalizumab is targeting acute ischemic stroke patients with mild to moderate severity with a therapeutic time window of up to 24 hours after stroke onset whereas BIIB093 is being evaluated for large hemispheric infarction up to 9 to 10 hours after stroke onset. Moving on to other areas in our pipeline, we continue to see exciting potential for BIIB074 in neuropathic pain based on a differentiated mechanism of action and compelling proof-of-concept data. We believe that there is substantial medical and social need for new, effective, non-opioid pain therapeutics. Our Phase 2b study in painful lumbosacral radiculopathy is enrolling with data expected in 2018. And next year we anticipate initiating a Phase 3 program with trigeminal neuralgia, a devastating disease with limited treatment options. Our early-stage pipeline includes novel approaches to tackling some of the most daunting important challenges in neuroscience beyond Alzheimer's disease. For example, in collaboration with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, we are advancing BIIB067, an antisense oligonucleotide therapy targeting a genetic form of ALS associated with mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 or SOD1 gene. This program leverages our unique expertise in intrathecal antisense oligonucleotide as a new transformative modality and highlights our approach of pursuing a genetically validated target in a disease with few treatment options today. We're encouraged by the profile of BIIB054, our anti-alpha-synuclein antibody currently in Phase 1 targeting the core pathology of Parkinson's disease with a goal of slowing disease progression. And we look forward to advancing a set of novel drug candidates into the clinic. Across our pipeline, we now have 2 assets in Phase 3, 10 in Phase 2 and 3 in Phase 1 representing a set of exciting opportunities. We continue to make good progress advancing this portfolio but we recognize that accelerating our long-term growth will require further enhancement to our pipeline. I will now pass the call back to Michel. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Thank you, Mike. Now guidance. We are raising our full year 2017 revenue guidance to a range of $11.5 billion to $11.8 billion. We assume that SPINRAZA continues on a strong trajectory in terms of patients' uptake in the U.S. However, we expect revenue growth will flow as many patients move on from loading dose to maintenance therapy. Outside the U.S. we expect modest SPINRAZA revenues, particularly from Germany and Japan. Our assumptions for MS for the balance of the year remain largely unchanged. We anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense between 18% and 19% of sales. This is an increase from prior guidance reflecting the recent in licensing of BIIB092 from BMS. This guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or large-later stage business development transactions. These are hard to predict but obviously remain a priority. GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 15% to 16% of revenue. We anticipate GAAP EPS results between $17.05 and $17.65. And non-GAAP EPS to be between $20.80 and $21.40. We believe 2017 is turning out to be a very strong and successful year for Biogen. Now, I would like to turn for a strategic update and discuss how we aim to build on this impressive success going forward. Our mission is clear. We aim to be the leader in neuroscience by developing transformational therapies to address what we believe are becoming the world's most significant unmet medical needs. In order to achieve this mission, we plan to maximize our near-term performance while investing for the future across four core growth areas. One, MS and neuroimmunology. Two, Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Three, Parkinson's disease and related-movement disorders. And four, neuromuscular disease including SMA and ALS. Further, we see opportunities to invest in emerging growth areas such as pain, ophthalmology, neuropsychiatry and acute neurology. Through the end of the decade, we expect cash flows to significantly grow driven by continued performance of our commercial assets and the anticipated expiration of the contingent payments related to TECFIDERA in the first half of 2019. This cash flow will enable us to invest in and build an industry-leading neuroscience pipeline that we believe will transform Biogen into the fastest growing large-cap biotech company. This represents a shift in approach from emphasizing share repurchases to prioritizing business development and investing for growth always with a priority towards maximizing shareholder value. We see an inflection point for Biogen in the early 2020s with multiple-high assets, potentially rolling out and launching. We are all looking to Aducanumab as a potentially transformative opportunity for Biogen. We too remain optimistic about what this therapy and our broader Alzheimer's franchise will present for us as a company and mostly for all the patients we serve. Importantly, we aim to demonstrate that we can advance a broader world-class neuroscience pipeline beyond just Alzheimer's disease. In order to deliver positive results in the near term, while investing in the next stage of growth for Biogen, we will focus on the following five strategic priorities. One, maximizing the resilience of our MS core business to drive strong cash flow generation. Two, accelerating our efforts in spinal muscular atrophy to shift towards significant new growth opportunities. Three, developing and expanding our neuroscience portfolio to create the future growth engines of Biogen, Mike will discuss. Four, reprioritizing our capital allocation efforts to drive investment for future growth. And five, creating a leaner and simpler operating model to streamline our operation as we aim to redirect up to $400 million towards high value creation R&D and commercial opportunities. Let me start with our first strategic priority, MS. Biogen is the clear leader with over 340,000 patients benefiting from our therapies today. We are focused on areas where we can improve as we prepare for the marketplace to become increasingly competitive with new entrants and generic products. We are committed to maximizing the resilience of our MS core by evolving our operating model and continuing to invest in MS-focused R&D. Specifically, we are transitioning to a portfolio centric customer first model to better meet the needs of patients, health care providers, payers and all the stakeholders in the value chain. We also aim to further differentiate our leadership in MS through services, solutions and business model innovations. We are committed to improving physician engagement and providing deeper patient support to help patients manage their disease. And we are proud of Biogen's leadership position in fostering value-based contracting. We recognize that price and access to treatments are key consideration for patients, providers, payers and policymakers. We aim to improve quality of care and expand access to our products by shifting from transactional to value-based contracting. As the MS market leader, we are well positioned to benefit the most from progress in diagnosing and managing the disease, including early identification of patients requiring high efficacy. We are working to advance the overall treatment paradigm by promoting the use of MRI, cognitive measures and innovative technology to better diagnose and monitor the disease. For example, we are collaborating with Siemens to develop new MRI tools and hope to expand the utilization of the MS Performance Test, an iPad-based app we developed in collaboration with Cleveland Clinic. We remain committed to investing in R&D for MS to address key unmet needs, including developing opicinumab as a remyelinating therapy, advancing, advancing new DMTs with superior profiles working to address progressive form of MS and researching new approaches for preventing, diagnosing and managing PML. In summary, we are optimizing our commercial operating model investing in new customer solution, demonstrating leadership through innovative contracting approaches and continuing to drive new scientific advancements. We believe this strategy will support a healthy, resilient MS business for Biogen. Next, let's speak about our second strategic priority. SPINRAZA is already off to a very promising start making a real difference to the lives of patients. It continues to exceed expectation in the U.S. and gains approvals in large geographies such as Europe, Japan and Canada. We believe we can accelerate our success to drive near-term growth and position Biogen for long-term leadership in SMA by increasing access to SPINRAZA globally with particular opportunities in Asia-Pacific and Latin America, strengthening SPINRAZA's profile with real-world data in additional subpopulations including teens and adults, accelerating diagnosis and newborn screening through disease awareness and education, reducing treatment burden such as optimizing the dose and exploring additional treatment option such as gene therapy and symptomatic therapies. Overall, we believe SPINRAZA will become one of our largest commercial assets shifting the center of gravity for Biogen beyond MS to generate new growth. Mike will now discuss our R&D strategy for creating new growth engines by developing and expanding our neuroscience portfolio, and I will be back to close on capital and resource allocation. Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: Thanks, Michel. Our strategy is rooted in the fact that the unmet need in neuroscience is massive. With an aging population leading to a significant increase in the number of patients globally that are expected to suffer from nervous system disorders, many of which currently have limited or no treatment options. Biogen has a long history in neurology and has built up substantial core competencies in the area. It is our belief that no other area of medicine holds as much promise with as much need as neuroscience. The opportunity space is vast, and the time is right. With an ongoing revolution in basic neurobiology, human genetics, biomarkers, patient stratification and neuroimaging, an increasing receptivity to new clinical endpoints and regulatory paths, we believe that all signs point to neuroscience as the next oncology. Yet, for most companies, it is either not an area of focus or represents an opportunistic play. Our view is that success in neuroscience requires intense focus and that opportunistic approaches will not maximize value. There is a need for a leader in neuroscience. Our goal is to be that leader. To that end and recognizing that as a therapeutic area in the field of biomedicine, neuroscience is large with many intersecting disciplines. Our strategy is to concentrate on the four core growth areas Michel mentioned : MS and neuroimmunology, Alzheimer's disease and dementias, Parkinson's disease and related-movement disorders, and neuromuscular disease including SMA and ALS. We believe we can accomplish leadership by acting on the following strategic initiatives. First, building a translational machine in neuroscience to increase the probability of success for transitioning from the lab all the way to the market. Second, investing in assets and capabilities in our prioritized growth areas. Third, substantially augmenting our pipeline to emphasize both innovation and risk balance. To the first point, we believe that our translational capabilities are increasingly changing the probabilities of success across neuroscience. We are gaining a better understanding of genetics and mechanisms of action. Disease models are improving. We are developing insights from longitudinal studies of populations, and we continue to invest heavily in biomarkers for disease pathology and progression. For example, we are mining our clinical data in experimental electrophysiological endpoints in ALS, yielding clinical measures with the potential to enable trials that are half the size, twice the speed and a third the cost. In Parkinson's disease, our advanced imaging biomarker investments are allowing patient selection and detection of disease progression that has not previously been possible. Fueling this translational machine, we've identified genetic modifiers and causal pathways that are providing proprietary insight to produce our next generation of drug candidates. Meanwhile, we are already witnessing advances in technology with new modalities that can be unlocked such as antisense oligonucleotides, new delivery routes such as intrathecal and advanced imaging. Furthermore, we have established some of the best scientific base relationships with regulators and are seeing accelerated pathways to approval and openness to new endpoints. For our second strategic initiative, to build the industry's leading neuroscience portfolio we are committed to reinvesting for growth. Our approach to develop and expand our pipeline builds on deep scientific and clinical knowledge. We will invest in the four core growth areas that Michel and I previously described. Within these areas, we see an opportunity to leverage Biogen's capabilities and rebalance pipeline risk by emphasizing rare neurological and neuromuscular disease, including genetic subtypes of more common diseases such as Parkinson's disease, ALS and telepathies (42:03). We also see further opportunity in the emerging growth areas Michel mentioned : pain, ophthalmology, neuropsychiatry and acute neurology. Where we are able to leverage commonalities and synergies in biological mechanism, disease pathophysiology and clinical populations. We will use multiple treatment platforms in an agnostic manner; small molecules, biologics, antisense oligonucleotides, intrathecal administration and gene therapy, taking advantage whenever possible of our unique capabilities such as in biologics and intrathecal antisense oligonucleotides. To the third point, we recognize that we have a highly innovative pipeline, and as a consequence it may seem risky and heavily-weighted towards just a few indications. Our strategy includes pursuing areas where real innovation is required and where success means pioneering new approaches and opening new areas of medicine, much like we have done with SPINRAZA in SMA. At the same time, our strategy includes taking a thoughtful and conscious approach to rebalancing risk in our portfolio. This means, one, continuing our scientific leadership across our core franchises of MS and SMA. This includes development of DMTs with superior profiles, as well as pursuing next-generation therapeutics in remyelination, muscle enhancement and gene therapy that leverages our substantial strengths. Two. Increasing our emphasis on rare and orphan diseases and particularly rare neurological and neuromuscular disease where the probability of success is higher and speed to approval is faster. Our pursuit of BIIB092, the anti-tau monoclonal antibody in progressive supranuclear palsy provides an initial example of this approach. Three. Broadening our lens of opportunity in the pipeline across neuroscience, including the emerging growth areas of pain, ophthalmology, neuropsychiatry and acute neurology. Four, pursuing patient-centric franchises. Here what I mean is developing a portfolio that addresses multiple features of a given disease. So in addition to disease-modifying therapies, we will search for additional symptomatic solutions and therapeutic improvements in our core areas. And five, acquiring late-stage assets where possible. Although our emphasis and asymmetric capability to extract value rests in identifying early-stage clinical assets, we intend to stay vigilant and proactive in evaluating later-stage opportunities. As we develop and expand the Biogen portfolio, we're also working to increase overall productivity at every stage, and we will implement a more robust external pipeline strategy that includes asset acquisitions, development partnerships for resource flexibility and early innovation partnerships. It is important to note that we believe the future growth we can generate from our neuroscience portfolio is not solely contingent on aducanumab but rather complemented by it. As we rebalance the portfolio, we plan to expand and enhance our opportunity set to diversify beyond aducanumab as the predominant value driver for the future of Biogen. While we continue to see tremendous opportunity for our Alzheimer's disease franchise, we believe we can achieve our aspiration of becoming the fastest-growing large cap biotech even without aducanumab. In order to create new growth drivers for Biogen, we aim to bring in and advance several assets through development over the next few years. Our aspiration is to grow our late-stage pipeline from two assets in Phase 3 today to substantially more in Phase 3 or filing-ready by the end of 2021. In summary, we remain focused on neuroscience but are widening our lens of potential opportunities. Our strategy takes a multipronged approach to both expand and derisk our pipeline including an increased emphasis on business development and diversification across both disease area and therapeutic approach. And to achieve all of this, we are working to enhance our internal R&D capabilities to increase both productivity and the probability of success. With a clear strategy in place, we are laser-focused on execution and delivering the portfolio. I'll now turn the call back to Michel. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Thank you, Mike. Turning to capital allocation, as we move forward our new priority for capital deployment is to invest in building our pipeline across our core growth areas and emerging growth areas. We will explore deals of all sizes, and we remain disciplined in our approach. We look to deploy capital to generate returns meaningfully above our cost of capital. We view investment in growth as our top priority, but we also recognize the value of opportunistically returning excess capital to shareholders through share repurchases. Our final strategic priority is to implement a plan for a lean and simple operating model which we believe can unlock resources that can be reallocated to help fund our prioritized investment for growth. We expect that by 2019 up to $400 million annually will be available to redirect towards prioritize R&D and commercial value creation opportunities. Before I conclude, let me discuss our biosimilars business. We are excited about the potential value of both our commercial assets in Europe and our option to increase our investment in our JV, Samsung Bioepis. Biosimilars are an important contributor to our growth while not being at the core of our neuroscience focus. Our plan is to use any positive cash flow from our commercial operation and the JV to reinvest in our core growth strategy. Now let me summarize our strategy to deliver in the short term while investing for medium- and long-term value creation. We are focused and committed to maximizing the resilience of our MS core business. We expect SMA to generate significant growth, accelerated by geographic diversification. We believe our core business is capable of generating significantly increased cash flow to invest for growth. We aim to expand and develop our neuroscience portfolio across our core growth areas and emerging growth areas. We believe we can build our pipeline while at the same time rebalancing the risk profile of our portfolio. Our capital allocation is focused on enhancing our pipeline for future growth, and we aim to free up to $400 million a year in resources that we can reinvest. Lastly, there is an overarching theme that I believe will be key to implementing our strategy. We are building a new management team with diverse global expertise and execution mind-set and our actions will continue to speak for themselves. So far this year, we've continued to grow our MS business. We delivered a strong start to our SPINRAZA launch. We added two high-value assets to our pipeline. We passed 50% enrollment for aducanumab. We executed four value-based MS contracts here in the U.S. and we increased our biosimilars revenue in Europe. We intend to continue this momentum. In closing, I would like to thank our employees around the world who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patients' lives and all of the physicians, caregivers and participants in our clinical development programs, the past and future achievements could not be realized without their passion and commitment. I am excited about our path forward on this promising journey. With our team and all of you, there is a need for a leader in neuroscience. Our goal is to be that leader. With that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham, Barclays. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question and all the strategic detail. And I'll keep it just to one question. So you touched on this but, Michel and Michael, I wanted to ask you about the clinical risk here when you look at the biz dev. I think most investors acknowledge the high-impact nature of the pipeline but the risk profile and probability of success in Alzheimer's and stroke in particular I think is the main uncertainty. So when you think about external biz dev, how much of an emphasis is there on clinical risk over things like diversification and impact? And when you look to say the orphan space, do you think more broadly SPINRAZA will provide a template for a bigger franchise in the rare disease space? Thanks a lot. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: So before I give the floor to Mike, this is Michel. So we want to have a strategy that is a bit more hedged. There are different combination of factors in the different vertical that you heard in neuroscience that were communicated by Mike, including clinical development risks, time line, P&L risk, capital allocation, regulatory or payer. But now coming back precisely to your question, Mike will give you more details. Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: Yes. Geoff, I think this is a great question and the nature of it highlights exactly what we're trying to do. We are looking very closely at clinical risk. We're looking to diversify that a bit. We think that SPINRAZA does provide an excellent template of what we can do in rare and orphan disease. When we look at this as development, we're going to look at very closely at this area in rare and orphan. We also want to make some of this risk a little bit less codependent which is areas that may not \u2013 where the risk isn't the same across different clinical populations so we're looking at that. And then I mentioned a little bit about trying to pursue patient-centered franchises which is kind of addressing things across patient areas where we've got known expertise. Whether that's symptomatics and Alzheimer's disease, whether it's muscle enhancement and SMA, those are the kind of things we're going to look to diversify and mitigate clinical risk in the portfolio. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC: Congrats on a great start to the year. I was hoping, Michel, could just talk a little bit more about capital allocation. It sounds like the shift from share repurchases to one of biz dev priorities is emphasizing maybe more growth over value. Can you talk about why you perhaps no longer view your stock as a good investment? Or also whether the dividend or any discussion of a dividend is off the table for the foreseeable future? Thank you. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Thanks for the good question, Eric. So as alluded, the third strategic priority is to develop and expand our neuroscience portfolio. We believe that this is a future growth engines for the company. But you know, we will obviously do that with the objective to maximize shareholder returns. We will absolutely deploy this capital where the internal rate of return will exceed our weighted average cost of capital and we will look all the time at R&D, commercial acquisitions as well as returning capital to shareholders, okay? So we don't exclude returning capital to shareholders. We will evaluate that while we see the opportunities. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Michel, so on the call today you mentioned a possible potential inflection point in the early 2020s. And you also talked about resilience in the MS base business and the growth in SPINRAZA. So my question is this, do you think you can grow top-line through that possible inflection early 2020s even if you excluded the contribution from biosimilars? Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: So you know, the facts and the way we did outline the strategy fully speaks for itself in terms of ability for Biogen to implement well on the opportunities we have to continue to drive MS and to accelerate the efforts in SMA. And we believe there are significant opportunities as explained. And if we continue implementing well, MS is a growing market. There are half of the patients being treated than actual prevalence in the U.S. So we decided not to give long-term forward guidance on these measures that you ask, but we are confident in our ability to continue to implement well and deliver on the expected performance. And, yes, it is true that at the same time there is an articulation whereby we have the readouts of very important studies. But we'll not wait for that. As we said all along, we will continue to develop and expand our portfolio, and therefore there will be some capital allocation prioritization efforts, including potentially some BD. So this is what we are working towards. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks very much. Mike, a lot of people have been asking about the interim look on the aducanumab trials. You amended the protocol, as you described, for the APoE4 carriers. Could you talk about the advisability and likelihood of an interim look? And whether that's something that would be disclosed to you or to us at the time? Thanks. Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: Yes, Geoff. Thanks for the question and interest. We just don't comment about interim analysis, so I really have no more to say on that one. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. Michel, you mentioned that the global MS patients increased 4% versus last year. So do you think that's a long-term market trend? And also what do you think OCREVUS would do? Because if I do my math, it seems that the drop in TYSABRI revenue in the U.S. this quarter is way less than what we saw from the increase in the OCREVUS launch. So does that mean actually OCREVUS would at least in the near term expand the MS market? I was wondering if you can talk about that. Thank you. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Yes. This is what I anticipate. Your competitor is your best friend, mostly when you get 24% royalties in the largest market. So we have seen in the U.S. a contraction in 2016 of the market. And we assume that the market will resume back to low-single-digit growth in the U.S. and high-single-digit growth in Europe geographies. So I anticipate that with the PPMS label and all the patients from the sidelines, there is logically an opportunity to see the market regain some momentum. And concerning TYSABRI, you know it's 10 years of post-marketing experience with a very well documented beneficiaries proposition for the providers and for the patients that had the time to experience the efficacy of this product. I was in USC last week, and I was reminded by all the physicians on the perceived unsurpassed efficacy on this product. So it speaks for itself, and I believe that TYSABRI will continue to do well, but we have seen some erosion and so be it for high titer JCV that will switch to OCREVUS. But let's keep in mind that when they switch from TYSABRI to OCREVUS, it's not an easy switch. What I hear and as anticipated is that some of the patients see a rebound in the disease symptomatology, and they do communicate that to the providers. So this is clearly an element that we see. So I hope I did answer with a few measures \u2013 the dynamic, your question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Aharon Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I would like to turn to SPINRAZA for a second. Now that you kind of know a little bit more about the market dynamics in the United States, patients with spinal fusion and so forth, can you give us a feel for the applicable market size for SPINRAZA as you see it today? And as long we're following that, you've not really mentioned time lines for bringing your own gene therapy to the marketplace. Can you describe that time line? And how you would compete with potential gene therapy between the current state and when you have your own program coming to market? Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Yes. So I will take the first part, and then I will let Mike on the gene therapy comment. So, when I travel in the different geographies and I get to meet scientific leaders and I talk to advocacy groups, it appears that the epidemiology and the prevalence might be slightly higher than what we anticipated. This is what I hear from different geographies. So we are very pleased with the launch progress, and we see infrastructure and patient access improving. The patients pools and demand is certainly a very good support to this momentum, and importantly, we are making some good progress with the late onset. And keep in mind that the later onset represents 80% of the prevalence. So we are now with regulatory approval beyond the U.S. unlocking new patient pools broadly, and the testimony from the patient is critical. And this is a community that basically communicates extremely well. Patients and family are very well informed, motivated and they demand treatment. So what we've said in the call is that we believe that SPINRAZA will become one of our most important commercial assets. Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: So, Ronny, I'll try to answer the question about gene therapy. So, first, we're very excited about our Penn collaboration. Obviously we stay closely aware of clinical results as they're being presented in the field by AveXis, an example. We think we're making good progress. We believe that we will be able to get to the clinic next year. We see a path forward. We're making a considerable investment in our development capabilities, our regulatory strategy, all the analytics and manufacturing technologies that go around this, and we're quite committed to solutions including gene therapy solutions for all SMA patients. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: So just an additional comment, but I would like to give the floor first to Paul McKenzie, our Head of Manufacturing, will say a few words. Paul McKenzie - Biogen, Inc.: Right. Thanks for the question. Great to hear your voice. Looking forward to the challenges of gene therapy. As we know, across the industry many companies are wrestling, like us, with gene therapy, its scalability, it's analytical challenges and our regulatory path forward. We've been investing specifically in growing our development engine in collaboration with our early partners like Penn where we're co-locating resources between the two companies, learning from each other actively. We believe that we can build a development engine that will drive success across our portfolio of gene therapy entities. And as we've announced at the end of last year, we went into a strategic agreement with Brammer Bio for manufacturing capabilities so we could co-develop and leverage a manufacturing platform across our entire portfolio. So we're excited about our possibilities in gene therapy. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Thank you, Paul. Al Sandrock would like to make a comment. Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr., M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: Hi, Ronny. On the question about prevalence, the most common type of SMA based on incidence is Type 1, and we know we affect survival in Type 1 patients. So the prevalence has to go up overall for SMA, if that's true. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a great quarter. So, just a follow-up, Al, with that comment. So the point about the percentage of people who can't get treated, is that a new data point? Did you know that a certain percentage of patients could not get the intrathecal injection? And did you say it's about only 40% that might be eligible? So is the number, the original number as a prevalence that you put out there, would that go down because a lot of those patients can't be treated? And just a quick question on the EAP patients. Are those patients that would be paying patients going forward, or have they gotten their drug already? Would they be getting drug in the future? Thanks. Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr., M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: Yes. The plan on EAP is to eventually \u2013 it was meant to bridge between getting the results, the positive results, and getting approval and reimbursement in those countries. So it's meant to be that bridge, and eventually we anticipate the EAP patients will be on the drug in the commercial setting. And in terms of people who can't get the drug, the types of people who can't get the drug were people who had spinal surgery, for example, spinal fusions, are having trouble medically to get the drug. And a lot of those are Type 2 patients, childhood onset patients. And so we're working through how to \u2013 we're working with orthopedic and neurosurgeons on trying to figure out how to get drug to those patients who deserve to be treated because they're childhood onset, and we have data that shows that childhood onset SMA responds well to SPINRAZA. And in terms of others who can't get it, I think you might be referring to those who get reimbursed. And we're working through that. We don't have a lot of data in adult onset patients so consequently, there are some questions from payers. But we're going to be addressing those questions. And remember, we have a broad label in the U.S. Many of those patients are getting treated, and we'll see if we can see efficacy in those patients as they get treated per the U.S. label. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: So, this is Michel. The uptake so far was strong, and we just want to send a word of caution here because, yes, effectively 80% or 60% of the Type 2 population basically had or has spinal surgery and eventually, just let's put ourselves in the shoes of Type 2 patients, either patients who had the fusion surgery and is aware now of the ability of a product like SPINRAZA and how motivated and also frustrated. And therefore, together with the medical community, they try to find solutions. Let me give you an example of one center close to where we stand here, the Boston Children's Hospitals. They have an strategy plan in place. They have an internal team that is well assigned to SMA. They have processes in place to manage through all the logistics. They are battling with the payers in order to secure access and reimbursement. And they are working now on the solutions so that they can appropriately dose the more complicated patients. It starts with the right leadership, the right commitment, and providers here are our allies in order to find solutions for those patients. But, again, we just want to say, we won't be able to penetrate as strong as one would wish in this population because of this challenge. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So, Michel, you clearly outlined a lot of flexibility in what you could do from both the pipeline and the revenue side, and I think you struck a tone of confidence here on the business, but you also decided not to give any kind of long-term metrics. Can you just comment on why you didn't give any long-term metrics at this point? And if there is a time, or what needs to change for you to feel comfortable to give some long-term metrics? Thanks. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: So, listen. I think that the process that together with the executive team, we worked on during the past six months has been a very rich and fascinating journey to try to define what will be the next step for Biogen. I am in charge since six months, and I think that already what we communicate here is pretty solid, and should give you an indication on how we see Biogen evolve. And we decided that for the time being this is good. Obviously, we have our plans, we have our commitments and we're going to execute on those. But here you have a clear view on the strategy, meaning what we consciously decide to do and not to do and this is what we communicated today. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on starting off the biotech tape with a good quarter. I guess just going to SMA again, kind of in the point of the center for people who were early adopters, do you see people going back to use the drug? And also like what's been the general feedback as far as educating and getting people comfortable with intrathecal injections? Thanks. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: So what we see is a learning curve. Remember, those centers did not perform in intrathecally \u2013 intrathecal injections and mostly injections and very often for infants. And what we see is capability being built around this pool of patients pressed by the patients, tremendously pressed by the patients and the advocacy group. And what we see is a learning curve and when they dedicate personnel infrastructure, we expect depth to increase over time in those key centers. Remember at the outset, what we always said with a lot of caution since day one, and we continue to be very cautious about the ramp up is that there are approximately 30 key SMA centers and 150 neuromuscular centers. And you see that where we stand today, we have 145 centers dosing the product. We've made substantial progress, and now it's a matter of having those centers performing more and more so that the patients can benefit. Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr., M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: Pediatric neurologists generally \u2013 I mean they're comfortable putting a needle in the intrathecal space, but usually to withdraw fluid for diagnostic purposes. So I think early on many centers were asking anesthesiologists and interventional radiologists who are more used (01:11:23) but I suspect that as time goes on, as Michel was saying, with the learning curve, that people will start to get comfortable injecting because usually the hard part is to find the intrathecal space (01:11:35) drawing versus adding fluid, there's not that much of a technical difference. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Thank you, Al. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Michel, when you referred to a leaner and simpler operating model, I'm just wondering if that just assumes a redirection of some SG&A spend to R&D or does that also contemplate any potential SG&A cuts that could impact your margins positively? Thanks. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Thank you for the question. Listen, the world and technology are evolving very fast and the question is pharma companies evolving at the same pace or faster pace, and how is Biogen in that space? Where do we stand versus pharma benchmarks and beyond pharma benchmarks? And, yes, we have done a lot of cost measure in the past, but when you peel the onion and look at the reality of the key processes, the ability for cost moves to the key geographies and patients, the key processes on manufacturing, R&D, using channels and benefiting from technology or procurement, there are plenty of opportunities to be leaner and more simple and to be the biotech that we stand for. The one that everybody wants to copy. This is why looking at the opportunity here across all divisions and functions we stated this opportunity of $400 million run rate as per 2019 that we are going in order to be logical with our strategy that we are going to reinvest in value creation opportunities that will benefit the shareholders. But I would like Paul to say a few words as head of manufacturing, how he sees the lean and simple. Paul McKenzie - Biogen, Inc.: Great, thanks, Michel. Thanks, Terence for the question. Now, to Michel's point, we really believe that if we can take \u2013 stand back, we have a great track record of developing and delivering high-quality products to the market. But when we look at our fundamental processes there's always opportunity to improve. There's areas like end-to-end planning in terms of how much time we take from start, raw material to patient. How can we improve our overall cycle times? How can we reduce variability to be successful? Reliability is a key focus of our manufacturing teams. How can we ensure that we're reliable day in and day out and really manage to make reliability a key strategic deliverable moving forward. We believe in resource allocation and the use of resources to drive higher use of technology, whether it's algorithmic planning for inventory, or whether it's process control. And the last one I want to highlight is really our zest to deliver industry platforms for all of our technology areas. Just want to highlight our next-generation manufacturing platform that creates an ecosystem from our interface to R&D out to our day-to-day distribution. But next-generation manufacturing we hope and we believe we can deliver consistently titers in monoclonal antibody space, be it above 10 grams per liter, which we will be the first in the industry we believe to deliver that level of titer. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Thank you, Paul. So basically it's all about fitness for the organization, and how can we enhance the level of speed and decision-making, proximity, agility. In the P&L, you can expect to see neutral impact on the contribution in bottom-line, but a potential shift from SG&A to R&D. And last but not least, I would like to say that based on this fitness, we want to stimulate growth momentum, but the cost discipline at Biogen actually will enhance, because we want to be very, very rigorous on how the money is being spent. It's not about focusing the efforts on head count reduction. It's all about fitness and processes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. A question for Al and Michael. You talked about the timing for gene therapy next year for SMA. Can you talk a little bit more about some of your confidence in terms of differentiating? Is that going right into the Type 2 patients? Is the improved capsage (01:16:20)? Does it improved manufacturing, given the COGS for these types of patients? Maybe talk a little bit about the challenges and where you see differentiation capabilities? Thanks. Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: Michael, this is Mike. I'll kind of start. Look, at one level we haven't really disclosed our overall strategy in this area. So I can't go into some of this. But, as I mentioned Paul elaborated on, we have put a considerable investment into our development capabilities, our analytical and manufacturing capabilities. And we do see this across the gene therapy space as being a critical point of differentiation. I mentioned that we're committed to solutions for all SMA patients, and I think that's also going to be an important component of potential differentiation in our development strategy. And I would also highlight that because SPINRAZA has become the standard of care and is approved quite broadly in SMA, we need to think very carefully about how different therapies will be used in combination and in sequence across different SMA populations. So that in a nutshell is sort of highlighting the broad categories of things where we think that we can differentiate. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions. So, when you talk about building through business development, I'm just curious how much financial flexibility or buying power you believe you have with your current balance sheet, assuming you're taking \u2013 you're not doing as much in terms of share buybacks and stuff and focusing on BD? Thanks. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: So, we have an EBITDA that is in approximation of $6 billion, if you take 2016. And we anticipate that the maximum yield would likely be in the approximation of $10 billion to $12 billion, which is two times the EBITDA on a net debt basis. This is where we stand basically. But again, the driver will be value for the shareholders, and we'll be very disciplined in the way we spend our money, the shareholders' money actually. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jim Birchenough - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for the detail on the call. Congrats on the results. Just on SPINRAZA, trying to get a better sense of the trajectory coming out of the second quarter. And there's some moving parts here. So I'm wondering if you can help us on what's the distribution right now between Type 1, 2 and 3 in patients treated. And when you think about the prevalence that's out there, when you eliminate the 60% who have spinal fusions, how many Type 2 patients are left to treat? Thanks. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Thanks for the question. This is Michel. So basically the current status is approximately two-third of the patients treated in the U.S. geography represents Type 2 and Type 3 populations. And this is also the highest prevalent population today, okay? As Al said, over time the early onset will grow based on expected improved survival. So 60% we did not anticipate that a few months ago. So it shows that those patients are highly motivated and now we face the challenge of the more complicated patients for which the entire system is trying to overcome to secure that they can also improve on their disability. So it's actually very difficult for me where I stand to state what will be the expected penetration of the late onset patients at this stage. Basically, the next few months will be very rich because they will inform us on the ability for the system to overcome those challenges. The Biogen team is, as you can tell, fully committed and engaged. They have done a spectacular work. They have not a sense of the strategy. They have the sense of the purpose and this is stronger than anything I have seen so far in my professional life. So to answer clearly your question, a few months and we'll be a bit more educated. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Salim Syed with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Hey. Congrats, guys, and thanks for all the color. Michel, I had a question on biosimilar since you've brought it up a couple times. It seems like you guys are excited about the business. So what are the pushes and pulls that are going into you actually exercising the option because I believe that expires next year if I'm not mistaken? Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: I think exercising the option makes sense. This is my position, okay. And this will give us a lot of optionality on what we do with this stake in a successful JV. As you can see, there is the launch of infliximab in the U.S. being announced today. So there are lot of good prospects for this JV that is engaged in also building a strong pipeline. And we're looking at that very closely so that we can see how we can eventually enrich our commercial footprint. We are very pleased with the success of this team, very focused, very nimble without basically losing the focus on MS as a priority and adding tremendous momentum to the top line but also profitable since Q3 last year. So these are all positives and I will just cap it by saying that from a value proposition vis-\u00e0-vis the public payers in Europe, this is a tremendous add when we engage with payers because we come with new product launches and innovation and at the same time with significant savings opportunity mostly when you consider then the relevant market for the anti-TNF is approximately \u20ac9 billion in Europe. So we currently intend to opt in for the JV option and as you know, the option expires in 2018. But we don't lose our focus strategically and I will bring you back to what we said earlier in the call, the vision is to be the leader in neuroscience. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Peters with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and let me add my congrats as well. Just wanted to understand the $400 million comment a bit more. It seems like you're shifting SG&A to R&D and specifically to external opportunities. So just wanted to get your sense on how you think about taking on additional clinical risk when it could be less likely that any external programs that you may pursue likely haven't done the same degree of translational work that you outlined earlier on the call. So how do you think about kind of your biomarker-type driven approach to risk as it relates to external opportunities? Thanks. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Thank you for a great question. So where do we stand? We did initiate the lean and simple a few months back when I took up the job. We are still looking at the opportunities. We have a long list of opportunities so this is to be more fit than what we are today. And we will need now, together with the executive team to prioritize what we do first. And as I communicated earlier, we believe we aspire to have a $400 million run rate in 2018. Well, we are mid-2017 so we still have some time in order to put that in place. Not much. We are starting implementing this year, but I don't have granularity today on the respective impact on each line of the P&L, but certainly we will see key geographies commercially and R&D benefit in order to add to the momentum in the short midterm and the long term, and Mike will add some comments. Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: Yeah. Andrew, so just to address the question on clinical risk and biomarkers that you raised. Look, this is why our primary focus is on things with an early clinical development, the early clinical space. Not exclusively, but that's really the primary, so we're focusing on that. And look, I think that in the areas where we work, we often see opportunities where others might not. We often can develop capabilities and development that others don't have in that space. And that's why we think we do just have asymmetric ability, the more we are in the early clinical space. Of course we're going to look beyond that, though, which there might be later programs, there might be earlier programs. A key element of this reinvestment though for that is the time element, so we're very conscious of the fact that to get to the growth that we're looking in the portfolio where our core skill set is in early clinical development means we need to be acting now to really be able to identify those opportunities and bring them in. I'll turn it to Al for some comments. Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr., M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: On the question about risk in neurology investment. I think the strategy that was outlined by Michel and Mike makes a lot of sense and it leverages not only our capabilities in terms of understanding of disease, but also platforms like the intrathecal ASO. So just as an example, we just take the movement disorder bucket, there are a lot of rare and orphan diseases. For example, the spinal cerebellar ataxias that are amenable we think to intrathecal ASO. They are genetically well-defined and the pathway could be very similar to the SPINRAZA pathway. In the neuromuscular disorders, there's a ton of diseases that are rare and orphan diseases. Again, and many of those are due to spinal cord pathology which we know now is amenable to intrathecal ASO. So I think within those key strategic core areas that Mike talked about, there's a lot of opportunity and even for large diseases such as ALS or Parkinson's, you can divide them into genetically well-defined subsets and take the very same approach. And I think using the ASO technology, we know that the antisense gets to large parts of the central nervous system, not just the spinal cord. We have data from nonhuman primates and from other places where we know that the ASOs can get all the way up into the brain into the cerebral cortex, so that opens up a whole array of opportunities. So yes, there's risk in neurology and I think it's important to think about that risk and to manage it, but I think there's also great opportunity, particularly when leveraging something like intrathecal ASOs. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Thank you, Al. Mike. Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: Yeah, I'll just pick up on that a little bit more, Andrew, because I think you've sparked a lot of interest in commentary there. One thing that I've been very impressed by being here at Biogen is the fact, if you look at Biogen's historical probability of success from FIH to proof of concept in this space, it's roughly four times higher than that of industry benchmarks. So we have a demonstrated ability to actually change the probability of success equation in that space. And Al cited beautiful examples on this. We've seen this before. It was the PRIME study with aducanumab actually imaging patients and stratifying accordingly. It's in the design capabilities, the smart type of design to have titration as part of the PRIME study to be able to inform how we conduct our Phase 3 trials and then responding and executing appropriately. Endpoint development, whether it was in the SPINRAZA program, it made a lot of difference. Or even as we've been envisioning the plans for the opicinumab program. These are the development of novel endpoints that are based on the fact that we have got differentiated expertise in the area. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Thank you, Mike. Before we take the last question, I would like to refer to a press release issued yesterday. We have announced Alisha Alaimo that will be joining Biogen at some point of time soon. And we are very excited about this new hire, superb talent with great leadership. We did not yet finalize a date \u2013 the starting date, but we are working on that. And here in the room we have Jean-Paul Kress, who is leading the international market and I would like just to extend a welcome. Maybe, do you want to say a few words, Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul Kress - Biogen, Inc.: Yes. Thanks, Michel, and good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to say how much I'm excited to join Biogen. I come from another company very much involved in MS as well. But I have to say that I've always been very impressed by Biogen's great rack record and leadership in MS and neurosciences. So it's a great pleasure and a great privilege to join the company at this time of renewed ambition. Obviously too early for me to comment and we're still in early days and started like five weeks ago, currently assessing the business, getting a hand on our global commercial organization with a strong focus on strengthening our execution capabilities and reinforcing our MS leadership and launching SPINRAZA globally. So, very much looking forward to interacting with you in the future and provide you with an update on our commercial project. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Thank you, Jean-Paul. We are relying on execution. So we have a last question. Operator : Our final question comes from Brian Skorney with Robert Baird. Please go ahead. Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for squeezing me in. I guess I was just wondering if you could give us some more details on the value-based contracts that you mentioned in MS, particularly, how much of the market these contracts currently represent and some idea of how the value winds up determining the price that you're getting revenue off of? Thanks. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question. We're extremely pleased that the team was able to foster value-based contract. I said earlier and I was challenged actually by saying but tell me how and it was not easy. The U.S. team has done a spectacular work. We spent time brainstorming on how we could bring the value of an entire portfolio to the customers and to the patient benefit and be in a position to shift the position that where the industry is perceived as being part of a transaction on a cost per product versus satisfaction, versus outcome, versus value, versus being part of the solution. And the team has worked very hard and I did believe into that. I did put that in the scorecard of the organization because I believe that this is what the society deserves and this goes beyond financial measures. It's a matter of providing the value that what we stand for since the outset of the discovery and the clinical development and translating that into the way we operate. So we were able to foster four of them and two types, one that basically gives the company responsibility for some of the discontinuation but the provider and the customer opens immediately to another dynamic in terms of engaging with a partner. And the other one on \u2013 the other one is on \u2013 I forgot, can you remind me the word? Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: The regional payers and so we've got payer and also Medicaid system. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Yeah. One is on discontinuation and one is on relapse of MS. So I apologize, so relapse of MS and therefore for the entire portfolio at the end of the period we see the relapse of MS and then there is basically a higher discounts being provided in case. So these are regional customers. These are pilots. It's for us to try to learn and to measure the impact, bring real world evidence and measure how we move forward from there. It's not a financial objective at the outset, it is just changing the paradigm and being the leader and being more responsible. This is what the industry deserves. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you to everyone for attending today. This will conclude today's conference call, and you may now disconnect.",

Now, I will turn the call over to Michel. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. For the third quarter of 2017, Biogen generated revenues of $3.1 billion. On an apples-to-apples basis, excluding hemophilia, revenues grew 13% from the same period a year ago. Revenues grew 4% when we include hemophilia revenues in the prior period. We enjoyed record earnings this quarter, with GAAP net income of $1.2 billion and non-GAAP net income of $1.3 billion. Our GAAP EPS was $5.79 and non-GAAP EPS was $6.31, both at a record level. In July, we communicated our strategy to become the leader in neuroscience by developing transformational therapies to address what we believe are becoming the world's most significant unmet medical needs. In pursuit of becoming this leader, we are focusing our R&D efforts mostly on four core growth areas. We also highlighted five priorities. The execution of those is important to successfully implement our strategy. This strategy requires us first to fortify our core business while also ensuring that we create new sources of value. Today, we are sharing exciting developments with each priority in turn. Overall, we are making encouraging progress on our core, meaning maximizing the resilience of our MS business, accelerating performance in SMA [Spinal Muscular Atrophy], and creating a leaner and simpler operating model. All are important for generating significant cash flow. We are putting this cash flow to work in the form of the final two priorities, reprioritizing capital allocation efforts and developing and expanding our neuroscience portfolio. We believe we have the ability to be the leader in neuroscience, and we are committed to building out our pipeline through both our internal R&D efforts and prudent but high-impact business development and strategy collaborations. We believe this strategy will maximize long-term shareholder returns. With that context, I am very pleased to discuss our Q3 performance. First, in the third quarter, our MS core business held up to our expectations. We continued the strong launch momentum on SPINRAZA, as we have meaningfully grown the number of patients treated in the U.S. and globally. We made progress advancing our neuroscience pipeline. We improved our collaboration arrangements with Eisai and Neurimmune, and we made progress streamlining our operations as we evolve towards a leaner and simpler operating model. We are eager to build on this momentum as we close 2017 and progress into 2018 and beyond. Let me start with our first strategic priority, maximizing the resilience of our MS core business. Our MS business is expected to be the driver of near and midterm performance for Biogen and a significant source of cash generation. MS revenues, including $65 million of OCREVUS royalties, were $2.3 billion, close to the all-time high we had in Q2. We continued to add patients globally, with a 3% increase versus the prior year and a relatively stable patient count versus Q2. This core franchise helped drive $1.1 billion in free cash flow this quarter, which is key to fueling our investment for future growth. We have also improved our overall position on U.S. formularies for 2018. We are very pleased with this progress. We have seen a trend of five major national plans that have recently embraced an open access strategy. And just last month, Aetna placed TECFIDERA, AVONEX, and PLEGRIDY on their preferred list. I give a lot of credit to our team in the U.S. They have really executed on building trust and demonstrating the value of our portfolio to payers. Now the performance of our core MS products, TECFIDERA maintained its global market share and remains the leading MS therapy \u2013 overall MS therapy. Global revenues were a strong $1.1 billion this quarter, a 3% increase versus the prior year, as we saw 9% increase in total TECFIDERA patients over the same period. U.S. TECFIDERA revenues declined 4% to $836 million in the third quarter compared to a record high in Q2, primarily due to a slight decline in patient demand. As a reminder, in Q3 2016, TECFIDERA benefited by approximately $40 million to $50 million due to an inventory build, which impacts the year-over-year comparison. In Q3, inventory levels for TECFIDERA were flat relative to Q2. In Europe, TECFIDERA patients grew approximately 16% year over year and 4% quarter over quarter, while in Japan, TECFIDERA has rapidly grown to over 10% market share. TYSABRI remains the leading high-efficacy MS therapy, with global revenues of $469 million. U.S. TYSABRI revenues were $267 million, an 8% decline from the prior quarter and an 11% decline year over year. We have seen an uptick in discontinuation, particularly amongst JCV-positive patients, as OCREVUS continues its launch in the U.S. Outside of the U.S., TYSABRI revenues were $203 million. In Europe, TYSABRI patients grew by 2% versus last quarter, as it benefited from updated label, providing improved clarity on the re-stratification and patient management. While our MS business has shown some signs of resilience, we are not stopping here. We are continuing to evolve our operating model in MS, including the recent rollout of a new regional structure in the U.S., which we believe will increase accountability and bring us closer to the customer. Next, I would like to talk about our second strategic priority, accelerating SMA. We see SPINRAZA as a key current and future growth driver for Biogen. We are very pleased with the growth being delivered by the global launch of SPINRAZA, as we generated $271 million in revenues in the third quarter, including $198 million in the U.S. We saw a 75% increase in the number of patients on therapy in the U.S. as compared to the end of Q2. As a reminder, Q2 revenues in the U.S. included approximately $30 million of inventory build, while inventory levels remained flat in Q3. Approximately 10% of U.S. SPINRAZA revenues in the third quarter were attributed to maintenance dose, as a large number of patients who completed the four-dose loading regimen in prior quarters did not receive a dose in Q3 due to the once every four months maintenance dosing. Additionally, over 65% of patients currently on therapy are Type 2s and Type 3s, and a growing 20% are over the age of 15 years old, suggesting that the most serious patients are treated first, and also significant opportunity remains in the other patient population. Infrastructure in the U.S. continued to improve. As of the end of the third quarter, over 180 sites have administered SPINRAZA, an increase from 145 sites last quarter. And we now have over 250 sites that have submitted start forms. Importantly, we have received hundreds of start forms from patients that are not yet on therapy, a great indicator for demand. We are diligently trying to help these patients start on SPINRAZA while also working to reach the thousands of older SMA patients who are either not aware of SPINRAZA or have not yet indicated an intent to start treatment. To help reach this broader population, we are expanding the size of our U.S. SMA team. Outside the U.S., SPINRAZA revenues were $73 million in Q3. Revenues and volume from ex-U.S. launch this quarter surpassed what we saw in Q1 of the U.S. launch. We have now launched in 11 European countries as well as in Japan, and we recorded revenues from named patient sales from multiple countries across the Middle East and Latin America. So far, we have submitted 20 pricing and reimbursement dossiers in Europe. This quarter, SPINRAZA was approved in Brazil and Switzerland, and we filed in Argentina. Over time, we aim to make this therapy widely available across the globe. For our strategic priority to create a leaner and simpler operating model, we intend to streamline our operations and relocate resources, with a goal of redirecting up to $400 million by the end of 2020 to be reinvested in prioritized research and development and commercial value-creation opportunities. To achieve this, we expect to make total expenditures of up to $170 million, primarily in 2018, through a restructuring program across a number of strategic operational and organizational initiatives. Moving to our biosimilar business, revenues grew 12% to $101 million, and the European Commission granted the marketing authorization for our adalimumab biosimilar, IMRALDI. Biogen is now the first company with approved biosimilars in Europe for the three most prescribed anti-TNF biologic treatments. So it was an exciting quarter, with healthy progress in our core business. We saw resilience in our MS franchise. We accelerated our achievements in SMA with several strong country launches, and we continued to grow our biosimilar business. We believe this foundation gives us an even greater ability to create more value for patients and shareholders in the future. We are incredibly excited about the work that is underway to both develop and expand our existing portfolio as well as to invest in building our pipeline. And now I would like to transition to our plan to create new sources of value. The team has been working tirelessly to ensure that we have the right capabilities and pipeline to win in this area, including: optimizing partnerships to better position us for new growth; advancing R&D candidates; actively looking for pipeline assets; enhancing our BD capabilities; and further building our senior management team. Before I turn it over to Mike, a few highlights; first, we renegotiated our agreement with our partner, Eisai. Biogen will now receive 55% of profits in the U.S., 68.5% of the profits in Europe, and 20% of the profits in Japan. This leverages Biogen's strong presence in the U.S. and Europe and Eisai's distinct advantage in Asian markets. Eisai also exercised its option to jointly develop and commercialize adalimumab. We are pleased by this demonstration of Eisai's confidence for our lead Phase 3 Alzheimer's assets. We also agreed to decrease our royalty obligations to Neurimmune. We believe both of these new agreements will improve the long-term economics of adalimumab. Second, we announced new data for the long-term extension of our ongoing Phase 1b study on aducanumab. We are encouraged by these results, as they are consistent with our previous reported data and support to the design of our ongoing Phase 3 studies. We will present detailed data from this analysis at the CTAD [Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease] conference next week, and Mike will provide more details shortly. Third, we advanced multiple assets in our pipeline. We completed enrollment for natalizumab in stroke and BIIB054 in Parkinson's disease. We initiated trials for natalizumab in epilepsy for our tau ASO in Alzheimer's disease in collaboration with Ionis and for opicinumab in MS. And we had a positive readout of STX-100 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Finally, we continued to build our new senior management team, which we believe is critical to maintaining this momentum. We could not become the leader in neuroscience without our world-class talents. Camille Lee has joined Biogen as Senior Vice President, Alzheimer's Therapeutic Area. Dr. Sanjay Jariwala has joined as Senior Vice President, Worldwide Medical. Anabella Villalobos has joined as Senior Vice President of Biotherapeutic Medicinal Science. In addition, we are progressing well in our search for a new CFO and hope to make an announcement in the near future. I will now turn the call over to Mike for an update on our recent progress in R&D. Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: Thank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone. Last quarter, we provided additional clarity on Biogen's R&D strategy, which highlighted our vision to be the leader in neuroscience. We continue to believe that no other area of medicine represents as much patient need, global economic burden, and scientific opportunity as neuroscience. We are enacting an R&D investment strategy aimed at definitive leadership in neuroscience. I would now like to spend some time highlighting the significant progress we have made this quarter within our core and emerging growth areas. Starting with MS and neuroimmunology, we are committed to investing in R&D for MS to address key unmet needs. This week, Biogen is releasing new data through more than 80 oral and poster presentations at the seventh joint ECTRIMS and ACTRIMS meeting, including comparative effectiveness data for TECFIDERA and TYSABRI, as well as an update on several real-world initiatives we are advancing to improve the diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. One of the key highlights for Biogen at the meeting will be the presentation of a post-hoc analysis of data obtained in the Phase 2 SYNERGY trial, which we believe identifies a patient subset exhibiting sustained clinical improvement upon treatment with opicinumab, a first-in-class human monoclonal antibody directed against LINGO-1. At the 10-milligram per kilogram dose, we found that opicinumab was associated with a greater and more durable treatment response in patients who had been diagnosed with MS within the last 20 years and in those whose brain MRI suggested lesions with lower myelin content as measured by magnetization transfer ratio, blood preserve, relative tissue integrity as measured by diffusion tensor imaging radial diffusivity. These characteristics provide a biologically and clinically plausible hypothesis that we will test in our Phase 2b AFFINITY trial. Specifically, AFFINITY, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 2b study that aims to enroll 240 patients with relapsing MS, was initiated earlier this year. The trial was designed to evaluate the potential for opicinumab to improve pre-existing disability in relapsing MS patients through remyelination. A fixed dose of opicinumab that closely replicates the 10-milligram per kilogram dose from SYNERGY will be studied as an add-on therapy in patients who are adequately controlled on their anti-inflammatory disease-modifying therapy versus the DMT alone and who exhibit characteristics consistent with the potential SYNERGY responder population. The primary endpoint of the study, overall response score, is an integrated measure of both the improvement and worsening of disability over time. During the quarter, Lancet published new data investigating the correlation between PML risk for natalizumab and JC virus antibody index values through large observational studies. The estimates suggest that PML risk remains low at JC virus antibody index less than or equal to 0.9 and increases at index levels greater than 1.5. Specifically, over six years of natalizumab treatment, the cumulative risk of PML was lowest in patients with index less than 0.9 at 0.2%, which increased to 2.8% for patients with an index value of greater than 1.5. Our hope is that these data can provide physicians and patients additional information when making individualized benefit/risk assessments with TYSABRI. These data are currently largely reflected in the EU label, and we are currently discussing these data with the FDA. We also had exciting new developments within Alzheimer's disease and dementia, which we believe we have one of the most robust AD portfolios in the industry. We recently conducted an additional interim analysis of the long-term extension of the ongoing Phase 1b study of aducanumab called PRIME, as Michel referred to. The updated analyses include data from the placebo-controlled period and long-term extension for patients treated with aducanumab up to 24 months in the titration cohort and up to 36 months in the fixed-dose cohorts. In patients treated up to 24 months in the titration cohort, amyloid plaque reduction was consistent with the dose and time-dependent results observed in the fixed-dose cohorts. In patients treated up to 36 months, amyloid plaque continued to decrease in a dose and time-dependent manner, with amyloid plaque levels in the 10-milligram per kilogram fixed-dose cohort reaching and remaining at a level considered below the quantitative cut point that discriminates between a positive and negative scan. At both 24 and 36 months, analyses of CDR sum-of-boxes and the MMSE [Mini Mental State Examination] suggest a continued benefit of the treatment of aducanumab on the rate of clinical decline during the treatment. In the Phase 1b long-term extension, the most commonly reported adverse events were headache, fall, and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIA. We look forward to presenting these data in detail next week at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease Conference in Boston. Our collaboration partner, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, recently initiated a Phase 1/2a study with BIIB080 or IONIS-MAPTRx in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease, and dosed the first patient earlier this month. BIIB080 is an intrathecally administered anti-sense therapy designed to selectively reduce the production of the microtubule associated protein tau in the brain. Pathological accumulation of tau protein is a hallmark feature of Alzheimer's disease that correlates strongly with clinical status. Reducing levels of tau via an antisense oligonucleotide, or ASO, represents a unique and independent approach to tau lowering relatively to lowering monoclonal antibodies. Within neuromuscular disorders, we presented significant data for SPINRAZA at the 22nd International Congress of the World Muscle Society in Saint-Malo, France. Key data highlights include a new analysis from the Phase 3 ENDEAR study as measured by the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination. Significant differences in motor milestone responders were observed in patients with disease duration at baseline less than or equal to 12 weeks, as 75% of infants treated with SPINRAZA responded compared to none of the untreated patients. For those with disease duration greater than 12 weeks at baseline, 32% of the treated patients responded while none of the untreated infants responded in this cohort. There was also a statistically significant benefit in event-free survival in infants treated with SPINRAZA with disease duration less than or equal to 12 weeks. Data from EMBRACE, a Phase 2 multi-center randomized double-blind sham-procedure-controlled 14-month study of SPINRAZA in infants and children not eligible to participate in ENDEAR, was also presented. The EMBRACE interim analysis showed a larger proportion of infants and children treated with SPINRAZA for Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination motor milestone responders compared to those who were untreated. In the ENDEAR and EMBRACE studies, SPINRAZA demonstrated a favorable benefit/risk profile. And overall, the data presented contribute to a growing body of evidence that demonstrates SPINRAZA can make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients with SMA regardless of their age or stage of the disease. Beyond SPINRAZA, we continue to be excited about the potential of our gene therapy program in SMA, and we expect to advance into the clinic in mid-2018. Moving on to our progress in movement disorders, BIIB054, our anti alpha-synuclein antibody targeting the core pathology of Parkinson's disease with the goal of slowing disease progression, has completed enrollment in the Phase 1 trial, and we anticipate sharing data from the Parkinson's cohort of this study next year. We are also planning to initiate a Phase 2 study of this asset by the end of the year. Moving on to other updates, we are committed to enhancing and advancing our pipeline in not just our core growth areas but also our emerging growth areas. Specifically, we see significant potential in acute neurology, pain, neuropsychiatry, and ophthalmology. Within acute neurology, we are currently conducting a Phase 2b trial with natalizumab in acute ischemic stroke, with the aim of improving functional outcomes by limiting brain inflammation in the post-stroke period. The study is fully enrolled, and we expect data early next year. Natalizumab is targeting acute ischemic stroke patients with mild-to-moderate severity, with a therapeutic time window of up to 24 hours after stroke onset. This program complements BIIB093, our first-in-class IV glibenclamide therapeutic targeting brain edema in severe large hemispheric infarcts, with a planned Phase 3 start next year. During the quarter, we also initiated OPUS, a Phase 2 study for natalizumab, which we believe has the potential to be a first-in-class antiinflammatory therapy for patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. With over 750,000 target patients in the U.S. and EU5 alone, we see significant opportunity. Specifically, the study will be a 70-patient six-month randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of natalizumab as adjunctive therapy. Patients are expected to continue into a six-month open-label phase after completion of the double-blind phase. The primary efficacy objective of the study is to determine if adjunctive therapy of natalizumab reduces the frequency of seizures in adult participants. Mechanistically, with multiple lines of preclinical and clinical research providing rationale for a potential benefit, we believe blocking alpha-4 integrin with natalizumab may help to reduce leukocyte vascular interactions and stabilize blood brain barrier integrity, which may ultimately help to reduce the frequency and severity of seizures. Moving on to our emerging growth area of neuropathic pain, our Phase 2b study of BIIB074 in painful lumbosacral radiculopathy is currently enrolling, with data expected next year. Also next year, we anticipate initiating a Phase 3 program for trigeminal neuralgia as well as a Phase 2 study in small fiber neuropathy. Outside of our core and emerging growth areas, we recently achieved proof of biology for BG00011 or STX-100 in a Phase 2a trial in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF. For assets like BG00011 that are not within our neuroscience focus, we intend to continue development as long as the science remains compelling and we see potential to add value. The results from the 41-patient Phase 2a trial demonstrated substantial down-regulation of the TGF beta pathway in IPF patients treated with BG00011, as measured by up to 70% inhibition from baseline of phosphorylated SMAD and alveolar macrophages isolated by bronchial alveolar lavage from IPF subjects. Phosphorylated SMAD mediates the transcriptional activity of TGF beta, signaling that increased levels have been correlated with fibrosis in multiple preclinical models. In addition, BG00011 was shown to impact multiple prespecified genes associated with TGF-beta signaling. Through this study, we have identified a dose with an appropriate safety profile and anticipated level of efficacy to support advancement into a Phase 2b study next year. As a reminder, our key strategic priorities within R&D are to build out our translational machine in neuroscience, invest in assets and capabilities in our prioritized core and emerging growth areas, and to augment our pipeline. We have made strong progress this year in increasing the probability of success for transitioning from the lab all the way to the market. In 2017, we have transitioned five programs from research to development within our core and emerging growth areas, putting us on track to nearly double historical productivity and highlighting our focus on bringing novel drug candidates into the clinic. We aim for a similar or greater level of R&D productivity next year. And a key component of our R&D strategy is to leverage antisense oligonucleotides, which offer a promising platform to get to and through the clinic faster than other modalities. To that end, we recently opened an ASO manufacturing facility in North Carolina to support our growing ASO pipeline. We have also been building our R&D leadership team, which Michel discussed, to help maximize future R&D productivity. While we continue to make important progress advancing our portfolio, we recognize that accelerating our long-term growth will require further enhancement. Internal productivity is already showing promise. But in addition, we are highly focused on expanding our neuroscience portfolio through external opportunities and look forward to highlighting the progress we make here in the coming months. In summary, across our portfolio, we see : continued leadership in MS, including remyelination; a growing body of clinical data within SMA; an industry-leading Alzheimer's disease portfolio; a compelling program in neuropathic pain; a unique clinical portfolio in stroke; defining new mechanisms of biology in IPF; advancing assets in Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and ALS; and a growing number of high-quality drug candidates reaching the clinic. I will now pass the call back to Michel. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Thank you, Mike. Now let me share with you how we are thinking about the rest of 2017. We expect that SPINRAZA continues on a strong trajectory in terms of patient uptake in the U.S. and internationally. However, due to the impact of the dosing scheduling, we anticipate SPINRAZA revenue growth in Q4 will be mostly driven by ex-U.S. markets. We expect OCREVUS will have a modest net negative impact on our MS portfolio, and we expect the typical seasonality for MS in Q4. And for expenses, we expect OpEx in Q4 to increase versus Q3, as we invest behind our strategic priorities. In conclusion, I believe we have a clear direction. Our actions are aligned to our strategic imperatives, and everything we do is linked to maximizing shareholder value over the long term. Our market-leading MS business remains resilient. We continued an impressive SPINRAZA launch. We advanced assets in our neuroscience portfolio. We increased our biosimilars revenues in Europe. And very importantly, we enhanced our collaboration arrangements with Eisai and Neurimmune. We intend to continue this momentum, especially with a focus on completing more business development to further expand our neuroscience portfolio so that we can achieve our mission to be the leader in neuroscience. Looking forward, within the next 12 to 18 months, we expect several meaningful readouts across our neuroscience pipeline, including: BAN2401 in Alzheimer's disease; natalizumab in stroke; BIIB067 for ALS; BIIB074 for painful lumbosacral radiculopathy; BIIB054 in Parkinson's; and our gene therapy program for XLRS. Before we go into Q&A, I would like to thank our employees around the world who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patients' lives and all of the physicians, caregivers, and participants in our clinical development programs. The past and future achievements could not be realized without their passion and commitment. With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC : Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. I'll leave out SPINRAZA patient count stuff for the rest of the call but, Michel, I actually wanted to focus on aducanumab for a minute, and two parts to that. First, I just wanted to think through what the $150 million payment to Neurimmune on the royalty reduction implies for the valuation of aducanumab. And the reason why I ask is because the implied valuation for aducanumab based on this $150 million payment is very different than what the market implies. So I was just curious and just wanted to understand the context of this negotiation a bit better. And then also on aducanumab, I was just curious. How much of your R&D spend is going towards aducanumab right now? And I ask because of the amount of payments Eisai is going to have to make starting 2019, whether that's appropriately reflected in Street expectations for your R&D spend in 2019 onwards or not. Thank you. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: So thank you for the good questions. We are very pleased with these new agreements. We believe in the potential opportunity with aducanumab, and therefore, we act in alignment with this belief. And this took a lot of work, and it's probably the most important alliance will be the agreement we reached in 2017 so far, so I think this is very important. For the $150 million, we are working on our long-term \u2013 long-range operating plan, and we remain, with the right assumptions, very bullish on the opportunity that we have with this product. With Neurimmune, we have a long-term collaboration and there are many things in play, in the past, in the present, and in the future. And I will say it's logical that working together we achieved this agreement between the two companies. So I would not go much further in terms of the speculation of the potential link, but I think that it's very positive for the overall future profitability of aducanumab if we're able to succeed. So we are pleased with this outcome. Concerning the clinical spend, the only thing I can tell you is that as for the time Eisai starts to contribute meaningfully to the clinical spend in 2019, a large portion of the overall spend will need to occur in 2019 and beyond. Does somebody want to add something, okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please go ahead. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I want to get some context for SPINRAZA just for the U.S. Obviously, it's flattish in Q3 and you're also saying that, Michel, for Q4, are you guys seeing discontinuations or difficulties in getting reimbursement, or is this just wave two in the U.S. is more difficult than putting on wave one, which would be the worst patients, the most severe patients? Thank you. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Thanks for the question. We are very pleased with the momentum in the U.S. And having 75% patient growth is not a simple achievement, so I compliment the team. As expected and also as difficult to model as it can be, based on the dosing regimen, the impact of the patients we got in Q1 and on the early access program was fully reflected in the Q3 because of the dosing regimen. Over time this will normalize, and that's why we are prudent the way we have been prudent since the beginning of the year, if you'll recall well, so we expect that the dynamic will normalize as the maintenance dose becomes the majority of the revenue, so this is basically the momentum we see. We enlarged the reach. We see a larger proportion of the patients above the age of 15. Meeting with scientific leaders, they are getting more experience on complicated spine in order to dose the patients, and they are investigating potential routes of administration and procedure for patients more complicated, other one with the fusion, and those ones are the more complicated. And it is anticipated, just to come back because I know that everybody has that in their mind, so yes, we said 60% of the patients have a complicated spine or mostly the patients with the Type 2 and Type 3, mostly the Type 2. But out of this proportion, it's actually between 10% and 20% of those patients who have fusion that are more complex. The others are easier. And apparently, according to scientific leaders, the proportion of fusion ex-U.S. is much lower, just to give some context. So we remain optimistic on the potential of SPINRAZA in the U.S. and ex-U.S., and our peak sales objective did not change. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question. I guess I'm just having the same problem with squaring the circle here on SPINRAZA. It sounds like you did very well with new patient adds, a 75% increase in number of patients on therapy from end of Q2 to end of Q3, and a variety \u2013 a large majority of those patients had to receive multiple doses. So I guess maybe not to ask the same question a different way, Michel, but how is it that you can't get growth with that many new patients being added here? There must be some change to gross-to-net or free drug or something of that sort. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: The free drug, unless I make a mistake, was 20%. This is correct, so there was a slight increase but not a major impact. Again, it's the 75% patient growth that was dosed, 75% of patient growth that were dosed with the initial dosing regimen and very little of patients with the maintenance dose. This is the dynamic that we see. It is clear that for the later onset of disease and more complicated patients, it takes a bit more time to get those. That's why we have hundreds of start forms that are not yet for patients who are not yet dosed. So this is another dynamic that is not new. But again, as I said, the infrastructure and the system is adjusting. Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Co. LLC: Do you expect growth in Q1? Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: I will not comment yet on Q1, and the last element that we saw was an inventory play between Q2 and Q3. Thanks, Eric. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merill Lynch. Please go ahead. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe, Michel, you talked about the formulary access for MS products. Can you talk on a high level what your expectation is for 2018 net pricing for TECFIDERA and also the other products? And then maybe another question is with Eisai just opting in for aducanumab, and we know that the BAN2401 program is coming to an end, did Eisai have any clarity on the analysis of the results from the 12-month follow-up before they opted in? Thank you. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: So I will get started on the market access for 2018, and that is now almost under contract. And as communicated, we are very pleased with the progress for the U.S. And the gross-to-net impact is similar to prior years and the typical contracting arrangements for which our leadership position is helping, as you can imagine. So we didn't see a dramatic erosion in order to maintain or enhance. We saw a very limited one actually. So we are pleased with the momentum, including open formularies and including the win with some major payers like Aetna. So this is an important achievement. Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr., M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: Ying, this is Al Sandrock. In terms of what Eisai saw, they saw all of the same things we've seen so far, which include data from the Phase 1b trial that Mike talked about that we'll be presenting next week, which is the 36-month follow-up in the fixed-dose cohorts and the 24-month follow-up in the titration cohorts. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good morning, guys, and thank you for taking my question. I'll keep it to one. Are you surprised by the relative strength of SPINRAZA overseas? I guess is there anything noticeably different relative to the U.S. launch that you've seen over there in these early days? Thanks. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: Thanks for the question. We are very pleased. And as communicated previously, we did anticipate that, unlike MS, we see that for SPINRAZA, mostly driven by the prevalence of the disease. We see a higher proportion of opportunities in terms of top line revenue ex-U.S. and U.S. So we are pleased with the early launch countries, Germany, a couple of Nordics countries, Japan since a few weeks. But this was mostly driven by Germany and some named patient sales in the Middle East, in Turkey, and in Latin America. Germany is going very strong. We got the journal official in Italy, and you'll recall that we had more than 100 \u2013 close to 120 patients on the early access program. And overall, maybe one element that is helping also the momentum in Europe, or ex-U.S., was the very large number of early access program patients that were already identified just waiting to gain reimbursement in order to be shifted to commercial goods. So obviously now, the question is, are we anticipating the same trends that basically many of you have anticipated as opposed \u2013 not just linear growth on a country basis ex-U.S.? We believe that based on the sequence of access, reimbursement, and unlocking opportunities in different countries that is not at the same time that this trend will not be the same as in the U.S. I think that this will be a smoother trend in the right direction. And again, overall, it's very nice momentum, and we are trending above what we thought were our internal targets. Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr., M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: Cory, just to put some numbers on it, we had more than 500 patients in the early access program across 18 countries in Europe. That compares to about 60 patients we had in the U.S., probably due to timing a little between when we saw the data and when the drug was approved, so a lot more interest in the EAP in Europe. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink. Please go ahead. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Thank you very much, a quick clarification for Al, if I could, and then a question, Michel, for you. Al, on the intrathecal ASO for Alzheimer's, could you just talk about the dosing frequency and the access there in terms of being able to deliver the treatment? And then, Michel, could you talk about your policy on pricing? Of course, pricing has been a significant driver to the MS category overall in prior years, and then the company changed the policy this year, and you've taken single-digit price increases on a one-time basis this year. Is that what we should be modeling going forward? Thanks. And I apologize for the double question. Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: Geoff, this is Mike. I'll take a stab at the first one. I think it was about intrathecal access for this. It turns out that we don't anticipate any more significant problems in terms of intrathecal delivery with this program than in the SPINRAZA program at all. And the initial studies are really that they're safety dose-ranging findings in Alzheimer's subjects. So we're trying to get an idea of exactly the right dose range. And then from a technical standpoint, we don't see or anticipate any more significant challenge than what we've seen with SPINRAZA. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: So concerning the second question, let me start by saying that we are very pleased with the resilience of our MS portfolio. That is so important in terms of cash flow generation, and we intend actually to continue this momentum. We organized a meeting in a few days with all the Biogen leaders, where we are going to recommit so that we can defend as much as we can. The market share where we speak is holding at 38%. It was 38.3% before. I don't know when exactly. And as expected, an OCREVUS launch will erode the share. And if I look at the performance over the last two quarters, including OCREVUS, that was still a minimum contribution, it is the last best two quarters ever for Biogen, so it's not a cliff. And we'll continue to drive the activity to generate demand and volume, and we will not comment on the price policy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with UBS. Please go ahead. Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning, guys, congrats on your results and all the updates. Just to come back to aducanumab, on the updates with Eisai and Neurimmune, how should we think about these? Were these proactive moves on your end or more opportunistic moves after overtures from those companies? Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: So I will not intend to the details of the first move. These are contracts that were signed a few years back. We see data coming in the Phase 1/1b, and we are relatively pleased with this data. We'll hear more at CTAD, and I thought it would be an opportunity to see how we could improve the operation or give the best chance for the operation and the core promotion the day we have potentially the product, and therefore playing out who's the best where. And obviously, I have the agenda to increase the opportunity for Biogen, and I think that with the two deals, this is what we are achieving. But it's a win-win, and the partner at Eisai gets also the opportunity to co-promote the MS portfolio, which is important. So we are very pleased with these two upgraded, I would say, arenas. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'd like to just go back to SPINRAZA one more time. I'm sorry for starting to beat this too much. Can you just help us because the numbers don't square? And I'm just trying to figure out what piece we may be missing. So if you back out the inventory from the second quarter, you had 32% sequential revenue growth, but you had 75% growth in new patients. And I thought at the beginning, you said that 10% of patients had a maintenance dose. So it seems like you almost doubled \u2013 I mean a little less, but you had substantial \u2013 hundreds of new patients add on and some patients taking maintenance dose. So it seems like the price per patient has come down by 40%. So is that right, or what else are we missing in those numbers? Matthew Calistri - Biogen, Inc.: Hey, Matthew, this is Matt. Let me try to help clarify. So first, when we say 75% patient growth, what we're looking at is at the end of second quarter to the end of third quarter. If you look at the number of patients on therapy at the end of the second quarter versus at the end of the third quarter, we had 75% more patients. Now how many of those patients at the end of the third quarter received one, two, or three doses is unclear. We haven't revealed that. So that's probably part of the reason it's a little more difficult for you to square that math. And the other thing we talked about was 10% of the revenues came from patients who had been on a loading dose in prior quarters, so there's a lot of dynamics here. And the nature of loading doses versus maintenance doses I know makes it a little bit complicated, but that's how the math plays out. So I don't think it's a function of gross-to-net impacting. As you saw, we believe it's 20% of patients are on free. It's more a function of just the timing of doses. And as we said, we expect this is something that normalizes over time. I think the other thing you're all trying to solve for is the commentary we said about Q4. We said the majority of growth is expected to come outside of the U.S. I don't think the message is that there's no growth in the U.S. I think the message is that there would be growth in the U.S., but the majority of growth would come from outside of the U.S. So I don't think we're trying to send a message that you're not seeing growth in SPINRAZA in the U.S. We're just comparing it to the dynamics in the rest of the world. Does that help? Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, I think it does. And I think you've commented on ex-U.S. trajectory. But should we consider \u2013 I guess maybe you could just give us some guideposts on what's going to grow ex-U.S. trajectory. Is it new country launches or additional patients in existing countries? Matthew Calistri - Biogen, Inc.: You can assume new country launches would make \u2013 we believe new country launches will be one of the drivers there that could be. As you just look at the comments we've made, Germany and Turkey made up a majority of the rest of the world sales. But as you look at the countries that have already approved and some of the traction we're making, you're going to see more diversity across other countries. That's our belief. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: But Germany still has a long way to go, so you can actually expect both. But in the first phase, obviously the new product launches in new countries like Italy, while we speak, will add momentum, should add momentum. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning thanks for taking the question, maybe one for Michel or Mike. You both referred to business development looking externally. Neuro focus, maybe just give us your latest thoughts on early stage, later stage, how you're thinking about business development and maybe the cadence of the deal or deals. Thanks. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: So I will get started, and Mike can add more color. So first, we have strong cash flow generation, and we expect that this cash flow will grow mostly after 2019, when we have less royalties to pay on TEC [TECFIDERA]. So we will make sure that the allocation of this capital will secure the maximization of the shareholder return. And we have communicated that, unlike in the past where we did the majority to the dollar back to shareholders in terms of share repurchase, we will also do the share and prioritize, as for now, the capital allocation efforts towards building the neuroscience pipeline. And in addition, we may continue to repurchase shares on an opportunistic manner based on the price of the share and other elements. So we are looking at different opportunities. Eisai and Neurimmune took a lot of time. And there are opportunities, and the sweet spot of Biogen remains at the early stage. And we'll be very careful if we go beyond the early stage of the valuation of those assets or companies. Mike? Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: Yes, I'd add just a little bit to that. We're quite committed to a couple of things within the R&D portfolio. Number one was increasing productivity of our existing pipeline, and number two was to be able to add important new assets to the pipeline. So we're quite committed to portfolio growth. Michel mentioned \u2013 our sweet spot, we believe, is in early-phase clinical assets because of our ability to really derisk those and advance those through proof-of-concept well. But of course, we look within that sweet spot and beyond. We've got a number of active discussions ongoing. We're augmenting our external innovation capabilities. We've been bringing online more search and evaluation, and we're really retuning a lot of the entire R&D organization and beyond to be more externally oriented. So I think that you will see over time both an increase in the productivity of the existing portfolio and a number of assets coming into the portfolio. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Aharon Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning and thanks for fitting me in, a question about the gene therapy platform. Good to hear that you think you'll be starting now your trials in mid-2018. I guess my question is on the manufacturing here. Is there an opportunity here to leapfrog in terms of your both capacity and cost? Folks would be talking about how difficult it is to get enough material to be able to treat an entire patient population as opposed to just the Type 1 SMA. Cost per therapy suggests in the hundreds of thousands of dollars per patient. Have you been able to move away from triple (57:20) transactions to something more stable? Will you be able to address the cost structure? If you could, just give us some landmarks around that. Paul McKenzie - Biogen, Inc.: Sure, Ronny, this is Paul McKenzie. Thanks for the question and thanks for your great recent gene therapy seminar that you gave. A lot of people really benefited from that in the industry. You bring up a great question around our ability and beliefs around our development and manufacturing capability. As I shared with you before that we have doubled down on our development capability. We believe that will allow us to drive to a gene therapy platform that's industry-leading. We also have invested in manufacturing partnerships and platforms that allow us to do these activities, both development and manufacturing excellence, in parallel. We're very excited around our progress around our clinical supplies for the second half of 2018 dosing. And we continue to make great strides on our PCL development for the future commercial process. So more to come in the upcoming months, but we believe we're well positioned to continue to drive our agenda in gene therapy across the portfolio as a real platform play. Michael D. Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: Ronny, this is Mike. Just following up on Paul's comments, manufacturing is certainly one area where we believe there's an opportunity for real competitive advantage in a platform approach that could be attractive for SMA and beyond. Within SMA in particular, there are a number of things that we are quite focused on, which is the right patient subtypes. We certainly have gained a lot of experience with patient subtypes within SMA with our SPINRAZA experience. And I think along with that are going to be important things that we're looking at, which are delivery route timing of dosing administration, potential combinations with SPINRAZA. And of course, front and center in our mind is how all that ties in with clinical safety, and I think that a lot of this still has to play out. So between manufacturing, patient sub-type, delivery route, safety profile, those are key elements of our gene therapy strategy. Operator : And your final question comes on the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC : Hey, thanks for the question. Given the update on the Eisai opt-in, can you just remind us with the BAN2401 data coming, how to interpret that from the standpoint of a high hurdle given aducanumab's advancement in Phase 3 and so far ahead, how you would think about whether there would be two Phase 3 programs or just the fact that there's a high hurdle for this program given that they've now opted in? Thanks. Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr., M.D., Ph.D. - Biogen, Inc.: Mike, this is Al. First of all, it's prespecified in the agreement what the hurdles actually would be, and so there's that. The way I look at that data is first I want to see. Is there plaque reduction with BAN2401? If there isn't, then I don't know how to interpret the rest of the data. If there is plaque reduction, then the next thing we want to see, is there at least a trend or a favorable effect on the composite measure, which includes things like CDR sum-of-boxes, which would allow us to compare the effect of aducanumab with BAN2401. And then finally, of course, we need to look at the safety, what are the rates of the key adverse events, such as ARIA. And then with that, we'll make a decision. But as I said, the contract prespecifies what the efficacy hurdles are. Michel Vounatsos - Biogen, Inc.: So thank you all and have a great day, bye for now. Operator : Thank you to everyone for attending today. This will conclude today's call, and you may now disconnect.",

My name is Chris and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Fourth Quarter and Year End 2017 Financial Results and Business Update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Matt Calistri, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Matt Calistri : Thank you and welcome to Biogen\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today\u2019s call, I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Michael Ehlers, EVP of Research and Development; and our new CFO, Jeff Capello. Before I conclude, I would also like to note that starting with the Q1 2018 earnings call we will post press releases related to future earnings calls materials and investor events on the Investors section of Biogen\u2019s website, www.biogen.com and issue statement on Twitter when they become available. We will do this instead of publishing press releases related to future earnings calls, earnings releases and Investor events via Newswire services. Our Twitter handle is @biogen. Now, I will turn the call over to Michel. Michel Vounatsos : Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. First, let me start with some financial highlights. Biogen closed 2017, with an all-time high in quarterly revenues of $3.3 billion. For the full year 2017, Biogen generated another all-time high of $12.3 billion in revenues. On an apples-to-apples basis, excluding hemophilia, full year revenues grew 15% versus 2016. Full year revenues grew 7% when we include hemophilia for 2016 and January 2017. Starting in 2018, we believe that overall the new U.S. tax reform will have a positive impact to our profitability and our ability to invest for the future. But in Q4, we took a one-time charge of $1.2 billion in line with what you are probably seeing from other public companies. Jeff will provide additional detail shortly. Therefore, full year GAAP earnings decreased 30% versus 2016 to $11.92 a share. Full year non-GAAP earnings were $21.81, an 8% increase versus full year 2016, while being impacted by over $500 million of expenses due to several business development transactions including our deals BMS, Alkermes and Ionis as well as our charge related to the ZINBRYTA impairment. Now, let me review the year. 2017 was clearly a very productive and successful year for Biogen. We launched a new focused and well articulated strategy with the longer term goal of becoming the leader in neuroscience and the fastest growing large cap biotech. We defined priority designed to drive future growth first fortifying our core MS business; second, executing on the launch of SPINRAZA and third, creating a lean and simple operating model. The goal of these priorities is to drive significant cash flow generation and invest those to create new sources of value beyond MS and SMA. We are pleased with the work the team has done to execute on our strategy which has led to significant progress for Biogen. Let me now reflect on some of our key results across each of these priorities. For our first strategic priority maximizing the resilience of our MS core business, we grew global MS revenues including royalties from OCREVUS to $9.1 billion, an increase of 4% versus 2016. Our MS products now treat over 340,000 patients globally, a 3% increase over 2016. In the U.S., our MS revenues were stable versus 2016 and including OCREVUS royalties, MS revenues in the U.S. increased 2%. We strengthened our IP position for TECFIDERA, our leading oral therapy through a settlement and licensing agreement with Forward Pharma. We received favorable rulings for both our IPR proceeding and interference case. We achieved expanded access for 2018 in the U.S. for our MS portfolio. We executed 5 value-based contracts in the U.S., which we hope will give us opportunity to learn and develop new contracting models to better serve patients. We licensed BIIB098 from Alkermes, a Phase 3 monomethyl fumarate with a potentially differentiated profile to TECFIDERA we expect filing will occur later his year. For our second strategic priority, spinal muscular atrophy, we delivered one of the most exciting biotech launch of the year with SPINRAZA global revenues of $884 million exceeding many expectations. As of the end of 2017, there were approximately 3,200 patients on therapy across the post-marketing setting, the EAP and clinical trials. We also launched a new collaboration with our partner Ionis to identify new ASO drug candidates for SMA with the goal to enhance strategic alternatives. And we are exploring a number of avenues, including device partnerships to improving surgical delivery with the recent example being our research collaboration agreement with Alcyone to leverage the device platform. For our third strategic priority creating a leaner and simpler operating model, we identified opportunities to streamline our operation to help fund further investment in high-value R&D and new commercial activities. We benchmarked against multiple businesses to challenge ourselves to be as effective and efficient as possible as we aim to create an innovative operating model designed for the future. We believe this will enable us to redirect up to $400 million by the end of 2020 to be reinvested and prioritize value creating opportunities across our R&D and commercial organizations. For our fourth strategic priority developing and expanding our neuroscience portfolio Biogen added seven new clinical stage programs in 2017 across our core and emerging growth areas through the advancement of our own internal candidates as well as external business development. And finally, our fifth strategic priority reprioritizing our capital allocation towards long-term growth, while also continuing to opportunistically buyback shares. We have emphasized investing in future growth while delivering near-term results and turned 2017 into one of our most productive year for business development. We also repurchased 4.9 million shares for approximately $1.4 billion at an average price of $278 a share. And importantly in terms of strategic alliances we renegotiated our agreements with Eisai and Neurimmune with the aim to improve long-term economics of aducanumab. In addition to the strong progress in 2017, I am also excited by new additions to our executive team. Jeff Capello has joined as Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer, Chirfi Guindo has joined as Executive VP and Head of Global Marketing, Market Access and Customer Innovation. I believe that we now have great leaders in all key position and Biogen is exhibiting well. We have a strong base business with significant cash flow generation and exciting new growth driver in SPINRAZA and accelerating momentum in R&D and business development to solidify the foundation for future growth. I look forward to carrying the strong performance through 2018 and beyond with our new executive team. I will now turn the call over to Mike for a more detailed update on our recent progress in R&D. Michael Ehlers : Thank you, Michel and good morning everyone. 2017 was the transformative year for Biogen R&D. We provided clarity on Biogen strategic priorities with the aim of becoming the leader in neuroscience. We believe this is an area right with opportunities, we are breaking science is opening up new avenues for drug development. We believe that Biogen has a competitive advantage in this space based on our strong track record and intense focus within our core growth areas and emerging growth areas within neuroscience. Our goal is to leverage our competitive advantage, target our investments and advance the world-class neuroscience R&D engine. To that end, we made significant progress in 2017 towards this vision. We made noteworthy advancements transitioning pipeline candidates from research to development with five transitions in 2017, nearly double Biogen\u2019s historical productivity. In 2018, we aim to continue this level of productivity or even accelerate the number of candidates that transition to the clinic. As Michelle highlighted, we added seven new clinical stage assets in 2017, through both advancing internal candidates, and through external business development. And as you may have seen earlier today, we announced our first deal of the year, in this agreement we acquired the rights to Karyopharm\u2019s first-in-class Phase 1 ready investigational oral compound KPT-350 for certain neurological and neurodegenerative conditions, primarily focused on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS. KPT-350 is a novel candidate that works by inhibiting XPO1, with the goal of reducing inflammation and neurotoxicity along with the increasing neuro protective responses. We plan on moving this asset into a Phase 1 study by the end of the year. As we develop and expand the Biogen pipeline, our aim is to increase overall productivity at every stage, de-risk the pipeline and continue to implement a robust external pipeline strategy that may include continued asset acquisitions, development partnerships for resource flexibility and risk sharing and early innovation partnerships. Earlier this month, we entered a precompetitive consortium with several of our peers to sequence the exempts of 500,000 participants in the UK Biobank, with the goal of assisting drug discovery and development by linking protein coding variance to human phenotypes. We believe this is a great example of our scientific leadership in the field. Before I hand it off to Jeff, I would like to spend some time highlighting several achievements from the fourth quarter starting with MS and neuroimmunology. As part of our long-standing commitment to the MS community, Biogen remains dedicated to advancing the treatment of MS and building upon our leadership position in the space. As Michelle mentioned, we licensed BIIB098, the MMF compound from Alkermes in the fourth quarter and we anticipate a filing by the end of the year. We are actively working to optimize the value and clinical potential of this asset. In December, we also does the first patient in affinity a Phase 2b study designed to evaluate the potential for opicinumab, the first in class human monoclonal antibody directed against LINGO-1 on improving pre-existing disability and relapsing MS patients through remyelination. We also had exciting new developments within Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia. We presented new interim data from the long-term extension of the ongoing Phase 1b study of aducanumab called PRIME at the clinical trials in Alzheimer disease meeting in November. We believe the totality of the data from the Phase 1b study is compelling and supports the design of the Phase 3 studies. Phase 3 enrollment for aducanumab is going well and we anticipate the studies will be fully enrolled in mid-2018. Last month, we learned BAN2401 and anti-beta amyloid protofibril antibody being developed in collaboration with Eisai did not meet the criteria for success in its Phase 2 study at 12 months. The study remains blinded and the final analysis will be conducted when patients have completed 18 months which is expected in the second half of the year. In the final analysis, we are particularly interested in the Alzheimer\u2019s disease composite score, or ADCOMS and its components such as the CDR-Sum of Boxes and MSC and ADAS-cog as well as brain amyloid levels as measured by amyloid pet and its overall safety profile. Beyond aducanumab and BAN2401, we are advancing four other clinical assets in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, including a base inhibitor; two, anti-tile antibodies and an antisense oligonucleotide in collaboration with Ionis. We believe we have the industry\u2019s leading Alzheimer\u2019s portfolio. Turning to neuromuscular disorders, we made significant progress towards our strategic objective of accelerating our leadership in spinal muscular atrophy. Along with our partner, Ionis, we were awarded the prestigious 2017 Prix Galien USA award for Best Biotechnology Product for SPINRAZA. This award recognizes extraordinary achievement in scientific innovation that improves the state of human health and we are honored to have received this distinction. In November, the end of study results from ENDEAR, the Phase 3 study of SPINRAZA were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The ENDEAR study highlights the therapeutic potential of this breakthrough treatment as most infants receiving SPINRAZA showed meaningful benefit regardless of their age or stage of the disease. As part of our commitment to the SMA community, Biogen remains dedicated to advancing potential additional treatment options for SMA. Last month, we entered into a new collaboration agreement with Ionis Pharmaceuticals to identify additional antisense oligonucleotide drug candidates for the treatment of SMA. In this agreement, we are exploring novel chemistries for advancing intrathecal ASO-based therapies that have the potential to reduce the dosing burden or increase the therapeutic effect. We also recently signed a research collaboration agreement with Alcyone that leverages their novel device platform with the hope of improving the intrathecal delivery of therapies for severe neurological conditions with the first year of interest being for SMA and particularly patients with spinal complications. We continue to believe that there is opportunity in gene therapy and are advancing our gene therapy asset for SMA toward the clinic with the aim of dosing the first patient by the middle of this year. Moving on to our progress and movement disorders, BIIB054, our anti alpha-synuclein antibody for Parkinson\u2019s disease has recently started the Phase 2 study called SPARC and we dosed the first patient earlier this month. In Phase 1, the drug was well-tolerated at doses that are being used in the Phase 2 study and its safety profile and pharmacokinetic behavior, including CSF concentrations in both healthy control and Parkinson\u2019s disease patients was acceptable and consistent with other monoclonal antibodies. Within acute neurology, we are currently conducting a Phase IIb trial with natalizumab in acute ischemic stroke with the aim of improving functional outcomes by limiting brain inflammation and therefore increasing neuronal survival in the post stroke period. With approximately 1.7 million ischemic strokes each year across the U.S., Europe and Japan, we believe there is significant opportunity if the trial is successful. The study is fully enrolled and we anticipate sharing top line results in the coming weeks. As a reminder, natalizumab is targeting acute ischemic stroke patients with mild-to-moderate severity with the therapeutic time window of up to 24 hours after stroke onset. This program complements BIIB093, our first-in-class IV glibenclamide therapeutic targeting brain edema in large hemispheric infarcts, with a planned Phase 3 start in the middle of this year. So, a very productive quarter and year as we build and advance our pipeline from human genetics to new novel clinical endpoints and clinical assessment tools to differentiated clinical development to potentially transformative modalities and delivery technologies, we continue to invest in and advance our asymmetric capabilities and neuroscience where our aim is to be the definitive leader. I will now pass the call to Jeff. Jeff Capello : Thanks Mike. Good morning, everyone. Let me now provide a little more detail on our financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2017 and share with you our guidance for 2018. Let\u2019s start with revenues. As Michel mentioned earlier, we had a strong Q4 2017 from a revenue perspective. Total revenues for Q4 grew 15% year-over-year to approximately $3.3 billion and grew 7% for the full year to $12.3 billion. Excluding the impact of the spinoff of our hemophilia business, total revenue grew 26% for the fourth quarter and 15% for the full year versus the prior year periods. Let me now provide more detail for our MS franchise revenues. Global fourth quarter TECFIDERA revenues were $1.1 billion, a 7% increase versus the prior year. This included revenues of $832 million in the U.S., an increase of 4% versus Q4 \u201816 and $244 million outside the U.S., an increase of 22% versus the fourth quarter of 2016. Despite the benefit of a roughly $20 million increase of inventory in the channel in the U.S. versus the third quarter of 2017. We are pleased with our net low single-digit growth versus Q4 \u201816 as we absorb the impact of OCREVUS. In addition, we are very encouraged by the growth outside the U.S. driven by patient growth across almost every large market in Europe and strong emerging market growth. For the full year, worldwide TECFIDERA revenues were $4.2 billion, an increase of 6% versus prior year. This includes $3.3 billion in the U.S. and $920 million in sales outside the U.S. Interferon revenues including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY were $645 million for the fourth quarter, a decrease of 6% versus Q4 \u201816 due to continued shift from the injectable platforms to oral or high efficacy therapies. This included $449 million in the U.S. and $196 million in sales outside the U.S. Within the U.S., AVONEX and PLEGRIDY benefited from the inventory build of approximately $15 million, while outside the U.S., Avonex benefited from a $9 million shipment to Brazil, neither of which are expected to recur in the first quarter of 2018. For the full year, worldwide interferon revenues were $2.6 billion, consisting of $1.9 billion in the U.S. and $757 million in sales outside the U.S. TYSABRI worldwide revenues were $463 million this quarter, a decrease of 2% versus the fourth quarter of 2016. This included $252 million in the U.S. and $211 million outside the U.S. In the U.S., revenues declined 13% versus the prior year. We saw an impact on TYSABRI shortly following the launch of OCREVUS both in terms of new patient starts and patient discontinuations. However, we believe both of these trends have now stabilized at new run-rate. Within the U.S., TYSABRI benefited from an inventory build of approximately $5 million. Outside the U.S., we had very strong TYSABRI growth of 14% versus prior year driven by both the large order of $6 million in Russia as well as solid growth in all major European countries driven by patient growth following the label update in 2017. For the full year, worldwide TYSABRI revenues were approximately $2 billion stable versus the prior year. We recorded U.S. revenues of $1.1 billion and $859 million internationally. As expected, across our MS business, we saw an increase in discounts and allowances in the fourth quarter partly due to seasonality. Throughout 2018, we expect another couple of 100 basis points of pressure on discounts and allowances with the typical seasonality in the first and fourth quarters. Despite this dynamic, we expect roughly flat performance for our total MS revenues for 2018 when you include the impact of the OCREVUS royalty. This corresponds to a low single-digit contraction in our MS revenues, excluding the OCREVUS royalties. Additionally, we expect the potential inventory drawdown in Q1 2018 coming off the build of approximately $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Let me now move to SPINRAZA. Global fourth quarter SPINRAZA revenues were $363 million. This included revenues of $218 million in the U.S., an increase of 10% versus the third quarter and $144 million outside the U.S. almost doubling quarter-over-quarter. For the full year 2017, worldwide SPINRAZA revenues were $884 million making it one of the most successful rare disease launches in history. This included $657 million in the U.S. and $227 million in sales outside the U.S. In the U.S., we now see over 275 sites that have submitted start forms, of which 215 have dosed at least one patient. We saw 33% increase in the number of patients on therapy in the U.S. as compared to the end of the third quarter. Similar to last quarter, revenues grew at a lower rate than patients due to loading dose dynamics with roughly half of revenues coming from new patients started dosing in the fourth quarter. In the U.S., we believe that new patient starts in the fourth quarter were weighted towards the beginning of the quarter as we saw an impact on demand during the holiday weeks. As a result, we expect a relatively lower contribution in Q1 2018 from these patients as they will have worked through many of their loading doses in the fourth quarter 2017. As expected, we are seeing an increasing contribution from maintenance doses as patients who started earlier in the year transitioned to dosing once every 4 months on a chronic basis. In the U.S., approximately 25% of SPINRAZA revenues in the fourth quarter were attributed to maintenance doses as compared to 10% in the third quarter. This correlates with the continued decline in the average doses per patient from 1.8 to 1.5 from the third quarter to the fourth quarter this year. We expect this dynamic to normalize over time with approximately 50% revenue being driven by maintenance doses by the end of 2018. In the fourth quarter and for the year, approximately 20% of U.S. SPINRAZA units were dispensed to our free drug program highlighting our goal that no patient will forego treatment because of financial limitation or an insurance denial in the U.S. We believe U.S. inventory levels for SPINRAZA were relatively flat in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. And in the U.S. we signed increased discounts allowance for SPINRAZA of a couple of 100 basis points to approximately 16%. We expect this rate to similarly increase over 2018 as we are seeing increasing utilization by Medicaid patients and purchasing from 340B hospitals. In the U.S. over 20% of SPINRAZA patients currently on therapy are over the age of 17 and increased from last quarter. A key strategic priority for us is to activate older patients through expanded patient and physician engagement. Outside the U.S. we more than doubled the number of commercial patients on therapy versus the prior quarter to 990 with approximately 35% of these patients transition from expanded access program or EAP. As a result, approximately 280 patients are still active in EAP as of the end of the fourth quarter. It\u2019s important to note that those patients transitioned from this program may have already completed most of their loading doses. The largest contributors to the ex-U.S. SPINRAZA revenues in Q4 were Germany, Turkey and Japan, which accounted for over two-thirds of the ex-U.S. revenues. We continue to be very encouraged by the up-tick of SPINRAZA outside of the U.S. in terms of country approvals, speed of adoption and penetration levels. In 2018, we expect growth from SPINRAZA in the U.S., but expect a larger portion of the revenue growth to come from outside the U.S. Let me now move on to our biosimilars business, which generate $122 million in revenue this quarter more than doubling year-over-year. Full year biosimilar revenues were $380 million, growing nearly fourfold versus 2016. We anticipate that increased biosimilar competition will result in further price erosion, but we still expect double-digit increases in revenue in 2018. Turning to our anti-CD20 revenues, we recorded $415 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 31% versus prior year primarily driven by the OCREVUS royalties. Full year anti-CD20 revenues were $1.6 billion, a 19% increase versus 2016. Within anti-CD20 revenues our estimate OCREVUS royalties were $77 million for the fourth quarter and $159 million for the full year. Although we do expect OCREVUS royalty continue to grow, we anticipate total anti-CD20 revenue growth to slow in 2018 versus what we saw in 2017 driven by the anniversarying on the OCREVUS launch in the second quarter of 2018 and the full year impact of a lower profit share percentage for RITUXAN. Total other revenues were $180 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of $129 million versus $51 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by greater contract manufacturing. Other revenues were $360 million for the full year, a 14% increase versus 2016. In 2018, we continue \u2013 we expect continued growth in contract manufacturing similar to the growth in full year 2017 but the exact amounts maybe lumpy over the quarters. Let me now turn to gross margin performance. Q4 gross margin was 85% which was negatively impacted by the disproportionate increase in contract manufacturing of biosimilars as well as a write-off of approximately $20 million of ZINBRYTA assets including inventory. Full year gross margin was 87%, slightly lower than in 2016. Q4 R&D expense was 18% of revenue or $588 million. This included $78 million of expense related to Alkermes and $25 million with Ionis due to recently announced business development transactions. Full year GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense were both 18% of revenue or $2.3 billion. Q4 GAAP SG&A was 17% of revenue or $572 million. Q4 non-GAAP SG&A was also 17% of revenue at $554 million. Full year GAAP SG&A was 16% of sales or $1.9 billion and non-GAAP SG&A was 15% of revenue at $1.9 billion. Both GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A increase versus the prior quarter due to the timing of spend as well as certain investments across sales and marketing, worldwide medical and G&A. We do expect slight relief in core OpEx in the first quarter 2018 with the gradual decline as we move throughout the year. Other net expense, which includes interest, was $66 million in the fourth quarter which was impacted by a $17 million charge to markdown marketable securities as we prepare to move our offshore cash back to the U.S. Other net expense was $250 million for the full year. Our expectations for other net expense in 2018 are lower due to less debt outstanding and higher interest rates on cash balances. In the fourth quarter our GAAP tax rate was approximately 112% as we booked a GAAP charge of $1.2 billion related to the recently enacted U.S. corporate tax reform legislation. In Q4 our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 29%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were impacted by $42 million and $50 million respectively related to the one-time ZINBRYTA charge. For the full year, our GAAP tax rate was approximately 48% and our non-GAAP Tax rate was roughly 25%. In 2018 we expect the underlying run rate for our tax rates to be \u2013 benefit by approximately 200 basis points as a result of U.S. tax reform with further benefit in 2019 and beyond. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximate 212 million for the quarter and 230 million for the full year which now brings us the diluted earnings per share. In the fourth quarter we booked the GAAP loss of $1.40 per share and non-GAAP earnings of $5.26 per share. For the full year, GAAP EPS was $11.92 and non-GAAP EPS with $21.81. GAAP EPS declined for Q4 2017 on the year-over-year basis driven by the $5.51 impact of tax reform, the $0.52 impact from our revised Neurimmune agreement, $0.34 impact for the Alkermes and Ionis deals and the $0.43 impact of the ZINBRYTA charge. Full year GAAP EPS decline versus 2016 due to the same factors as well as $1.08 impact from our deal with BMS and $0.48 impact from our deal with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. Non-GAAP EPS grew 4% for Q4 \u201817 despite the $0.34 impact from the Alkermes and Ionis deals and the 32% impact of ZINBRYTA charge. Non-GAAP EPS grew 8% for the full year 2017 versus prior year, despite the same factors as well as the $1.08 impact from our BMS. We ended the quarter with approximately $6.7 billion of cash and marketable securities. Let me now turn to our full year guidance for 2018. We expect revenues of approximately $12.7 billion to $13 billion which would represent year-over-year growth of 3.5% to 6%. We expect cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales to be consistent with our full-year 2017 cost of goods sold. We anticipate R&D expense between 16% and 17% of sales. Of note guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions as both are hard to predict. We expect SG&A expense to be approximately 15% to 16% of revenues. From a tax perspective, our guidance takes into account the impact of U.S. tax reform and we anticipate our GAAP tax rate for 2018 to be between 23.5% to 24.5% and our non-GAAP tax rate to be between 22.5% and 23.5%. We anticipate full year 2018 GAAP EPS results of $22.20 to $23.20 representing growth of 83% to 91% and non-GAAP EPS to be between $24.20 and $25.20 representing growth of 11% to 16%. From a quarterly perspective we expect non-GAAP EPS growth on year-over-year basis to be stronger in Q2 \u201818 and Q4 \u201818 due to the impact of business development events in 2017 and the factors described above. We believe the midpoint of the guidance ranges we have provided represents a reasonable base case. I will now turn the call over to Michel for his closing comments. Michel Vounatsos : Thanks Jeff. We are excited to have you on the team and I am glad to see that you are quickly coming up to speed on the business. I would like to conclude with these thoughts. When I spoke from the SIT a year ago, I told you we are refocusing the organization, building our new management team and developing a strategy and priorities for both short-term and long-term shareholder value creation. I stated that our actions would speak for themselves. 2017 was a very strong and successful year for Biogen and we delivered on the commitments we have made. For 2018 our goal is to continue this momentum and achieve our guidance. We have a well defined strategy to deliver near-term results and to maximize long-term value. We have an energized world-class executive team and key opportunities in front of us based on the significant unmet medical needs and breakthroughs we are seeing in neuroscience. We believe the risk level neuroscience is fundamentally challenging at this time and we believe Biogen is uniquely positioned to leading the space based on our core capabilities and intense focus. Looking forward to leading the next 12 months to 18 months where we have several meaningful readouts across our neuroscience pipeline including natalizumab stroke BIIB098 in MS, BIIB054 in Parkinson\u2019s disease, BIIB074 for painful lumbosacral radiculopath, BAN2401 in Alzheimer's disease, BIIB067 for ALS and our gene therapy program for XLRS. Before we go into Q&A, I would like to thank our employees around the world who are dedicated to making the positive impacts on patients\u2019 lives and all of the physicians can give us and participants in our clinical development programs. In 2018, Biogen celebrates its 40th anniversary. Our past and future achievements could not be realized without the passion and commitment. With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Yee of Jefferies. Your line is open. Michael Yee : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Congrats on a great quarter. Appreciate the question. Maybe a question for Michel, obviously, you have seen a ton of M&A going on in the space over the last 6 to 12 months and it\u2019s turning up maybe you could just remind us about how you think about your strategic M&A plans and how you think about whether neurology, aware of neurology you could go and whether there are other larger market opportunities outside of neurology that you can look at? How you think about the landscape now? Thanks. MichelVounatsos: So, I will initiate the answer and then my colleagues will add. Long-term value generation is the strategic focus and we have communicated that. And for that, we said we shipped some of the capital allocation to enrich the pipeline. And I am pleased with what we have done in 2017 and what we have continuing to do in \u201818. I don\u2019t see a frenzy of increase of because of more cash. I see strategic intent, science, scientific rationale first, patents and ordered and financial rigor in order to rationalize any move from the company. We are contemplating early assets, which remains the sweet spot, the sweet spot where we can add tremendous value because of the capability that we have and the focus. We are contemplating larger assets as you can imagine, but I will stop here and I will let Jeff comment, it\u2019s important as the new CFO and Mike from the therapy point of view. Jeff Capello : Thanks, Michel. It\u2019s a good question. What I say would be I think we laid out for the investor community at the JPMorgan Conference an illustrative view of how much capacity we have from a capital perspective and that concluded both cash on hand at the end of the second, third quarter rather leverage taking the leverage of the company up to 2x less the leverage we have today plus cash flow for the next 5 years. And if you put all those factors together, I am assuming a flat business, which we obviously don\u2019t expect. We get a $37 billion number, which gives us a lot of capacity to add to the business. And I think our focus is on that \u2013 is on growing the business continuing to be active in early stage, but also hopefully being active in mid to late stage assets to bring in things that are closer to revenue. Having said that, we also expect to be able to return cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchase, I think we have ample flexibility for that, but we will be disciplined and we will look for those opportunities that fit strategically, scientifically, that fit with the operations and fit in our core areas. So, we expect this to be active, but disciplined. Michael Ehlers : The only thing I would add to that, Michael, is just reemphasize that really our approach is a blended one considering pipeline additions and larger opportunities as Jeff said where the strategy and science makes sense and where we really feel that Biogen can track the maximum value. Operator : Our next question comes from Umer Raffat of Evercore. Your line is open. Umer Raffat : Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to focus on a couple of R&D topics if I may. First on TYSABRI stroke, I am curious your expectations for the 600 mg dose arm on the primary endpoint as well as how you think about the more \u2013 the longer time from stroke onset to have the role on the primary endpoint? And then separately, when I look at your slide on readouts for this year, one thing I noticed is your partner Alkermes had mentioned they will have data from the head-to-head study versus TECFIDERA at least for the 100 patients in early 2018 is what they had guided to for the readout over the course of last year. And I was curious if you have that data in-house anything you are seeing from that? Thank you. Michael Ehlers : Yes, Umer, thanks. Let me take a couple of these here. So, what I would say is starting with the TYSABRI stroke setting, one reason why we are very interested in this study is the fact that we are assessing potential clinical benefit up to 24 hours after the stroke instant. This would obviously be a substantial change to standard of care [indiscernible] out there is for TPA and a thrombolytic really only approved in 4 hours to 5 hours after the stroke. So this would be significant. And we think that it makes sense in terms of the known pathophysiology of acute ischemic stroke where in the period after the infarct you have got this period of intense brain inflammation that\u2019s associated with poor clinical outcomes. And we are testing two different doses or perhaps you were getting at which is to see whether or not there is any dose dependent difference in clinical benefit. First, we will have to wait for the data and as always these are Phase 2 clinical studies and we will have to see what it shows, but where to be positive we think that this would represent a significant advance. On the question on the Alkermes BIIB098 MMF, this is something that which we are still evaluating and what we said is that we do anticipate an ability to file this year. We have not made the determination exactly when data will be presented out of that, but that\u2019s something that we are working through with Alkermes. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is open. Geoff Meacham : Good morning guys and thanks for the question. Just have a few quick ones, for Jeff is there a tipping point in the biosimilars business that would make the option for the JV more attractive and I am assuming that the status quo is assumed in 2018 guidance. And then for Michel just to ask the bus dev question another way, if you had to choose the priority would it be to diversify pipeline risk say over the longer term or more to augment P&L growth say in the next few years? Thank you. Jeff Capello : Okay. Let me start with the biosimilars question. So we were pleased with the performance in the fourth quarter. And as we looked out through next year and there on I think that business is well-positioned. As you pointed we do have an option to buy in more to that business and I think that would be our intent. And then we continue to look at it strategically in terms of what would fit with our core operations going forward. Michel Vounatsos : And concerning your second part of the question we are not on the burning platform, we are doing reasonably well in terms of top line momentum as you can see. Obviously, there is a binary event that we all know and should we find a late stage that is aligned and meets the criteria that were alluded by the team here will be very interested. So, science will be the key driver, the ability to create value that nobody else will be able and alignment to the strategies that we brought in. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of Leerink. Your line is open. Geoffrey Porges : Thank you very much. And Jeff maybe just a few kind of questions just on the P&L, because your margins certainly bounced around compared to prior periods, first you alluded to the gross margin effect of the high contract manufacturing, should we be modeling that the gross margin is going to so trend in the direction of the Q4 performance going forward, because of the contribution of that in the biosimilars mix to your overall revenue. And then secondly you talked about the SG&A spike in Q4 and that was significantly higher than we had anticipated, could you give us a little bit of color to the contributing factors to that spike and how that might continue going forward as we update our models? Thanks. Jeff Capello : Sure. Well, good questions. So first question, gross margins went down Q3 to Q4 from like 88% down to 85%. Two factors drove that, the first was our significant growth in corporate partner revenue, it increased significantly from the third and fourth quarter and that has much lower gross margin. I would say that contributed about two-thirds of the impact of the gross margin erosion sequentially. The other third was the roughly $20 million inventory charge we took at ZINBRYTA. And as we look forward to next year, gross margin quarter-by-quarter although it\u2019s difficult to predict excess and obsolescence charges, we obviously don\u2019t expect that charge to recur per se. And we also expect to have less corporate partner revenue for the quarters for next year and the margin to be slightly better. So both of those things will abate and we expect our margins to kind of get back to the 87% range. So we are pretty comfortable with that by quarter for gross margins. On the question of SG&A, you are correct that the SG&A rate did increase quite a bit sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter. There is really four factors that drove that. One was just basic expenses that ended up moving in from the first quarter of \u201818 to the fourth quarter which were known. The second impact were investments with regard to our SMA business. We are very happy and pleased with the growth, but we are investing in it. The third factor was year end bonus true-ups and other benefit true-ups which were typical the fourth quarter. And then the fourth component were fees and services for projects. So what we think happens here is the rate comes back down as we look at kind of going forward it will kind of \u2013 it will get back into kind of the our guidance range. So we think the fourth quarter is a little bit of an aberration and it will settle back down. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Schmidt of Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Eric Schmidt : Thanks for all the added transparency on SPINRAZA and some of the other numbers. Maybe for Jeff on SPINRAZA you spoke to faster ex-U.S. growth in 2018, is that going to be a function of existing geographies, putting more patients on the drug or will be driven by more newer territories coming online and when you think about SPINRAZA kind of big picture, could this be a franchise similar to other orphan franchises where maybe as much as two-thirds of the total peak revenue is outside the U.S.? Thanks. Michel Vounatsos : So, I will get started Eric, and then Jeff would come. So we are very pleased with the momentum that we see here, ex-U.S. also in the U.S. where we foresee continuous growth. But you know the most urgent to treat patients, the 70% achievements from the age 0 to 2, somehow is done and now we move into the year the biggest strata. Ex-U.S. a significant opportunity and as Jeff said 70% approximately of the results to-date are generated by three markets. So, we still have a long way to go in terms of reimbursement that we are currently negotiating and also NPP that emerges from geographies that were non-anticipated, so still a long way to go ex-U.S. Jeff Capello : Yes. I would just add that we are really pleased with the performance. I think European team has done a really good job and they are poised to kind of do even better in 2018, as we look at the countries, we have got \u2013 countries kind of lined up and we expect increased growth from the existing countries as well new countries coming on. So I think that the business is really well-positioned for 2018 in Europe as well as the U.S. Michel Vounatsos : So just to add to that, we are proved in 34 markets, reimbursed in 14 and we still have to 280 patients on early access program. Matt Calistri : We are ready for the next question. I want to remind please keep it to one question. I know there is a lot of people in the queue, so please keep it to one question. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Matthew Harrison : Great, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask on your SMA gene therapy product, what are the steps that you have to take to get that started by the middle of the year and can you talk about potential differentiation versus the existing SMA gene therapy product that\u2019s in the clack? Thanks. Michael Ehlers : Yes. Thanks. Thanks Matthew. So I mean steps to be taken I think these are lot of the known in standard steps, essentially about trial design, material preparation, site activation, etcetera. So there is \u2013 there are no kind of surprises in the steps to get to the clinic here, but things that we consider are also lot of known things. As we are designing this, which are the patient subset, way to delivery, we think a lot about manufacturing. We think a lot about the safety features for these agents, still early days across the space in gene therapy, so we think a lot about that. And all of those can be elements of differentiation. Another thing that we are spending a lot of time contemplating is how we would want to be able to demonstrate clinical benefit and the potential space for a gene therapy where we think there is a lot of opportunity together with SPINRAZA. Operator : Your next question comes from Alethia Young of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Alethia Young : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, just one unrelated to like ALS in the Karyopharm and putting it together of what you are doing with Ionis if you can just talk about kind of the strategic vision there with the ALS opportunity? Thanks. Michael Ehlers : Yes, Alethia, thanks for the question. So, the Karyopharm compound is pretty interesting one. This is very early, it\u2019s a preclinical, but we will get it to the clinic this year. It\u2019s inhibitor of XPO1. This is a key component of nuclear export and they had done a lot of collaborative work, very nice scientific work showing that this could reduce the hallmark pathology of sporadic ALS, which is the cytoplasmic accumulation of these toxic RNA binding proteins like TDP-43 and FUS, which undergo unclear export that can be blocked at this way. So, the hypothesis is that this could be an oral drug potentially for sporadic ALS. This really complements our ASO programs with Ionis that are really targeting initially genetic forms of ALS like the SOD1 mutant ALS, which is a subset. So, we have got very complementary modalities, completely orthogonal mechanisms and potentially distinct clinical populations. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Ying Huang : Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. Just want to ask one of SPINRAZA U.S. new patient adds, it seems that in 4Q added 420 patients, it\u2019s a step down from 3Q. I was wondering is it because of our seasonality you expected to go back to let\u2019s say 500 per quarter level or what\u2019s the outlook for 2018 new patients out in the U.S.? Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : So, I will get started and Jeff will come in. So, first Q4, there were lot of holidays. Okay, so we need to take that into account and it is expected that the suitable proportion of the later onset has complicated spine and therefore it takes more time to dose those patients. So, this is a trend that we need to get used to even if we work at helping the provider community to dose better with devices etcetera. So, we are come to start out the patients where there is a bit less urgency to treat and some of them have more complicated spine. Jeff will add. Jeff Capello : Yes. And the only thing I would add to that, I would agree with that would be just getting the infrastructure up and running the number of sites people trained to kind of handle the increased volume that will take time. So, I think it\u2019s a combination of both getting the more difficult to treat patients and getting the infrastructure ramped up. Michel Vounatsos : The epidemiology is still there. We have 9,000 patients and we still have a long way to go. We increased the team. So, we are getting in there step by step and there is a long queue of patients that are waiting. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Raymond of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Chris Raymond : Thanks. I am just on the SPINRAZA discounting and allowances I think that you called out, just doing some quick math on the patients and the dose per patient \u2013 doses per patient that you guys callout in your numbers. I don\u2019t really see a step down in the \u2013 essentially in the revenue per dose quarter-on-quarter. Can you maybe sort of square that a little bit and talk about what\u2019s really going on with respect to discounting allowances? Thanks. Michael Ehlers : Yes, I am not sure we are going to be able to do the math real-time for you, it\u2019s fairly complicated, but what we did experience just to reiterate is that we did have a little bit of an uptick in the fourth quarter and discounts and allowances by about a couple of 100 basis points as we sell into more 340B hospitals and the Medicaid mix kind of increases. So that is happening and we expect that to happen into next year, it\u2019s kind of hard to do the math real-time on your numbers, but we can certainly take that offline. Operator : Your next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Citigroup. Your line is open. Robyn Karnauskas : Hi, guys. Thank you. I was wondering if you could talk a little about how the price increases for MS and FX contributed to your 2018 guidance and then what element is just growth? Thanks. Michael Ehlers : Okay. So, from a price perspective, I think the people are aware, I will talk to the U.S. first that we took prices up about, little bit more than 8%, some products a little bit less than that in others. So, we expect to get kind of some price drop through. We do expect as we commented the gross to net or discounts in a while just to go up. So, we won\u2019t probably fall through as much as we had historically, but we will still get some kind of pricing increases. Volume will be a little bit pressured in the first half of the year as we complete the anniversarying of the OCREVUS launch after which in the second half volume will come back a little bit more. So, that\u2019s a little bit with regard to the U.S. dynamics. Outside the U.S., we expect to continue to see pretty good growth in unit volume across most of the major European countries. We will have kind of OCREVUS coming in across some of the countries slowly, so there will be a little bit of a headwind. We still expect to grow and then price will maybe be down a little bit across Europe. So, that kind of if you put all that together you get to kind of the low single-digit kind of contraction of the business. And then the factor we have of course is the interferon class is continuing to get again some headwind as a result of people moving away from that class a bit and we are doing our best to kind of stem that. Hopefully, that\u2019s helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Terence Flynn : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a follow-up on your gene therapy, Mike, you talked about some of the differentiated features, but are you willing at this point to give us anymore details with respect to either the vector you guys are using or the route of delivery and how you are thinking about initial trial designs? Thanks. Michael Ehlers : Yes, I know, thanks for the question. This is not something that which we are talking about yet. I just want to highlight that these are key elements of our considerations for designing study. And I think it will be a general feature for a lot of AAV base gene therapy efforts. It\u2019s still kind of early days to know this. And like I mentioned, the long-term safety profile and how that relates to route of administration transduction efficiency, patient subtype etcetera is what we are working through and those together with the development paths it might contemplate a position along with SPINRAZA we believe are all potential elements of differentiation. Operator : Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Cory Kasimov : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess for BIIB089 so formerly ALKS 8700, what type of clinical profile do you need to see relative to TECFIDERA to be confident this product is differentiated and if it ultimately is what are your early thoughts about the potential commercial strategy for that product? Thanks. Michael Ehlers : Yes, I will start on the clinical side and then see if Michel or Jeff want to jump in on the commercial differentiation and by the way it\u2019s BIIB098 not BIIB089. Cory Kasimov : Oh, sorry about that. Michael Ehlers : For those taking notes memorizing. So, look I think the profile here that we are looking at is to see whether or not this is different fumarate pro drug has a different profile in terms of GI tolerability. This is something which we will play out in trial designs in looking at adverse events and ultimately probably will play out in the real world setting. So we are looking at that as kind of a potential clinical differentiator and that will be based on the data that we see. Ultimately the head-to-head comparison may allow us to get a better feeling for that. It may also end up, but this will have to play out in the real world setting. Michel Vounatsos : Yes. As Mike said so the priority is certainly on the better tolerability profile. We did suffer on the GI discontinuation on track even if we did improve a couple of points. There is still a long way go the oral market of the MS TMTs is going much faster than the other segments. So we will be able to expand the big franchise there. And with the longer patent life, this opens plenty of opportunities beyond the priority that we just spoke about. Operator : Our final question comes from Carter Gould of UBS. Your line is open. Carter Gould : Right. Good morning, guys and congrats on a successful 2017. From Michael, just following up on the earlier comments on TYSABRI and stroke, how do you think about the hurdle for potentially moving that into Phase 3 given clearly need, but balanced by the [indiscernible] we have seen with prior assets that had encouraging initial data? Thank you. Michael Ehlers : Yes. I think it\u2019s a valid point, Carter. I mean this is one of the reasons why we have spent a lot of time really thinking about this. I mean our belief is that just the world has changed in terms of the ability to really conduct and evaluate the stroke to trials and the kinds of quantitative endpoints that you can really apply. And there is a lot of reasons for that I think one macro reasons that people have learned how to conduct is better with the advent of endovascular thrombectomies, trials are actually working now. So there is a lot more refinements just in the execution of these trials and the other thing is that we are looking at this with eyes wide open and the totality of our action one and action two studies. And so based on the data we obtain from action one, we have revised our study design and our endpoint selection. And so we do think that out of this study the data that we will get, we will be able to know whether or not the clinical benefit that we saw across action one and action two whether it\u2019s real or not. And it has to be real for us to take it into the Phase 3. Operator : That was our final question today. I will return the call to our presenters. Michel Vounatsos : So, thank you all for your attention and support to our great company. Thank you. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Dan and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen First Quarter 2018 Financial Results and Business Update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Matt Calistri, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Matt Calistri : Thanks, Dan. Thank you and welcome to Biogen's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the Risk Factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Michael Ehlers, EVP of Research and Development; and our CFO, Jeff Capello. Before I conclude, I would also like to note that starting with the Q2 2018 earnings call we will post press releases related to future earnings calls, materials, and Investor Events on the Investors section of Biogen's website, www.biogen.com, and issue statement on Twitter when they become available. We will do this instead of publishing press releases related to future earnings calls, earnings releases, and Investor Events via Newswire services. Our Twitter handle is @biogen. Now, I will turn the call over to Michel. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you, Matt. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. First, let me begin with some financial highlights. Biogen started 2018 with first quarter revenues of $3.1 billion. On an apples-to-apples basis, excluding hemophilia, revenues grew 15% versus the same period a year ago. Including hemophilia, revenue grew 11%. First quarter 2018 GAAP earnings were $5.54 a share, a 60% increase versus the same period a year ago, and non-GAAP EPS was $6.05, a 16% increase versus the same period a year ago. We are pleased with our double-digit top-line and bottom-line growth. Our new management team is taking meaningful action to secure our long-term leadership in neuroscience, including strong execution on our core business, a renewed focus on business development, ramping up our internal R&D productivity, and implementing an enhanced operating model designed for the future. Now let me review the solid progress we made in the first quarter. First, our MS core business including OCREVUS royalties delivered revenues of $2.1 billion. Globally, our core franchise remained resilient as reflected by continued growth in number of MS patients and new staffs on Biogen therapy. In the U.S., the good news is that we saw improving demand of our MS products and our discontinuations remain relatively stable. However, we saw the usual seasonality and a larger than expected inventory drawdown. Outside of the U.S., our volumes grew in our priority markets and we continued our strong progress in the emerging markets. Overall, these performance is in line with our expectations, but there are some puts and takes that Jeff will discuss in more detail. We remain absolutely committed to our MS business and we are furthering our lifecycle management initiatives by advancing the development of BIIB098 with our partner Alkermes. We have planned to file for regulatory approval in the U.S. later this year. By initiating efficacy studies and further data generation for the expanded internal dosing for TYSABRI, as we build on the data presented at ECTRIMS. By beginning the development of PLEGRIDY IM as another potential convenient and efficacious options to bolster our market-leading interferon franchise and by continuing to pursue Opicinumab as a potential remyelination therapy. Second, SPINRAZA, the only approved medicine for SMA, with global revenues of $364 million. The number of patients on SPINRAZA grew to approximately 4,100, an increase of over 25% from last quarter and Jeff will be providing more details on this performance. Overall, worldwide SPINRAZA performance was slightly ahead of our expectations, as lower than expected U.S. uptake in the adult segment was offset by stronger than anticipated performance ex-U.S. We will continue to focus our efforts and resources on the more than 5,000 untreated pediatric and other patients in the U.S. and even greater number of untreated patients outside of U.S. that we believe will benefit from SPINRAZA. In the U.S., we believe we have those more than half of incense and close to half of pediatric patients where we believe much more opportunity remains. At the end of the first quarter approximately 25% of patients treated in the U.S. were adults, 18 years or older, an increase from 20% last quarter. We believe this is very encouraging trend particularly now that we have expanded our sales team and can dedicate more resources and efforts to the large pediatric and other segment of the SMA population. Outside of the U.S., we continue to expand access and we are now treating over 1,800 patients. We believe the rapid and sequential reimbursement approvals and future launches are critical to achieve our long-term goals. I'm especially proud of our team's success securing reimbursement in an additional seven markets, meaning we now have reimbursement in 24 countries of which 17 achieved formal reimbursement and seven have individual case-by-case reimbursement. We now have formal reimbursements over 400 million covered lives ex-U.S. and we expect to receive formal reimbursement in at least seven more countries by the end of 2018. In summary, beyond the seasonality and channel dynamics, our core MS business continue to be resilient and we continue to see significant future growth potential for SPINRAZA. Third, we expanded further our neuroscience pipeline and capabilities. We added BIIB104 a Phase 2 asset for neuropsychiatry and we entered into an exclusive 10-year collaboration agreement with Ionis that we believe will differentiate Biogen as the leader in developing ASO-therapies for neurological diseases. We believe our exclusive access with Ionis market-leading ASO platform for the CNS is a remarkable competitive advantage that has the potential to generate a steady flow of transformative medicine into our pipeline. Our cash generation remains very strong and continues to provide us with significant optionality and flexibility in terms of capital allocation. Importantly, and as we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to maximizing returns over the long-term for our shareholders something that demands a thoughtful approach towards all our investment. As you can see, our newly aligned management team is implementing our updated strategy and delivering noticeable results. We remain highly focused on implementing well on both our MS and SMA core businesses. We are working to create a leaner and simpler operating model and we are strategically allocating capital as we invest to develop and expand our neuroscience portfolio, again with the objective of maximizing shareholder returns. I will now turn the call over to Mike for a more detailed update on our recent progress in R&D. Michael Ehlers : Thank you, Michel, and good morning everyone. Last July, we communicated our vision for securing definitive leadership in neuroscience. This past quarter we have executed against our goal to meaningfully enhance our pipeline by adding or advancing five clinical stage programs, improving our research productivity, and bolstering our portfolio of pre-clinical assets. I'd like to talk about how we continued that momentum in the first quarter across our core and emerging growth areas. Starting with MS and neuroimmunology. This week we are presenting data at the 70th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology or AAN, which was also presented at ECTRIMS, regarding real world use of TYSABRI, and the potential impact of extended interval dozing on the risk of PML. A post-hoc analysis of data from the touch database supported an approximately 90% reduction in the risk of PML when taking TYSABRI using extended interval dosing as compared to the standard dosing. Based on these data, we're accelerating efforts to generate more data evaluated in the efficacy of alternate dosing. If this additional research supports a high level of efficacy with a lower risk of PML, we believe it would represent a significant advancement of the treatment of MS. This builds on our broader risk stratification efforts for TYSABRI including the use of JCV index values. Earlier this month, the FDA approved an updated label highlighting the association between index values and the risk of PML. Further, Alkermes will be presenting data at AAN from the EVOLVE-MS-1 study which is a Phase 3 open label long-term study of our partnered monomethyl fumarate prodrug BIIB98 in patients with relapsing remitting MS with 528 patients enrolled to-date. In a one-year interim analysis of exploratory efficacy endpoints, the annualized relapse rate in patients treated with BIIB98 was 0.16 and there was a significant reduction in number of gadolinium positive lesions from baseline to year one. These preliminary results for annualized relapse rate and MRI parameters support BIIB98 as a potential oral treatment option for patients with relapsing remitting MS. Alkermes is planning to file with the FDA by the end of the year. In other areas of MS, given their well characterized efficacy and safety profile, and many years of patient experience, we believe that interferon therapies will continue to play an important role for MS patients. To that end, and as Michel mentioned, we are pleased to announce plans to develop an intramuscular formulation of PLEGRIDY with the goal of reducing injection site reactions, ultimately with the aim of delivering a therapy with safety and tolerability comparable to AVONEX with the efficacy and dosing convenience of PLEGRIDY. Finally, we continue to advance the Phase 2b study of opicinumab as the potentially transformative therapy for many MS patients by promoting remyelination with the goal of improving pre-existing disability. All of these are examples of how we continue to innovate, aspire to create new options for MS patients, and aim to maintain our long-term leadership position in MS. We believe our current MS portfolio uniquely benefits patients across the full spectrum of the disease and we are committed to pursuing new advancements to address the remaining unmet needs of MS patients. I'll now turn to our progress in Alzheimer disease and dementia. We continue to advance our leading Alzheimer's portfolio with multiple assets across complementary modalities and pathways, including the industry's most advanced program targeting beta amyloid. We presented a new analysis of the Phase 1b prime study of aducanumab at AAN. In the 10-milligram per kilogram group aducanumab demonstrated up to 71% reduction in amyloid back on the centelloid scale a method used to standardize pep results. This is the largest degree of plaque reduction ever observed in the field. We believe each new analysis of the Phase 1b data reinforces aducanumab's position as the most advanced potential disease modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease across the industry. Also targeting beta-amyloid, BAN2401, the A beta antibody currently being developed by our collaboration partner Eisai is continuing to the final 18 month readout in the third quarter of this year and the BACE inhibitor elenbecestat continues to recruit in Phase 3 studies also being inducted by our collaboration partner Eisai. Beyond A beta, we believe that Tau plays an important and complementary role in Alzheimer's disease pathology and we are advancing a suite of Tau assets. We have begun screening patients in the Phase 2 Alzheimer's disease trial of BIIB092, the anti-tau antibody we license from BMS last year and we expect data from the Phase 1 study of BIIB076 another anti-tau antibody by the end of this year. Further, our first-in-class Tau antisense Oligonucleotide BIIB080 is advancing in Phase 1 studies. Turning to neuromuscular disorders, we made significant progress in our strategic priority of spinal muscular atrophy. In March, we presented important new data for SPINRAZA at the Muscular Dystrophy Association Clinical Conference. New interim Phase 2 results from NURTURE studying pre-symptomatic infants with SMA showed that all infants treated with SPINRAZA were alive did not require permanent ventilation and showed improvement in motor function and motor milestone achievements compared to the decline normally seen over the course of the disease. All NURTURE participants achieved the age expected WHO motor milestone of sitting without support. We also presented a case series of five SPINRAZA treated patients with SMA Type 2 or 3 between the ages of 17 and 19 upon their last visit, showing stable or improved motor function and improved quality of life. These data are important and support the clinical value of SPINRAZA for older patients who represent the majority of the current prevalence of the disease. We aim to continue to build on the body of data in this patient population over time. At AAN this week, we are presenting interim results from the SHINE open-label extension study for patients who have transitioned from the ENDEAR study demonstrating long-term benefits for infantile-onset SMA in terms of both improved motor function and longer event free survival. And in collaboration with Columbia University, we are also presenting a case study of 14 later onset patients between the ages of two and 15 showing that with SPINRAZA treatment they were able to walk longer distances, while experiencing decreases in fatigue. In February, the end of study results from the SPINRAZA Phase 3 CHERISH study were published in The New England Journal of Medicine, another important acknowledgement of the unprecedented benefits that SPINRAZA provides to later onset patients. Biogen remains committed to advancing the standard of care in SMA beyond SPINRAZA. We continue to advance our genetherapy program in collaboration with University of Pennsylvania with study initiation expected in the middle of the year. But we are not stopping there. We believe that the future treatment landscape may involve combination for sequential therapy across different modalities. We have heard reports that seven of the 15 patients in AveXis Phase 1 gene therapy study have subsequently gone on to SPINRAZA, suggesting that clinical experience to-date may support the utility of ASOs in combination with gene therapy. Sequential or additive benefits of gene therapy in ASOs could include additive effects on protein levels on a per cell basis, complementary distribution and transduction across the CNS, and durability and stability of Episomal transgene expression. These are some of the reasons we are actively pursuing a strategy to evaluate SPINRAZA in combination with gene therapy, but simply, we do not believe the gene therapy will replace ASOs but rather provide a complementary modality. Moving to our progress and movement disorders. At AAN, we are presenting Phase 1 data for BIIB054, our anti-alpha-synuclein antibody for Parkinson's disease. BIIB054 demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetics as well as a safety and tolerability profile which support advancement into the ongoing Phase 2 trial. At AAN, we're also presenting Phase 1 data for anti-tau antibody BIIB092 in progressive supranuclear palsy which was well tolerated and demonstrated reductions in CSF pre-tau levels of over 90%. We laid the foundation for our entry in neuropsychiatry this quarter, with our agreement to acquire Phase 2b ready AMPA receptor potentiator now called BIIB104 from Pfizer. This transaction has now closed. BIIB104 is a first-in-class molecule initially targeting cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia or CIAS, a devastating aspect of schizophrenia with no current treatment options. We believe BIIB104 has compelling data from a number of distinct early clinical studies demonstrating functional circuit activation as measured by FMRI, treatment effects on relevant domains of cognition, and the potential for a favorable benefit risk profile. In particular, the multiple ascending dose study in stable subjects with schizophrenia demonstrated dose dependent effects on improvement from baseline to day 14 across multiple cognitive domains including working memory, short-term memory, verbal recall and reasoning. Importantly, we saw correlation to this clinical advocacy with plasma exposure. We believe this molecule is differentiated from prior compounds in the class due to its high potency and favorable PKPD profile which we believe allows for an improved therapeutic index. We plan to initiate a Phase 2b trial in CIAS by the end of the year in parallel to exploring additional studies across other indications supporting our core growth areas. Within acute neurology, we are excited about the potential for BIIB093, our first-in-class IV glibenclamide therapeutic targeting brain edema in large hemispheric infarcts. We plan to start our Phase 3 study in the middle of this year. We also recently initiated the Phase 2 study of natalizumab in drug resistant focal epilepsy and we dosed the first patient last month. Within neuropathic pain, we are advancing BIIB074 into Phase 3 for Trigeminal Neuralgia, the start of activities outside the U.S. in parallel to FDA engagement. We expect to dose the first patient by the end of the year. We have completed enrolment in the Phase 2 study of BIIB074 for Painful Lumbosacral Radiculopathy with data expected towards the end of the year and we've began screening patients in the Phase 2 trial of BIIB074 in small fiber neuropathy as we explore multiple potential indications. Given the high unmet medical needs of neuropathic pain patients especially in light of the growing opioid epidemic, we are excited to expand our pain portfolio with the recent initiation of a Phase 1 study for BIIB095, our second Nav 1.7 inhibitor. Within ophthalmology, our partner AGTC recently completed enrolment in the Phase 1/2 trial with it's AAV based gene therapy program for X-Linked Retinoschisis or XLRS. Top-line data are anticipated by Q4 with the final analysis at the 12-month time point. Last week, AGTC also dosed the first patient in the Phase 1/2 study in X-Linked's Retinitis Pigmentosa or XLRP. Underpinning all of our efforts across our core and emerging growth areas, is investing in core capabilities, platforms, and modalities to enhance our translational mission in neuroscience. To that end, last week we announced a new exclusive 10-year collaboration agreement with Ionis Pharmaceuticals to develop novel antisense oligonucleotide drug candidates for a range of neurological diseases. This partnership brings together the industry-leader in ASO drug discovery with the industry-leader in neuroscience drug development to create what we believe will be a powerful CNS genetic medicine engine. Based on our experience with SPINRAZA and other ASOs we have in development, we believe that Intrathecal ASOs may address many genetic diseases and genetic targets of the central nervous system including some pathways that were previously undruggable with small molecules and monoclonal antibodies. Given their ability to directly intervene at the genetic origin of disease, we believe ASO approaches have a higher probability of success than traditional modalities with a more efficient development path and greater potential speed to patients. We believe this collaboration solidifies a key pillar of our R&D strategy to become the leader in neuroscience. We aim to advance several SPINRAZA like drugs to patients in the future. Importantly ASOs are now validated as a transformative therapeutic modality for CNS in particular. Now with an industry-leading CNS ASO platform partnership secured, we further aim to build emerging synergistic modalities including gene therapy to further augment Biogen's leadership in neurological diseases. We see high complementarity for ASO therapeutics in gene therapy. Intrathecal ASOs can be well tolerated, exclusively selective, can up or down regulate gene expression, may be readily manufactured, may not be subject to immune surveillance, and exert effects that may be reversed based on drug pharmacokinetics. We further believe that a powerhouse ASO platform will significantly augment our overall approach to genetic diseases and targets of the CNS. Please refer to our webcast from Friday, April 20th, which is available on our website for more details on this new collaboration. Overall, we had a remarkably productive quarter across our pipeline in both our core and emerging growth areas and we aim to maintain this momentum through the rest of this year and beyond. I will now pass the call to Jeff. Jeff Capello : Thanks Mike. Good morning everyone. I'll now review our financial performance for the first quarter 2018, starting with revenues. As Michel mentioned earlier, results for the first quarter were largely in line with our expectations. Total revenue for Q1 were $3.1 billion growing 11% year-over-year or 15% excluding hemophilia. Let me now provide more detail on our MS franchise revenues. While the expensed seasonality and greater than anticipated inventory impacts in the U.S., we believe the fundamentals of the business are healthy across our portfolio as we continue to drive stability in the U.S. and strong growth outside the U.S. Global first quarter TECFIDERA revenues were $987 million, a 3% increase versus the prior year. This included revenues of $729 million in the U.S., a decrease of 3% versus Q1 2017, and $258 million outside the U.S., an increase of 25% versus the first quarter 2017. In the U.S. we saw an inventory drawdown of approximately $80 million. This compares to a drawdown of approximately $60 million in Q1 2017 thus driving a difference of $20 million year-over-year. Excluding this impact U.S. TECFIDERA revenues would have been stable versus Q1 of last year as net pricing increases offset the impact of OCREVUS. On a sequential basis, we saw stable U.S. volumes for TECFIDERA versus the prior year when accounting for the inventory dynamics, with improving demand generation trends within the quarter leading to increased share of new prescriptions and stable share of total prescriptions. In addition we were very pleased with TECFIDERA's performance outside the U.S. driven by strong year-over-year patient growth across each large European market and solid emerging market growth, particularly in Japan, where TECFIDERA has reached 16% market share in its first year in the market. We believe there is significant opportunity remaining for TECFIDERA outside the U.S., with continued momentum expected in Europe and further geographic expansion into new markets such as Latin America. Ex-U.S. TECFIDERA revenues benefited by approximately $12 million versus the prior year due to changes in foreign exchange rates, net of hedging. TYSABRI worldwide revenues were $462 million this quarter, a decrease of 15% versus the first quarter of 2017. This included $250 million in the U.S. and $212 million outside the U.S. In the U.S. revenues declined 18% versus prior year primarily due to the launch of OCREVUS and disproportionately higher gross to net charges driven by seasonality and timing. We saw stable U.S. volume for TYSABRI versus prior quarter with improving share of new prescriptions and stable share of total prescriptions. Outside the U.S. TYSABRI revenues decreased 11% versus the prior year. As a reminder, in Q1 2017 we reported a $45 million benefit following our agreement with the Italian National Medicines Agency, AIFA related to prior periods. Ex-U.S. TYSABRI revenues this quarter benefited by approximately $17 million versus the prior year due to changes in foreign exchange rates, net of hedging. TYSABRI patients increased in most major European markets versus the prior year along with strong double-digit patient growth in emerging markets. Interferon revenues including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY were $550 million during the first quarter, a decrease of 15% versus Q1 2017. This included $371 million in the U.S. and a $179 million in sales outside the U.S. In the U.S. we saw a decrease of Interferon inventory of approximately $50 million in Q1 2018 as compared to a decrease of $20 million, driving at $30 million delta year-over-year due to channel dynamics. Ex-U.S. Interferon revenues benefited by approximately $11 million versus the prior year due to changes in foreign exchange rate, net of hedging. Overall U.S. MS performance versus prior year was impacted by both the launch of OCREVUS and channel dynamics. Despite these factors our U.S. sales team demonstrates resilience in driving stability and underlying demand sequentially for TECFIDERA and TYSABRI. We expect both factors to be less significant on a year-over-year basis as we move throughout the year, but the potential benefit is if there was a channel build towards the end of the year, we are encouraged by the momentum we saw in underlying demand as we enter the second quarter. Let me now move on to SPINRAZA. Global first quarters SPINRAZA revenues were $364 million. This included a $188 million in the U.S. and a $176 million outside the U.S. We saw a 16% increase in the number of patients on therapy in the U.S. as compared to the end of the fourth quarter. However revenues decreased versus Q4 due to a lower rate of new patient starts, combined with the impact of a loading dose dynamics. We believe we have now worked through a good majority of the bowls of urgent, infant, and pediatric patients, we saw earlier in the launch and we continue to see significant growth opportunity in both pediatric and adult populations. We saw an increased contribution for maintenance doses as many patients have transitioned to dosing once every four months on a chronic basis. In the U.S. approximately 40% of SPINRAZA revenues in the first quarter were attributed to maintenance doses as compared to 25% in the fourth quarter. This correlates with a continued decline in the average doses per patient from 1.6 to 1.1 from Q4 last year to Q1 of this year. In the first quarter approximately 20% of U.S. SPINRAZA units were dispensed through a free drug program, highlighting our goal that no patient would forego treatment because of financial limitation or insurance denial in the U.S. We believe both inventory levels and discounts and allowances for SPINRAZA were relatively flat in the first quarter versus Q4 of last year. We continue to be encouraged by the opportunity to reach a large number of untreated pediatric and adult patients in the U.S. We expect to see stable U.S. revenues sequentially for the next couple of quarters but the potential inflection point by the end of the year as we remain focused on increasing our efforts around lead patient identification, reimbursement, and sales and marketing to reach older patients. Outside the U.S. a number of commercial SPINRAZA patients increased over 50% versus the prior quarter and there are still approximately 290 patients active in the expanded access program. We signed increasing contribution for multiple markets, which recently secured reimbursement with over two-thirds of ex-U.S. SPINRAZA revenues in the first quarter coming from Germany, Japan, Italy, and France. Overall we believe that the international opportunity for SPINRAZA is even greater than in the U.S. given the uniform epidemiology across geographies and the growing level of market access that can generate future growth momentum. Let me now move on to our Biosimilars business which generates $128 million in revenues this quarter nearly doubling versus prior year. We have seen continued steady market share gains across the large European markets following the rapid initial conversion in the Nordics. In addition to a continued expected uptick for BENEPALI, we believe the expected launch of IMRALDI in October this year will be an additional growth driver for our Biosimilars business going forward. In the coming months we plan to exercise our option to increase our equity stake in the Samsung Bioepis joint venture. We believe this is an attractive value creation opportunity. Turning to anti-CD20 revenues, we recorded $443 million in Q1 an increase of 30% versus the prior year primarily driven by OCREVUS royalties as well as a strong performance from RITUXAN. This includes our estimated OCREVUS royalties of $77 million for the first quarter. Total other revenues were $164 million in the first quarter an 83% increase versus Q1 2017 as we continued to benefit from greater contract manufacturing. Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 86% a slight improvement versus the fourth quarter due to lower contract manufacturing and the impact of the ZINBRYTA write-off last quarter. Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense was 16% of revenue or $497 million including approximately $13 million of trial closeout cost for ZINBRYTA. There were no meaningful milestone payments booked in the first quarter. The increase in R&D compared to Q1 2017 was principally driven by higher clinical trial costs as we invest to grow our product pipeline. In Q2 we expect report $75 million of GAAP in-process R&D expense related to the closing of our asset acquisition with Pfizer for BIIB104. We also expect to report the substantial majority of the $375 million upfront payment to Ionis as a both GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense along with the equity premium as GAAP only R&D. Q1 GAAP SG&A was 16% of revenue or $501 million. Q1 non-GAAP SG&A was also 16% of revenue at $498 million. As a percentage of revenues both GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A decreased versus the prior year primarily due to the timing of spend across sales and marketing and G&A. GAAP other net expense which includes interest was $41 million in first quarter versus $38 million in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP other net expense was $35 million in Q1 versus $38 million in Q1 of last year. In Q1 our GAAP tax rate was approximately 22% and our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 21% both benefiting by approximately 250 to 300 basis points versus the prior year to the recently enacted U.S. corporate tax reform legislation as well as expected closing of the Ionis transaction and mix of profits by geography. Our weighted average diluted share count for Q1 was approximately 212 million. We repurchased approximately 900,000 shares in Q1 for a total value of $250 million leaving $2.75 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization which now brings us to diluted earnings per share. In the first quarter we booked GAAP earnings of $5.54 per share, an increase of 60% versus last year and non-GAAP earnings of $6.05 per share, an increase of 16% versus last year. We generated approximately $1.5 billion of cash flow from operations for Q1 and ended the quarter with approximately $7.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, and $5.9 billion in debt. After repatriating $3.5 billion in Q1, approximately 85% of our cash is now held in U.S. We believe we have and we will continue to have ample capacity to execute meaningful future business development and M&A as well as return capital to shareholders. We will also continue to be disciplined in our approach and focused on value creation. I will now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you, Jeff. We closed the first quarter with solid double-digit revenue and earnings growth and with the momentum across our business that we anticipated. In line with our strategic priorities, we allocated capital to both invest in our differentiated pipeline and opportunistically return capital to shareholders. We do not intend to pose or slowdown here. We believe there will be plenty more we can accomplish through the rest of 2018. Looking forward within the next 12 months, we expect further progress across our neuroscience pipeline, including completing enrolment of aducanumab, dosing the first patient with our gene therapy for SMA, data readouts across MS, Alzheimer's, neuropathic pain of thermology and ALS, initiation of Phase 3 studies in stroke and neuropathic pain, and filing for regulatory approval in the U.S. for BIIB098 in MS. Overall, as we have communicated in the past, our goal is to secure the long-term growth potential of Biogen beyond just aducanumab. We believe we have made progress between the potential 2019 U.S. launch of BIIB098, the potential launch of late-stage assets for stroke, PSP, neuropathic pain in the early 2020s, and our continued progress to bolster our early and mid-stage pipeline but we clearly have more work to do to achieve this goal. Importantly, and for the long-term growth of Biogen, we are focused on our eight priority markets with the U.S. remaining the most significant driver. However, as we execute on our strategy and selectively expand our global footprint, we are seeing evidence that there is likely more long-term growth opportunity than we expected in the EU and in the emerging markets. Our MS volumes continue to grow outside of the U.S. and it is still an under-diagnosed disease in many developed countries. Our Biosimilars business in Europe is now tracking at a potential run rate of at least $0.5 billion a year and we plan to launch IMRALDI in October of this year. SPINRAZA is paving the way for Biogen to establish a presence in selected new geographies which will support further global growth. In the first quarter, our ex-U.S. product revenues were $986 million, an increase of over 30% from the same period a year ago, and we have recently opened affiliate in China, Korea, Taiwan, and Colombia. Finally, I want to reiterate our commitment to maximizing returns to our shareholders over the long-term. This demands that we continue to allocate capital efficiently, effectively, and appropriately. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will always strive to have an optimal capital structure as well as aim for superior returns from the investments we make. I would like to thank our employees around the world who have dedicated to making a positive impact on patient's life and all of the physicians, caregivers and participants in our clinical development programs. Next month, Biogen will be celebrating its 40th Anniversary. Our past and future achievements could not be realized without the passion and commitment. With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question today comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat : Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to focus on Alzheimer\u2019s for a minute maybe and your sample size estimation because of the higher variability and I guess my question is this, you added patients to the trial despite unless they are dropouts which implies to me that perhaps the higher variance has to do with the assumptions you made on both the trials both on the treatment of fact and perhaps also on variance so my question is where your assumptions on the placebo arm informed by prior trials that happened reported large ones or where they were informed by the Phase 1b data that you presented previously. Michael Ehlers : Yes, Umer, this is Mike. I'll take that. So essentially you're correct about this, let me clarify. The variability that was observed was and the powering of the study was initially designed based on our known data in the Phase 1b prime data study as well as other previously conducted studies so both were contributing to our estimation to that. Of course it's always an estimation of the variability that we would expect to see and the blinded sample size readjustment was put in place in order to take care of the situation where I think our assumptions were not quite accurate. And that's what we found in this case where our assumptions as we had initially going again in were not exactly the same as the behavior that we were observing across the blinded sample size. So as a consequence we increased the sample size of the trial as a whole in order to preserve 90% power. Umer Raffat : Got it. And just to be clear when Lily ran their third trial they used higher end of the standard deviation and they basically took the higher standard deviation from the first two trials; is that a practice you had continued to implement as well? Michael Ehlers : Well, I mean we haven't gotten into that level of detail on exactly the statistics underlying our initial assumptions. But just for a little bit of perspective I mean this blinded sample size re-estimation as you know is a pretty standard method used in trials and we did the same thing actually an increase of sample size for both our TECFIDERA and PLEGRIDY trials and they were ongoing. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham : Hey guys good morning and thanks a lot for the questions. Just had a question on commercial SPINRAZA. I realize that trends can be lumpy on a sequential basis just given dosing but does like new starts moderate in the U.S. can you speak to the dynamics in the U.S. end of the market and then obviously OUS you do have some nice sequential growth and good new ads and maybe just speak to kind of where you are with respect to adoption in some of the major markets. Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : So thanks for the question. This is Michel. We don't see the start forms really at the tread line and we're working hard really to capture now the rest of the pediatric population and the adult population and these takes a bit more time than we anticipated. But if we step back, there was bolus of patients a year ago that were working for this only hope for treating SMA. And they came pretty fast to treatment and we have basically outpaced all estimate that we had and that the external stakeholders had also. So we did extremely well and the model worked very well. Now the second phase is absolutely to do to hey to do the same, but for the pediatric and adult population which is the biggest cutter of SMA patients. So we are basically enhancing and increasing the field team. We have now an adult campaign that we are launching and we start to see traction. We have patient's ambassadors as adults and we are encouraged by the momentum actually. So we are really focused on implementation there is still more than 5,000 patients to go. The team is putting the head down and implementing better than ever and actually I have good confidence in our U.S. team. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen. Please go ahead. Eric Schmidt : Maybe another question for Michel on biz dev you mentioned a renewed focus here. Is there a specific goal that you're trying to achieve via business development maybe you can comment on what that is and what exactly you and the board have alignment on with regard to your focus here? Jeff Capello : So let me take that one. This is Jeff. So as Michel has said and I've said as well we've got. an enviable position here where we were well capitalized and we generated a lot of cash. And so we're in an enviable position where we have a lot of cash available to create shareholder value. Our premium is on adding to the pipeline, given our commercial footprint and our manufacturing footprint and trying to bring in assets that are closer to being market ready. So there's certainly a preference to kind of look at those types of transactions. However as we go along we'll continue to add to the pipeline with mid-stage assets and lower-stage assets where they fill in, and Mike has done a great job with his team doing that. But at the same time given our capital situation our cash flow generation we can both add to the pipeline both later-stage assets and mid-stage assets and also return capital to shareholders. And I do want to reiterate we have $2.75 billion remaining under our share repurchase program and we expect to be active on that front as well. Michel Vounatsos : So if I can add on one Jeff\u2019s comments. The priority capital allocation will go in terms of BD, will go on the priority growth areas. So we will retain some capital and will distribute. We'll continue to distribute the way we have done but even more eventually. But the investment in terms of BD will be primarily dedicated to the priority growth areas : MS, neuroimmunology, movement disorders, neuromuscular diseases and the last one, Mike. Michael Ehlers : Alzheimer's. Michel Vounatsos : Alzheimer's disease absolutely. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Cory Kasimov : Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess following up on Eric's. I also wanted to ask about BD but in a different way as it relates to the growth outlook for the company from here, so with SPINRAZA flattening out at least in the U.S. as you been predicating and a stable MS franchise. I'm curious if you think you can continue to grow the business over the intermediate term without bringing in a later-stage pipeline from the outside. Thanks. Jeff Capello : Let me start with a comment on MS, SPINRAZA flattening out in the U.S. I don't think we're saying that the U.S. is going to flatten out indefinitely. I think what we're saying is because we were so successful in getting through the bolus of patients when we first introduced the drug that we had kind of a benefit -- one-time benefit of a number of patients, particularly in kind of the infants and the pediatrics. And so we worked our way through that which is why kind of the loading doses have come down a bit which is kind of impacting our sequential growth. We think that as we, as Michel said, penetrated the adult segment which is the largest segment that growth will resume and we're kind of predicting that to happen at kind of the end of this year as our sales force gets focused on the different centers to treat adults we get through reimbursement we identify those patients. So there is still a very good growth opportunity in the U.S. Outside the U.S. there's an even bigger opportunity and you can see and we've said clearly that we think the market is going to be greater. We won't face exactly the same dynamics because some of the outside U.S. patients don't go through the normal loading doses they come through the expanded access program. So we'll have more of a regular growth outside of the U.S. So we're still very confident that the SPINRAZA has a very growth -- good growth opportunity ahead of it. Michel Vounatsos : So I can only reinforce the focus of the organization on executing well all around the world including the U.S. As I've said we are very encouraged by the leadership and the implementation that we see in the U.S. even if there are some bumps sometimes on the way. This is the nature of our business. So it's all about growth and this hopefully will be generated in the U.S. more directly but mostly ex-U.S. Concerning SPINRAZA with the rapid and sequential reimbursement that we are gaining and the objective by the end of the year we are unlocking new opportunities in terms of picking SMA population. So this paves the way hopefully to us achieving the peak sales that we anticipate and we already said this will be one of the largest asset of the organization. Obviously we look at complementing eventually the momentum with some acquisition but we will be very wise always on the way we invest our capital and if we believe we can do -- these assets can do better in Biogen hands then we\u2019ll propose that to the board that will be always very cautious but we are actively looking absolutely. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink. Please go ahead. Geoffrey Porges : Thank you very much and appreciate all the color. Just following up on SPINRAZA. You gave us good information on the distribution of patient types by age in U.S but could you provide the same color for the 2300 or so patients outside the U.S. I think that's the right number. And then could you just comment on treatment persistence in the U.S. where you've been in the market for longest for those three different patient population infant, pediatric, and the adolescents in adults. Thanks. Jeff Capello : Yes, so let me give you the numbers as it relates to kind of Europe. I don't have all the numbers around the world but kind of our Type 1 patients were roughly 810 in the first quarter, Type 2 were 590, and Type 3 were 138, that's how it breaks out plus Geoff. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Michael Yee : Thanks for the question. Appreciate it. In regards to the Samsung Bioepis stake which you made a comment about planning to exercise in the coming months, can you just remind us I guess how that would work when you do that you have to integrate your P&L or you just going to hold the equity stake obviously that would be worth billions of dollars, so maybe just the plans on that and how that strategically would fit with what you guys are trying to do et cetera et cetera. Thanks so much. Michel Vounatsos : So this is Michel before we come to this question I just wanted to answer the second part of the previous question. The discontinuations on SPINRAZA are extremely low and this speaks to the efficacy of the product and the progress that the patients are making on the product. Now Biosimilars. Michael Ehlers : Yes, so as it relates to kind of exercising that option that would be an equity investment we would make and would still be below the level that would require us to consolidate, so it would be an equity investment where we would just pick up their share or our share of the net profits with regard to that collaboration. So would be booked kind of below the line, below non-operating. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Ying Huang : Hi, thanks for the question. Another quick one of SPINRAZA as well you mentioned previously that seven patients from the AveXis 101 Phase 1 type 1 SMA patients have already been receiving SPINRAZA treatment. Can you talk about where those seven patients saw additional function improvement from SPINRAZA? And then secondly in light of the recent failures of the Merck facing better in two Phase 3 trials does that change your thought on your base program in Phase 3 or not. Thank you. Michael Ehlers : Hey, Ying this is Mike thanks for the questions there. I mean so that the short answer is that we really don't have direct information on the clinical status or outcome of the patients in the AveXis trial that had substantially gone on SPINRAZA. All we can really say is that medical experience to-date and as reported by AveXis indicates that number or a large number of patients who received in therapy subsequently gone in SPINRAZA. But while we don't know the exact reasons there, they're not hard to imagine and in any event suggest that even with a gene therapy product on the market we can anticipate substantial need and use for combination therapy which is something that we're actively exploring in terms of preclinical studies. With regard to the Merck base inhibitor results of course these are things we've been looking at very carefully. I think they do raise a number of very valid questions about the right patient population study design when you might anticipate potential benefit or not and these are things that we're looking at very closely in active discussions with our collaboration partner ASI. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Matthew Harrison : Great, good morning thanks for taking the question. I was hoping maybe we could just talk a little bit about your neuropathic pain assets. Obviously you're going to have some probably have some data from the Radiculopathy study sometime in the second half of this year. Maybe if you could just help us think about, what we're going to see out of that dataset and how you would frame that data in terms of insights into the overall program. Thanks. Michael Ehlers : Yes, so this is Mike, Matt. Thanks for the question on that. So right now this is we've got BIIB74 it\u2019s we'll be starting a Phase 3 trial in Trigeminal Neuralgia I mentioned. It\u2019s completed enrollment in Phase study in painful lumbosacral radiculopathy. These are two different pain syndromes. I think as you know and one of the challenges but and opportunities in the neuropathic pain space as you got a variety of different specific indications that have different features of neuropathic pain. Trigeminal neuralgia very episodic pain crises and some where we've got stronger proof of concept data. Lumbosacral radiculopathy or sciatica this is a little bit more of a mixed neuropathic in inflammatory pains state that's a little bit more of a mixed mixture. We've started screening on our -- on the trial in small fiber neuropathy again this would be a small fiber more episodic pain disease. In each of these cases, a lot depends on the specific pain state and the mechanism that you're going after. That's why we were trying in each of these three, the strongest clinical evidence that we have to-date is in trigeminal neuralgia and we're looking to explore where that might provide additional benefit beyond trigeminal neuralgia. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Terence Flynn : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just on SPINRAZA in Europe, I was wondering if you can give us a little bit more detail on the percent of patients that are getting a loading versus maintenance dosing and then roughly where you would expect that to end up by the end of the year. And then for Jeff, you had repurchased $250 million of stock in the quarter; you mentioned you still have a pretty sizable amount outstanding. How should we think about the case on the forward there? Thanks a lot. Michel Vounatsos : So we get started on the SMA question ex-U.S., so you recall that we had many patients on the early access program. So we don\u2019t have the hockey stick as easy of dosing dose in most of the market. So this is helping the trend be much more smooth. And in addition there is a sequential access and reimbursement progress we're making and this should pave the way combined with the U.S. performance for long-term growth on SPINRAZA. Jeff Capello : And with regard to the share repurchase question, so I would look -- based on the stock price today we think the company is very undervalued, I would look for us to kind of pick up our pace with regard to the share repurchase and actually get out to $2.75 billion over a reasonable timeframe. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Alethia Young : Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I was just curious actually about the Alkermes program BIIB098, just how you\u2019re thinking about the potential opportunity there from that relationship of payors and the physicians and thinking about differentiated profile in TECFIDERA in particular linear generic which may come in August of 2019. Thanks. Michael Ehlers : Okay Alethia this is Mike. I\u2019ll start with this and then pass it on a little bit. So I mean the status is that Alkermes is presenting data at AAN demonstrating clear benefits I mentioned on annualized relapse rate and MRI lesions. We\u2019re in the midst of generating and gathering data in head to head comparison with TECFIDERA which we\u2019ll be talking about more at the beginning of next year. We do anticipate of being able to file this year and look the profile that we're looking for here is to-date we've seen strong evidence of efficacy. We\u2019ve seen safety profile that looks favorable and we're very interested to know how that lines up relative to our experience with TECFIDERA and we imagine that upon filing and making it available to patients that this would provide an additional potential option with potentially differentiated tolerability profile. Michel Vounatsos : And if I may add, this is Michel. This will be another opportunity to expand the fastest growing segment of the MS DMT which is the oral and TECFIDERA is doing great but here we will have another opportunity with potentially integrate. And coming back to the overall growth questions and the reasons to believe also for MS, we continue to take price and we have seen that. The generics are mostly impacting the originator, the unmet medical needs is tremendous. We have an entire portfolio where we are leaders on the platforms, the orals and the high efficacy. We are generating more data and we had a pipeline. So these are additional reasons to believe in our ability to compete and to grow. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Citi. Please go ahead. Robyn Karnauskas : Hi guys, thank you for taking my question. So just a little bit along the lines of TECFIDERA continuing about next year, you\u2019re referring from doctors that they view TECFIDERA [indiscernible] similarly and so basically patients don\u2019t get both, they are now curious whether or not your market research was supportive of that and then on the lines do you think that a generic will really only impact the brand. What gives you the confidence is it just a just rebating and would you be surprised going forward next year that you stuff added 14 people to use generic ahead of a different type of brand in the oral class. So maybe give us some comfort around what your market repurchase value is? Michel Vounatsos : So the way the market so far has managed those DMTs was with open formularies because of this type of disease and they do believe the payors that is not a blanket formulary that will increase the value for the patients. We are talking here logically different therapies, different classes. As you know the monitoring on the Gilenya is pretty intense during the first period on the product. I don\u2019t see how evidence based medicines will be completely overshadowed by formularies in order to prescribe first a generic of S1P that has baggage of efficacy and risk profile that is different from the other DMTs, this would be a bad day for evidence based medicine in this country and this will be the first time for neurological diseases and mostly MS. I don\u2019t see that as a credible assumption, we will not take that in our long range plan assumption. Michael Ehlers : And Robyn, I may add just a little bit here, this is Mike. I think in our experience and discussions practicing a neurologist out there is that there would be a very strong aversion we believe to patients potentially having to have a multi-hour first dose cardiac monitoring as a step through for some of the therapy. So there is an initial a clinical burden that would generally be viewed negatively by a number of MS neurologists we believe. Operator : And your final question today will come from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Ronny Gal : Good morning everybody and thanks for fitting me in. Just wanted to talk a little bit about the pattern of buying that you're seeing with the MS product, it feels a little bit like buyers are buying in the fourth quarter ahead of anticipated price increases in the first quarter. Is this what\u2019s going on and is it something you can manage through contracting and similarly can you talk a little bit about co-pay accumulators as you switch to patients from kind of insurance type card to a more of credit card format in terms of your co-pay assistance program? Jeff Capello : Ronny, it\u2019s Jeff. Let me help you with the inventory channel dynamics and reiterate some of the numbers for you. So I think as you saw in our press release, we disclosed the channel inventory overall for U.S. MS came down about $130 million in the first quarter. If you look at that compared to the fourth quarter channel inventory went up $50 million. So we had about $180 million swing that had nothing to do with fundamental demand as far as we can see it, it is just channel dynamics. So that's a good kind of overall sense of kind of what happened Q4 to Q1 and we expect that the case is in fact because of expected price increases we\u2019ve done and further regularly in the first quarter. So that we can\u2019t control to a certain degree that we have kind of a larger kind of channel building that's prerogative in the fourth quarter and then some drawdown in the first quarter. Fundamentally though as we look at kind of share and we looked at it carefully with regard to kind of going from the fourth to the first quarter that script, we believe we picked up share in both TECFIDERA and TYSABRI from the fourth quarter to the first quarter in U.S. in terms of new prescriptions and the kind of flat total prescriptions. So we think the business underlying are pretty healthy and it\u2019s going in the right direction but we can\u2019t control always kind of the channel inventory dynamics. Michel Vounatsos : Yes, we are pleased to see that basically we cross that during the months of March in MVRX Ocrevus with a growth momentum for the BIIB portfolio, so we are pleased to see that. But still a long way to go. So concerning the patient accumulator I understand this is the last question, so we believe that some [indiscernible] have started to account the co-pays element differently according to these new co-pay evaluator formula and there is absolutely no impact at this stage, we need to monitor that every year carefully but at this stage there is nothing more to report. End of Q&A Michel Vounatsos : So thank you all for attending our Q1 call and have a good day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you to everyone for attending today. This will conclude today\u2019s call and you may now disconnect.",

My name is Dan, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen's Second Quarter 2018 Financial Results and Business Update Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Matt Calistri, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Matt Calistri : Thank you and welcome to Biogen's second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the Risk Factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Michael Ehlers, EVP of Research and Development; and our CFO, Jeff Capello. We will also be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Al Sandrock. Before I conclude, I would also like to also point out that starting with this earnings release and call, we're posting press releases related to earnings calls and Investor Events on the Investors section of Biogen's website, www.biogen.com. And we'll issue statement on Twitter when they become available. We will do this instead of publishing press releases related to future earnings calls, earnings releases, and Investor Events via Newswire services. Our Twitter handle is @biogen. Now I will turn the call over to Michel. Michel Vounatsos : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, let me begin with some financial highlights. Compared to the same period a year ago, Biogen's second quarter revenues grew 9% to record $3.4 billion, second quarter GAAP earnings per share grew 3% to $4.18 and non-GAAP EPS grew 15% to $5.80. Our performance for the second quarter was strong and we are raising our full year revenue guidance. Now let me review the accomplishments we delivered in the second quarter. First, our MS core business including OCREVUS royalties delivered revenues of $2.3 billion, a decrease of 2% versus prior year, adjusting for inventory dynamics with the global MS revenues were stable versus prior year. The number of patients on our MS products globally remained stable versus the prior year as patient growth outside of the U.S. offset increased competition within the U.S. We were pleased to see that new patient starts for TECFIDERA in the U.S. in the second quarter were at the highest level since the launch of OCREVUS just over a year ago. Outside the U.S., we continued our strong progress in several international markets such as Japan were close to half of MS patients are now treated with the Biogen products. Second, SPINRAZA global revenues grew to $423 million, driven by quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year revenue growth in the U.S. and even greater revenue growth outside the U.S. The number of commercial patients on SPINRAZA increased by approximately 28% from last quarter and we now have over 5,000 patients on SPINRAZA, including the expanded access program and clinical trials. In the U.S., we encouraged by the progress we are making with adults, as the number of adult patients on SPINRAZA grew by over 20% compared to last quarter. We remain focused on increasing our reach with adults by supporting the establishment of adult treatment sites, working to broaden our reimbursement coverage and communicating the potential value of SPINRAZA for this patient population. Outside the U.S., the pace of reimbursement for SPINRAZA across multiple geographies lead to meaningful revenue growth with significant revenue contribution not just from Europe but also from Asia-Pac and Latin America. We expect the launch of SPINRAZA to continue expanding globally throughout 2018 and 2019. We have filed for regulatory approval in 7 additional countries including China, and we expect to file in up to 4 more countries by the end of the year. We also seek a formal reimbursement in seven additional countries and now have formal reimbursement in 24 markets. Third, we made significant progress advancing our differentiated neuroscience pipeline, a critical source of potential future value generation for Biogen. We entered into an exclusive option agreement to acquire TMS-007, a Phase 2 compound being developed for acute ischemic stroke, which we discussed in detail during our webcast on June 28. Today, we also announced we acquired an early stage program from AliveGen for muscle enhancement, which will initially be studying SMA and has the potential to benefit patients across a board range of neuromuscular diseases, including ALS. In line with our expectation, this month, we completed enrollment of both ENGAGE and EMERGE, our two Phase 3 trials, studying our investigational treatment aducanumab in early Alzheimer\u2019s disease. And in May, we exercised our option with Neurimmune to further reduce the royalty rates payable on potential future sales of aducanumab. Along with our collaboration partner Eisai, we announced positive top-line results of the final analysis of the Phase 2 study of BAN2401. We believe these results provide evidence to further support beta amyloid as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Importantly, our cash generation remained very strong and continue provide us with significantly optionality and flexibility to allocate capital. In addition to the two BD deals I discussed earlier, during the second quarter, we repurchased $2.75 billion worth of shares. We exercised our option to increase our ownership of Samsung Bioepis for approximately 49.9% and will pay approximately $700 million for these option shares. We believe our share of Samsung Bioepis is worth significantly more. And we believe this investment is aligned with our goal of creating meaningful value for our shareholders. And we invested $1 billion in a new collaboration agreement with Ionis, which capitalizes on Biogen\u2019s expertise in neuroscience, R&D and Ionis\u2019 leadership in antisense oligonucleotides with a goal of meaningfully expanding our neuroscience pipeline. As we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to maximizing returns for our shareholders while continuing to bringing variety therapies to patients, something that demands a thoughtful approach towards all our investment over both the short and the long-term. As we aim to continue allocating capital to expand our pipeline, this quarter we hired Daniel Karp as EVP, Corporate Development. We look forward to the contribution Daniel will make as we continue to refine our corporate strategy and evaluate new opportunities for potential business development and M&A. In summary, Biogen executed on strategy and continued to deliver noticeable progress. Our core MS business demonstrated resilience. We continue to believe there is significant growth potential for SPINRAZA and we encouraged by a recent progress in reaching adults and expanding market access globally. We enhanced our pipeline with addition of two more assets as we aim to diversify our neuroscience R&D portfolio and build decks in our core and emerging growth areas. We completed Phase 3 enrollments for aducanumab, which we believe is one of the most promising investigational therapy for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Together with Eisai, we announced positive top-line results for BAN2401, which we believe provides further support for the Amyloid Hypothesis. We have made progress implementing a leaner and simpler operating model designed for the future. And we strategically allocate capital as we invest to develop and expand our neuroscience portfolio again with the goal of maximizing shareholders return and bringing innovative therapies to patients. I will now turn the call over to Mike for a more detailed update on our recent progress in R&D. Michael Ehlers : Thank you, Michel, and good morning to everyone on the phone. This is a very exciting time for Biogen R&D as we have made meaningful advances across our industry-leading Alzheimer's portfolio, added two new clinical stage assets and continued to progress our broader neuroscience pipeline. Let me review the progress we made across our core and emerging growth areas. I'll start with the significant advances we made in Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Earlier this month, along with our collaboration partner Eisai, we announced positive top-line results from the final 18-month analysis of the Phase 2 study of BAN2401, a beta amyloid antibody being studied in early Alzheimer's disease, including subject with mild cognitive impairment due to AD and a subset of mild AD. Based on data from 856 patients, this study demonstrated both the potential disease modifying effect on clinical function and beta amyloid lowering in the brain. Specifically, the study demonstrated the dose dependent reduction in beta amyloid in the brain as measured using amyloid pet as well as a concompetent dose dependent slowing of the rate of clinical progression as measured by the Alzheimer's disease composite score or adcoms a novel endpoint which incorporates elements of validated measures including ADAS-Cog, CDR Sum of Boxes and the Mini-Mental State Examination. While the study did not achieve its primary outcome measure at 12-months based on a Bayesian statistical analysis using conventional frequentist statistics, the highest treatment dose of BAN2401, 10 milligrams per kilograms by weekly showed a statistically significant effect on Adcoms as early as 6 months and also 12 months and 18 months. These new data provide compelling evidence for further support blocking or clearing beta amyloid as a therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease. In this study, BAN2401 demonstrated an acceptable tolerability profile through 18 months. The most common treatment emerging adverse effects were infusion reactions and Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormalities or ARIA. These results will be presented by Eisai in an oral section at the 2018 Alzheimer's Association International Conference tomorrow July 25th, at 3 :30 p.m. Central Time in Chicago. A live webcast of the presentation is expected to be available. In addition to BAN2401, we continued to advance aducanumab, a distinct antibody that binds the both soluble and insoluble aggregated forms of beta amyloid, including oligomers, protofibrils and fibrils. Aducanumab demonstrated significant plaque removal as well as slowing of cognitive decline in the Phase 1b PRIME study. Both Phase 3 studies were aducanumab, ENGAGE and EMERGE are now fully enrolled. Eisai also reported Phase 2 data for elenbecestat, a base inhibitor designed to reduce the production of beta amyloid. Elenbecestat demonstrated an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in this 70-patient study, and the results demonstrated a statistically significant difference in beta amyloid levels in the brain as measured by amyloid-PET. A numerical slowing of decline in functional clinical scales is also observed although this effect was not statistically significant. Elenbecestat is currently being evaluated in two Phase 3 studies. Beyond beta amyloid, we are advancing a number of assets targeting tau, which we believe plays an important and complementary role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Specifically, in the second quarter, we dosed the first patient in the Phase 2 Alzheimer\u2019s disease trial of BIIB092, the anti-tau antibody we licensed from BMS last year. Turning to MS and neuroimmunology. We previously communicated data regarding the potential impact of extended interval dosing on reducing the risk of PML for TYSABRI. We have now finalized plans for worldwide prospective study to evaluate whether extended interval dosing provides a similar level of effectiveness to standard dosing. We believe this study will provide sufficient data to inform clinical practice and we plan to initiate the study by the end of the year. Further, in collaboration with Alkermes, we continue to advance BIIB098 or diroximel fumarate as a novel oral fumarate in Phase 3 development for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis where we aim to provide a differentiated GI tolerability profile. This quarter, we received data from the ongoing open-label long-term safety study that will be included as part of the new drug application to support registration. Safe data were consistent with what has been presented at prior scientific meetings and includes results from approximately 700 patients of which roughly 500 were treated for at least one year. Alkermes expects to file with the FDA by the end of the year. In parallel, we continue to enroll the EVOLVE-MS-2 head-to-head tolerability study versus TECFIDERA with data expected in the first half of 2019. This study is employing an adaptive trial design in which results from Part A are used to inform Part B. We are committed to expanding our leadership position in multiple sclerosis and we believe this new generation fumarate is an important part of our strategy. Turning to our progress in movement disorders. We are actively recruiting a Phase 2 study of our anti-tau antibody BIIB092 and progressive Supranuclear Palsy or PSP. BIIB092 is a potent selected anti-tau antibody that has demonstrated reductions in CSF pre-tau levels of over 90%. We expect to complete enrollment in this 52 week study in the coming months. The primary endpoints are efficacy as assessed by the PSP rating scale, a zero to 100 measure of disability across six domains as well as safety. If the data from this Phase 2 study are positive, we believe there is a potential it could be registrational and could thereby possibly support a regulatory filing. Moving to neuromuscular disorders, including spinal muscular atrophy. We continue to build on the growing body of clinical evidence for SPINRAZA as the standard-of-care in SMA. Earlier this month, at the International Congress on Neuromuscular Diseases, we've presented a new analysis of Type 3 SMA patients initially enrolled in the CS2 study between the ages of 11 and 14 followed by its open-label extension study. Of the 11 patients included in this analysis, 10 demonstrated stabilization or clinically meaningful improvement in motor function as compared to the decline over time expected based on natural history. As we aim to bolster our leadership position in SMA, we are pursuing new therapies across multiple modalities. To that end, as Michel mentioned, today we are pleased to announce the acquisition of two programs from AliveGen targeting the myostatin pathway for potential muscle enhancement across a range of neuromuscular diseases, including SMA.  Myostatin is a widely studied negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass that signals to ActRIIA and ActRIIB receptors. ALG-801, now known as BIIB110, and it's backup compound ALG-802 are subtle hybrids of the ActRIIA and ActRIIB receptors and act as ligand in Fabs to inhibit myostatin as well as other muscle suppressing ActRIIA, IIB ligands, including activin A and activin B. Recent research has indicated that inhibiting both myostatin and activins maybe necessary to maximize clinical efficacy. However, previous approaches to simultaneously inhibit these ligands have resulted in an addition of BMP9, a related growth factor involved in both vascular and bone homeostasis, who's in addition increases the risk for vascular related toxicity. AliveGen is carefully designed BIIB110 with the aim of spearing BMP9 was sequestering the muscle inhibiting factors myostatin and activins A B conferring the potential for both greater efficacy and improved safety compared to other compounds in the class. Preclinical data for BIIB110 have demonstrated compelling increases in muscle mass as well as improvements in bone density, which we believe make further differentiate the asset. BIIB110 is currently in the Phase 1a study in healthy volunteers. We believe there is a broad opportunity for BIIB110 with an initial focus on development as an add gene therapy for SMA but with potential applicability for other rare diseases such as ALS and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease or more prevalent condition such as Sarcopenia. Development in SMA, in particular, has the potential for complementary benefit when used in combination with the disease modifying therapy such as SPINRAZA. As previously communicated, we have been working to advance our SMA gene therapy program in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania. We were recently informed that the FDA has placed our IND on clinical hold. We believe we have a path forward and we are working to lift the hold as quickly as possible. We are not able to provide details or updated timing, but we intend to bring the program to the clinic as soon as possible. Moving to acute neurology, we have now begun initiating sites in the Phase 3 CHARM study of BIIB93, our first-in-class IV glibenclamide therapeutic targeting brain edema and large hemisphere infarction. And as Michel mentioned, during the second quarter, we also entered into an option agreement for TMS-007, which is the potential best-in-class thrombolytic drug candid currently in Phase 2 in Japan. Due to its highly targeted mechanism of action, we believe TMS-007 may have several important benefits compared to the current standard of care of Tissue Plasminogen activator or TPA, including a potentially longer treatment window and lower bleeding risk. I encourage you to review our recent webcast from June 28 for more details on BIIB93, TMS-007 and our overall strategy to target stroke. Overall, we have made significant progress advancing our pipeline, including encouraging new data on Alzheimer's disease, continued new additions to our pipeline and strong execution across our clinical programs. Since the beginning of 2017, we have meaningfully expanded our pipeline by adding our advance in 14 clinical stage programs. We are building our pipeline with the goal of being the leader in neuroscience. We see compelling evidence. This is just the beginning of a period of transformative breakthroughs in the treatment of neurological diseases, we are positioning Biogen to take full advantage of the innovation and progress that we anticipate will continue to occur in neuroscience. And with that, I will now pass the call to Jeff. Jeff Capello : Thanks, Mike, good morning, everyone. I'll now review our financial performance for the second quarter of 2018 starting with revenues. Total revenues in the second quarter were $3.4 billion, growing 9% year-over-year. Let me now provide more detail on our MS franchise revenues. Overall, our MS business delivered revenues of $2.3 billion in Q2, 2018, including OCREVUS royalties of approximately $113 million. MS revenues in Q2 '18 were down 6% versus prior year, but OCREVUS royalties were down 2% including OCREVUS royalties. Total ex-U.S. MS product revenues benefitted by approximately $42 million versus the prior year due to changes in foreign exchange rates net of hedging. Global second quarter TECFIDERA revenues were $1.1 billion, a 2% decrease versus the prior year. And this include the revenues of US$826 million, a decrease of 6% versus Q2 '17 and $261 million outside the U.S., an increase of 11% versus the second quarter 2017. In the U.S., we saw an inventory drawdown of approximately $35 million. We also believe we experienced the final quarter of difficult comparisons due to the timing of the OCREVUS launch. Both of these factors weigh on our U.S. TECFIDERA performance for the second quarter. We continue to see stabilization share of old prescriptions and growth in TECFIDERA share of new prescriptions, building on the capable trends we saw in the first quarter of 2018. New patient starts with TECFIDERA in U.S. in Q2 '18 were at the highest level since the launch of OCREVUS, just over a year ago. In addition, we were very pleased with TECFIDERA outside the U.S., driven by strong year-over-year patient growth across each large routine market, solid emerging market growth and particularly strong performance in Japan where TECFIDERA has now reached over 25% market share. For the balance of the year, we expect continued patient growth for TECFIDERA outside the U.S. though we are closing monitoring some evolving pricing pressure in certain European markets. Ex-U.S. TECFIDERA revenues benefited by approximately $17 million versus the prior year due to changes in foreign exchange rates net of hedging. TYSABRI worldwide revenues were $467 million this quarter, a decrease of 6% versus the second quarter of 2017. This included $266 million in the U.S. and $202 million outside the U.S. In the U.S., revenues declined 8% versus the prior year, primarily due to the launch of OCREVUS. We are encouraged that this was a second straight quarter of stable U.S. volumes for TYSABRI as we saw stability in TYSABRI share of both new prescriptions and total prescriptions. Outside the U.S., TYSABRI revenues decreased 2% versus prior year. TYSABRI patients increased in all major European markets versus the prior year along with strong double-digit patient growth in the emerging markets. Ex-U.S., TYSABRI revenues this quarter benefited by approximately $12 million versus the prior year due to changes in foreign exchange rates, net of hedging. Interferon revenues including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY were $626 million during the second quarter, a decrease of 9% versus Q2, 2017. This included $445 million in U.S. and $181 million in sales outside the U.S. In the U.S., we saw a decrease of Interferon inventory of approximately $10 million in Q2, 2018. Ex-U.S. Interferon revenues benefited by approximately $12 million versus the prior year due to changes in foreign exchange rates, net of hedging. Overall, U.S. MS performance versus prior year was impacted by both the launch of OCREVUS and channel dynamics. We expect both factors to be less significant on a year-over-year basis as we move throughout the year with the potential benefit if there is channel build again in the second half of this year. Given the trends we see, combined with the anniversary of the OCREVUS launch, we expect second half 2018 worldwide MS product revenue to be stable when compared on a year-over-year basis. Let me now move to SPINRAZA. Global second quarter SPINRAZA revenues were $423 million. This included revenues of $206 million in U.S., representing 10% growth compared to the first quarter and $217 million outside the U.S., representing 23% growth compared to Q1. This is the first quarter where revenues outside the U.S. exceeded revenues in U.S. The number of patients on therapy in the U.S. increased by over 10% as compared to the end of the first quarter, including a greater than 20% increase in the number of adults on therapy as we continue to make progress in reaching adults in the U.S. We saw continued increase in the revenue contributions for maintenance doses this quarter. In U.S., approximately 55% of SPINRAZA revenues in the second quarter were attributed to maintenance doses as compared to approximately 40% in the first quarter. In the second quarter, the average doses per patient was approximately 1.1 roughly the same as in Q1.  In the second quarter, approximately 15% of U.S. SPINRAZA units were dispensed through our pre-drug program, a decrease from approximately 20% in Q1. As some patients enter the second year on therapy, we have benefited from proven insurance coverage we have today versus a year ago, allowing some patients to transition from pre to commercial product. We believe both inventory levels and dispensing allowances for SPINRAZA were relatively flat in the second quarter versus Q1. We continue to believe there is a significant opportunity in adults in the U.S. and we are very encouraged by the progress we're making. We estimate we now have reached approximately 50% of all infants, 50% of pediatric patients and 10% of adults. Of note, our data indicates that approximately 5% of the prevalent SME population of infants, 35% are pediatric patients and 60% are adults, highlighting the large number of untreated adult patients that we believe could benefit from SPINRAZA. Assuming a similar free drug percentage and continued progress in reaching adults, we expect to show continued stability in U.S. SPINRAZA revenues compared to the second quarter of 2018. Outside the U.S., the number of commercial SPINRAZA patients increased almost 50% versus the prior quarter, and there are still approximately 300 patients active in these standard access programs. We've recorded revenue from over 25 international markets with approximately 75% of ex-U.S. SPINRAZA revenues in the second quarter coming from Germany, Italy, Japan, Turkey, Brazil, Spain and Australia. We continue to believe that the international opportunity for SPINRAZA is even greater than in the U.S. as we continued the momentum of new country launches, and we believe there is significant ex-U.S. opportunity, not just in Europe but also in Asia-Pacific and Latin American markets. Let me now move on to our biosimilars business, which generated $127 million in revenue this quarter, a 40% increase versus the prior year. We estimate that more than 90,000 patients in Europe are currently receiving Biogen biosimilars. BENEPALI continues to be the market leader in countries such as UK, Denmark and Norway and we estimate BENEPALI market share of approximately 40% across all major launch markets. FLIXABI units grew 48% versus the prior quarter led by Germany, Italy and France where we estimate market share to now exceed 10%. As more competitors enter the anti-TNF biosimilar market, we believe the continuity of our global supply chain may accrue to be a competitive advantage. We aimed to maintain a 100% uninterrupted supply, and we have delivered nearly 5 million doses since launch without an interruption. Looking forward, we expect growth to moderate in the second half of this year as volume growth is offset by pricing pressure. But we expect to be well positioned in 2019 with the expected launch of IMRALDI in October this year. We estimate that the originaire product HUMIRA as annual revenues of approximately $4 billion in Europe, representing a large potential market for biosimilars. Last month we exercised our option to purchase additional shares of Samsung Biopis, our joint venture with Samsung Biologics. We will pay Samsung Biologics approximately $700 million to increase our ownership share in Samsung Biopis to approximately 49.9%. We believe the intrinsic value of this additional equity is significantly greater than our expected payment. This transaction is subject to certain regulatory conditions as they expected to close in the second half of 2018, at which point we've been anticipate that we will begin to report our shares and net profits and losses of the JV below the operating line. Turning to anti-CD20 revenues, we reported $490 million in Q2, an increase of 23% versus prior year, primarily driven by OCREVUS royalties. This includes our estimated OCREVUS royalties of $113 million for the second quarter. Total other revenues were $109 million in second quarter more than doubling versus Q2 '17 as we continue to benefit from greater contract manufacturing. Although the timing can be difficult to predict for the third and fourth quarter, we expect roughly similar contribution from other revenues compared to the second quarter. Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 87%, a slight improvement versus Q1, due to lower contract manufacturing. Q2 GAAP R&D expense was 29% of revenue or $981 million. Q2 non-GAAP R&D expense was 24% of revenue or $819 million. Both GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense include $324 million out of the $375 million upfront payment to Ionis, with the remaining $51 million capitalized as prepaid R&D, which will be amortized into the P&L over the life of the agreement. GAAP R&D expense also included $162 million comprised of the equity premium of approximately $94 million as well as a discount of approximately $68 million to reflect the effect of certain holding period restrictions, which will be amortized into the P&L for the next couple of years. The remaining $463 million, which is the difference between the fair market side of our investment in Ionis upon deal closing and the discount was reported as an investment and will be mark-to-market each quarter as a GAAP only expense. Q2 GAAP SG&A was 15% of revenue or $516 million. Q2 non-GAAP SG&A was also 15% of revenue at $512 million. GAAP and other net expense, which includes interest of $35 million, in the second quarter versus $69 million in second quarter of last year. Non-GAAP other net expense was $40 million in Q2 versus $69 million in Q2 of last year. In Q2, our GAAP tax rate was approximately 22% and our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 21%. Our weighted average diluted share count for Q2 was approximately 207 million shares and we finished the quarter with 201 million shares outstanding. We repurchased approximately 9.6 million shares in Q2 at an average price of $206 -- $286, excuse me, for a total value of $2.75 billion completing our previously announced $5 billion share repurchase authorization, which now brings us to our diluted earnings per share. In the second quarter, we booked GAAP earnings per share of $4.18 per share, an increase of 3% versus last year, and non-GAAP earnings of $5.80 per share, an increase of 15% versus last year. We generated approximately $1.1 billion in net cash flows from operations in Q2, which is impacted by approximately $537 million due to the Ionis collaboration agreement. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.4 billion in cash and marketable securities and $5.9 billion in debt. We believe we have and we will continue to have ample capacity to execute meaningful future business development, M&A activity, as well as return capital to shareholders. We will continue to be disciplined in our approach and focused on value creation. Let me now turn to our updated full year guidance for 2018. We expect revenues of approximately $13 billion to $13.2 billion, which will represent year-over-year growth of approximately 6% to 7.5%. The low end of our guidance reflects emerging potential risk to our MS business in Europe including pricing pressure as well as uncertainty in channel inventory levels in US. We expect gross margin as a percentage of sales to be consistent with Q2 2018. As a result of business development transactions in the first half of the year, we now anticipate GAAP R&D expense between 19% and 20% of sales and non-GAAP R&D expense between 18% and 19% of sales. Of note, guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions as both are hard to predict. We continue to expect SG&A expense to be approximately 15% to 16% of revenues. We anticipate our GAAP tax rate for 2018 to be between 21.5% and 22.5% and our non-GAAP tax rate to be between 20.5% and 21.5%. This reflects both the anticipated benefit of the U.S. corporate tax reform as well as the tax impact of the business development activities that's occurred so far in 2018. We anticipate full year GAAP diluted EPS of $21.80 to $22.40 for 2018, representing growth of 83% to 87% versus 2017, and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be $24.90 to $25.50, representing growth of 14% to 17%. I'll now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments. Michael Ehlers : Thank you, Jeff. We closed the second quarter with the record quarterly revenues, double digit non-GAAP earnings growth and increase for full year revenue guidance and exciting progress across our pipeline. Consistent with our strategic priorities, we're allocated capital to both invest for future growth and opportunistically return capital to shareholders. We do not intend to pause or slowdown here. We believe there will be plenty more exciting opportunities for Biogen as we move into the second half of the year. Looking forward, within the next 12 months, we expect further progress across our neuroscience pipeline, including Eisai's presentation of the BAN2104 data tomorrow and assessing next steps, dosing the first patient in our Phase 3 studies in stroke and hepatic pain; data readouts across MS, Alzheimer's, neuropathic pain, ophthalmology and ALS, and filing for regulatory approval in the U.S. for BIIB98 in MS. As Mike noted earlier, we continue to see compelling evidence across the neuroscience landscape that leads us to believe we are at the beginning of a period of transformative breakthroughs in the treatment of neurological diseases. We believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from these potential breakthroughs and Biogen's goals is to be the long term leader in neuroscience as we believe it will become one of the most promising symmetric areas of investment for biopharma and growth investors. To deliver on our aspiration, we remain focused on executing well on our strategic priorities to fortify our core business in MS and SMA and allocate capital to expand and progress our neuroscience pipeline. Finally, I want to iterate our commitment to maximizing returns to our shareholders and bringing innovative therapies to patients over the long term. These demands that we continue to capital efficiently, effectively and appropriately, as we have demonstrated in the past, we will always strive to have an optimal capital structure as well as aimed for superior returns from the investments we make. Once again, I would like to thank our employees around the world who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patients' lives and all other physicians, caregivers and participants in our clinical development programs. Our past and future achievements could not be realized without their passion and commitment. With that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat : Hi, thanks so much for taking our questions. I wanted to focus on BAN2401. And I didn't want to ask any questions on the data. We'll find it all tomorrow and we can discuss it. But instead to help us prepare, my question was, some clarity on trial design, so we\u2019re all on the same page going into it. And my question is this, was there -- so beyond the Bayesian stats, I am going to focus specifically on the traditional stats, was there a stat hierarchy? And if not, was there a multiplicity adjustment? And if that\u2019s the case, what\u2019s the statistical significance threshold we should be pegging most of the results to? I think that\u2019s really what I am trying to get clarity on. How many cuts of the data were there that we should end? And what\u2019s the P value of threshold we should be pegging all the results to? Thank you very much. Al Sandrock : Hi, Umer. This is Al Sandrock. So we look forward to seeing the results tomorrow presented by Eisai, my colleague at Eisai, Dr. Kramer. So look, there was a single primary endpoint and the primary endpoint was a Bayesian analysis of 12 months where they were looking for the threshold was an 80% probability of seeing a 25% treatment effect. That\u2019s the primary endpoint. There were a number of secondary endpoints that were pre-specified and that\u2019s -- and Dr. Kramer, I believe, has a plan to present those pre-specified secondary endpoints. I hope that answers your question. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Cory Kasimov : I wanted to also ask a question on just the Alzheimer\u2019s kind of portfolio overall. And with the understanding, as Umer said, the 2401 data is tomorrow and you limit to what you can say on the data, I am curious on a broader level. How you see the key or what you see the key elements of read through from 2401 over to aducanumab? How much of these results impact your confidence on the ongoing studies there that you\u2019ve just completed enrollment in? Thanks. Al Sandrock : Yes, Cory. Thanks. This is Al again. First I want to point some of the similarities between BAN2401 and adu. They both bind tightly to soluble oligomers as well as insoluble fibrils of Abeta. Protofibrils is just a type of soluble oligomer and thus both antibodies bind tightly to it. Neither antibody binds very well to monomers of Abeta. So they are both selective for aggregated forms of Abeta. Both antibodies bind to the end terminal portion of the Abeta peptide. And we believe that the linear epitopes are very, very similar. So they bind at very similar places on Abeta. But based on x-ray crystallography studies that we\u2019ve been doing lately, is that they bind in a different way because they are different antibodies? In the human trials, as we\u2019ve noted on the top-line, both antibodies clear amyloid plaques as seen on PET scans in a dose dependent manner, as Mike said this morning. And in human trials, both antibodies seem to slow the progression of cognitive decline at the highest dose. So you can see that there a lot of similarities. And so, we continue to believe that what we are doing right now in terms of these two large Phase 3 trials of aducanumab where we use an antibody that selectively targets aggregated forms of Abeta in the right patients is the right approach. And we think it\u2019s the most promising approach right now as we try to find the first disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer\u2019s. Michael Ehlers : And Cory, this is Mike. I think Al summarized it very well. The only thing I might add to that is, we always started going into this trial in terms of the read through to aducanumab, would be the relationship between brain amyloid lowering and slowing of cognitive decline. And what we\u2019ve reported together with Eisai, and the top-line was that there was and observed both a reduction in brain amyloid by PET and the slowing in the cognitive decline. And that's what we were looking to in terms of the potential read through to Opicinumab. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Ying Huang : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I have one question on BAN2401 data as well. Given that the trial missed the primary endpoint, but here maybe the key secondary point. Is it possible you could potentially file this data set with the FDA? Or this trial could potentially be a pivotal trial for registration purpose? And then, secondly maybe for Mike and Al. What's your thought on the Roche RO drug data in the SMA? I know you guys shifting that to $1 billion in the Ionis collaboration. But would you consider developing RO modality for SMA? Thank you. Al Sandrock : Hi, Ying it's Al again, on the BAN2401. Look our next steps are to talk to FDA and other regulators. We'll see what they say. And I think it's too early to speculate as to whether or not we can file with this. Michel Vounatsos : Yes, Ying, I'll take the question on the Roche PTC oral. I mean first, the comment relative to our broader deal with Ionis. I would say, of course, this oral while it really pretends to one specific target SM displacing and our broad collaboration with Ionis will be across many, many targets in many different mechanisms. So it's particularly related to the broader Ionis collaboration, I would say. But in terms of SMA, we're very interested to continue to seeing the data that Roche and PTC are reporting around their oral. So it's early days, but we've always said from the beginning that we welcome additional modalities. We think that there is going to be a roll in the future where there are multiple options for patients with SMA whether it's SPINRAZA whether it's potential gene therapies we're seeing where there are oral spice moderators. And these kind of combinatorial effects or complementary effects of different mechanism are things that we're actively exploring. Al Sandrock : And I just want to remind everyone, we have a lot of people in queue. So we would really appreciate if you limit to one question each. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Matthew Harrison : I will not ask a BAN2401 question. I was hoping maybe you could just comment, you mentioned the couple of times and I think when you talked about guidance for the rest of the year. You talked about 2A stability for MS, but you also pointed the EU pricing pressure. Could you just expand upon what's happening in the EU? And what are the risks and the timelines for that playing out? Thanks. Jeff Capello : Thanks, Matt. It's Jeff. So let me two parts to that question, one is the stability. One of the things we're looking forward to is and as we entered the back half of this year, as we now had a period in U.S. from an MS perspective, we're now up against the comparable period where we had OCREVUS in the market. So that's filled in terms of volumes where we're directed at kind of add equation. So we feel good about that in terms of our potential to kind of the stable in the U.S. Outside the U.S. the volumes have been growing pretty well, outside of Interferon, so we believe that that will continue. The challenges of each European market is different and our pricing pressures. And we'll have to kind of work our way with those certain countries that are little bit more aggressive than others. So we'll have to kind of work through that as we work way to the back half of the year. Al Sandrock : So let me add to the Jeff's comments, there is nothing new in the EU. We\u2019ve seen and we\u2019ve been facing year-after-year this type of pressure on price. The good news is that revenues growing strong and according to what we did plan. And in some major countries we have conventions and we have some timeline where we need to meet back with the authorities, regulators based on drug optimization and prices being negotiated. But it\u2019s too early to speculate, but nothing new from the European settings. It\u2019s a constant, I would say, engagement with regulators. The important element is that the underlying demand is going well mostly for the key products. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Geoffrey Porges : Thank you very much and congratulations on all the progress. Unfortunately back to BAN2401 and, perhaps Michel if you could give us a sense of Biogen's current corporate spends. At this stage, are you willing to commit to another Alzheimer\u2019s pivotal trial program and then perhaps if you could give us some view or insights on whether another pivotal would have to be of the same size and scale as the aducanumab pivotal trials? And if so, when we might hear about such a development plan? Thanks. Michel Vounatsos : Thanks for the great question. That maybe little bit too early for us to answer. As you can anticipate we are encouraged by the news. We look forward to the presentation tomorrow. We are engaging very closely with our partners at Eisai. This later data lands well on the amyloid opportunities. This reinforces aducanumab we believe so. So we need to reconvene. We are well positioned with our portfolio that is already large. We believe as many of you that it\u2019s not one single treatment that will treat all the patients at all the stages. So we need to envision new studies, including potentially combination therapies or sequential therapies to best answer the unmet medical need. But again, too early to be precise on what we have to do. Clearly that is an investment case. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Michael Yee : Thanks for the question and congrats again on the BAN data. I guess, just to clarify some earlier comments about the next steps. Is it fair to say that you would want to seek to aggressively file or that the goal is clearly to start more trials in different patient populations. I guess what are the scenarios and more importantly I guess what\u2019s the timing of all this to get some more clarity of the industry? Thanks so much. Al Sandrock : Hi, Michael, it\u2019s Al again. Yes, well, look, we can get a meeting with FDA pretty quickly, I believe. And I think we\u2019ll have to see what they say. A whole variety of options are available -- potentially available to us and we\u2019ll do the best I think that we can for AD patients who need a disease modifying therapy approved as soon as possible. In terms of the size and scale we'll have to do next, that will all be based on what these conversations say with respect to regulatory authorities, not just in the U.S., but also across the world. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Another one on 2401. Obviously, we'll learn a lot more on the data tomorrow. But can you speak out for the ADCOMs a bit more, what\u2019s the regulatory view of it? What validation has been done? And then what animal studies have already been completed? I'm just thinking preclinical toxicity, things like that. Thank you. Al Sandrock : Well, obviously, preclinical studies extensive ones were done in order to allow us to enroll -- both companies to enroll patients into fairly large trials even this Phase 2 trial with BAN2401 had more than 800 patients, so clearly a full and adequate preclinical package was done. In terms of, sorry, I forgot the first part of your question Jeff. Oh the ADCOMs, yeah the ADCOMs. So the ADCOMs is a composite of three already well validated endpoints, the CDR Sum of Boxes, the ADAS-Cog and the NMFC. It chooses elements of -- it actually uses all of the CDR Sum of Boxes, which is about 60% of the composite endpoint and chooses the portions of the ADAS-Cog and the NMFC that increase the sensitivity of the outcome measure to change, in this early population, MCI and mild patients. And they published on this. And how the regulators will view it, we'll have to see what they say when we go to talk to them. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terence Finn with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Terence Finn : Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering if you deal the expanded all in your comments and your SMA gene therapy program in terms of maybe timeframe for getting off clinical hold. And then based on the orphan drug designation, it looks like you guys are using the same promoter that Novartis is. But are you willing to share what bacteria you're using at this point? Thanks. Michael Ehlers : Yes, so this is Mike. All I can really say at this point is we believe we've got a path forward. We're working hard to get this off-clinical hold and we look forward to initiating the trial and getting patients as rapidly as possible. Once we're able to do that, we will have more to say about the precise nature of our gene therapy agent. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Salim Syed with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Salim Syed : Hey guys, thanks for the question. One on BAN2401, if I may. When you're thinking about running additional trials versus filing, are those two decisions independent of each other? Or if you run additional trials, does that preclude you from filing off the data that you have thus far? Thank you. Al Sandrock : Well, that's a tough question to answer without the benefit of the conversations we're about to have with the regulators. So I don't think I will have to respond. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Citi. Please go ahead. Robyn Karnauskas : Hi, thanks so much for taking my question and congrats. Question on Opicinumab data that was presented yesterday for 110 weeks. It was confusing because it's versus placebo switch-overs, but it looks like the titration arm didn't do as well as the 10 mg per kg arm. Can you help us understand a little bit more what you think is going on at two years? And how to think about the drug and what's going on in that arm at that time? Thanks. Al Sandrock : Hi, Robyn, and it's Al again. Yes, it is hard because we've lost the placebo control after one year. I think I do agree with when you look at the data, the 10 mg per kg arm group has always looked good since the very beginning and continues to look great. The titration arm, there is two questions related to that. One is that the dose was lower for period of time in order to try to mitigate the effects of ARIA, which it does. But the two things are happening. One is that you are starting with a lower dose, which we believe might be less effective initially. And then the time to get to the appropriate dose is a little bit later. However, when I look at the translation data, I have to say, I am pretty encouraged overall. I think it looks quite good and may not be as good as 10 mgs per kg. But I think the bottom-line also Robyn is that we\u2019ve lost the placebo control. We\u2019re down to very few patients at this point. I mean we were -- it was not a large trial to begin with. So trying to look at differences between dose arms is pretty hard with this small number of patients. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Phil Nadeau : One commercial question on SPINRAZA. We saw a deceleration new patient starts beginning in Q2. Is that simply the maturation of the product? Was there anything that can reverse that trend? And on the adult patients specifically you mentioned 60% of population are adults. What proportion of those adults do you think are appropriate for therapy and could be on therapy over the long haul? Thanks. Michael Ehlers : Yes, I think, we were encouraged by the progress we made from this first quarter to second quarter. I think we mentioned that 20% growth in adult patients being treated, and I think you have the statistic right that 60% of the patient pool is in adults. So we think that still is a large underserved patient pool. The exact percentage of that is treatable. I think is still to be determined given some of the complexities, but we think it\u2019s a large percentage. So we continue to be encouraged by that patient sub-segment and we\u2019ve made good progress. And I think we continue to believe as we work our way through the year. Our efforts to focusing on those sites that treat adults, which we did not focus on before is going to pay dividends. Our adult branded and targeted campaign, it's like the patients who are going to pay dividends as well as the investment in sales force. So we continue to expect to see a growth. We will just have to see how much growth we get in the back half of the year versus next year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with UBS. Please go ahead. Carter Gould : I guess for Michel and Jeff, on the BD front which seems to be very active completing a number of tuck-ins and platform deals. Meanwhile you\u2019ve reiterated a number of times a preference for later stage assets. So may be if you could just kind of characterize where you sit now with your BD strategy. And if you see sort of any evolution on that front sort of after the first half of the year? Michel Vounatsos : I will get started and Jeff will continue. So we always said that the early stage was the sweet spot for organization. This is where we can add the most value base on the quality of the team, our ability to best develop the compound. So we continue to be looking at opportunities that can meet and complement our current portfolio. It\u2019s very nice to see like the last year we\u2019ve done on muscle enhancement that it can reach towards different priority areas that we have. So this is very exciting. We look at order opportunities in later stage too by remaining very disciplined. And I will let Jeff continue on the answer here. Jeff Capello : I think we are pleased by the progress we\u2019ve made. And then, since Michel has become the CEO we\u2019ve done seven deals now. All smart deals, many refer later stage deals that have really helped the pipeline if you look at the slides. So I think we feel good about the pipeline advancement. But as we said from the beginning, we continue to say we\u2019ve got ample capacity to both invest in early stage deals, late stage deals and return capital to shareholders. And that hasn\u2019t changed. The challenge is, I think, as everybody can appreciate is we have to find later stage deals where there is a good scientific rationale, strong international property, good synergies from a commercial and manufacturing perspective and it make sense financially. Those are lot of wickets to get through to kind a get a deal through. But there is no lack of attention and the focus on it. As Michel has said, we now have a strong Head of Business Development, Daniel Karp, who will be moving forward more aggressively looking at later stage deals. And we certainly hope to get something done, but it will be something that will be smart and appropriate and disciplined. Operator : And your final question will come from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Brian Abrahams : Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the progress in the quarter. On Alzheimer's being that ADCOMS endpoints, I think, is somewhat new to many of us. I was wondering if you could speak to your views as to the bar for clinical meaningfulness or the goal on that particular endpoint maybe relative to CDR Sum of Boxes. And then maybe speak about how the 2401 results might affect your views of performing interim analysis for Opicinumab in the Phase 3 program? Thanks so much. Al Sandrock : Hi, Brian, it's Al. First I'm going to start with the interim analysis and the answer that we give is that we're commenting on it. On the -- in terms of the ADCOMS, it's the new endpoint as you pointed out. I haven't seen any publications that relate to what the clinically meaningful difference is. I will say though that the BAN2401 was powered to on the Bayesian analysis, essentially to see a 25% treatment effect size and 80% probably with the threshold. So that answers that in terms of what the study was powered for. Whether what the community believes is the clinically meaningful threshold has not yet been published or determined to my knowledge. Matt Calistri : Hi all, this is Matt. Thank you again for joining for today's call. Before we conclude, I'd like remind everyone that we planned to host a webcast tomorrow July 25 to discuss our Alzheimer's portfolio with Dr. Al Sandrock, our Chief Medical Officer; and Samantha Budd Haeberlein, Vice President Alzheimer's Disease, Dementia, and Movement Disorders in Late Stage Clinical Development. This will be a webcast-only event, not in-person. And we'll start at 5 p.m. Central Time, 6 p.m. Eastern Time. And a link can be found on the Investor section of Biogen's website at www.biogen.com. Thank you. And we look forward to speaking with you in the future. Al Sandrock : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, everyone for attending today. This will conclude today's call. And you may now disconnect.",

My name is Dan, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Third Quarter 2018 Financial Results and Business Update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Matt Calistri, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Matt Calistri : Thank, Dan. Thank you. And welcome to Biogen's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the Risk Factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Michael Ehlers, EVP of Research and Development; and our CFO, Jeff Capello. We will also be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Al Sandrock. Before I conclude, I would also like to remind everyone, that we now post releases related to earnings call and Investor Events on the Investors section of Biogen's website, www.biogen.com. And issue statement on Twitter when they become available. We do this instead of publishing earnings releases and any releases related to Investor Events and earnings calls via Newswire services. Our Twitter handle is @biogen. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Michel. Michel Vounatsos : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, let me begin with some financial highlights. Compared to the same period a year ago, Biogen's third quarter revenues grew 12% to $3.4 billion, third quarter GAAP earnings per share grew 24% to $7.15 and non-GAAP EPS grew 17% to $7.40. We are pleased with this year-over-year double-digit topline and bottom line growth, as we continue to execute on our strategy to solidify our long-term leadership position in neuroscience. Now let me review the accomplishments we delivered in the third quarter. First, our MS core business including OCREVUS royalties remained stable versus prior year and delivered revenues of $2.3 billion. The number of patients on our MS products globally also remained relatively stable versus the prior year. In the U.S. we saw increasing trends for both TECFIDERA and TYSABRI on a year-over-year basis. Outside the U.S., we continued to add patients across multiple geographies. Second, SPINRAZA global revenues grew to $468 million, driven by quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year revenue growth in the U.S. and even greater revenue growth outside the U.S. The number of commercial patients on SPINRAZA increased by approximately 20% from last quarter and we now have close to 6,000 patients on SPINRAZA, including the expanded access program and clinical trials. In the U.S., we continued making progress with adults. In the third quarter more then 50% of new starts were adults, increasing the number of adult populated patients on SPINRAZA by more then 20% compared to last quarter. Outside the U.S., the pace of reimbursement for SPINRAZA across multiple geographies lead to meaningful revenue growth with significant revenue contribution not just from Europe, but also from Asia-Pac and Latin America. We have received regulatory approval in five more countries and we have made two more regulatory filings. We also secured formal reimbursement in four additional countries, including Canada and now have formal reimbursement in 28 markets. We were very proud to announce new data from the NURTURE study of SPINRAZA of the 25 presymptomatic infants with genetically diagnosed SMA that was treated with SPINRAZA, many were achieving milestones consistent with normal development. All the patients were alive without ventilation and able to sit without support. 22 patients or 88% were able to walk either with assistance or independently and 88% was normal bullbar function. We believe the long-term data we are generating across a broad patient populations underscore the compelling efficacy profile of SPINRAZA. This is the kind of innovation and progress that inspires us to tackle some of the most difficult and challenging disease areas within neuroscience. Third, we continue to develop our neuroscience pipeline as we look to prioritize our investments towards areas with highest probability of success, while building depth in core areas of expertise. Within MS and neuroimmunology we are working to expand our long-term leadership position, and this quarter we completed enrolment of the Phase 2 trial of Opicinumab, a potential remyelination therapy. Along with Eisai we are presenting data this week for our industry leading Alzheimer's disease portfolio at the CTAD meeting in Barcelona. We are building for the depth in neuromuscular diseases with initiation of a Phase 1 trial of BIIB078, an ASO targeting C9ORF72 the most common genetic cause of ALS and we continue to be optimistic about the potential for BIIB067 targeting SOD-1 for ALS. We are making notable progress in movement disorders having completed enrolment in the Phase 2 first of BIIB092, an anti-tau antibody, in progressive supranuclear palsy or PSP. BIIB092 has been granted fast-track designation from the FDA. We also continue to advance BIIB054 in Phase 2 for Parkinson's disease. Within our emerging growth area of acute neurology we dosed the first patient in our Phase 3 trial of BIIB093, a first-in-class IV glibenclamide for large hemispheric infarction. And beyond our neuroscience pipeline we initiated a Phase 2b trial of BG11 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Mike, will provide more details on the development across our entire pipeline. Our biosimilar business grew revenues to $135 million, which represents 33% growth year-over-year. We believe that there are now more than 100,000 patients treated with our biosimilars in Europe. Last week we launched IMRALDI, our adalimumab biosimilar referencing HUMIRA. With an originator market of approximately $4 billion per year in Europe. IMRALDI is now available in several European markets, with IMRALDI we are now able to offer biosimilars of the three main anti-TNFs, providing physicians with more options to meet the needs of patients. We believe the significant savings from biosimilars in European markets can create headroom for innovative therapies. As a reminder, we exercised our option to own approximately 49.9% of the Samsung Biopis joint venture and we expect this transaction to close by the end of the year. Importantly, our cash generation remains very strong and continue to provide us with significant optionality and flexibility to allocate capital. Since the beginning of the year, we have completed five business development deals and repurchased 10.5 million shares. During the third quarter, we generated $1.7 billion in cash flow from operations. We continue to diligently evaluating opportunities for potential business development and M&A and our board has authorized a $3.5 billion share repurchase program. As we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to maximizing returns for shareholders, while continuing to bring innovative therapies to patients, something that demands a thoughtful approach towards all our investment over both the short and the long-term. In summary, Biogen executed on strategy and continued to deliver noticeable progress. Our core MS business demonstrated resilience. SPINRAZA continued to grow in the U.S. and even more so outside of the U.S. and we remain committed to our goal of being the long-term standard of care in SMA. We initiated a new study in ALS and completed enrolment of studies in MS and PSP, as we aim to develop our neuroscience portfolio and build depths in our most promising core and emerging growth areas. We grew our biosimilars business and have launched IMRALDI in Europe. We are actively implementing a leaner and simpler operating model and we generated ample cash as we focus on strategically allocating capital to develop and build depths in our neuroscience portfolio, again with a goal of maximizing shareholder returns and bringing innovative therapies to patients. I will now turn the call over to Mike for a more detailed update on our recent progress in R&D. Michael Ehlers : Thank you, Michel and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter we made important progress across our differentiated neuroscience pipeline, including our industry leading Alzheimer's disease portfolio. So I'm delighted today to review advances we made across our core and emerging growth areas, as we prioritize our activities and build depth in our most promising programs in disease areas. Starting with Alzheimer's disease and dementia. This week we are presenting data at the Clinical Trials and Alzheimer's Disease meeting or CTAD on the safety and efficacy of aducanumab, our monoclonal antibody of the binds soluble and insoluble aggregated forms of beta amyloid, including oligomers, protofibrils and fibrils. These presentations will include a 36 month analysis of the aducanumab titration dosing regimen and a 48 month analysis of the fixed dose cohort both from the long-term extension of the Phase 1b PRIME study of patients with early Alzheimer's disease. The results are generally consistent with the previous interim analyses and there were no changes to the risk benefit profile of aducanumab. Live webcasts of our oral presentations, as well as an investor Q&A call will be available on the Investor section of our website. Also at CTAD, our collaborator Eisai will present a clinical and biomarker updates from the Phase 2 study of BAN2401. These results will be presented in an oral session at CTAD and a live webcast of the presentation will be available on Eisai\u2019s website. Additionally, Eisai will present safety and efficacy data from the Phase 2 study of elenbecestat, a small molecule base inhibitor being evaluated in two Phase 3 studies in patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. In parallel to advancing Phase 3 clinical development aducanumab, we are also planning to initiate EVOLVE, a Phase 2 study designed to assess the clinical relevance of asymptomatic amyloid related imaging abnormality or ARIA. Aducanumab has been generally well tolerated in patients with Alzheimer's disease with ARIA being the primary safety and tolerability finding. The goal of EVOLVE is to test the hypothesis in a prospectively design study that continuation of dosing with aducanumab in the absence of symptoms does not have clinically impactful safety outcomes. We expect this study to begin by the end of the year. Beyond beta amyloid, we are advancing a number of assets targeting tau, which we believe plays an important and complementary role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Specifically, we continue to advance BIIB076 and BIIB092 both anti-tau antibodies, as well BIIB080, an antisense oligonucleotide targeting tau production. We expect full data from the Phase 1 study of BIIB076 in early 2020. Turning to MS and neuroimmunology. This quarter we completed enrolment of FFINITY, a 72 week Phase 2b study of opicinumab as an add-on therapy to disease modifying therapies for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Opicinumab is a first-in-class human monoclonal antibody directed against LINGO-1 and is being evaluated to determine its potential for improving pre-existing disability in relapsing MS patients through remyelination. Enrolment of FFINITY was completed approximately seven months ahead of schedule and we expect data in mid 2020. We continue to advance diroximel fumarate or BIIB098 in collaboration with Alkermes, as a new oral option that may provide benefit to many MS patients. We are currently enrolling patients in Part B of the head-to-head tolerability study versus TECFIDERA with data expected in mid 2019. This study is employing an adaptive trial design in which results from Part A are used to inform Part B and we have used this approach to update the endpoints and increase the sample size by 80 patients to 500. In parallel, Alkermes expects to submit the NDA for BIIB098 to the FDA by the end of this year, potentially positioning us for U.S. approval by early 2020. We are committed to expanding our leadership position in multiple sclerosis and we believe the next generation fumarate is an important part of our strategy. Earlier this month, Biogen presented data in over 70 oral and poster presentations at the 34th Congress of the European Committee for treatment and research in MS or ECTRIMS in Berlin. Key updates included results from the ENDORSE study, which demonstrate that the clinical benefits of TECFIDERA in newly diagnosed patients were maintained throughout nine years of continuous treatment. Additionally, an analysis from the TYSABRI observational programs reinforced the long-term safety and consistent effectiveness of TYSABRI over 10 years. We also presented data on serum neurofilament light or NfL, as a biomarker of disease activity in MS. Data indicated that serum NfL levels above a certain threshold were associated with gadolinium lesion count and new T2 lesion development. The number of patients with serum NfL levels above this threshold was significantly decreased following treatment with disease modifying therapies, particularly TYSABRI. Turning to our progress in movement disorders. This quarter we completed enrolment of a Phase 2 study of our anti-tau antibody BIIB092 for the treatment of progressive Supranuclear Palsy, a rare and devastating neurodegenerative disease in which tau pathology is believed to be the primary driver of neurodegeneration. BIIB092 has been granted fast track designation by the FDA and results from this 52 week study are expected in the second half of next year. Combined with our potentially best-in-class anti-alpha-synuclein antibody BIIB054 which is actively enrolling in a Phase 2 study for Parkinson's disease, we are leveraging our core neuroscience expertise to build depth in movement disorders. We also see strong R&D momentum within neuromuscular disorders. We continue to build on the growing body of clinical evidence for SPINRAZA as the standard-of-care and spinal muscular atrophy. Earlier this month at the Annual Congress of the World Muscle Society, we presented new interim results from NURTURE, an ongoing open label single arm efficacy and safety study of SPINRAZA in pre symptomatic infants with genetically diagnosed SMA. As of May, all patients in the study were alive and none required tracheostomy or permanent ventilation. 22 of 25 participants were able to walk either with assistance or independently according to the motor milestones standard of the World Health Organization and all were able to sit without support. Additionally, assessment of bullbar function revealed that 22 of 25 patients achieved a maximal score on the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination Section 1 evaluation of the ability to suck and swallow. Participants were also evaluated for motor function using the CHOP INTEND scale, out of a maximum of 64 points, mean CHOP INTEND scores were 62.6 per study participants with three copies of the SMN2 gene and 61.0 for those with two copies of the gene. We believe these data underscore the unprecedented efficacy profile of SPINRAZA as the standard-of-care in SMA with many patients achieving milestones consistent with normal development. We estimate that the majority of the treatable infant population is already being treated with SPINRAZA across multiple geographies. In our efforts to support the broad use of SPINRAZA, we are working with the SMA community to enable intrathecal dosing for patients with scoliosis or spinal fusions. We have seen meaningful progress in the field, including a recent publication out of Phoenix Children's Hospital outlining a potential treatment paradigm to those patients with complex spines. This site noted the successful administration of 104 doses amongst 26 children with 100% technical success, utilizing techniques such as imaging directed injection or catheter placement for patients with complex spines. We are highly encouraged by the strong response to the SMA a clinical community and excellent outcomes that have been achieved to make intrathecal delivery a routine procedure for SMA patients. Today, we estimate there have been over 30,000 injections of SPINRAZA performed globally and we believe intrathecal injections may become widely used for severe neurological diseases beyond SMA. As previously communicated, the IND for our SMA gene therapy program is currently on clinical hold in the US. Through additional interactions with the FDA, we have learned that the agency has questions regarding our preclinical data package. We are disappointed with these developments and we are currently assessing options to determine the extent to the viable [ph] path forward. Beyond SMA, we continue to progress our Phase 1 study of BIIB067 in ALS patients who harbor mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 or SOD1. The genetic cause of familial ALS. BIIB067 is an antisense oligonucleotide designed to directly target and reduce SOD1 expression. In addition to BIIB067, we have expanded clinical development within genetically defined subpopulations of ALS patients as we build depth in this indication. In collaboration with Ionis, this quarter we dosed the first patient in the Phase 1 trial of BIIB078, an antisense oligonucleotide designed to selectively target hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 gene or C9ORF72, the most common genetic cause of ALS. BIIB078 selectively target C9ORF72 transcripts that contain hexanucleotide repeat expansions for degradation and may thereby mitigate C9ORF72 mediated pathology. These programs highlight our continued commitment to targeting the genetic origins of severe neurological diseases, including ALS. Moving to acute neurology. We continue to advance BIIB093, our first-in-class IV glibenclamide therapeutic for the prevention and treatment of cerebral edema associated with large hemisphere infarction. In the third quarter we dosed the first patient in CHARM, the Phase 3 trial of BIIB093 and we look forward to progressing this novel therapeutic approach in the severe stroke population. Along with our Phase 2 TMS-007 program, we are encouraged by the potential to advance innovation in this area of significant unmet medical needs. Within neuropathic pain, we recently received the results from the Phase 2b study of vixotrigine or BIIB74 in painful lumbosacral radiculophathy or PLSR. While the safety data were consistent with the safety profile reported in previous studies, the study did not meet its primary or secondary efficacy endpoints and we will be discontinuing development in this challenging indication. We expect to report more detailed results of this study at a future scientific forum. We continue to roll a Phase 2 study in small fiber neuropathy. In parallel, we have continued our FDA interactions regarding the design of the potential Phase 3 studies in trigeminal neuralgia. We will delay phase 3 initiation as we await the outcome of these ongoing regulatory interactions, a more detailed review of the PLSR data and insights from the ongoing small fiber neuropathy study. Outside of our core neuroscience focus, we have continued to advance a small number of legacy programs where the science remains compelling and we believe we can continue to add value. Earlier today, we announced topline results from a Phase 2b study evaluating the safety and efficacy of dapirolizumab pegol, an anti-CD40 ligand pegylated Fab, in adults with moderately-to-severely active systemic lupus erythematosus despite receiving standard-of-care treatment such as corticosteroids, anti-malarials and non-biological immunosuppressants. The primary endpoint of the study to demonstrate a dose response at 24 weeks on the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group based Composite Lupus Assessment was not met with a p value of 0.06. The study did demonstrate consistent and potentially meaningful improvements for the majority of clinical endpoints in patients treated with dapirolizumab pegol compared with placebo. In addition, biomarker data demonstrated evidence of proof of biology. Dapirolizumab pegol was well tolerated and demonstrated an acceptable safety profile. We continue to further evaluate these data, while assessing potential next steps. In addition, this quarter we dosed the first patient in the Phase 2b study of BG11 otherwise known as STX-100, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the alpha v beta 6 integrin in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or IPF. The primary endpoint of this 52 week study is the yearly rate of change and Forced expiratory Vital Capacity and established measure of pulmonary function in IPF. BG11 previously demonstrated compelling proof of biology via substantial down regulation of the TGF beta pathway in IPF patients, as measured by inhibition of phosphorylated SMAD and alveolar macrophages isolated by bronchoalveolar lavage. Overall this quarter, the first patient in a Phase 3 stroke study put [ph] a compelling data supporting SPINRAZA is the standard-of-care in SMA, initiated two new clinical trials completed enrolment in two [ph] Phase 2 studies and continue to make rigorous data driven decisions on clinical development across our portfolio. Our aim is to continue building a portfolio momentum to realize our vision of being the neuroscience leader and transforming the lives of millions of patients living with neurological diseases. I will now pass the call to Jeff. Jeff Capello : Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. I'll now review our financial performance for the third quarter of 2013 starting with revenues. Total revenues for the third quarter were $3.4 billion, growing 12% year-over-year. Starting with our MS franchise revenues. Overall our MS business delivered revenues of $2.3 billion in the third quarter of 2018, including OCREVUS royalties for approximate $137 million. MS revenues in the third quarter of 2018 were down 3% versus the per year with OCREVUS royalties and were relatively stable including OCREVUS royalties. In the U.S., channel inventory levels were relatively stable for TECFIDERA, AVONEX and PLEGRIDY combined. Versus prior year foreign exchange rates and hedging had a minimal impact on ex U.S. MS product revenues for the third quarter. Global third quarter TECFIDERA revenues were $1.1 billion, a 2% increase versus the prior year. This included revenues of $842 million in the U.S., an increase of 1% versus the third quarter of 2017 and $248 million outside the U.S., an increase of 6% versus the third quarter of 2017. On a year-over-year basis, TECFIDERA revenues were relatively stable in the U.S. versus the decline we saw in the first and second quarters. In addition, we were very pleased with TECFIDERA\u2019s performance outside the U.S., driven by year-over-year patient growth across each large European market, solid emerging market growth and particularly strong performance in Japan where TECFIDERA has now reached over 25% market share. Even though trends outside the U.S. were strong, it's important to note that Q3 x U.S. TECFIDERA revenues were negatively impacted by ongoing price decreases in certain European countries. TYSABRI world wide revenues were $470 million this quarter, relatively stable versus the third quarter 2017. This included $253 million in U.S. and $217 million outside the U.S. In the U.S. revenues declined 5% versus the prior year, primarily due to the launch of OCREVUS. TYSABRI\u2019s relative performance continues to improve on a year-over-year basis after declining 8% in the second quarter 2018 and 18% in the first quarter of 2018 versus prior year. Outside the U.S., TYSABRI revenues increased 7% versus the prior year. TYSABRI patients increased in all major European markets versus prior year except for Germany where we have seen a moderate impact from the launch of OCREVUS. TYSABRI also benefited from strong double-digit patient growth in emerging markets. Interferon revenues including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY were $590 million from the third quarter, a decrease of 11% versus the third quarter of 2017. This decline was primarily driven by lower volumes, as the market continues to move towards orals and high efficacy therapy's. Interferon revenues included $421 million in the U.S. and $169 million in sales outside the U.S. Overall, MS revenues, including our royalties on sales of OCREVUS were stable versus prior year. Moving forward, we expect continued stability through the balance of the year, as we expect the OCREVUS impact to be less significant on a year-over-year basis and we anticipate a moderate inventory channel build in the fourth quarter in the U.S. Let me now move to SPINRAZA. Global third quarter SPINRAZA revenues were $468 million. This included revenues of $220 formerly in the U.S., representing 9% growth as compared to the second quarter and $244 million outside the U.S., representing 12% growth compared to the second quarter. The number of patients on therapy in the U.S. increased by over 10%, as compared to the end of the second quarter. Discontinuations remained relatively low and continue to be driven primarily by mortality. We continue to believe there is significant opportunity in adults in the U.S. and are very encouraged by the progress we're making. The number of adults on therapy in the U.S. grew by over 20% versus [ph] the second quarter and in the third quarter are - over half the new patient starts in the U.S. were adults. In the U.S., we estimate we now have reached approximately 50% of all infants and pediatric patients. And we estimate we've reached approximately 15% of adults, an increase from approximately 10% in the second quarter. We estimate that about a third of our U.S. patients on therapy are now adults. As a reminder, our data indicate that approximately 5% of the prevalent SMA population are infants, 35% are pediatric patients and 60% are adults, highlighting the large number of untreated adult patients that we believe could benefit from SPINRAZA. We saw a continued increase in the revenue contribution from maintenance doses this quarter. In U.S. approximately 60% of SPINRAZA units in the third quarter were attributed to maintenance doses, as compared to 55% in the second quarter. In the third quarter the average doses per patient was approximately 1.1, roughly the same as the second quarter. In the third quarter approximately 15% of U.S. SPINRAZA units were dispensed through our pre-drug program, similar to the second quarter and a decrease from approximately 20% a year ago. We continue to see improved insurance coverage in U.S., as policies broaden their coverage criteria. We believe the inventory levels for SPINRAZA were relatively flat in the third quarter. We saw an increase in discounts and allowances for approximately 100 basis points versus the second quarter, due primarily to increased treatment through 340B hospitals. If a similar pre-drug percentage is maintained and with continued progress in treating adults, we expect to show stability in U.S. SPINRAZA revenues in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, recognizing there may be some seasonal dynamics impacting quarterly revenue trends. Outside the U.S., the number of commercial SPINRAZA patients increased approximately 29% versus the prior quarter and there are approximately 290 patients active in the expanded access program. We recorded revenues from over 30 international markets with approximately 75% of ex-U.S. SPINRAZA revenue in the third quarter coming from Germany, Italy, Japan, Brazil, Spain, France and Australia. We continue to believe that the international opportunity for SPINRAZA is even greater than in U.S., as we continued the momentum of the new country launches and we believe there is significant ex-U.S. opportunity not just in Europe, but also in Asia-Pacific and Latin American markets. We expect to see continued revenue growth ex-U.S. for SPINRAZA in Q4, as patient growth continues, although at a more modest rate in more mature markets. Let me now move onto our biosimilars business, which generated $135 million in revenue this quarter, a 33% increase versus the prior year. We believe that there are now more than 100,000 patients treated with our biosimilars in Europe. BENEPALI continues to be the market leader in countries such as the U.K., Denmark and Norway and exceeds 40% volume share in Germany, Italy and Sweden. FLIXABI volumes grew by 19% versus the second quarter, mostly in Italy. Last week we launched IMRALDI, a biosimilar referencing HUMIRA which is now available to several European markets. Overall we expect relatively stable biosimilars revenue in fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Turning to our anti-CD20 revenues. We recorded $512 million in third quarter, an increase of 26% versus the prior year, primarily driven by OCREVUS royalties. This includes our estimated OCREVUS royalties of $137 million for the third quarter. It's important to note that typically the fourth quarter with an inventory drawdown for RITUXAN. In addition, we continue to monitor [ph] potential new biosimilar entrants which could begin impacting RITUXAN revenues in 2019. Total other revenues were $147 million in the third quarter more than three times what we recorded in the third quarter 2017, as we continue to benefit from greater contract manufacturing. As a reminder, we believe that the fourth quarter of 2017 revenues were abnormally high due the timing of contract manufacturing, creating a difficult comparison for the fourth quarter this year. Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin were 87%, a slight decrease from the second quarter due to higher contract manufacturing. Q3 GAAP non-GAAP R&D expense were both 15% of revenue or $580 million [ph] Q3 GAAP SG&A was $498 million and Q3 non-GAAP SG&A was 495 million, both 14% of revenue. We expect both R&D and SG&A expense to increase in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter due to the timing of clinical trial expense and market expansion investments, as well seasonality. GAAP amortization was $282 million, which includes a $189 million impairment related to updates and the development status of [indiscernible] which Mike discussed. The effects of this impairment were partially offset by a $90 billion reduction in our contingent consideration liability. GAAP other net income was $115 million in the third quarter versus a net expense of $44 million in Q3 of last year. This includes a GAAP only gain of approximately $141 million, related to changes in the fair value of certain equity investments, including shares of Ionis Pharmaceuticals, as of September 30th, 2018. Non-GAAP other net expense was $26 million in the third quarter versus $44 million in the third quarter of last year. In Q3 our GAAP tax rate was approximately 20% and our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 21%. Our weighted average diluted share count in the third quarter was approximately 202 million shares. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. However, our board has authorized a new $3.5 billion share repurchase program. This now brings us to our diluted earnings per share. In the third quarter we booked GAAP earnings per share with $7.15, an increase of 24% versus last year and non-GAAP earnings per share of $7.40, an increase of 17% versus last year. We generated approximately $1.7 billion of net cash flows from operations in the third quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.7 billion in cash and marketable securities and $5.9 billion in debt. We believe we have and will continue to have ample capacity to rescue meaningful future business development and M&A activity, as well as return capital to shareholders. We will continue to be disciplined in our approach and focused on value creation. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Michel for his closing comments. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you, Jeff. We closed the third quarter with double-digit revenue and earnings growth versus a year ago, an exciting progress across our pipeline. And last week we launched a new biosimilar. Looking forward within the next 12 to 18 months, we expect further progress across our neuroscience pipeline, including Eisai's presentation of the BAN241 data this week at CTAD and assessing next steps. Data readouts across Alzheimer's, including the final Phase 3 data for aducanumab, as well as MS, PSP, ophthalmology and ALS and filing for regulatory approval in the U.S. for BIIB098 in MS. And using the updated NURTURE data as the most recent example, we continue to see compelling evidence across the neuroscience landscape that leads us to believe we are at the beginning of a period of transformative breakthroughs in the treatment of neurological diseases. We believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from these potential breakthroughs and Biogen score is to be the long-term leader in neuroscience. To deliver [ph] on our aspiration we remain focused on executing well on strategic priorities to fortify our in MS and SMA and allocate capital to expand and progress our neuroscience pipeline, while opportunistically returning capital to shareholders. Finally, I want to reiterate our commitment to maximizing returns to our shareholders and bringing innovative therapies to patients over the long-term. These demands [ph] as we continue to allocate capital efficiently, effectively and appropriately. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will always strive to have an optimal capital structure, as well as aim for super returns from the investment we are making. Once again, I would like to thank our employees around the world, who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patient\u2019s lives. And all of the physician [indiscernible] and participants in our clinical development programs [ph], our past and future achievements could not be realized without their passion and commitment. With that, we\u2019ll open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Michel, I think we've all asked Biogen's R&D leaders on this in the past and I'm curious to get your view on this, which is, do you think BAN2401s previously reported results at higher doses were entirely driven by a baseline imbalance on care status?. And based on everything we've seen to date, is Biogen willing to pay for Phase 2 and BAN or is there a way to opt out? Michel Vounatsos : Thanks for the question, Umer. We have seen the data obviously, but we have two days to wait for the 25th in Barcelona. So we have to be patient and Eisai\u2019s presentation we give a slide on the next steps. Please understand. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham : Hey, guys. Good morning and thanks for the question. On aducanumab looking at the 3Q slides versus prior periods, this is the first time you guys have noticed that the Phase 3 data for ENGAGE and EMERGE is \u201cfinal\u201d. Am I reading too much into that? I am just thinking about the willingness to take an interim look? And related on the EVOLVE study, what was the driver for initiating the Phase 2, was it regulatory ongoing analysis or just - a Phase 3 or is it pre-planned? Thank you. Al Sandrock : Hi Geoff, its Al Sandrock. Well, I wouldn't read too much into that statement about final analysis. We're not commenting on whether or not we're going to do an interim analysis and help you understand the main reason for that is that we want to maintain clinical trial integrity. On the drivers for EVOLVE, it really wasn't driven by a regulatory request. It was our desire to see whether or not MRI monitoring was necessary. So in this study you know, what we're looking - what we're doing is, all symptomatic ARIA is being addressed the way it is now in the current clinical trials. It's really how you deal with the asymptomatic ARIA, which is what the study is looking at and whether or not the MRI monitoring that's being done is actually necessary. And so that's the main purpose. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink. Please go ahead. Geoffrey Porges : Thank you very much for taking my quick question, Just a couple of data ones. Could you clarify the contribution of net price to your U.S. market and product performance? And then secondly, could you give us some commentary on SPINRAZA treatment persistence by Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3 patients so far? Thanks. Jeff Capello : Hi, Geoff. Its Jeff. So from a pricing perspective in U.S. and MS, we had a slight benefit from a pricing perspective in the U.S. that benefited our products within the quarter based on pricing increases earlier in the year. Al Sandrock : And Geof, just commenting on the question on SPINRAZA treatment persistence across SMA types. In our experience, essentially there's been a very durable and persistent treatment effect of SPINRAZA across all types. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Matthew Harrison : Great, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, I was hoping for a little bit more clarity on what was going on with the SMA gene therapy product and maybe specifically if you could also address that do you think the preclinical observations are centered specifically on this program or do they impact your broader gene therapy pipeline? Thanks. Al Sandrock : Hi, Matthew. I'll take that question. I mean, we're not really going to comment on ongoing FDA interactions. I would say of course those interactions are program specific, but we won't really discuss details about those interactions at this point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Ying Huang : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. To an extent you can comment - can you confirm whether you will interact with FDA about BAN2401 for Phase 3 strategy or even filing for that based on Phase 2b or not. If you cannot answer that, I would like to ask a question about SMA. We have seen data from both Roche and Norvartis on their oral programs, given the setback of you gene therapy program, does that change your strategy about future development in SMA, trying to maintain a leadership here? Thanks. Al Sandrock : Hi. This is Al. I\u2019ll take the first part. We're not commenting on regulatory interactions, that we\u2019re basically in the middle of right now, so I can't answer your first question, sorry. Michael Ehlers : And I'll take the question on the Roche oral and SMA commitment, I mean just to be completely clear we remain highly committed to SMA. We follow other programs and experimental therapeutics and development. We are aware of the data that Roche and PTC have presented around their oral compound. We know that the field is very interested in the long-term safety and tolerability of that compound as are we. I would say that our - the most recent NURTURE data that I mentioned really highlights the compelling efficacy profile of SPINRAZA and you know, when we look across just the clinical experience to date, I would remind that while we were very interested in - I think it's roughly 21 Type 1, 35 Type 2, Type 3 patients in the Roche PTC study, it had nearly 6000 patients for close to up to six years in some instances of patients on SPINRAZA. So we have the largest body of clinical evidence for any SMA therapy. Michel Vounatsos : If I may, this is Michel. I just wanted to add that we are adding momentum in the U.S. in penetrating the idle h population. And this was unsure at the beginning of the year, uncertain at the beginning of the year and ex-U.S. we have staggering launches in different geographies and if in some, we may see some of the effect we are seeing in the U.S., following the first year of dosing. There are plenty of countries that are being here where we are launching. We just filed in China, for example, we are unlocking patient population also in Latin America. We are doing extremely well in Japan and continue to well in core Europe. So the momentum is good, but again, the biggest satisfaction is the implementation capability in the U.S. in the 65% of the market that has adult [ph] population. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Cory Kasimov : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you can comment on the 2019 pricing outlook for your MS franchise based on your formulary negotiations? Thanks. Michel Vounatsos : Unfortunately we will not be able to comment on price. We see the magnitude and the frequency of price being taken in the marketplace in the past, but we cannot comment on the future. Thanks for understanding. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Michael Yee : Great. Thanks for the question. Question on biosimilars. You made a comment that obviously you are launching the HUMIRA biosimilar, but that fourth quarter I guess, biosimilars would be stable. Can you just comment on A, your outlook on a HUMIRA biosimilar versus the type of business you're doing Enbrel business? And then more importantly, where do you think this $500 million business can go over the next few years, given you've obviously made some bullish comments on that? Thanks. Michael Ehlers : So Michael, we\u2019re pretty excited about the launch, the team has already hit the ground. I think they're very well-prepared and we'll see some contribution, we believe in the in the fourth quarter. You know, a lot of those contracts, big contracts in Europe are tenders that take a little bit while to kind of ramp up. That's why you won't see as much of an impact in the fourth or quarter. There's also some pricing pressure across some of the other two lines that we\u2019re - there on. So it kind of negates the benefit we'll get - expect to get from a morality perspective. But we think this business has the opportunity to potentially double over the next couple of years based on morality and we'd like as we said before based on a relationship with Bioepis to add more compounds. So we believe that this is a good growth opportunity for us and we're quite excited about the future. Michel Vounatsos : So this is not the first entity in there that is being launched in Europe, this is the third one. And I would say the purchase pattern and the journey is well set for those countries in terms of two big categories. The one that \u2013 from tenders and the one for which decision is left more the physician levels. So we anticipate that to be adalimumab biosimilar we\u2019ll penetrate [ph] at least as strong as the previous one, even stronger. And I would like to remind you that we are the only company having the three anti-TNFs in the marketplace. So the team is already motivated, supply is ready and while we speak prescriptions are going up. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Phil Nadeau : Morning. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask another one on SPINRAZA competition. It sounds like your expectations for growth for SPINRAZA, especially in the U.S. are largely from the adult population, it does seem like Roche and PTC with an oral compound could have a key differentiating feature for that population. So how do you see competition coming in \u2013 in the adult population and how could you differentiate SPINRAZA for those patients? Thanks. Michael Ehlers : So Phil, maybe I'll start another may have a comment here too. I mean, in essence we \u2013 we\u2019re very confident in what we see with the clinical data on SPINRAZA. We're encouraged by the - the ongoing studies in teens and adults that we see in the access, including in complex spine patients, SPINRAZA. But we're very aware of the other competitive programs out there. It's early days and in lot of those. And like I mentioned we know the field is very interested in the long-term safety and tolerability of the orals. We know that there are questions around the dose selection that will ultimately be used there. And to date it's a relatively small number of patients, but we are certainly staying aware of it. Michel Vounatsos : So we were able somehow together with the physicians to deliver 30,000 dosing of SPINRAZA during the past month is because in real world there is an efficacy perception at the patient level. So its an efficacy play for those patients who are just the right [indiscernible] and the convenience comes after, this is what is being was backed by the customers. So with 3000 patients being dosed and more than 300 patients in clinical trial, we had a body of evidence that is still difficult to match for the time being. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with UBS. Please go ahead. Carter Gould : Morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess for Jeff or Michel, just on the BASR versus committing for BD [ph], obviously, you\u2019ve been pretty active so far this year on the BD front. So maybe just kind of how you see that balance and I guess looking out the next sort of 12 to 18 months, how you see that may be evolving? Thank you. Jeff Capello : Yes. So thanks for the question. So you know, I think the nice position we're in is given our cash flows, we generate $1.7 billion of cash flow for the quarter again which is strong cash flow and given our net debt position. We have the luxury of being able to do both, both to invest in the business from a pipeline perspective and return capital to shareholders. So we've now done eight acquisitions and licensing type deals/acquisitions since Michel is been CEO, so we\u2019re very encouraged by that and we expect to do more. A lot of that been done kind of in the - in the early to mid stage. We'd love to get something later stage done. But we also have ample cash capacity to return capital to shareholders. We bought back $10 billion of stock over the last couple of years and I would just remind investors that we have a new $3.5 billion share repurchase program that the board has recently authorized. So we have ample capacity to do both. Certainly we would be a preference to get more done in the pipeline and get more done that\u2019s later stage. So certainly that would be kind of the focus or the preference, but we have the capacity to do both. Michel Vounatsos : So if you look at the momentum that Biogen is able to deliver, year-to-date, if I am not mistaken is 12% on the topline and with leverage P&L. This was not anticipated two years ago because of OCREVUS launch, because of limited potential of SPINRAZA, because of neglected biosimilars and the rest. And here we are. So we're not on a burning platform and the level of rigor and alignment to the strategy, to the scientific validity, to the IP and to financials criteria remained very rigorous within the organization and even more importantly, we have some very important readouts in the coming months. So in the meantime we deliver, we tightened the belt and we're evaluating opportunities, but in a very best manner. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Salim Syed with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Salim Syed : Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. This one's for probably Mike or Al, just on the XLRS gene therapy program. Can you confirm that we're still getting topline data in the fourth quarter of this year? And what are you looking for in terms of deeming the trial a success? Thank you. Al Sandrock : Yes. So thanks for the question on this. So you know, right now on the XLRS program, we recall that this is a collaborative program with AGTC. The kind Phase1/2 trial is ongoing. This is an adult subsequent [ph] XLRS and at the moment we are anticipating that we could get a data readout projected in the first part of next year or so. But of course, these are always dependent on timing and enrolment of the right subjects. We're also very interested in no differences for example in the adult versus pediatric population this disease or some heterogeneity. As you may know in kind of the path of - pathology in XLRS because it has to do with exact location of the retina, specific visual endpoints you need and so forth. But to date the program is on track. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Citi. Please go ahead. Robyn Karnauskas : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So from your from your presentation it's \u2013 there is a lot on your pipeline, that it feels like you're focused on \u2013 and just trying to understand a little bit, as we see all these reads that are going to come out over the next 12 to 18 months, excluding Alzheimer's programs, which do you think have been the greatest ability to have a read to Phase 3. In other words, like - will give you the most confidence that there is a real proof of concepts or proof of potential success for those indications, as historically we know if something works for Biogen with your leverage the stock's ability to go up a lot. So help us understand which are those you think are the least risky and have the greatest read to the next stage of development? Michael Ehlers : Okay. So this is Michael. I'll try to take some of that. Thank you by the way for the question. I mean, as we show - I mentioned and so we do have a number of upcoming data readouts at different stages across the pipeline that have, I\u2019d say different ramifications. A few things that we noted there is that we will start getting data on our BIIB67, SOD1 ALS program either towards the end of the year or early next year. This we think will be important primarily as a second leasing ASO program, in this case an adult indication with a different mechanism of action in the RNase H mediated knockdown of a pathological gene target. So we're very interested to see the biomarker and potential clinical efficacy data from that. That likewise has the potential to influence our thinking on other genetic targeted ASO programs like BIIB078, like I mentioned C9ORF72 positive ALS, as well as our tau ASO program which is currently in Phase 1 study in Alzheimer's disease. But I see there are more. We are - we have been very successful in advancing our BIIB092 program in progressive super nuclear policy. This is obviously a rare severe orphan disease. So I think this could give us an accelerator opportunity. And beyond that we're \u2013 we\u2019ve initiated our Phase 3 study in BIIB093, so that will be ongoing. And although it's really first of its kind you know, we're very encouraged by the responsive side. And of course, you know, we announced that earlier this year that we completed enrolment in ENGAGE and EMERGE - aducanumab which is an 18 month dosing period study. That among others I think constitute an array of upcoming data readouts and have the potential to create significant excitement. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Ronny Gal : Good morning, everybody and thank you for hitting me in. Two questions for Mike on the pipeline. Mike, first the BIIB104 AMPA regulator. AMPA is been particularly difficult target to drug. Can you discuss a little bit how you convinced yourself you can avoid the toxicity that has been seen with this target before? And second about 093 [ph] glyburide program. Essentially, is this one of those programs that has the potential of reading out early? Is there interim analysis here? You kind of think about stroke or something you can accumulate there pretty quickly, how you're thinking about a potential of this program to actually readout head of time? Michael Ehlers : Okay, thanks, Ronny for the questions and I\u2019ll try to take these briefly. On BIIB104 what we were encouraged by there was - was really a quite differentiated and tight pharmacokinetic profile and safety profile that have been reserved both pre-clinically and clinically. It was really quite different from previous or earlier generation AMPA PAMs. So to date the clinical and preclinical data that have been seen have supported a favorable tolerability profile, as well as showing indications of efficacy in a few different clinical studies and of different designs in the domain of working memory and cognition. So we think there are differentiating features that have to do with some of the very specific pharmacology of this compound versus others previously in the class. So we think is differentiated. On BIIB093, we won't talk about an interim analysis on that, but I would say is that we have had a very strong response on site engagement, site activation and investigator interests because obviously there has been really no alternative for patients having a large hemispheric infarc. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terence Finn with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Terence Finn : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just first on the financials, I was wondering if you can help us think about your tax rate heading into \u201919, you guys - it looks like you\u2019ve continue to bring that lower throughout the course of the year. And then any guidance on the operating margins for the biosimilars franchise that you can offer at this point? And then just one on the pipeline for 8700, you mentioned some new endpoints in that study. Can you just review what changed there? Thanks. Jeff Capello : Thanks. So with regard to the tax rate, we're currently running at low 20% tax rate, as I mentioned in the script. We did mention when tax reform first got implemented that we expected the tax rate to come down again in 2019, as a result of some accounting factors that are more unique to kind of how our tax works around the world. We still expect that to be the case and we'll be able to provide you a more specific expectation on that when we release guidance in January for 2019. In terms of operating expenses, as I mentioned you know, we expect the fourth quarter to tick up a little bit as we continue to invest in the pipeline and drives some of the growth that we're seeing from a commercial perspective in SMA. We're still in the middle of kind of going through our planning process for next year. What I can share with you is based on the strength of our lean and simple cost savings initiative, we expect to take money out of kind of the G&A area and invest that back into the pipeline, grow our spend and our and our projects with regard to R&D. So we are very committed to that continuing to increase the innovation in neurology of the company. Michael Ehlers : So I think it was a question on 8700, I am going to interpret that as BIIB098. Michel Vounatsos : Yes. Michael Ehlers : If that's not asking, but I\u2019ll just say that on BIIB098 we have used data from the Part A of the study to inform Part B where we've expanded the patient - patient number in the head to head study against TECFIDERA, where again we anticipate that we'll be able to file on this data this year looking an approval potentially in the first half of next year or mid next year. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Chris Raymond : Thanks for squeezing me in. Yes, just another question on BIIB098. Just on the strategy here, I do think this launch could be kind of unique. So you filing under 505 B2 pathway, but you will have a head to head versus TECFIDERA on tolerability, which you talked about. Some of our work indicates that you know that's kind of you know one of the bigger reasons for discontinuation of TECFIDERA tolerability issue. So if BIIB098 sort of repeat the clinical data we've seen so far that should address you know, essentially a big issue of TECFIDERA. So how do you approach the marketing and positioning of this drug and how should we think about these two drugs coexisting over time? And then also just on that point, I think in your slide you guys talk about a 2020 approval, but I think I just heard you guys mentioned that or maybe second half 2019 approval, can you sort of talk about that timing? Thanks. Michel Vounatsos : Thanks for the great question. And the first I would like to say that we are pleased with the momentum behind TEC . I think this is important. So TEC will remain always front end center. We are doing well. We grow the volume even if we price, we face some crushing pressure in part of the world like in Europe and we have increasing competition. So BIIB098 will offer the opportunity eventually to have a an upgrade in terms of safety profile and GI safety and this will be eventually the low hanging fruit that we aim to move further. And the team is working towards the longer term lifecycle management opportunities that these product offers beyond the fumarate. So is what we're working on. But we are very excited about this opportunity and to expand our leading share of orals, but beyond the fumarate market. So looking forward to this filing and potentially launch towards the end of \u201819 or early 2020. Michel Vounatsos : So at this stage, I would like to close the call by saying a very exciting times that Biogen we are looking forward to the data readouts and I thank you all for attending our call today. Have a good day. Matt Calistri : Thank you for joining today's call. Before we conclude, I would like to remind everyone that we plan to host three webcast from CTAD later this week, on Thursday October 25th at 730 a.m. Eastern Time. We will webcast the keynote presentation from Samantha Budd Haeberlein, Vice President, Alzheimer's disease, dementia and movement disorders later stage clinical development, titled what we learned from Aducanumab. Later that day at 4 :15 p.m. Eastern Time we will host an Investor Q&A webcast to discuss the Alzheimer's portfolio with Dr. Al Sandrock, our Chief Medical Officer and Samantha Budd Haeberlein and on Friday October 26 at 9 :15 a.m. Eastern Time we will webcast the oral presentation titled aducanumab titration dosing regiment, 36 month analysis from PRIME, a Phase 1b study in patients with early Alzheimer's disease. The links to those webcast can be found on the Investor section of Biogen\u2019s website at www.biogen.com. Thank you and we look forward to speaking with you in the future. Operator : Thank you to everyone for attending today. This will conclude today's call and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Financial Results and Business Update Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please limit yourself to one question to allow other participants time for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Matt Calistri, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Matt Calistri : Thank you and welcome to Biogen's fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the Risk Factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Michael Ehlers, EVP of Research and Development; and our CFO, Jeff Capello. We will also be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Al Sandrock. Before I conclude, I would also like to remind everyone, that we now post releases related to earnings calls and Investor Events on the Investors section of Biogen's website, www.biogen.com. And issue a statement on Twitter when they become available. We do this instead of publishing earnings releases and any releases related to Investor Events and earnings calls via Newswire services. Our Twitter handle is @biogen. Now, I will turn the call over to Michel. Michel Vounatsos : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First let me start with some financial highlights. Biogen closed 2018 with an all-time high in quarterly revenues of $3.5 billion, an increase of approximately 7% compared to the same period a year ago. For the full year 2018, Biogen generated another all-time high of $13.5 billion in revenues, representing growth of 10% year-over-year. Full year 2018 GAAP earnings were $21.58 a share, an 81% increase versus full year 2017. Full year 2018 non-GAAP earnings were $26.20 a share, a 20% increase versus full year 2017. We are pleased with this strong year-over-year growth as we continue to execute on our strategy to solidify our long-term leadership position in neuroscience. Now, let me review the year. First, full year MS revenues including OCREVUS royalties were $9.1 billion demonstrating resilience. The number of patients on our MS products globally remained relatively stable versus the prior year. Importantly, we continued to see improving trends for our MS business in the U.S. on a year-over-year basis. Second, SPINRAZA, which we pioneered in collaboration with Ionis as the first treatment for SMA, generated full year global revenues of $1.7 billion, and nearly double the revenues we delivered in 2017. This blockbuster performance was driven by strong year-over-year revenue growth in the U.S. and even greater revenue growth outside of the U.S. Over the past year, including the expanded access programs and clinical trials, we have more than doubled the number of patients on SPINRAZA to over 6,600 patients. SPINRAZA is the standard of care in SMA with approval in over 40 countries and formal reimbursement in 30 countries. Third, we continue to expand and progress our neuroscience pipeline with strong momentum, building depth in our core growth areas. We are leveraging the interconnectivity within neuroscience as we aim to create multiple franchises beyond MS, SMA, and Alzheimer's disease. 2018 was one of the most productive years we have had in research and development as we aim to further de-risk our pipeline and prepare for multiple potential launches in the early 2020s. Starting with our core growth areas, we made significant progress in our MS pipeline including an NDA submission to the FDA, initiating new life cycle management initiatives, and increasing investment in our R&D portfolio to develop potentially transformative new treatments, which Mike will discuss in more details. In Alzheimer's and dementia, we completed Phase 3 enrollment of aducanumab. We initiated a Phase 2 study of BIIB092 in Alzheimer's disease, and we announced topline results of BAN2401 with our partner Eisai. In neuromuscular disorders, we made impressive progress building depth. We acquired BIIB110, a muscle enhancement program from AliveGen. We initiated a Phase 1 study of BIIB078 targeting C9orf in ALS, and we announced positive Phase 1 interim results for BIIBO67 in SOD1 ALS. In movement disorders, we created strong momentum. We initiated a Phase 2 study of BIIB054 in Parkinson's disease, and we completed enrollment of our Phase 2 study of BIIB092 in PSP. In our emerging growth areas of acute neurology, neurocognitive disorders, and pain, we did initiate four new studies. We expanded our pipeline with the addition of BIIB104 for cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia and our option for TMS-007 for acute ischemic stroke. We are also advancing the program -- the Phase 3 program for BIIB093 in large hemispheric infarction with a potential to generate peak revenues of over $1 billion with initial launches as early as 2022. Moving on to our biosimilars business. Full year biosimilars revenues were $545 million, which represents 44% growth year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, we launched IMRALDI, our adalimumab biosimilar referencing Humira in several European markets. IMRALDI has generated $17 million in revenues since its launch in mid-October, making it our most successful first quarter launch of a biosimilar. Importantly, our cash generation remained very strong and continued to provide us with significant optionality and flexibility to allocate capital. In 2018, we spent a total of approximately $1.8 billion through six business [ph] development deals and the increase in our share of the Samsung Bioepis joint venture. We continue to diligently evaluate new opportunities for more potential business development and M&A. We also repurchased approximately 14.8 million shares for $4.4 billion, and we have about $2 billion remaining in our share repurchase program. In addition, we began 2019 with a new collaboration with Skyhawk Therapeutics with the aim of developing oral splicing modulator for multiple diseases, including MS and SMA. We continue to be financially disciplined, and we are focused on implementing a lean and simple operating model with the goal of continuous operational improvements. As we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to maximizing returns for our shareholders while continuing to bring innovative therapies to patients, something that demands a thoughtful approach towards all our investments over both the short term and long term. In summary, 2018 was clearly a very productive and successful year for Biogen, as we executed on our strategy and continued to deliver noticeable progress. Our core MS business demonstrated resilience, SPINRAZA continued to grow in the U.S. and even more outside of the U.S., and we remain committed to our goal of being the long-term standard of care in SMA.  We expanded and progressed our pipeline by adding six new clinical programs and completing enrollment of three late-stage studies. We grew our biosimilar business and launched IMRALDI in Europe. We are actively implementing a leaner and simpler operating model, and we are generating ample cash as we focus on strategically allocating capital to develop and build depth in our neuroscience portfolio, again with a goal of maximizing shareholder returns and bringing innovative therapies to patients. Overall, we continue to make progress towards our goal of building a multi-franchise neuroscience portfolio, and we are very excited about our upcoming data readouts. I would now turn the call over to Mike for a more detailed update on our recent progress in R&D. Michael Ehlers : Thank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone. Neuroscience is experiencing a revolution in science and medicine. There is no a large area of unmet needs and disease in the nervous system, and we believe that our focus on neuroscience offers a key strategic advantage. Before I discuss our pipeline in more detail, let me comment on our recent progress on building a multi-franchise neuroscience portfolio, supported by a broad range of therapeutic modalities. Complementing our expanded collaboration with Ionis delivers their antisense oligonucleotide platforms. Earlier this month, we announced a strategic set of collaborations with C4 Therapeutics and Skyhawk Therapeutics to discover and develop novels, small molecule approaches for neurological diseases. Our collaboration with C4 Therapeutics, we utilize C4's platform to discover small molecules and engage the endogenous ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system to selectively tag disease-causing potential for degradation. And through our collaboration with Skyhawk, we aim to discover small molecules capable of modulating RNA splicing at selective pre-messenger RNAs, including SMN2. With these collaborations, we have further expanded the breadth of modalities we are pursuing, which now includes biologics, antisense oligonucleotide, oral protein degraders and splicing modulators and gene therapy. As Michel discussed, looking over 2018, we added six clinical programs to our pipeline and transitioned five pipeline candidates from research to development. The same number as the previous year, which nearly doubled Biogen's historical productivity. Thus, once again, 2018 represented a substantial enhancement of our differentiated clinical portfolio of potential breakthrough medicines. Turning to advances in the fourth quarter. Let me start with the depth, we are building in neuromuscular disorders. Last month, we, along with our partner Ionis, received data from an interim analysis of the Phase 1 study of BIIB067 in the form of familial ALS. BIIB067 is antigens oligonucleotide, targeting superoxide dismutase 1 or SOD1, mutations in which confer a toxic gain of function and cause a familial form of ALS that constitutes approximately 2% of all ALS cases. This interim analysis demonstrated both proof-of-biology and proof-of-concept with the concordance across multiple clinical and biomarker endpoints. Specifically, at the highest dose tested, we saw a statistically significant lowering of SOD1 protein in the CSF with the p-value of 0.002 and a trend towards lowering of CSF neurofilament, a biomarker of axonal injury. And we observed a numerical trend across three dimensions of clinical efficacy, consistent with the potentially meaningful clinical benefit as compared to placebo. Specifically, we observed swelling of clinical decline as measured using the ALS Functional Rating Scale, slowing of decline in respiratory function as measured by slow vital capacity and slowing of decline in muscle strength as measured by handheld dynamometry. Based on these positive data, we plan to add an additional cohort to the study to further evaluate the highest dose. With very limited treatment options for this devastating genetic form of ALS, we believe this additional cohort could provide important new data to support the rapid path to registration. More broadly, we believe that these data have positive implications for additional antisense oligonucleotides in our pipeline, including BIIB078, which targets C9ORF72, BIIB080, which targets tau and up to two antisense oligonucleotides -- in clinic this year. Additionally, we believe that these data exemplify the depth we are building in neuromuscular disorders, including ALS and highlight the interconnectivity across our pipeline. Turning to SMA, as a leader in the space, we welcome additional therapeutic options for patients, including the potential launch of Novartis gene therapy, AVXS-101, which we believe will be initially indicated for infants. A number of questions remain for this experimental approach as data on the safety, efficacy and durability of AVXS-101 remain limited with the results reported to date for only 15 patients followed for up to 2.5 years, seven of whom are reported to have subsequently initiated treatment with SPINRAZA. This is, in contrast, to the SPINRAZA clinical trial program, which has included more than 300 patients followed for up to six years. It is important to note that there are significant differences in the age and severity of the patient population between the Sham Control ENDEAR study of SPINRAZA and the Phase 1 open-label study of AVXS-101. We believe that earlier treatment initiation positively impacts the clinical efficacy of agents designed to boost full length SMN protein production. Patients in the ENDEAR study were older with the mean age at first dose of 5.3 months, whereas participants in the Phase 1 open-label study of AVXS-101 initiated treatment earlier with a mean age of first dose of 3.4 months. Thus direct comparisons between these data sets are not scientifically valid. In addition to ENDEAR, we are very encouraged by the data from the NURTURE study of SPINRAZA in presymptomatic infants which shows patients on average achieving motor milestones consistent or nearly consistent with normal development. We believe these data, combined with the real world reports of significant efficacy across all patient types and ages, supports SPINRAZA remaining the standard-of-care in SMA even after the introduction of alternative modalities. Turning to MS and neuroimmunology. Biogen strategy to extend our leadership position in MS has focused on three strategic imperatives. First is the pursuit of next-generation therapies for relapsing form of MS while also advancing life cycle management for our current portfolio. Second, we aim to advance the care of progressive forms of MS by leveraging emerging insights and new drug targets. Third, we aim to slow or reverse disability progression and restore function through remyelination and excellent repair or protection. As Michel discussed, we've made significant progress this quarter across these imperatives, including submitting the NDA for diroximel fumarate, or VUMERITY, in the U.S. with head-to-head data versus TECFIDERA expected mid-year; reinitiating development of BIIBO61, a small molecule remyelination agent; dosing the first patient in the NOVA study; examining the efficacy of extended interval dosing of TYSABRI; and dosing the first patient in a bioequivalent study of intramuscular formulation of PLEGRIDY. For more details on each of these programs I encourage you to review our MS Investor Webcast held on December 12 of last year, which is available on our website. We also had exciting new developments with our industry-leading Alzheimer's disease and dementia portfolio. At the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease Meeting, or CTAD, we presented updated analysis of the long-term extension of the Phase 1b PRIME study of aducanumab which were generally consistent with previous analysis. In addition, there were no changes to the risk-benefit profile of aducanumab. We also showed data from the PRIME study suggesting that following treatment with aducanumab, the reduction in brain amyloid correlates with slowing of clinical decline. We expect final data from ENGAGE in EMERGE, the Phase 3 studies of aducanumab in early 2020. Also at CTAD, our collaboration partner Eisai presented additional analysis of the Phase 2 study of BAN2401. Data from pre-specified subgroup analysis showed that treatment with BAN2401 was associated with the reduction in brain amyloid as well as clinical benefit across subgroups of APOE genotype, clinical stage and concomitant use of AD medications. Importantly, while the study was not powered to show statistical significance in subgroup analysis, we believe there was evidence of clinical benefit in both APOE for carriers and non-carriers with small sample sizes potentially explaining the numerical differences in clinical efficacy between these subgroups. Overall, we continue to believe that the data from BAN2401 increases the probability of success for both this asset as well as aducanumab. BAN2401 and aducanumab share important features, distinguishing them from other anti-beta amyloid anybodies including specificity for binding aggregated forms of beta amyloid, full effector function, which we believe is important for inducing amyloid clearance by microglia, data demonstrating robust removal of amyloid plaque in humans and signals a potentially clinically meaningful slowing of cognitive decline across multiple measures. To our knowledge, amongst clinical a-beta antibodies only aducanumab and BAN2401 share these features. Together with Eisai, we are pursuing a large Phase 3 studies to confirm these findings including the planned initiation of a Phase 3 study of BAN2401 following the conclusion of ongoing regulatory dialogues. Eisai also presented safety and efficacy data from the Phase 2 study of elenbecestat, a small molecule base inhibitor being evaluated in two Phase 3 studies and in response to external data presented at CTAD suggesting that treatment with other base inhibitors has been associated with trends toward cognitive worsening, a cognitive safety monitoring plan has been implemented in the ongoing elenbecestat studies to ensure that patient safety is paramount. The independent Data Monitoring Committee has reviewed data from the Phase 3 studies and recommended that the studies proceed and we will continue to monitor safety, including cognitive safety, as the study progresses. Finally, given the evidence that the beta-amyloid pathology begins to accumulate in the brain decades prior to the clinical onset of Alzheimer's disease, I am pleased to announce that we along with our partner Eisai are planning to initiate a Phase 3 study to evaluate whether early use of aducanumab can prevent or delay the clinical onset of Alzheimer's disease. The study will include patients with evidence of amyloid pathology in the brain with or without subjective cognitive complaints. This represents an earlier phase of the disease, demonstrating studies in ENGAGE and EMERGE and is otherwise referred to as Stages 1 and 2 in the FDA draft guidance on treatment of early Alzheimer\u2019s disease. We look forward to sharing more details about this study in the near future. Moving to our progress in neuropathic pain. In October, we indicated that we have paused the initiation of the Phase 3 program of vixotrigine or BIIB074 in the state and use-dependent voltage-gated sodium channel blocker in trigeminal neuralgia. Now, based on recent feedback from the FDA, I am pleased to say that we are planning to initiate a Phase 3 program for the development of vixotrigine in trigeminal neuralgia by the end of the year. And in parallel, we continue to enroll a Phase 2 study of vixotrigine for small fiber neuropathy. Within neurocognitive disorders, last month we dosed the patient in the Phase 2b study of BIIB104 for the treatment of cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. BIIB104 is a first-in-class AMPA receptor potentiator that we believe has compelling data from a number of distinct early clinical studies, demonstrating functional circuit activation as measured by fMRI, treatment effects on relevant domains of cognitions such as working memory, short-term memory, verbal recall and reasoning, and the potential for favorable benefit risk profile. Broadly speaking, we believe neurocognitive impairment is a central node in the network of symptomatology that defines many neurological diseases. Therefore, we believe BIIB104 may have potential applicability in multiple diseases within our core and emerging growth areas. As we strive to be the neuroscience leader, we continue to prioritize our activities and build depth in what we believe are our most promising programs and disease areas. With that in mind, last month we made the strategy decision to terminate our collaboration with AGTC to develop AAV-based gene therapies for X-linked retinoschisis or XLRS and X-linked retinitis pigmentosa or XLRP based in part on recent clinical data in XLRS. We have also decided to terminate specific programs included in our collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania. To be clear, our SMA gene therapy program with UPenn, which remains on clinical hold with the FDA, is not affected by this decision. Overall, Biogen R&D delivered significant progress in 2018. We believe we are in a strong position today with four programs in Phase 3, 13 in Phase 2, and seven in Phase 1 with the deep pre-clinical pipeline across multiple modalities and we continue to generate clinical data that reinforce our commitment to neuroscience and the intrinsic interconnectivity of the space. For instance, we believe our recent positive date on BIIB067 in SOD1 ALS, resonate across our pipeline, supporting the depth we are building in ALS and highlighting the promise of our collaboration with Ionis to leverage the antisense oligonucleotide platform across a range of neurological disorders. And we don't stop there. To realize our vision of becoming the definitive leader in neuroscience, we look forward to continuing to invest in and advance our pipeline in asymmetric capabilities with the goal of developing innovative medicines with the potential to transform the lives of patients living with devastating neurological diseases. I will now pass the call to Jeff. Jeff Capello : Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Let me now provide some detail on our financial performance for 2018 and share with you our guidance for 2019. Let's start with revenues. As Michel mentioned earlier, we had a strong Q4 2018 from a revenue perspective. Total revenue for the fourth quarter grew 7% year-over-year or approximately $3.5 billion and grew 10% for the full year to $13.5 billion. Overall, our MS business delivered revenues of $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, including OCREVUS royalties for approximately $152 million. MS revenues in the fourth quarter of 2018 decreased 1% versus the prior year without OCREVUS royalties and increased 2% including OCREVUS royalties. In the U.S. MS revenues in the fourth quarter 2018 benefited from channel inventory build for approximately $115 million, compared to a build of approximately $15 million in Q4, 2017. Our U.S. business continued to show signs of stabilization in the fourth quarter, continuing the trends of improving year-over-year performance we saw throughout 2018. Full year MS revenues were $9.1 billion including OCREVUS royalties of approximately $478 million, representing a decrease of less than 1% versus the prior year. Excluding OCREVUS royalties, MS revenue decreased 4% versus the prior year. Full year 2018 MS revenues benefited by approximately $86 million versus the prior year due to changes in foreign exchange rates, net of hedging. Global fourth quarter TECFIDERA revenues were $1.1 billion, a 3% increase versus the prior year. This included revenues of $856 million in the U.S., an increase of 3% versus the fourth quarter 2017 and $254 million outside the U.S., an increase of 4% versus the fourth quarter of 2017. TECFIDERA benefited from increase in channel inventory in U.S. of approximately $65 million in the fourth quarter 2018 compared to an increase of approximately $40 million in Q4 2017. We were pleased to see continued relative stability in new prescriptions in U.S. as we have now anniversaried the launch of OCREVUS. Outside the U.S., we performed very well in Q4 2018 with double-digit volumes increases in Europe and Japan versus the prior year. Somewhat offset by pricing pressures in several European countries. For the full year, worldwide TECFIDERA revenues were $4.3 billion, an increase of 1% versus prior year. This included $3.3 billion in the U.S. and $1 billion in sales outside the U.S. The Interferon revenues including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY were $597 during the fourth quarter, a decrease of 7% versus of Q4 2017 due to continued shift from the injectable platforms to oral or high-efficiency therapies. This included $4.31 million in the U.S. and $166 million in sales outside the U.S. Within the U.S. AVONEX and PLEGRIDY benefited from the channel inventory build for approximately $40 million compared to a build of approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. For the full year, worldwide Interferon revenues were $2.4 billion, consisted of $1.7 billion in the U. S. and $695 million in sales outside the U.S. TYSABRI worldwide revenues were $464 million this quarter, stable versus the fourth quarter of 2017. This included $257 million in the U.S. and $208 million outside the U.S. In the U.S. revenues increased 2% versus of the prior year. Within the U.S. TYSABRI benefited from a channel inventory build of approximately $10 million compared to relatively stable inventory levels in the fourth quarter 2017. Within the fourth quarter, we saw continued improvement in TYSABRI performance in the U. S. with the highest new prescription share since the launch of OCREVUS. Outside the U.S. TYSABRI revenue increased 1% versus the prior year. For the full year, worldwide TYSABRI revenues were approximately $1.9 billion, a decrease of 6% versus the prior year, primarily due to the launch of OCREVUS. We recorded U.S. revenues of $1 billion in the U.S. and $839 million internationally. As expected across our MS business, we saw an increased discounts and allowances in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, primarily due to seasonality. Throughout 2019, we expect another couple hundred basis points of pressure on discounts and allowances with a typical seasonality in the first and fourth quarters. Overall, we were very pleased with the performance of our MS business in 2018 and are focused on maintaining the resilience of this franchise in light of new competition entering the market. We expect the rate of change in full year global MS product revenues excluding OCREVUS to be similar in 2019 versus 2018, mostly offset by expected growth of OCREVUS royalties. Additionally, we expect a potential inventory draw down in the first quarter of 2019. Let me now move on to SPINRAZA. Global fourth quarter SPINRAZA revenues were $470 million, a $30 million increase versus the prior year and relatively flat versus the third quarter. This included revenues of $236 million in U.S., an increase of 5% versus the third quarter and $234 million outside the U.S. a decrease of 4% versus Q3. For the full year 2018, worldwide SPINRAZA revenues were nearly double to $1.7 billion. This included $854 million in the U.S. and $870 million in sales outside the U.S. The number of patients on therapy in U.S. increased by 9% as compared to the end of third quarter of 2018 and discontinuations remained relatively low. In the U.S., we continue to make strong progress with adults. In the fourth quarter more than 50% of new starts were adults, increasing the total number of adult patients on SPINRAZA to nearly 1,000, an increase of approximately 20% versus the third quarter of 2018. We saw a continued increase in the revenue contribution from maintenance doses this quarter. In the U.S., approximately 65% of SPINRAZA units in the fourth quarter were attributed to maintenance doses as compared approximately 60% in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, approximately 15% of U.S. SPINRAZA units were dispensed through our pre-drug program, similar to the third quarter and a decrease from approximately 20% a year ago. Outside the U.S., the number of commercial SPINRAZA patients increased approximately 18% versus the prior quarter and there are approximately 260 patients active in the expanded access program. We recorded revenue from over 40 international markets in the fourth quarter. Despite overall -- excuse me, despite strong overall patient growth, fourth quarter ex-U.S. SPINRAZA revenue increase slightly versus the third quarter due to combination of lower volumes in certain markets due to lowing dose dynamics, the timing of shipments in certain distributor markets, and pricing dynamics in certain markets. In 2019, we expect global SPINRAZA revenues to grow in the mid to high-teens and we expect growth in both the U.S. and outside the U.S. We expect global SPINRAZA revenue to be relatively stable in Q1 2019 versus Q4 2018 due to seasonality followed by quarter-over-quarter growth. Outside of the U.S., we expect continued patient growth in 2019, although at a slower pace in 2018. Overall, we were very pleased with both the performance and outlook for SPINRAZA as we continue to believe it has delivered the best launch from an orphan drug ever and continue to deliver strong growth for the company. Let me now move to our biosimilars business, which generates $156 million revenue this quarter, an increase of 28% versus the prior year. Full year biosimilar revenues were $545 million, an increase of 44% versus the prior year. BENEPALI continue to be the market leader in countries such as U.K., Denmark and Norway, and became the market leader in the Germany in the fourth quarter. TYSABRI revenues grew 24% quarter-over-quarter. In October 17th, we launched IMRALDI, our biosimilar referencing HUMIRA. While it is too early to comment on specific share data, we can say that we are very pleased with IMRALDI sales performance in the first quarter in the market, in many cases surpassing the initial rate of uptake from BENEPALI With the launch of IMRALDI, Biogen became the first company to offer all of the three main anti-TNF biosimilars across Europe. In 2019, we expect double-digit revenue growth from a biosimilars business, primarily driven by the launch of IMRALDI. Turning to our anti-CD20 revenues, we recorded $535 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 29% versus the prior year, primarily driven by OCREVUS royalties. Full year anti-CD20 revenues were $2 billion, a 27% increase versus 2017. Within anti-CD20 revenues our estimated OCREVUS royalties were $152 million for the fourth quarter and $478 million for the full year. We expect a slight decline in anti-CD20 revenue in 2019, driven by the expected launch of RITUXAN biosimilars in the second half of the year. Total other revenues were $166 million in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 8% versus the prior year. Other revenues were $586 million for the full year, an increase of 63% versus 2017. In 2019, we anticipate a modest increase in these revenues with revenue heavily loaded in the first quarter due to the affected timing of sales of approximately $200 million of remaining inventory associated with the Bioverativ\u2019s spinoff, which carries a lower gross margin. Let me now turn to gross margin performance. Q4 2018 gross margin was 86% of revenues versus approximately 86% in the fourth quarter of 2017, driven by unfavorable net mix of revenue in Q4 2017. Gross margins for the full year of 2018 were approximately 86%, relatively flat compared to the full year 2017. In 2019, we expect gross margin compression due to sale of remaining Bioverativ inventory just discussed were substantially all the impact anticipated in the first quarter. Q4 GAAP R&D expense was 17% of revenue or $612 million. Q4 non-GAAP R&D expense was also 17% of revenue or $602 million. Q4 R&D expense includes $35 million opt-in payment we made to Ionis related to BIIB067 for ALS and $17 million related to our collaboration agreement with C4 Therapeutics. Full year GAAP R&D expense was 19% of revenue or $2.6 billion. Full year non-GAAP R&D expense was 18% of revenue or $2.4 billion. We expect Q1 2019 R&D expense to include approximately $35 million, related to our collaboration agreement with Skyhawk. Q4 GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A were both 17% of revenue or $591 million. Full year GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A were both 16% of sales or $2.1 billion. Both GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A increase versus the prior quarter, due to the timing of spend as well as certain investments across sales and marketing, worldwide medical and G&A. In 2019, we expect total OpEx per quarter to be slightly above $1.1 billion, as we continue to invest in our pipeline and prepare for the potential launch of aducanumab. GAAP other net expense which includes interest was $29 million in Q4 and GAAP other net income was $11 million for the full year. Non-GAAP other net expense was $16 million in Q4 and $117 million for the full year. We expect other net expense to be lower in 2019 due to higher interest income resulting from larger cash balances and higher interest rates versus 2018. In Q4, our GAAP tax rate was approximately 33% as we booked a GAAP tax charge of $136 million related to the initial recognition of deferred taxes on the GILTI tax of international earnings, a component of U.S. corporate tax reform by this legislation. In Q4, our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 21%. For the full year, our GAAP tax rate was approximately 24% and our non-GAAP tax rate was roughly 21%. In 2019, we expect the underlying run rate for our tax rates to benefit by approximately 200 basis points as a result of U.S. corporate tax reform. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately $200 million for the fourth quarter and $205 million for the full year. We repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares in the fourth quarter at an average price of $311.24 for a total value of approximately $1.4 billion, which now brings us to our diluted earnings per share. In the fourth quarter, we booked GAAP EPS of $4.73 compared to GAAP loss of $1.40 per share in the fourth quarter 2017 and non-GAAP earnings of $6.99 per share, a 33% increase versus the prior year. For the full year, GAAP EPS was $21.58, an 81% increase versus 2017 and non-GAAP EPS was $26.20, a 20% increase versus 2017. As a reminder, fourth quarter and full year 2017 GAAP EPS was negatively impacted by $5.51 due to U.S. corporate tax reform. We generated approximately $1.9 billion in net cash flows from operations in the fourth quarter and approximately $6.2 billion for the full year. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.9 million in cash and marketable securities and $5.9 million in debt. Let me now turn to our full year guidance for 2019. We expect revenues of approximately $13.6 billion to $13.8 billion assuming current foreign exchange rates. We anticipate gross margins of 85% to 86%, driven by the unfavorable mix issues I discussed earlier. We anticipate R&D expense between 16% and 17% of revenue. Of note, guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions as both are hard to predict. We expect SG&A expense to be approximately 16% to 17% of revenues, as we expect to begin meaningful investments in launch preparation activities for aducanumab. We anticipate our GAAP tax rate for 2019 to be between 18.5% to 19.5% and our non-GAAP tax rate to be between 18% to 19%. We anticipate full year GAAP diluted EPS results of $26.65 to $27.65 representing growth of 23% to 28% and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be $28 to $29, representing growth of 7% to 11%. From a quarterly perspective, it's important to recognize that we had a large business development expense in Q2 2018 effecting the year-over-year comparison for Q2 2019. I'll now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you, Jeff. We closed 2018 with strong commercial performance, double-digit earnings growth versus a year ago and strong execution of our strategy. We opened 2019 with the announcement of two business development deals. We have enhanced our neuroscience pipeline and broaden our capabilities across multiple modalities as we prepare for multiple upcoming important readouts. Biogen's vision and strategy are clear. As a pioneer, we aim to capture the significant unmet medical need in neuroscience with a goal of bringing potential new therapies faster and more efficiently to patients. For 2019, we aim to continue our momentum and achieve our guidance. To deliver on our aspirations, we remain focused on executing well on our strategic priorities to fortify our core business in MS and SMA. And also, allocate capital to expand and progress our neuroscience pipeline while opportunistically returning capital to shareholders. Biogen will continue to actively pursue business development and M&A. Within the next 12 to 18 months, we expect further progress as we aim to build a multi-franchise neuroscience portfolio including data reduction Alzheimer's, including the final Phase 3 data for aducanumab as well as MS and PSP. Up to five new assets advancing into the clinic and potentially regulatory approval in the U.S. for VUMERITY in MS. Finally, I want to reiterate our commitment to maximizing return to our shareholders and bringing innovative strategies to patients over the long-term. These demands that we continue to allocate capital efficiently, effectively and appropriately. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will always strive to have an optimal capital structure as well as aim for superior return from the investment we make. Once again, I would like to thank our employees around the world, who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patient\u2019s life and all of the physician, caregivers and participants in our clinical development programs, our past and future achievements could not be realized without the passion and commitment. With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is open. Geoff Meacham : Hey, guys good morning. Thanks a lot for the question. Michel, when I look at 2019 guidance, it reflects a slower growth profile for both revenue and earnings. So, the question is from a strategy perspective, does this alter your view on BD, your capital allocation, or do you look at 2019 growth as more of a temporary trend? And then Mike or Al, real quick, I just wanted to ask you guys on the new Phase 3 study for aducanumab in earlier stage Alzheimer's. Was this informed at all from ENGAGE, EMERGE or PRIME or something else? Thanks. Michel Vounatsos : Thanks for the good questions. So, the strategy as you know is clear and simple and very usable. There\u2019s three main reasons to believe; first, we have a strong underlying momentum, solid base, value proposition, improving with the offer of biosimilars and we are working on the operating model. Second, we have a strong and stronger engine for growth with all the enhanced pipeline that Mike spoke about, and we have very important landmark study readouts in the coming period, so this is a very exciting place to be. Third, we have financial strengths. So concerning the BD and M&A, the drive first will be to continue to accelerate the buildup of our modalities and pipeline. This will be the key driver, scientific and strategic alignment. We will not go for bridging a potential gap because we are not on a burning platform. The team is building up very well; the management team is spending a lot of time on those activities. We have a broad range of targets and we are working on that but with pace and calm. Al Sandrock : So, hi Jeff, this is Al. On your second question, we've been considering doing this preclinical study, we call it, for a few years now and it's part of our broader life cycle management strategy. I'd say the reasons why we're doing it are that many of our advisors and investigators have been encouraging us to do it for some time, and I would say also that the BAN2401 results that we got roughly six months ago increases our level of confidence in aducanumab, and then finally as you know FDA put out guidance recently that contemplates how you might get approval for early AD. So we believe one day, the standard of care will be to treat with amyloid-lowering drugs as early as possible and this trial will go a long way toward informing that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Your line is open. Michael Yee : Thanks, good morning. Congrats on the good quarter. I know everyone is focused on interim analysis, so I\u2019m asking if there will be an interim analysis on aducanumab? Just asking actually, it feels like the street would like to know if you had one or if you had a futility analysis whether that would be disclosable if you passed either of those? I think Roche talks about the futility and how that's a material piece of information, so I just wanted to understand your view on whether you took either of those of if they will be on futility and whether that\u2019s disclosable? Thanks so much. Al Sandrock : Mike, this is Al. I am really sorry, but we continue to have a policy here that we don't talk about interim analysis. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Terence Flynn : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. With respect to SPINRAZA ex-U.S, I was just wondering if you can give us a little bit more detail on the impact in the fourth quarter from pricing versus loading dose, and then maybe help us think about the pacing going into 2019? And ex-U.S. reimbursement progress, any new countries that you guys are expecting to come on board in 2019? Thanks. Michael Ehlers : Thanks for the question. So just to reiterate, we're very pleased with the performance of SPINRAZA, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. and think it has a very strong growth profile. It was up 60% year-over-year although down a little bit sequentially. As I mentioned, really there are three factors that drove the sequential decline and that was; one, a shift from loading to maintenance doses in some of the more mature markets in Europe, the timing of shipments in certain distributor markets which are hard to predict, and then pricing dynamics including unfavorable country mix. So as we look forward in 2019, we expect for that franchise to resume growth. We expect that to come from several sources. Number one, in the mature markets, just like we saw the dynamic of the shift in the U.S., we expect some of these larger markets to return to growth in 2019. Second, although the IPM, or International Partner Markets, will continue to be lumpy, they are a good source of growth for us, so we expect that to grow as well. And then if you look at new markets, either entry into new markets for expansion into markets that we've just recently entered, there's a number of kind of interesting things that are happening. If we look at Europe first, we expect to enter the U.K. at some point in 2019 which would be a good size opportunity. In Turkey, we've been very successful in Type 1. We expect to kind of get Type 2 and Type 3. Saudi Arabia, Poland, and Portugal are all markets we expect to enter as well from a European perspective. Moving around the world, Canada, we just recently got approval in the fourth quarter of 2018. We expect that to be a good growth opportunity for us and a good market. And then, if you look across the rest of the world, in Asia Pacific, South Korea, we expect to get reimbursement in that market in 2019. Taiwan is another good sized market, Hong Kong. And then, in China we expect to get in on a self-pay basis. And then, Latin America, Brazil could be a sizable country. Today it's on a one-off approval basis. We expect to get reimbursement from the epidemiology is in the thousands in Brazil. So there's ample opportunity for us to grow. It's diversified regionally and by country. That's a real testament to both the effectiveness and reception of SPINRAZA worldwide. Michel Vounatsos : So we expect to grow SPINRAZA during 2019 in the U.S. and ex-U.S. Remember, in the U. S. one year ago we're not sure by the ability of the organization to penetrate the large adult segment of the prevalence and we add 15%. This has driven more than 50% of the new starts in Q4. There is still a very long way to go. The organization is ready, working on that and beyond the U.S. just give some color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink. Your line is open. Geoffrey Porges : Thank you very much and I appreciate all the information on the call. I had a question on BIIB067. Mike, could you talk a little bit about the data? When we might see it? Whether you've had a chance to discuss it with the FDA? The size of the cohort? And how quickly this could advance? You seem quite excited about the signal. And then, perhaps you could just address what the general principles you take away from this finding are for the rest of your program? Thanks. Michael Ehlers : Yes. Thanks, Geoff, for the question. A few things, hopefully I'll touch on each of these points. We will plan to present the data at an upcoming scientific meeting. We haven't quite yet determined that, but that will be in the coming months where we'll be able to talk about it some length. We wouldn't really comment on our regulatory strategy at this point, I guess, what I would say is that we know this is a very severe disease. It's really little to nothing for these patients. So our anticipation here is that there would be good receptivity for the kind of efficacy that we think that we can see here. Just on the data itself, so this is a Phase I study, keep in mind it was designed to be a safety study as primary endpoint of this patients largely, but we incorporated a number of biomarker pharmacodynamic and clinical endpoints in this. And as I describe, it has been the collection of these both the lowering of SOD1 and the CSF has statistically significant a trend towards lowering in CSF neurofilament as well as three separate clinical outcomes, the ALSFRS, the slow vital capacity for respiratory function, the handheld dynamometry for muscle strength, and the concordance between these endpoints that have led to our excitement for these program. And I would say the general takeaways you're asking about it\u2019s really two dimensions. One, is this is very, very encouraging to us across our ASO platform, I would say. This is our second foray after SPINRAZA. We've got many other clinical programs, new molecule as we get to the clinic. It shows us that in adult onset neurological disease we're targeting an RNase H-dependent mechanism that we are seeing signs of clinical efficacy. I believe it will be the first demonstration of proof-of-clinical concept in adults with an RNase H mechanism per se. So we're excited about that. That's one dimension. The other is that the promise that this holds broadly speaking for us in ALS, and neuromuscular disease in general. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Cory Kasimov : Great, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, Al, I know you won't comment on any potential internal interim analysis. But I'm curious to get your thoughts around the expected upcoming interim readout for Roche\u2019s crenezumab in Alzheimer's, and so far as what you see as some of the kind of the key similarities and differences between your drug and Roche\u2019s drug? And also whether you see much of a read through to aducanumab based on these pending results? Al Sandrock : Hi, Cory. I be cautious about too much read through. First of all these are not the same antibodies, crenezumab binds to sort of a mid-domain in A-beta42 peptide, aducanumab and BAN both are in terminal. Aducanumab and BAN are highly selective for aggregated forms of A-beta both soluble oligomers as well as insoluble fibrils, crenezumab doesn't have that same level of specificity. I think it's important to note that crenezumab is an IgG4, which doesn't have full effect or function, whereas, BAN and adu both have full effect or function. And finally, we just saw the results published recently on crenezumab Phase 2 where even their high dose IV arm, they did not show statistically significant lowering of amyloid plaque whether you use subcortical white matter or cerebellum as a reference region. So that's another important difference between aducanumab and BAN, both of which show substantial reduction in amyloid plaque burden in human. So I think there are some notable differences, and I'll be cautious about too much of a read through. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Chris Raymond : Hey, thanks. Just a couple of financial questions. Just on the tax guidance, I think you're guiding to 200 to 300 bps lower year-on-year, and I know you cited corporate tax reform as the driver. But can you just maybe talk about the step down from 2018 or even the Q4 rate, which presumably should have benefited in tax reform? And is that number sustainable beyond 2019? And then just on the inventory, I think last year you guys had $50 million Q4 inventory build for the MS franchise. This year I think it looks like it more than double, can talk about what's driving that difference? Thanks. Jeff Capello : Yeah, so on the tax rate, if you back up to 2017, when we -- when U.S. tax reform got passed, we dropped the tax rate about 300 basis points and at that point we said that there was a further reduction in the tax rate due to tax reform that because of the way our legal structure works from an international perspective, there was inventory that would turn to the system and that would be for the reduction of the race. So that 200 basis points is really kind of the higher simplistically think about is higher priced inventory from a tax perspective return to the system in 2018. So now in 2019 that inventory is gone, another raise is dropped. So I'm not able to kind of give you a long-term tax rate at this point. We don't know long-term guidance, but we're comfortable with the rate going down 200 basis points from 2018 to 2019. And then thereafter, it will depend on a lot of things including the distribution of earnings and other things. But for now, I think, the guidance for 2019 is something you can rely on. With regard to inventory, yes, so we built about $115 million worth of inventory in the fourth quarter compared to a build of roughly $50 million in the fourth quarter of last year, a lot of that\u2019s outside our control. We distribute our product through distributors and they decide to either build inventory or not and we'd recognize revenue on shipment into the channel, which is different than kind of the flow through or consumption of that inventory, which is what we highlighted for people so they can normalize. So it's just beyond our control. It's not something that we have control over. So it's driven by external factors and we do our best to kind of manage through those and make sure it's clear to people in terms of what's driving demand. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Your line is open. Umer Raffat : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First on aducanumab. My question is, and I have fully acknowledged and I don't think I ever asked about that interim. But my question is this. I realized there's a policy of not commenting on it, but once you do get a notification from the DSMB, given the sheer materiality of this, will you not put out a statement? And I guess that's really what I'm trying to get at, like, for example, trials continues as planned, like, will that happen or not happen once there is a notification to the management? And then Jeff, on inventory my question is, so the Q4 \u2013 the inventory we saw on the slide and the disclosure for last year is obviously different than the inventory numbers that were reported last year, because of the change you guys implemented in 2Q. But my question is, in 2Q that inventory slide has two different metrics and it's been a little confusing to figure out when we see the inventory disclosures now, which of those metrics are actually being reported because the numbers are different on both. Alfred Sandrock : Umer, this is Al, I am sorry, but we just can\u2019t comment on interim analysis. Michael Ehlers : With regard to inventory, Umer, what we disclosed is the change within the quarter, for the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, that's a number of thing we have consistently disclosed in the press releases so that is generally inventory build up by $115 million from the beginning of the fourth quarter to the end of the fourth quarter of 2018. Similarly in 2017 from the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2017 to the end, it's built by $50 million. So the change within the quarter is up $115 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and up $50 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. So we think the relevant metric people should look at is what was the change within the quarter and if you want to know what the change was comparatively, you take the difference of the change in the change, which is $65 million I think that's pretty clear. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Matthew Harrison : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to clarify some comments you made about rebates and your outlook on the MS business, broadly can you just speak in a little bit more detail kind of like you were expecting a few hundred basis points of additional chargeback rebate pressure this year in the U.S. You thought that would be offset by OCREVUS, maybe you could just comment broadly on your outlook for the MS business in the U.S. and outside the U.S.? Thanks. Michael Ehlers : So I think you're referring to two different things. I think we said we expect that our discount and allowances in the U.S. take to offer another couple hundred basis points which is very similar to what happened in 2018. And that's been driven by the mix of the business becoming more Medicaid, Medicare and 340B Hospital reliant in terms of the channel it goes through where there is higher discounts. So no different than the trend we saw from 2017 to 2018. We'll see more pressure from 2018 to 2019. With regard to the performance of the MS business, I think we said that we expect that business globally to perform similarly excluding OCREVUS to what it did in 2018. And then for any difference would be made out by the OCREVUS royalties and the combination of both of those to be resilient which we kind of, say, flattish. So we expect the kind of the trends with regard to improvement to continue in the U.S., which is very encouraging and the outside the U.S. we will continue to see some pricing pressure and competition with OCREVUS rolling through Europe. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Ying Huang : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. A quick one for maybe Al. We know that cladribine is being in the registration with FDA. I was wondering do have any thoughts on cladribine impact on the MS market? Could we see something like OCREVUS in the U.S. dynamics? And then secondly on SPINRAZA, from last quarter to this quarter your market share in infants and also in pediatrics have been stable about 50%. Do you see further growth in those two segments for SPINRAZA in the U.S. this year? Thank you. Al Sandrock : Hi, Ying. This is Al. On cladribine it\u2019s -- we welcome any new therapy for MS patients, that's good for patients and good for doctors to have multiple options for their patients because MS patients are different, every one of them. Having said that cladribine, it's oral, it's very convenient in the sense that you can give it every six months essentially a cycle every six months if you will, and the key question early on was the safety, which in some of the Phase III data there were some signals that were concerning, which prevented it from being approved a few years ago, and some of those questions may still remain, which takes sort of -- which makes the convenience of it less optimal if you will. So I'll just stop there. Michel Vounatsos : Concerning SPINRAZA in the U.S. for infants and children if it was your question, we do believe that it is still opportunity to improve the penetration. The reason why we are 50% for infants is that some are still too advanced, and therefore they cannot be dosed. For children and toddlers, one of the challenge was the complex spine, and we can see that the clinicians are able to dose better nowadays that they have more experience. So, we should be able to continue to make reasonable inroads. The biggest potential again remains really adult, the 60% opportunity for, which we penetrated thoroughly 15% and now have the capability, the reach and the infrastructure in terms of dosing capability and coverage is establishing the U.S. Al Sandrock : Just as a reminder, we've got 2,600 patients in therapy in U.S. today; we estimate the total potential is 9,000. There's a lot of room to grow from perspective interest. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Alethia Young : Hey, guys thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the progress. I guess, I want to talk a little bit more about, what you think have been impactful in your efforts with adult, SMA, and I\u2019ve seen that you're making some progress there. So, just wanted to get some more color on that? Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : I would like to say that it starts with the team and the capability that Biogen was able to deploy in the marketplace. It takes a little bit of time for the more urgent infant population, for which we new that was a natural history the outcome of it, and the treatment centers were well identified. For the adult population, less symptomatic that can live with some symptoms but they can live quite long life. It was a bit more difficult and challenging to find treating centers and to mobilize them for a better quality of life. So this is why it took a little bit more time. So we enlarge the team, we did a lot of work in terms of medical affairs, and finally we showed that for the adult population there were incremental gains in functionality and this played a very important role. Al you want to add? Al Sandrock : Yeah, I mean, many of these patients weren't seeing a neurologist anymore. They were maybe seeing rehab specialists, but they had -- since there was no treatment, they really weren't seeing neurologist even neuromuscular neurologist weren't really seeing them. But now that there is a treatment, they're starting to find doctors and the doctors -- and it turns out their neuromuscular doctors are the same ones that are treating ALS patients by the way that are now treating a SPINRAZA patients that plus the fact that interventional radiologists have gotten really good at finding ways to get into this -- into the intrathecal space when people with complex spine, spinal fusions and other things present, and so I think it's a combination of both. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Citi. Your line is open. Robyn Karnauskas : Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. So, because AveXis will be launching in kids, sometime people believe early for -- some time in middle of the year, in the first half of 2019, how do you view that uptake? And do you think it's \u2013 you mentioned that some of these babies have difficulty getting the intrathecal infusions, would you think that be the area in which they'd start to take share? Or do you still believe that AVONE most likely will get a combination approach of gene therapy and SPINRAZA? I'm just trying to get a sense of when we start to see that impact, how are you thinking about that for 2019 in your guidance? And then second question was, just on the inventory draw down, so do we still expect to have all of that inventory be taken out in the first quarter? Or do you think there'll be a higher level of inventory laying around for the year? Thanks. Michael Ehlers : Okay. Robyn, this is Mike. I'll start on this and turn it over. I think our assumptions around the Novartis AVXS-101 gene therapy launch is, they've disclosed they filed in the U.S., E.U. and Japan for Type 1. Our base case is that they launch in the middle of the year and we expect that their initial label to be for Type 1 patients and mainly infants. And of course, we've been talking about it in the call, the majority of patient in Type 2 increase. So we really see this as probably being positioned for the Type 1 or the infantile SMA. Then I think the latter part of your first question was that we do think that there is opportunity for complementarity between modalities. The NURTURE data in our mind with SPINRAZA demonstrates a nearly maximal potential efficacy in terms of normal motor development if you treat in that first six-week period with SPINRAZA. That really I think sets the bar for the standard-of-care and it highlights the fact that at some level you really can't mess around on this. You've got a time window where maximal SMA protein expression really matters and I'd say the data that we\u2019ve generated with SPINRAZA really sets the bar very high. Al Sandrock : And the with regard to your question on inventory, we would expect the vast majority of the $200 million worth of inventory would get sold through in the first quarter and then there would be none left. Although, we need to manufacturing with Bioverativ but that's completely separate \u2013 distinct from the legacy inventory. Michel Vounatsos : So for 2019 we aim to continue our momentum while we are getting ready for very important readouts. Thank you all for joining us today on our call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen First Quarter 2019 Financial Results and Business Update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please limit yourself to one question to allow other participants time for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Matt Calistri, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin, sir. Matt Calistri : Thank you and welcome to Biogen's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflects how we manage the business internally. We\u2019ve also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the Risk Factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Michael Ehlers, EVP of Research and Development; and our CFO, Jeff Capello. We will also be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Al Sandrock. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Michel. Michel Vounatsos : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First let me start with some financial highlights. Biogen started 2019 with first quarter revenues of $3.5 billion, an increase of approximately 11% compared to the same period a year ago. First quarter 2019 GAAP earnings were $7.15 per share, an increase of 29% versus the same period a year ago. First quarter 2019 non-GAAP earnings were $6.98 per share, a 15% increase versus the same period a year ago. These results were driven by solid execution of our strategy to maximize the resilience in MS, progress in our dual launch of SPINRAZA, expand our anti-TNF biosimilar success in Europe, create a leaner and simpler operating model and prioritize our capital allocation efforts with the goal of maximizing shareholder returns. Let me expand on capital allocation. We remain focused on investing in areas with the highest potential benefit for patients and return for our shareholders. In addition to investing in our organic pipeline collaborations and acquired programs, we have made strategic investments in our operations, our biosimilars joint venture, our next-generation manufacturing facility that we are building in Solothurn, Switzerland. We have also taken measures to unlock capital that can be redeployed for higher return such as our agreement to sell our Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark manufacturing operations to FUJIFILM for up to $890 million. In addition, we have allocated capital with the proposed acquisition of Nightstar Therapeutics. Following the discontinuation of aducanumab, we viewed repurchasing our own share as an area with high potential return and announce a $5 billion share repurchase program. So far in 2019 Biogen has repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares for approximately $1.1 billion and our previously announced 2018 share repurchase program. We have $1 billion remaining under that program, plus $5 billion from our new repurchase program announced in March. We are committed to maximizing the value of our investments and to allocating capital and resources towards the areas we believe to be of the highest potential return something that demands a thoughtful approach over both the short and the long-term. Capital allocation includes the investment we have made in our pipeline. Over the past two years we have added 13 clinical programs and most recently announced our plan to acquire Nightstar Therapeutics. When we articulated our strategy almost two years ago, we identified four core and four emerging growth areas, as we widen our lens to diversify. We have made meaningful progress towards this diversification and have entered into new therapeutic areas, while building depth in our core growth area of neuromuscular diseases and movement disorders and potentially accelerating our entry into ophthalmology. In addition, we continue to advance other assets and pursue therapeutic adjacencies with scientific promise. Today we have 23 programs in clinical development, including BIIB098, which has been filed with the FDA. And we expect 10 mid to late-stage clinical readouts by the end of 2020. In addition two [ph] more mid to late stage clinical assets assuming completion of the Nightstar acquisition. Let me now address three critically important topics. First, the discontinuation of aducanumab and its short-term implications TECFIDERA IP challenges and the outlook for SPINRAZA. First I will address the discontinuation of aducanumab. We are in the business of discovering and developing breakthrough treatments to meet unmet medical needs. The unfortunate reality is that the pursuit of this objective is not always successful. The results for aducanumab are a terrible disappointment for the patients and families desperately hoping for a scientific breakthrough. Our scientists, researchers, medical professionals and as humans we share this disappointment. We followed the science and the outcome was not as we hoped, but we followed the science. I am incredibly proud of everyone at Biogen involved in this journey. We believe that the learning from the aducanumab trials will better position us to potentially attack this terrible disease successfully in the future. Importantly, for our remaining programs focused on targeting beta-amyloid BAN2401 and Elenbecestat, we are analyzing the results from the Phase 3 studies of aducanumab and the Phase 2 study of BAN2401. The learnings from these data will inform our view of the development of BAN2401 and. Elenbecestat. We plan to continue to advance our tau programs in Alzheimer's disease. BIIB092, BIIB076 and 080BIIB080. Beyond the disappointment of aducanumab this outcome takes nothing away from everything else we have accomplished. What we aim to deliver in terms of operational performance over the near term, what we believe we can accomplish in the future with the rest of our pipeline. Biogen is the world's leading neuroscience focused biopharmaceutical company. We intend and expect to remain the leader in the discovery, development and treatment of neurological diseases, while we will also continue to progress our very interesting compounds in lupus and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or IPF. We will continue working towards our goal of a multi-franchise portfolio, by growing our pipeline and executing on our strategy. In the short-term, we remain focused on solid quarter-over-quarter execution, financial discipline and our high return capital allocation priorities. And we will continue to pursue opportunities to improve business performance, explore indication expansions, look for ways to accelerate time-to-market for our clinical programs, optimize our clinical resources and manufacturing capacity. Biogen has key competitive advantages. We have deep scientific and clinical development expertise in neuroscience, global commercial expertise including market access, as evidenced by a leading MS, SMA and European entity NS biosimilars commercial portfolio, world-class biologic manufacturing capabilities; and last but not least, a highly talented and energized team, fully committed to realizing the value of the investment we have made in our organic pipeline, collaborations and acquired R&D with the goal of delivering the highest return to our shareholders. As we have communicated in the past, our strategy is long-term-leadership in neuroscience. That is still our reality today. Now, I will address TECFIDERA intellectual property. First, we appreciate that there are many questions regarding our U.S. intellectual property for TECFIDERA, which is being challenged in an inter partes review or IPR in the patent Office and a litigation in District Court. Let me remind you that our 514 patent which covers TECFIDERA and expires in 2028 has been very carefully scrutinized by the U. S. Patent Office multiple times. There was already an IPR before the PTAB where we prevailed, and we were also successful in an interference proceeding. We continue to believe we have valid patents. Nonetheless, we are appropriately preparing for all possible outcomes. Importantly, ahead of the outcome of the IPR and District Court and the Litigations, we shall have the opportunity to launch VUMERITY, a novel oral fumarate disease modifying treatment that has the potential to be another important choice for MS patients. The FDA has accepted the NDA filing of VUMERITY and we expect a regulatory decision in the fourth quarter of this year. VUMERITY has a composition of matter patent with a base expiration date in 2033. It is a priority that we appropriately maximize the potential of VUMERITY. Finally, I will address the outlook for SPINRAZA. Many of you are focused on the potential of upcoming competition for SPINRAZA. While we welcome the options for patients, we continue to believe that SPINRAZA will remain the standard of care in SMA for years to come. There are approximately 7,500 patients on SPINRAZA worldwide, including the EAP and clinical trials with over 7,000 patients having real world experience in the post-marketing setting. We have clinical data following patients for up to six years. The efficacy and safety profile of SPINRAZA in the post-marketing setting has been viewed very positively by patients and physicians. And we believe the NURTURE study of pre-symptomatic infants demonstrates the remarkable efficacy profile of SPINRAZA. Overall, we expect SPINRAZA to continue to grow, as we aim to reach a global patient population that we believe is larger than what we initially estimated. The Biogen team is standing up proud, while taking the current situation very seriously. As always, we are committed to working for patients with unmet medical needs and maximizing shareholder value creation by investing in the areas that we believe have the highest potential return. I will now turn the call over to Mike for a more detailed update on our recent progress in R& D. Michael Ehlers : Thank you, Michel. And good morning, everyone. Diseases of the nervous system are the leading cause of disability and the second leading cause of death worldwide. The burden and unmet medical need in neurological diseases continues to grow. We remain committed to developing effective, differentiated medicines for these devastating diseases and we believe that are our focus on and asymmetric capabilities in neuroscience position us to lead in this critical area of medicine. Before I review recent progress within our pipeline in greater detail, let me first elaborate on Michel's comments and discuss the recent news on aducanumab. Last month we and Eisai announced our decision to discontinue ENGAGE and EMERGE, the Phase 3 studies designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aducanumab in patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease and mild Alzheimer's disease dementia. The decision to stop these trials was based on a futility analysis conducted by an independent data monitoring committee. The pre-specified futility criteria were defined as less than 20% conditional power to meet the primary endpoints of both studies. The recommendation to stop these studies was not based on safety concerns. Further analysis of these data has demonstrated that treatment with aducanumab resulted in a dose and time-dependent reduction in cerebral amyloid deposition, as assessed by amyloid PET imaging. We are actively analyzing the complete data set to fully understand the behavior of aducanumab across doses and cohorts in these two trials. As part of the decision to discontinue ENGAGE and EMERGE, the EVOLVE Phase 2 safety study and the long-term extension of the PRIME Phase 1b study of aducanumab have also been discontinued. We have also decided not to initiate a Phase 3 secondary prevention study to evaluate whether early use of aducanumab can prevent or delay the clinical onset of Alzheimer's disease at this time. We appreciate that these results raise questions about the precise role of aggregated forms of beta amyloid in this patient population. We continue to analyze the data from ENGAGE and EMERGE to inform our view of  BAN2401 and Elenbecestat, our programs being developed in collaboration with Eisai. While disappointing for patients, families and the Alzheimer's community, we believe that the data collected from ENGAGE and EMERGE are extensive and that a full analysis will inform future efforts. Data from these studies will be presented at future medical meetings to advance the field's understanding of the neurobiology of Alzheimer's disease and help guide ongoing research. As a leader in neuroscience, we remain committed to our goal of developing novel therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We believe the Phase 3 results for aducanumab have limited read through to our portfolio of tau-directed therapeutics. Accordingly, we are continuing to advance BIIB092 or gosuranemab, an anti-tau antibody in Phase 2. BIIB076, a distinct anti-tau antibody in Phase 1 and BIIB080, an antiantisense oligonucleotide targeting tau currently in Phase 1 being developed in collaboration with Ionis. Importantly, two years ago together with Michel we articulated our goal of becoming the leader in neuroscience by building and diversifying our portfolio beyond Alzheimer's disease. Since then, we have made meaningful progress toward that goal by adding considerable depth across our core and emerging growth areas. Specifically, we have added 13 clinical programs since the beginning of 2017, including two that have achieved proof-of-concept and three that have achieved proof-of-biology. These include programs in multiple sclerosis Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear, palsy, ALS, stroke, epilepsy, cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia and neuropathic pain. And with our planned acquisition of Nightstar Therapeutics we have the potential to add two mid to late-stage assets for inherited retinal disease. Today and not including Nightstar, we have 23 programs in clinical development, including six programs in Phase 1, 13 programs in Phase 2 and three programs in Phase 3, as well as BIIB098 which has been filed with the FDA. This represents a substantial expansion and diversification of our clinical portfolio with many important and promising drug candidates each with significant potential to address some of the most debilitating diseases of our time. Turning to our proposed acquisition of Nightstar Therapeutics. We are extremely excited about the opportunity to join forces with this talented team of drug developers and together address serious genetic causes of blindness for which there have been no treatment options. This acquisition would accelerate our entry into ophthalmology, with the potential to deliver first-in-class adeno-associated virus based gene therapies to patients suffering from severe retinal diseases. Retinal degeneration shares many characteristics with the generative diseases of the central nervous system. And we therefore see positive synergy din pursuing treatments for inherited rental diseases that leverage our scientific and clinical capabilities. Nightstar's lead drug candidate NSR REP1 targets choroideremia, a rare degenerative disease that inevitably leads to blindness for which there are no current therapies. In Phase 1/2 trials treatment with NSR REP1 via targeted subretinal injection was associated with a higher rate of maintained vision, and in a subset of patients, a meaningful improvement in visual acuity, suggesting that NSR-REP1 has the potential to significantly alter the course of this disease. Based on compelling proof-of-concept data in the Phase 1/2 studies, Nightstar initiated the Phase 3 STAR trial. We expect enrollment in this trial to complete in the first half of this year with Phase 3 data expected in the second half of 2020. Of note, NSR-REP1 has received regenerative medicine advanced therapy for RMAT designation from the FDA, which confers all the benefits of both fast track and breakthrough therapy designation. Nightstar's second clinical stage asset is NSR RPGR for X-linked retinitis pigmentosa or XLRP. Like NSR REP1, NSR RPGR is an AAV based gene therapy delivered by targeted subretinal injection. Data from ea Phase 1/2 dose escalation study showed promising signals of early efficacy, including increases in central retinal sensitivity as measured by microperimetry. A Phase 2/3 dose expansion study of NSR RPGR is currently enrolling and assuming the transaction closes we would plan to add a Phase 3 study to support registration. In addition, Nightstar is advancing preclinical programs that include gene therapies targeting Stargardt disease, the most common form of inherited juvenile macular dystrophy, Best vitelliform macular dystrophy and additional programs targeting other genetic forms of retinitis pigmentosa. These diseases which inevitably lead to ability blindness and the associated severe disability are amongst the large group of inherited retinal diseases which have been estimated to afflict up to 200,000 patients in the U.S. alone, many of which may be amenable to similar gene therapy solutions. Subject to final approvals, we look forward to coming together with the remarkable scientific and clinical team at Nightstar with he goal of bringing breakthrough therapies to patients to slow or halt blindness across a range of inherited retinal diseases. Turning to our progress in neuromuscular disorders. Last month, we dosed the first patient in the Phase 3 VALOR study of BIIB067 or tofersen, an antisense oligonucleotide for ALS with mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 or SOD1. BIIB067 selectively targets the mRNA for SOD1 to reduce the levels of toxic mutentmutant SOD1 protein that is thought to be the causative agent in this autosomal dominant genetic form of ALS. VALOR is a continuation of the Phase 1/2 single and multiple ascending dose study of BIIB067 for which we have previously communicated proof-of-biology and proof-of-concept. VALOR is enrolling to assess the efficacy and safety of BIIB067 versus placebo. And the primary endpoint of this study is an analysis based on the ALS functional rating scale revised score. In parallel, we are in active discussions with regulators as we collaborate to further define the scope of the clinical data package required to support the registration of BIIB067. Very limited treatment options for this devastating genetic form of ALS, we believe the data from the VALOR study have the potential to support a rapid path to patients. Moreover, given that BIIB067 engages RNase H mechanisms to degrade endogenous mRNAs and hence decrease levels of the target, we believe that these data have positive implications for additional antisense oligonucleotides that we are advancing in our pipeline together with Ionis, that similarly utilizes RNase H-dependent mRNA degradation. Including BIIB078 which targets C9orf72 for ALS, BIIB080, which targets tau for Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies and up to two new antisense oligonucleotides that could enter the clinic this year. Further, we believe these data exemplify the depth we are building in neuromuscular disorders, including ALS and highlight the interconnectivity across our pipeline. We plan to present data from the single and multiple ascending dose portions of the Phase 1/2 study of BIIB067 in the emerging science session at the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting next month. And you'll hear more specifically about our ALS pipeline at an R&D investor webcast on June 5th. Moving to SMA. At the 2019 Muscular Dystrophy Association Clinical and Scientific Conference earlier this month, we presented an encore presentation of data from the NURTURE study of SPINRAZA in pre-symptomatic infants with SMA. highlighting the unprecedented efficacy profile of SPINRAZA, these data show patients on average achieving motor milestones consistent or nearly consistent with normal development. Specifically, as of May last year of the 25 infants treated with SPINRAZA in this study, 100% were alive, none required tracheostomy or permanent ventilation, 100% were able to sit without support and 88% were able to walk either with assistance or independently. We believe that SPINRAZA's efficacy profile, including data on patients treated for up to six years combined with real world safety and efficacy experience in over 7,000 patients supports SPINRAZA as the standard of care in SMA. Even after the potential introduction of alternative modalities with significantly less data and outstanding questions regarding long-term safety and efficacy. Within movement disorders, we are making strong progress advancing our assets for progressive supranuclear palsy or PSP and Parkinson's disease. We look forward to the final readout for the Phase 2 study of BIIB092 and PSP in the second half of this year. BIIB092 is a monoclonal antibody targeting extracellular tau, with the aim of reducing the spread of tau pathology in the brain. And we are making strong progress with recruitment in the Phase 2 study of BIIB054, a monoclonal antibody targeting extracellular synuclein for Parkinson's disease. We now expect to receive data on the primary outcome measure from the one-year placebo-controlled period of this study in the second half of 2020. As Michel mentioned, we remain steadfast in our commitment to neuroscience, while we continue to explore therapeutic adjacencies where we have existing assets and/or expertise. Importantly, we continue to progress our clinical programs in lupus and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Specifically, we are advancing BIIB059, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds BDCA2, a C-type lectin that inhibits type-1 interferon signaling in plasmacytoid dendritic cells. We are currently evaluating BIIB059 in a Phase 2 study in cutaneous lupus erythematosus or CLE and systemic lupus erythematosus or SLE with data expected by the end of this year. Moreover, we expect to work with our collaboration partner UCB to agree on the details of a potential global Phase 3 program for dapirolizumab pegol, an anti-CD40 ligand PEGylated FAB in SLE. A previous Phase 2b study of dapirolizumab pegol in SLE demonstrated consistent and potentially meaningful improvements for the majority of clinical endpoints in patients treated with dapirolizumab pegol compared with placebo. Although the primary endpoint of this Phase 2b study to demonstrate a dose response at 24 weeks on the British Isles lupus assessment group based composite lupus assessment was not met at p=0. 07. We believe the totality of the Phase 2b data supported proof-of-concept. In addition, biomarker data demonstrated strong evidence of proof-of-biology. Dapirolizumab pegol was well tolerated and demonstrated an acceptable safety profile. We believe that the Phase 2b data together with a post-hoc analysis that indicated a notable response in a refined population support a decision to advance to Phase 3. Together with UCB we intend to present these findings at a future scientific forum. So what do we expect from Biogen R&D going forward? Four key priorities. Focus on clinical trial execution and optimizing our resources with up to 10 mid to late-stage readouts by the end of 2020, diversification, including potential indication expansions, continued progress advancing our pipeline including ways to accelerate time to market, and balancing the risk of our pipeline including a continued pursuit of late-stage opportunities. On this last point, let me elaborate on how we think about balancing risk across our pipeline. Biogen is, always has been and will remain a science-driven company, dedicated to converting differentiated biology into breakthrough medicines. That is the promise of innovation spawned from creative ideas and risks at the forefront. It is the incubator of future SPINRAZAs and solutions for patients and families that change medicine. As we advance our portfolio, we will continue to mitigate risk by seeking later-stage assets, taking advantage of our unique capabilities in developing antisense oligonucleotides and gene therapy to target causal genetic drivers of disease such as SOD1 and C9orf72 in familial ALS. Leveraging our depth of expertise in MS and SMA to expand our footprint in neuroimmunology and neuromuscular disorders and deploying rigorous experimental medicine methods, including biomarkers of target engagement and disease activity to derisk early-stage clinical programs. As we diversify and balance risk within our pipeline, we will also thoughtfully consider therapeutic adjacencies that synergize with our core and emerging growth areas and where we have existing assets or expertise. Backed by a significantly expanded portfolio of clinical stage assets, we remain focused on our goal of developing transformative medicines for patients living with devastating neurological diseases. I will now pass the call to Jeff. Jeff Capello : Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. I'll now review our financial performance for the first quarter of 2019 starting with revenues. As Michel mentioned earlier, we had a strong Q1 2019 from a revenue perspective. Total revenues for the first quarter grew 11% year-over-year to approximately $3.5 billion. Overall, our MS business delivered revenues of $2.1 billion in Q1 2019, including OCREVUS royalties of approximately $112 million. MS revenues in Q1 2019 decreased 2% versus the prior year without OCREVUS royalties and were stable including OCREVUS royalties. U.S. MS revenues in Q1 2019 were impacted by a decrease in channel inventory of approximately $170 million compared to a decrease of approximately $140 million in Q1 2018 and an increase of approximately $105 million in Q4 2018. Global first quarter TECFIDERA revenues increased 1% versus the prior year, driven by revenue growth outside the U.S. U.S. TECFIDERA revenues were impacted by a decrease in channel inventory of approximately $110 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to a decrease of approximately $80 million in Q1 2018 and an increase of approximately $60 million in Q4 2018. We were pleased to see an increased share of both new and total prescriptions for TECFIDERA in the U.S. With our share of new prescriptions exceeding our share of total prescriptions for the first time in almost two years. Outside the U.S., TECFIDERA performed very well in Q1 2019 with continued double-digit volume increases across most large European markets and Japan versus the prior year, somewhat offset by pricing pressure in several European countries. Q1 interferon revenues including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY decreased 9% versus Q1 2018 due to the shift from the injectable platforms to oral or high efficacy therapies. Within the U.S., AVONEX and PLEGRIDY were impacted by a decrease in channel inventory of approximately $45 million compared to a decrease of approximately $60 million in Q1 2018 and an increase of approximately $35 million in Q4 2018. TYSABRI worldwide revenues were stable versus the first quarter of 2018. Within the U.S., TYSABRI revenues were impacted by a decrease in channel inventory of approximately $15 million compared to relatively stable inventory levels in Q1 2018 and an increase of approximately $10 million in Q4 2018. TYSABRI's underlying performance improved in the U.S. with an increased share of both new and total prescriptions. Outside the U.S., TYSABRI revenues increased 1% versus the prior year. Overall despite the headwinds from channel Dynamics, we were pleased with the continued resilience of our MS business in the first quarter and are focused on maintaining the resilience of this franchise in light of new competition entering the market. Let me now move on to SPINRAZA. Global first quarter SPINRAZA revenues increased 42% versus the prior year and increased 10% versus the fourth quarter of 2018. In the U. S. revenues increased 19% versus Q1 2018 driven by continued patient growth. Compared to the fourth quarter 2018, U.S. revenues decreased 5% which we believe was driven in part by seasonality. Outside the U.S., revenues increased 26% versus Q4, driven by continued new country launches and increased penetration across all major geographies, as well as a positive pricing adjustment in France following the receipt of former reimbursement and timing of shipments across several international markets. The number of patients on therapy in the U.S. increased 5% as compared to the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 and discontinuations remained relatively low. In the U.S., we continue to make strong progress with adults. In the first quarter approximately 50% of new starts were adults, increasing the total number of adult patients on SPINRAZA to over 1000, an increase of approximately 8% versus the fourth quarter of 2018. We saw continued increase in the revenue contribution from maintenance doses this quarter. In the U.S. approximately 75% of SPINRAZA units in the first quarter were attributed to maintenance doses, as compared to approximately 65% in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter approximately 10% of U. S. SPINRAZA units were dispensed through our free drug program, a decrease from approximately 15% in Q4. Outside the U.S., the number of commercial SPINRAZA patients increased approximately 24% versus the prior quarter. And there are approximately 210 patients active in the expanded access program. We recorded revenues from over 40 international markets in the first quarter. During the past quarter, SPINRAZA was approved in Argentina, Colombia, Taiwan and China where SPINRAZA is now available for self-paying patients. We also secured broad reimbursement in France and South Korea and our named patient sales program in Turkey where we estimate there are approximately 1500 estimated [ph] patients, was expanded to cover type 1, 2 and 3 patients. As Michel mentioned, we believe the global opportunity for SPINRAZA is significant and even greater than we initially anticipated. We now estimate there are over 45,000 individuals with SMA in the markets where Biogen has a direct presence. For example, we now estimate that there are approximately 10,000 SMA patients in Latin America, approximately 15 to 25,000 SMA patients in China and approximately 3,600 SMA patients in the rest of Asia Pacific. These estimates were not factored into our original estimate of 20,000 SMA patients. SPINRAZA has now become our second-largest product, as we continue to execute well on growing our treated patient base. Let me now move on to our biosimilars business. Revenues this quarter increased 37% versus the prior year and 12% versus the prior quarter. BENEPALI has been strengthening its leadership position in countries such as Germany, the UK, Denmark and Norway, shipping again more than 1 million doses in the quarter. In the first quarter FLIXABI exceeded 100,000 doses for the first time in a quarter. For its first full quarter in the market, IMRALDI, which references HUMIRA exceeded 200,000 doses with sales in 18 different countries. In general, the rate of HUMIRA biosimilar adoption has been steeper than for the previous two anti-TNFs. And our data indicate that IMRALDI is the market-leading HUMIRA biosimilar in Europe. As an example, in Germany the largest anti-TNF market in Europe we estimate that HUMIRA biosimilars have already captured approximately 35% market share with IMRALDI capturing about 40% of that share. Overall, our success outside the U. S. with MS, biosimilars and SPINRAZA has led to meaningful geographic expansion and diversification of revenues. Specifically the proportion of our product revenues coming from outside the U.S. increased from 39% a year ago to 44% in the first quarter of 2019. Total anti-CD20 revenues in the first quarter increased 17% versus the prior year, primarily driven by OCREVUS royalties. Q1 was a particularly strong quarter for RITUXAN due in part to channel dynamics and pricing adjustments. As a reminder, our royalty rate on sales of OCREVUS resets at the beginning of every calendar year. Total other revenues in the first quarter increased 78% versus the prior year, driven primarily by the sale of approximately $200 million of inventory associated with the Bioverativ spinoff, somewhat offset by a decline in our other corporate partner revenues. As noted in our Q4 2018 earnings call, this sale of inventory represents most of the remaining hemophilia inventory that we\u2019ve been hold to Bioverativ. Let me now turn to gross margin performance. Q1 2019 gross margin was 83%, negatively impacted by the sale of Bioverativ inventory which carried a very low gross margin. Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP R& D expense were both 16% of revenue. Q1 R&D expense includes approximately $39 million related to our agreement with Skyhawk and approximately $45 million in trial closeout costs for aducanumab. Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A were both 16% of revenue. For the balance of the year we expect a reduction in operating expenses of approximately $125 million related to aducanumab with ea net savings of approximately $80 million for the full year 2019. In Q1 we booked a GAAP loss of $116 million associated with our agreement with FUJIFILM related to the proposed sale of our manufacturing operations in Denmark. We expect to receive up to $890 million in cash related to this transaction subject to certain working capital adjustments and other contractual terms. Q1 GAAP other income was $357 million, including $376 million in net gains on investments. This includes a $321 million increase in the fair value of our equity investment in Ionis that we made last year in conjunction with our expanded strategic collaboration. We continue to believe that this deal is a great example of how we aim to create long-term shareholder value through a strategic capital allocation. In Q1 non-GAAP other expense was $19 million. In Q1 our GAAP tax rate was approximately 23%, negatively impacted by approximately 400 basis points due to the proposed sale of our manufacturing operations in Denmark. In Q1 our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 18% which declined from approximately 21% in Q1 2018 due to the remaining benefit of the U.S. corporate tax reform. We repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares in Q1 at an average price of $268 for a total value of approximately $656 million. And so far in April we repurchased an additional 2.1 million shares at an average price of $236 for a total value of approximately $492 million. As Michel mentioned, in the first quarter of 2019 our Board authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program. This is in addition to the approximately $1 billion remaining under the share repurchase program authorized in August 2018. which now brings us to our diluted earnings per share. In the first quarter we booked GAAP EPS of $7.15, an increase of 29% versus the prior year and non-GAAP earnings per share of $6. 98 percent - excuse me $6.98 per share, a 15% increase versus the prior year. We generated approximately $1.5 billion in net cash flows from operations in Q1. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.3 billion in cash and marketable securities and $5.9 billion in debt. I'll now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you, Jeff. The Biogen team is taking the current situation very seriously and dedicating every effort to maximize shareholder value creation. I am inspired by the reaction of the team. And we now have the opportunity and the obligation to rebound. We remain focused on growing our core business in MS, SMA and biosimilars, while addressing the short-term priorities already discussed, including the TECFIDERA IP challenge and preparing for the expected launch of VUMERITY by the end of the year. As always, we will invest in the areas we believe have the highest potential return for shareholders. Between now and the end of 2020, we expect continued progress as we aim to build a multi-franchise portfolio, including data readouts in MS, PSP, lupus, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, ALS, pain, cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia and stroke. Potential regulatory approval in the U.S. for VUMERITY in MS and up to 10 new assets advancing into the clinic. Finally I want to reiterate our commitment to maximizing returns to our shareholders and bringing innovative therapies to patients over the long term. This demands that we continue to allocate capital efficiently effectively and appropriately. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will always strive to have an optimal capital structure, as well as aim for superior returns from the investments we make. I will end by stating explicitly that everyone at Biogen is highly committed to making a positive impact on patients life by remaining at the forefront of discovering and developing breakthrough treatments, while always being dedicated to maximizing the long-term returns on behalf of our owners. With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America. Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Ying Huang : Hi. Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my question. I want to ask one about your strategy on business development and M&A. In the wake of discontinuation of aducanumab Phase 3, does management team feel more urgency to acquire more assets that are either commercial or near commercial? And along those lines does the Board of directors also feel the same urgency to conduct more M&A and transactions? Thank you? Michel Vounatsos : Thanks for the question. And as we communicated, we plan to deploy our capital to areas of highest returns for the shareholders. And we do believe that at the current stock price level buying back shares is very important. We took aggressive steps to diversify our portfolio in the past. But in the context of our current cash flow generation and the profile of our balance sheet we can do both buying back and also conduct some BD, M&A activities. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Robyn Karnauskas : Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I think you acknowledging all the concerns that investors had including TECFIDERA and SMA. I guess my key question is while you acknowledge that aducanumab failures some of the reasons why we are so concerned. Let's start with SMA. What gives you the confidence that if the oral product maintains its efficacy in more studies that it won't erode SPINRAZA? And maybe specifically, you -- could you clarify maybe what percentage of patients might be low-hanging fruit for that product? Maybe they are not as compliant as their older patients and not as fit that are currently on SPINRAZA? Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : So, Robyn this is Michael. I'll start with that. I think it's still -- look, it's still pretty early days with the data that we know from RITUXAN has been relatively small numbers of patients in the 20s or 30s, but infants and later onset, they clearly generated some encouraging data on this in terms of efficacy. I think some of the open things that the field is looking to understand about this is the overall benefit risk profile, the degree of efficacy, the extent to which that there is manageable therapeutic index on this. These are all parts of that program and data that are still to really emerge. The way we kind of think about is that particularly through the NURTURE study, the data that we generated from SPINRAZA really sets the bar for the degree of efficacy that's really going to define standard-of-care. So we think that's an important feature here. And we have such an extensive safety database on thousands of patients and patient years. So, again, I think that kind of sets the bar for what safety should look like. Much of this is going to have to play out over time. Right now we are very, very confident in SPINRAZA's profile in terms of safety and efficacy and we'll have to see how the RITUXAN data set reads out at this time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham : Hey guys. Thanks for the question and for all the perspective on aducanumab. Just had another one on SMA, in the US, can you add a little bit more detail for the new start trends? And you think there is a warehouse effect in 1Q ahead of an expected of excess launch? And then related to that I mean obviously you guys have learned a lot from the SMA launch in the orphan space, do you view this as a strategic asset? And by that do I mean, do you look at the orphan space as a broader area for BD or is the emphasis still from a BD perspective neuroscience focused? Thank you. Jeff Capello : Yes. Hi, Geoff. It's Jeff. Thanks for the question. So, as a reminder we grew 18% year-over-year in the U.S. in SMA, so pretty strong growth year-over-year. We did have a bit of a slowdown sequentially which I think you are asking about. Couple of things to remember. Our estimated epidemiology in the U.S. is still 9,000 patients. We're only 30% penetrated to-date. And in the adult class, which is the largest class, 65% of the patients, we're only 18% penetrated. So we continue to do a good job executing. We did a very good job this quarter continuing to grow that adult class. We also had a drop in the free drug percentage from 15% to 10% as more insurance coverage picks up the product which is just a testament to the strength of the product and we had very low discontinuations. Having said that, we did see a slight decrease in the number of new patient starts. We actually saw the same dynamic happen when you look at the fourth quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018. And we think part of that is due to the fact of seasonality both with regard to new patient starts and maintenance doses. In fact, if we look at our maintenance doses, we did see less compliance in the first quarter, which we attribute to weather and the cold and flu season. So this is not that the similar from what we saw in terms of the dynamics shifting from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018. So we think we continue to have lots of opportunity to grow this business in the U.S. And, of course, outside the U.S. we had a terrific quarter. Michel Vounatsos : Concerning the second part of your question. Thank you for asking. Based -- following aducanumab setback, we gathered the team and we certainly worked hard to maintain the focus on the operations and the progress from all sites of the company. And again I'm impressed by the reaction of the team. If we step back and we look at our - and reach portfolio that is materially improved compared with what it was 28 months ago. The core of our focus remains and we remain neuroscience. Having said that, we also look very carefully at the progress we are making in lupus with the two compounds that Mike spoke about and also idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. So this may point out adjacencies potentially in immuno, you speak about rare disease. It's too early for the organization to state that clearly. We need to regroup as a team and we got doing that while we speak share and line with the Board and then come back to you. Jeff Capello : And Geoff I might add something to that too. I think you raised a very good point about. Our SPINRAZA experience, I think has been highly informative to us and in growing our capabilities in and around rare diseases broadly speaking. I think when you look at the ability to deploy innovative development plans when you look at the extent of regulator engagements and accelerated paths. When you look at the collaborative relationship that we've exercised in patient efficacy and patient support groups that have supported that and then you look at opportunity space in disease like SMA, which ends up being much larger than I think anyone had anticipated at outset. These points to the adjacencies Michel was just talking about, which were programs we have in our portfolio BIIB067, 078, 092 and the proposed Nightstar acquisitions, all will provide positive synergy and give us another lens to look at an additional external opportunities. Michel Vounatsos : Just to conclude on this question and adding to what Mike is saying. It's all about adding value and highest return for the shareholders and finding synergies with the core capabilities of Biogen the way others will not be able to deliver. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Michael Yee : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I appreciate the comment as well, Michel. I guess, a question for Michel following on big picture strategy and the disappointment post Alzheimer's. Maybe you could talk about whether there is any change or pivot on two fronts? One is the change in investment of capital in the Alzheimer's including BAN2401 or what or how we should think about spending in Alzheimer's? And number two, whether or not there can be anything you can do about realizing immediate shareholder value post Alzheimer's given where the stock price is at and how to think about where you are now? Thanks so much. Michel Vounatsos : Thanks for the great question, Michael. So if you sit back and you recall what we said repetitively. The plan A was always to prepare Biogen for growth even without aducanumab. So as I said, the focus will remain on neuroscience based on the portfolio we have, but also on the adjacencies of all the programs we are developing for now and we'll come back with more. If you look at what we have done, we have materially improved our pipeline. We have materially diversified our pipeline. We are basically positioning the company for the future. We have improved the operational performance and also the efficiency of our operations. And we believe we have the ability to go further. This is where the capital also had been. We believe we invested the capital over the highest return opportunity. We have an IP challenge that we need to solve and we are working on that. And we do recognize our responsibility to shareholders to maximize the return over the long term, specifically on Alzheimer's disease. It has to be science driven. We have tons of data points that we are still not yet finalizing to review and to digest. So we have to wait for the team and a team statistician and clinicians to look at the data, so that we can best indicate, educate the course forward for the beta-amyloid hypothesis and for BAN2401 and elenbecestat. And as I said concerning the capital allocation and the share repurchase, I think, we've been pretty clear that at this level we believe that this is an area with very high return opportunity for shareholders. But again, in the context of the pristine balance sheet that we have, we can do more. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Cory Kasimov : Hey. Good morning, guys. And thank you for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on the business development front and ask about the companies buying capacity at this point. At the beginning of the year, I believe, you highlighted having roughly $42 billion in buying capacity through 2023. I'm curious if that has shifted at all post the buyback and other transactions? And can you comment how much capacity you believe you have to do something now as compared to over a four to five-year timeframe? Thanks. Jeff Capello : Hi, Cory, it's Jeff. Yeah. So we had mentioned back, I believe, it was at your conference that if you took, the metric was \u2013 if you took the cash flows of the company at the end of the third quarter of 2018 and you annualize those, you drop the CVRs and then you look at that over a five-year period that was a certain pool of cash. And then, if you look at the cash on the balance sheet, plus leverage up to 2.5 times, less the leverage we have today, that gave you the $42 billion of potential capacity. Assuming all stayed constant in terms of the business, which obviously is not the plan. The plan is to grow the business and grow those cash flows. So that's where we got the $42 billion. We once again had a very strong quarter cash flow wise. We did $1.5 billion in operating cash flow. And I would point out that this quarter was the final payment of the Fumapharm settlement of $300 million. So we're now beyond that settlement. So if anything, we believe that our cash flow will continue and we'll be in a strong position to leverage those cash flows, as Michel had said, with regard to both buying back stock and being active from a business development perspective. So there will be no lack of capacity. Michel Vounatsos : So we believe that deployment of capital at this level of price level should be on the share buyback. We believe this is a high return for everybody and we believe in the value of our company. At the same time, our team is working very hard on looking for other opportunities with high return. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Michel maybe just in a different direction. In listening to you today, I get a sense that the Alkermes fumarate, VUMERITY is more and more important to your MS strategy perhaps than it has been in the past. Can you speak to that? Am I hearing it correct and also should we reasonably expect a meaningful switch ahead of IPR decision? Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : So from day one and this is the reason why we did the -- we deployed capital and acquired this asset is that it was meaningful and strategically important for the company. We have a $9.1 billion franchise in MS that is pretty resilient to date. And we continue to - we want to continue to invest in that space. We believe that this Alkermes compound can eventually be differentiated. We need to wait for some data readouts. In the context of the IP challenge, certainly this is very important. It would be premature to state on any clear tactical plan or strategy for launch. But while we speak, we are working thoroughly on that. It's not that the organization is without any alternative, but we remain confident on our patents for TECFIDERA. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Alethia Young : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question and thank you for all the color this morning. I just wanted to go and maybe discuss the pipeline a little bit. I know you have the one data, which will be in? And I just wanted you to talk a little bit more about the C9ORF72 program and like what confidence you've received from the SOD1 that gives you confidence in knocking down that on HUMIRA as well? Thanks. Michael Ehlers : So Alethia, it's Mike. So I think one thing we've learned from BIIB67 SOD1 program is a lot about how we can very reliably measure target engagement and a pharmacodynamic effect in terms of looking at the relevant cause of the agent species in CSF like SOD1 in that case. We are deploying a very similar approach with C9ORF72 earlier program. So this is now just an essentially safety trials in this ALS patients. So we will be looking at similar types of things. Target engagement lowering of the toxic species and as well as assessing some of the same types of clinical measures. We do think that the extensive experience we've gained in development over time in ALS has significantly enhanced our ability to conduct and execute these trials efficiently. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Leerink. Please go ahead. Geoffrey Porges : Thanks very much. I just wanted to clarify a little bit more on what you're saying about 2401 elenbecestat, and particularly in the context of your expenses going forward. It was a bit surprising that canceling of aducanumab was only about 5% saving to your R&D spend. But if you discontinued 2401 elenbecestat, how much would totally you save from expected R&D? And secondly, could you just talk about the contractual flexibility you have to make that decision or can you only suspend funding for those programs with the agreement of your partner? Thanks. Jeff Capello : So, Geoff I'll start with the -- I guess the back half of your question. And we disclosed this clearly in our filing. So, our share of the expenses relative to both BAN2401 elenbecestat was $74 million in 2017, that's just our share and $116 million in 2018. And the amount is not -- creeps up a little bit in 2019, but not dramatically. So that gives you a little bit of sense of kind of the run rate. So, should we decide and our partners decide not to move forward those programs, obviously, that expense would come out. But I think as we mentioned in the prepared comments, as we're going through the aducanumab data and we're still having conversations and we'll make those decisions and deliberations as they play out. Geoffrey Porges : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carter Gould from UBS. Please go ahead. Carter Gould : Good morning guys and thanks for the color on strategy and capital allocation front. Maybe ask one on sort of near-term pipeline comment about BIIB092. I guess Michael can you give a little bit color on how you think about clinical meaningfulness on the PSPr scale, obviously, an indication for a lot of unmet need, but still some color on that front? And then just how you're thinking potential about read-through to targeting tau across other tauopathies depending on the outcome of this study and PSP? Michael Ehlers : Yes, great questions Carter. Thank you for that. So, the status of this is that we do anticipate getting days relatively large Phase 2 study data by the end of the year in PSP. The PSP rating scale is kind of the recognized standard across this field on areas of clinical meaningfulness. We've been in active collaborative dialogue with regulators on exactly components of this scale and how to use that for a primary endpoint. But I think we're making really excellent progress on that. I do think that this study is powered in a way with the right endpoint to detect a clinically meaningful effect in these patients. We have to keep in mind that to-date what we really know is that we've got a very target engagement in terms of measuring significant lowering of tau in the CSF. There's a lot of stuff that we still don't know and this is a Phase 2 study. So, you have to keep in mind that this is still a relatively early program where this is largely untested hypothesis and thus it remains a risky program in that regard. But I would say if we're able to show and find that there's a clinically meaningful effect in PSP, I do think that this will have significant positive ramifications or ability to intersect tau across many tauopathies. I would also add and say that we have also very cautiously not just limited ourselves to tau monoclonal antibodies in this regard and that's why we're also enthusiastic about our BIIB080 program at tau antisense oligonucleotide which gives us a very different approach to targeting and lowering tau in tauopathies. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Phil Nadeau : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I did have a follow-up question on the broad strategy of targeting CNS diseases. Very clear that you want to maximize return to shareholders and it seems like based on the indications you're going after that means major unmet needs where these reasonably sized patients populations, but also really increasing the return to shareholders and also risk of success. And as we look at slide 37 and the indications that are going to read out between here and the end of 2020, it kind of strikes me that not all those -- or actually most of those conditions don't have a determined mechanism of the disease or the pathogenic mechanisms not really well understood. So, can you talk a bit more about how you assess the risk of success and failure when you're looking at potential indications to bringing to your portfolio? And whether that has changed at all post the failure of aducanumab? Michel Vounatsos : So, I will get started. Since 41 years that this company is in operation, innovation, scientific excellence was at the forefront and is at the forefront of what we did and what we do and what we will do. And this is coming with some risk. And we know historically that there have having some setbacks. But we also believe that nowadays we are able to mitigate some of them with genetically validated pathways and also biomarkers neuroimaging and other elements capabilities that we are building. Mike will give more color. Michael Ehlers : Yes, Phil. I think this is a very good question. It's a broad question. I think what we would say is, look, in this area what we see and detect is a significantly changing risk profile in the area. And we see this playing out in a number of dimensions and it's within things we're doing. And if you look broadly at the ecosystem, SMA being sort of the cardinal example of that, but it doesn't stand alone on this. This risk profile in changing. Where you're successful, there's considerable high reward, as we've seen with SPINRAZA. We are very focused on mitigating the risk level of this in our overall portfolio. We do that in a number of ways Michel was talking about. It's partly by seeking later-stage assets where we've got clinical data that points to the progress, and particularly objective clinical data where we can \u2013 lead to go after genetic origins of disease. And this has been a big focus of ours with the extended collaboration Ionis in leveraging the antisense oligonucleotide platform. It's taking advantage of some of our other unique capabilities and depth of expertise in MS and SMA. And as we've been doing that and growing the portfolio, we would note that of these things we've added by bringing in or identifying, three of these deals were post proof-of-concept, two of these deals were post proof-of-biology. So that's an intentional strategy to really mitigate the risk across the portfolio. And I think whether you look at what's going on in \u2013 with \u2013 in Biogen or in the field as a whole, you can look at disease after disease where these traditional views of the risk are breaking down. SMA, migraine, muscular dystrophy, tardive dyskinesia, progressive MS, Huntington's, gene therapy, the inherited retinal diseases, ALS, treatment-resistant depression, Parkinson's, psychosis, postpartum depression, all these areas where before there have been very little prospect. In the very recent past, in the last year or two, including today, we're seeing a significant change in the risk profile in this area. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Ronny Gal : Good morning. And thank you squeezing me in. A couple of, if you don't mind. The first one is, I hear Michael, but there - kind of overall reducing risk and in neurological conditions. But you guys have been pretty positive on your amyloid beta program early on. And I was wondering, if in light of the end results here, if you thought about structural changes about you view trial, how you conduct them, more focus on interim analysis or early futility analysis? Have you kind of thought about how you mitigate the risk that you think you've gone into pretty significantly risky area. Are you looking for ways to kind of, like, ensure that you're not going down the wrong path for too long? And how do you think about in light of the aducanumab failure? And then, if I can throw one more in, should we read from the Nightstar acquisition, anything about your interest in biosimilar VEGF programs? Michael Ehlers : Ronny these are getting great questions, which I guess has been lot of time to answer. Let me try to give a little bit of a flavor for it. So in terms of how it is that we design and think about trials. Key for us is where we can get early signs with objective types of measurements that we know are connected to disease. So you will see more and more this is what we try to do across the board but you'll see more and more of that. That means in some instances specific types of biomarkers target engagement, the powering of trials in a way where we're looking for big effects and looking for them early, where we can and we know there is a particular standard of care where we can do head-to-head type of comparisons, it's really leveraging existing data sets that are out there across these diseases to define and refine endpoints. These are the things that we're looking to do. I'll tell you what we're not looking to do is to do large extensive trials where the only thing we're relying on subjective endpoints in that regard. So you will see less and less of that and more and more about refined patient populations objective measures that we think will be tied to a meaningful outcome for patients. Michel Vounatsos : Concerning the biosimilars. We do believe in the value creation opportunity offered by the biosimilars also in the U.S. The savings opportunity are up to $250 billion in the next 10 years if we had an effective biosimilars market in the U.S. And we don't speak about that enough. But I believe what is being discussed in terms of rebates -- new rebates or the policy; we'll address this potential gap. We are very pleased with our portfolio. We are very pleased with our performance. We do not intend to stop here. Operator : Your next question and your last question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Terence Flynn : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Maybe just two for, Jeff to follow-up on question Geoff Porges\u2019s question. Just can you be little bit clear, are you obligated to move forward with BAN2401? If Eisai would like to advance this program or if you don't agree, can you opt out and return rights there? And then on biosimilars pricing dynamics in the EU. Can you give us a sense of what you're seeing right now and then maybe beyond Germany for HUMIRA? Any early read on some of the other countries? Thank you. Jeff Capello : So, on the first question, Terry I\u2019m not going to be able to get into a lot of detail. That's a private arrangement between us and our partner. So as I said, we're looking at the data across all the programs and we'll certainly be able to give people an update when we have more clarity. On your second question with regard to the pricing dynamics. I would just say that the pricing dynamics are more or less in line with what we expected with regard to the IMRALDI launch having two anti-TNS already in the market. We're pretty well tuned to the pricing dynamics was very dramatically country-by-country. So we understand the dynamics and the different long-term contracts and how the different countries bid. And we're very encouraged by what's happening in Germany where we really have started out strong. So I would say the pricing is more or less in line with expectations than what we've seen historically. Matt Calistri : Well, thank everybody. We're going to end the call now. I'm going to have Michel make some closing comments. Michel Vounatsos : I would like just to reiterate our commitment to patients, all customers, and importantly to our shareholders. I believe Biogen is set to rebound and I fundamentally believe that we will be back. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.+",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Second Quarter 2019 Financial Results and Business Update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please limit yourself to one question to allow other participants time for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Biogen CEO, Michel Vounatsos. You may begin your conference. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I would like to start by thanking Matt Calistri for nearly four years he spent leading our Investor Relations program. We wish him the very best in this next endeavor. I would like to welcome Joe Mara, our new Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, who is a talented and energized finance and business leader with over 12 years of experience at Biogen across a number of functions. I am confident that Joe will prove to be a valuable resource for the investment community and I look forward to all of you getting to know Joe. Joe the floor is yours. Welcome. Joe Mara : Thank you, Michelle. And welcome everyone to Biogen's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. I look forward to getting to know all of you over the coming months. Before I begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in tables one and two and table three includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We've also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Michael Ehlers, EVP of the Research and Development; and our CFO, Jeff Capello. We will also be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Al Sandrock. Now, I will turn the call back over to Michel. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you, Joe. Now let me begin with some financial highlights. Compared to the same period a year ago, Biogen delivered solid topline and bottom line growth. Second quarter revenues grew 8% to $3.6 billion. Second quarter GAAP earnings per share grew 88% to $7.85 and non-GAAP EPS grew 58% to $9.15. Based on our strong performance year-to-date and our dated outlook for the second half of the year, we are raising our full year financial guidance, which Jeff will discuss in more details. Now let me review the highlights from the second quarter. First, revenues from our MS core business, including OCREVUS royalties increased 3% versus the prior year to $2.4 billion. Excluding OCREVUS, the total number of patients on our MS products globally grew in the low single digits versus the prior year. Critically, we are focused on addressing the IP challenge with TECFIDERA, while also preparing for the expected launch of VUMERITY towards the end of the year. Second, SPINRAZA global revenues grew 15% to $488 million driven by year-over-year revenue growth both in the US and outside the US. The number of commercial patients on SPINRAZA increased by approximately 12% from last quarter and we now have approximately 8400 patients on SPINRAZA, including the Expanded Access Program and clinical trial. Within the US, the number of SPINRAZA patients increased by approximately 4% versus Q1 which we believe demonstrates the potential for continued patient growth in the more mature markets. We were very proud to announce new data for the neutral study of SPINRAZA. We have continued to generate long-term data across broad patient populations which underscore the compelling safety and efficacy profile of SPINRAZA. Many are focused on the potential of new competition for SPINRAZA. While we welcome new options for patients, we believe it is premature to make assumptions about the ultimate uptake of emerging modalities given the large number of outstanding questions on the clinical profiles. Importantly, sorry, SPINRAZA remains the only SMA therapy approved for all age groups. Third, our biosimilars revenue grew 45% year-over-year to $184 million. We continue to deliver on our broad portfolio of anti-TNFs including the strong launch of IMRALDI, the market-leading biosimilar referencing in HUMIRA Europe. We estimate that the uptake of our biosimilars products will contribute up to $1.8 billion in healthcare savings across Europe in 2019, an important contribution to the long-term sustainability of the European healthcare systems that Biogen is proud to contribute to. We believe this business continues to demonstrate a strong trajectory with the potential to continue to drive growth. Fourth, we make continuous progress to develop and expand our pipeline as we work to build a multi-franchise portfolio. We added four clinical programs to our pipeline this quarter, including the two mid to late stage ophthalmology gene therapy programs we acquired through Nightstar, also an oral BTK for MS and an oral compound for sporadic ALS. In total, we have added 17 clinical programs over the past two and a half years as we have materially expanded and diversified our pipeline which now includes 27 clinical programs. Mike, will provide more details on the development across our entire pipeline. Fifth, we maintain our diligent focus on capital allocation to maximize potential shareholder returns. During the second quarter, we generated $2 billion in cash flow from operations and we benefited from the expiration of the contingent payments related to TECFIDERA. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 10.4 million shares at an average price of $231 per share for a total of $2.4 billion. As we have stated previously, we view share repurchase as an important element of thoughtful and value creating capital allocation. But at the same time, we have the financial flexibility and capacity to continue to evaluate potential external business development and M&A opportunities as evidenced by the 11 deals we executed over the past 2.5 years, including our recent acquisition of Nightstar. As we have demonstrated, we are committed to maximizing returns for our shareholders, while continuing to bring innovative service to patients something that demands a thoughtful approach towards all our investments over both the short and the long-term. In summary, Biogen continue to execute on our strategic objectives. We delivered solid financial results, raised our full year 2019 financial guidance, continue to progress our pipeline and we\u2019re opportunistic and discipline with capital allocation. Our core MS business demonstrated resilience and delivered an all-time high quarterly revenues. SPINRAZA continue to grow into key markets, including mature markets such as the US and we presented compelling new data for the NURTURE study. We grew our biosimilars business driven by strong launch of IMRALDI. We added four new clinical programs to our pipeline and we generated significant cash as we focus on strategic - strategically allocating capital towards the areas we believe have the highest potential return. Before I conclude, I would like to discuss how Biogen is evolving its strategy to drive long-term growth. Together with our Board of Directors, we have reflected on the opportunities before us and we continue to believe that the core focus on neuroscience will lead to long-term shareholder value creation based on the large and growing epidemiology, breaking science and our deep neuroscience expertise and core capabilities. With that said, we are refining the five strategic priorities we outlined two years ago. Our overarching goals are to enhance our focus on our current commercial business, accelerate the areas with the most attractive opportunities to build new franchises, rebalance the risk reward profile of our pipeline, prioritize our investment based on clinical data and widen our lens to new therapeutic areas. Our first priority remains unchanged to maintain long-term leadership in MS and maximize the resilience of that franchise. Our second priority is to build out a broader leading franchise in our muscular disorders. We aim to bid [ph] on SPINRAZA as the most successful rare disease launch ever as we pursue multiple potential therapies for ALS, as well as in muscle strengthening program with potential applicability across a broad range of neuromuscular diseases. We have reported very encouraging results for tofersen in SOD1 ALS, and we believe this has positive implication for our broader portfolio targeting order form of the disease. Our third priority is to continue developing and expanding our neuroscience portfolio, while now also widening our lens to selectively follow the science into therapeutic adjacencies including immunology. Mike will provide more details on our strategy in R&D. Our fourth priority is to unlock the potential of biosimilars as a continued growth driver as we work to create financial headroom for innovation in the healthcare system. We aim to both increase the size of our biosimilars portfolio and expand geographically. And fifth in parallel, we will continue to drive efficiencies including adopting digitalization in our operating model through continuous improvement and we will be diligent in capital allocation as we aim to maximize returns for shareholders. We believe these priorities reflect both the recent progress we made and the most attractive opportunities ahead of us. We are working diligently to rebalance the risk profile of our pipeline leading us to prioritize the areas we believe have the greatest probability of success and highest potential return. Overall Biogen's purpose remains the same. We aim to transform patient\u2019s life by pioneering and leading neuroscience and therapeutic adjacencies. I will now turn the call over to Mike for a more detailed update on our recent progress and long-term strategy in R&D. Michael Ehlers : Thank you, Michel. And good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with the progress in our industry-leading neuroscience pipeline and with our expanding efforts in immunology. Illustrating the momentum in our portfolio, we look forward to 10 mid to late-stage readouts over the next 18 months. As Michel mentioned, our top priorities are to continue strengthening our franchise in MS and neuromuscular disorders. Beyond these priorities we are refining the emphasis within our core and emerging areas. To that end based on the opportunities we see following our acquisition of Nightstar Therapeutics, we now view ophthalmology as a core growth area. Moreover, recognizing the potential of our existing assets and long-standing expertise in immunology we can now consider this to be an emerging growth area. Diving in, let me begin with advances we made in the second quarter to secure long-term scientific leadership in our MS and neuromuscular franchises. At the annual meetings at the American Academy of Neurology and the consortium of multiple sclerosis centers, we presented new interim data from EVOLVE MS-1, an ongoing single-arm open-label 2-year Phase III study, evaluating the safety and efficacy of diroximel fumarate to be marketed as VUMERITY if approved by the FDA in patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Interim results in 696 MS patients showed that treatment with diroximel fumarate was associated with a 79% reduction in the annualized relapse rate over one year when compared to baseline, with an 83% reduction in newly diagnosed patients. The mean number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions in patients treated with diroximel fumarate was reduced by 77% compared to baseline in the total population and by 96% in newly diagnosed patients. Over one year the rate of gastrointestinal adverse events leading to discontinuation was 0.7%. GI tolerability of diroximel fumarate versus TECFIDERA is been evaluated in the ongoing EVOLVE MS-2 study. This study is now near completion and we expect results in coming weeks. I am also pleased to announce that we have dosed the first subject in the Phase I study of BIIB091, a highly potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase or BTK. BTK is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates development and signaling of B cells and myeloid cells that are hypothesized to contribute to the pathogenesis of MS. Notably BIIB091 is in non-covalent innovator of BTK which we believe together with its high potency and selectivity has a potentially best-in-class profile. This placebo-controlled single and multiple ascending dose study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of BIIB091 in healthy adults. Turning to our progress in neuromuscular disorders. At the Cure SMA Annual Conference and the 5th Congress of the European Academy of Neurology, we presented new interim data from the NURTURE study of SPINRAZA in presymptomatic infants with SMA. Now including up to 45 months of analysis, this ongoing open-label study once again highlighted the remarkable efficacy profile of SPINRAZA. Specifically, of the 25 presymptomatic patients with SMA treated with SPINRAZA in this study 100% were alive, none required tracheostomy or permanent ventilation. 100% were sitting independently and 92% were walking independently or with assistance. In addition, patients were approaching the maximum score of 64 on the CHOP INTEND measure of motor function. At last visit, patients with three SMN2 copies achieved a mean score of 63.4 out of 64 and patients with two SMN2 achieved a mean score of 62.1 out of 64. Importantly, these data also showed that the overwhelming majority of patients had achieved these motor milestones within the timeframe of normal development. Given the robust, durable efficacy of SPINRAZA across a broad range of SMA patients, its well established longer-term safety profile with the reversible targeted mechanism of action and unsurpassed real-world experience, we believe SPINRAZA will remain a foundation of care in SMA for years to come. Moreover, we believe that SPINRAZA demonstrates the transformative potential of antisense oligonucleotide therapies to dramatically alter the course of diseases of the nervous system. We are excited by the depth of our ASO pipeline targeting the genetic underpinnings of a range of neurological diseases such as ALS. Specifically, as we described during our recent ALS webcast, we are targeting genetic forms of ALS where modulation of genetic target is causally linked to disease. For instance, we continue to advance the Phase 3 VALOR study of tofersen, an antisense oligonucleotide designed to degrade SOD1 mRNA and SOD1 ALS. We believe that this study has the potential to support registration for this devastating genetic form of ALS. We have now finalized the Phase 3 study design, which includes 99 patients treated with 100 milligram tofersen or placebo. Over the course of this 20 weeks \u2013 28 week study, patients will receive three loading doses over the first 29 days, followed by maintenance doses every four weeks. Based on the final stage three study design, we expect a readout from this study in 2021. We also continue to advance the Phase 1 study of BIIB078, an antisense oligonucleotide targeting hexanucleotide repeat expansions in C9ORF72, the most common genetic cause of ALS. Data from this study are also expected in 2021. Further, we are pursuing novel scientifically driven drug targets for the larger opportunity in sporadic ALS. To this end, I am pleased to announce that the first patient was dosed in the Phase 1 study of BIIB100 for sporadic ALS last month. BIIB100 is a small molecule inhibitor of exportin 1 or XPO1, a nuclear transport factor that mediates the export of many proteins from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm. With BIIB100, we aim to test the hypothesis that reducing nucleoprotein export may prevent the formation of neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions and thereby slow the clinical progression of sporadic ALS. In movement disorders, the Phase 2 study of our anti-tau antibody BIIB091 or gosuranemab in progressive supranuclear palsy is fully enrolled with data expected in the second half of this year. We believe the positive data from this study could potentially support a regulatory filing. Also this quarter we completed enrollment of the Phase 2 study of BIIB054, a monoclonal antibody targeting extracellular alpha-synuclein for Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is the second common neurodegenerative disorder with the prevalence of approximately three million patients across the G7 and no available treatment to slow its inexorable progression. Aggregation of misfolded alpha-synuclein and degeneration of nigro-striatal dopaminergic neurons represents hallmark pathologies of Parkinson\u2019s disease and genetic data from familial Parkinson\u2019s disease shows that alpha-synuclein can play a causal role in Parkinson\u2019s disease pathogenesis. In the second half of next year, we expect to receive data from the one year placebo-controlled period of this study. This will include safety data as well as a neuro imaging-based assessment of striatal dopamine transporter density. Beyond BIIB054, we expect advance up to two new antisense oligonucleotide programs for Parkinson\u2019s disease into the clinic by the end of the year. And in Alzheimer's disease and dementia, this quarter our collaboration partner, Eisai, dosed the first patient in the Phase 3 study of BAN2401 for early Alzheimer\u2019s disease and continued to advance the Phase 3 study for Elenbecestat, also for early Alzheimer's disease. In parallel, we continue to advance our portfolio of tau-directed therapeutics including gosuranemab in Phase 2, BIIB076, a distinct anti-tau antibody in Phase 1, and BIIB080, an antisense oligonucleotide targeting tau mRNA currently in Phase 1, being developed in collaboration with Ionis Pharmaceuticals. Further, we are advancing a suite of next-generation preclinical programs pursuing genetically validated targets for defined subsets of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia patients. Moving to neurocognition, we continue to advance the Phase 2b study of BIIB104 for the treatment of cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. Last month the FDA granted fast track designation to BIIB104 for this indication. BIIB104 is a first-in-class AMPA receptor potentiator that we believe has compelling data from a number of distinct early clinical studies. Data from this Phase 2b study are expected in late 2020. As I mentioned earlier, we view immunology as an emerging growth area for Biogen that takes advantage our long-standing in-house expertise in this area. This quarter we completed enrollment of the Phase 2 study of BIIB059, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds BDCA2 for cutaneous lupus erythematosus, or CLE and systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE. As shown in the Phase 1 study of BIIB059 recently published in the General of Clinical Investigation, treatment with BIIB059 led to BDCA2 internalization on plasmacytoid dendritic cells, as well as decrease interferon pathway activation, reduced immune infiltrates and skin lesions, and decreased cutaneous disease activity in patients with SLE and CLE. With limited available treatment options and a prevalence of approximately 800,000 patients across the G7, we aim to bring forward a potentially new disease modifying therapy to this area of high unmet need. Data from this study are expected by the end of this year. Further, in collaboration with UCB, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 program with the - in the first half of next year for dapirolizumab pegol, an anti-CD40 ligand pegylated fab in patients with active SLE despite standard-of-care treatment. This decision is based on the promising results of the Phase 2b clinical trial. Interim data from this study were presented at the European Congress of Rheumatology last month. As part of the ongoing process of balancing risk and opportunity within our pipeline, we continue to strategically prioritize our programs and disease areas. To that end, we have decided not to initiate the Phase 3 trials for Vixotrigine or BIIB074 in trigeminal neuralgia this year, although we will continue with Phase 3 preparation activities in advance of a potential initiation next year. We will continue to evaluate our trigeminal neuralgia program and we will assess the potential initiation of Phase 3 studies next year. We continue to advance the Phase 2 study of Vixotrigine in small fiber neuropathy and now expect to readout from that study in 2021. In addition, we continue to enroll the Phase 3 study of BIIB093 for the prevention and treatment of severe cerebral edema in patients with large hemispheric infarction with the potential launch as early as 2022. We also expect a Phase 2 readout of TMS007 in acute ischemic stroke by the end of next year. Finally, emphasizing our focus on genetically validated targets in defined patient populations to rebalance pipeline risk, let me conclude by highlighting our recent acquisition of Nightstar Therapeutics. We are extremely excited to join forces with this talented team of drug developers to address serious genetic causes of blindness for which there are no current treatment options. This acquisition accelerates our entry into ophthalmology with the potential to deliver first-in-class gene therapies to patients suffering from severe retinal diseases. Our lead drug candidate, NSR-REP1 now known as BIIB111 is an AAV-based gene therapy delivered by targeted sub-retinal injection for the treatment of choroideremia, a rare degenerative disease that inevitably leads to blindness, for which there are no current therapies. In Phase 1/2 trials, treatment with BIIB111 via subretinal injection was associated with the higher rate of maintained vision and in a subset of patients, a meaningful improvement in visual acuity, suggesting that BIIB111 has the potential to significantly alter the course of this disease. We expect data from the Phase 3 STAR trial of BIIB111 in the second half of next year. Our second clinical stage asset NSR-RPGR now known as BIIB112 is an AAV-based gene therapy targeting X-linked retinitis pigmentosa or XLRP. Like BIIB111, BIIB112 is delivered by targeted subretinal injection. Data from the Phase 1/2 dose-escalation study showed promising signals of early efficacy, including increases in central retinal sensitivity as measured by microperimetry. Phase 2/3 dose expansion study of BIIB112 is currently enrolling with data expected in the second half of next year. These diseases, which inevitably lead to blindness and the associated severe disability are part of a larger set of inherited retinal diseases which have been estimated to afflict up to 200,000 patients in the U. S. alone that maybe amendable to similar genetic medicine solutions. We look forward to leveraging our newly acquired leading clinical platform in specialty ophthalmology to potentially expand the future opportunity across inherited retinal diseases. As Michel mentioned, including our new Nightstar assets, we added four clinical programs to our pipeline this quarter, BIIB111 for choroideremia, BIIB112 for X-linked retinitis pigmentosa, BIIB091, a small molecule BTK inhibitor for MS, and BIIB100, a small molecule XPO1 inhibitor for sporadic ALS. In total, we have added 17 clinical programs over the past 2.5 years as we have continued to expand our pipeline. And we expect to advance up to three additional programs into the clinic in the second half of this year, including up to two new antisense oligonucleotide programs for Parkinson\u2019s disease. As we widen our strategic lens, we will continue to mitigate risk by seeking later stage assets, prioritizing targets that have been validated by human genetics, deploying biomarkers in early stage clinical programs and leveraging our asymmetric capabilities and expertise in neuroscience. With 10 mid to late stage readouts over the next 18 months including 8 Phase II readouts the Phase III readout of BIIB111 and head-to-head data for VUMERITY, we believe we are poised to reinforce our core franchises in MS and neuromuscular disorders build for their depth in our neuroscience portfolio and followed the science into emerging areas. Above all, we remain focused on our goal of developing transformative medicines from patients living with devastating neurological diseases.  I will now pass the call to Jeff. Jeffrey Capello : Thanks, Mike. Good morning everyone. I'll now review our financial performance for the second quarter 2019 starting with revenues. As Michel mentioned earlier, we had a very strong Q2, 2019 from a revenue perspective. Total revenues for the second quarter grew 8% year-over-year to approximately $3.6 billion. Overall our MS business delivered revenues of approximately $2.4 billion in the second quarter 2019, including OCREVUS royalties of approximately $183 million, growing 3% versus the prior year. Global MS revenues in Q2 2019 were stable versus the prior year without OCREVUS royalties. US MS revenues in Q2, 2019 were impacted by a decrease in channel inventory of approximately $25 million compared to a decrease of approximately $50 million in Q2, 2018 and a decrease of approximately $175 million in Q1, 2019. In addition this quarter we benefited from lower than anticipated discounts and allowances, which is not expected to continue for the rest of the year. Global second quarter TECFIDERA revenues increased 6% versus the prior year driven by revenue growth both in the U.S. and outside the US. U.S. TECFIDERA revenues were impacted by decrease in channel inventory for approximately $10 million in the second quarter 2019 compared to a decrease of approximately $40 million in Q2, 2019 and a decrease of approximately $110 million in Q1, 2019. We were pleased to see a continued increase in the share of new prescriptions for TECFIDERA in US and for the second consecutive quarter our share of new prescriptions exceeded our share of total prescriptions. Additionally, our share of new prescriptions in the US for TECFIDERA is now its highest point since the launch of OCREVUS. Outside the US, TECFIDERA performed very well in Q2, 2019 with continued volume increases across all large European markets and Japan versus the prior year somewhat offset by pricing pressure in several European countries. In total TECFIDERA delivered strong global patient growth of approximately 8% year-over-year. Q2 Global interferon revenues including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY and decreased 11% versus the second quarter of 2018 due to the continuing shifts from the injectable platforms to oral or high-efficacy therapies. Within the US AVONEX and PLEGRIDY were impacted by decrease in channel inventory of approximately $5 million compared to a decrease of approximately $10 million in Q2, 2018 and a decrease of approximately $50 million in Q1, 2019. Outside the US, interferon revenues benefited by approximately $10 million with channel dynamics within Europe. TYSABRI worldwide revenues increased 2% versus the second quarter of 2018. Within the US, TYSABRI revenues were impacted by a decrease in channel inventory of approximately $10 million compared to relatively stable levels in Q2 2018 and a decrease of approximately $15 million in Q1 2019. We were pleased to see stability in TYSABRI revenues in the US along with growth outside the US versus the prior year. We believe the recent launch of Mayzent has primarily impacted GILENYA so far with minimal impact on TECFIDERA and TYSABRI in the second quarter. Overall, we were pleased with the execution of our MS franchise and a strong performance of our MS business in the second quarter. We continue to be focused on maintaining resilience and MS market leadership. Let me now move onto SPINRAZA. Global second quarter SPINRAZA revenues increased 15% versus the prior year to $488 million. In the US revenues increased 12% versus the second quarter 2018 and 3% versus Q1 2019, driven by continued patient growth, which we believe demonstrates that SPINRAZA has the potential for continued steady growth in larger more mature markets. The number of patients on therapy in the US increased 4% as compared to the end of the first quarter of 2019. Since its approval in late May, we have not seen a meaningful impact from Zolgensma on SPINRAZA performance in US. As a reminder, Zolgensma is only indicator for children under two years old, which represents approximately 5% of the prevalent market. In the US, we continue to make strong progress with adults. In the second quarter, we were pleased to see approximately 50% of new starts were adults and the number of adult patients in the US increased by approximately 7% versus the first quarter 2019. We still believe there is a large opportunity remaining, as we\u2019ve only reached approximately 20% of the adults in the US. And as a reminder, this is the largest patient segment representing approximately 60% of the SMA market. In the US, we observed discontinuation rate is relatively low, currently in the mid-single digits on an annualized basis. Outside the US revenues increased 19% for the second quarter 2018, driven by continued new country launches and increased penetration across all major geographies. In total, outside the US, the number of commercial SPINRAZA patients increased approximately 17% versus the prior quarter. We recorded revenues from over 40 international markets in the second quarter. During the past quarter, we secured broad reimbursement in the UK, Ireland and Argentina. As a reminder, we believe the global opportunity for SPINRAZA is significant and even greater than we had initially anticipated. We estimate that there are over 45,000 individuals with SMA in the markets where Biogen has a direct presence, including attractive markets of Asia Pacific and Latin America. Versus Q1 2019, ex-US revenues decreased 13%. As we previously mentioned on our last earnings call, Q1 revenues benefited from a positive pricing adjustment of $14 million in France and the timing of shipments across several international markets, which can be lumpy at times, affecting the quarter-over-quarter comparison. In the second quarter, ex-US revenues were also impacted by the continued transition from loading to maintenance doses in more mature markets. Although, overall ex-US revenues declined due to quarterly dynamics - excuse me, we saw quarter-over-quarter patient growth in the mid single digits across the larger more mature European markets, as well as Japan, significant patient growth in Turkey and strong double-digit patient growth across multiple markets in Asia Pacific and Latin America. Overall, we were pleased to see continued patient growth across the larger mature markets and continued rapid uptick for more recently launched markets. Given our expected continued patient growth and the execution across many global markets, our established product profile and the significant market opportunity, we remain optimistic of our SMA business and its trajectory. Let me now move on to our biosimilars business, which generated $184 million this quarter, growing 45% versus the prior year. We estimate, there are now over 170,000 patients using our biosimilars in Europe. BENEPALI has continued to grow in volume and market share across Europe, strengthening its leadership position in markets such as Germany, the UK, Norway and Denmark. We were pleased to report that BENEPALI has now become the number one prescribed embryo biosimilar across the major EU5 markets. FLIXABI volume grew 96% versus the prior year. IMRALDI volumes grew 40% versus 44% versus Q1 2019 and it continues to be the leading launched HUMIRA biosimilar across Europe. The IMRALDI autoinjectors have been well received in the market and continues to build on our success with BENEPALI and offering an improved patient experience at a lower price point. In a recent study comparing the IMRALDI autoinjector device with the HUMIRA device, 85% of nurses and 78% of patients prefer the IMRALDI device. Our biosimilars business along with SPINRAZA has help drive geographic diversification of our revenue base. We aim to continue capitalizing on global growth opportunities for both our current commercial portfolio and our pipeline products. Total anti-CD20 revenues in Q2 increased 18% versus the prior year, primarily driven by OCREVUS royalties. Q2 OCREVUS royalties benefited by approximately $17 million due to adjustment related to prior periods. We continue to expect RITUXAN revenues to be impacted by entry of biosimilars in US beginning in the fourth quarter of this year. Total other revenues in the second quarter increased 47% versus the prior year. These revenues tend to be lumpy and difficult to predict. Let me now turn to gross margin performance. Q2 2019 gross margin was 87%, an improvement versus Q1 2019 following the sale of most of the remaining inventory in the first quarter which carried a very low gross margin. Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense were both 13% of revenue. Q2 R&D benefited from both savings related to aducanumab, as well as the timing of spend. As a reminder, the second quarter 2018 R&D expense included $324 million related to the upfront payment to Ionis. Q2 GAAP R&D expense also included an additional $162 million related to our equity investment in Ionis. Q2 GAAP SG&A was 16% of revenue and non-GAAP SG&A was 15% of revenue. The increase in GAAP SG&A expense versus the prior year was primarily due to approximately $33 million in acquisition-related charges incurred in connection with our recent acquisition of Nightstar. Q2 GAAP other expense was $197 million including $174 million in net losses on investments, principally driven by a decrease in the fair value of our equity investment in Ionis, as well as a realized loss on the sale of Ionis stock versus the prior quarter. In Q2 2019 non-GAAP, other expense was $19 million. In Q2, our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were both approximately 14%. During the second quarter, we completed the change to our tax profile. This resulted in a decrease of 500 basis points to our GAAP tax rate and a decrease of 430 basis to our non-GAAP tax rate for the second quarter. This benefit is not expected to recur post 2019. We repurchased approximately 10.4 million shares in the second quarter at an average price of $231 for a total value of approximately $2.4 billion. We completed our 2018 share repurchase authorization. And as of the end of the second quarter, we get approximately $4.1 billion remaining on our 2019 authorization, which now brings us to our diluted earnings per share. In the second quarter, we booked GAAP EPS of $7.85, an increase of 88% versus the prior year and non-GAAP earnings of $9.15, a 58% increase versus the prior year. As a reminder, Q2 2018 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS were impacted by a total of $2.84 and $1.52, respectively related to BD transactions affecting year-over-year comparisons. We generated approximately $2 billion of net cash flows from operations in the second quarter and this quarter the continued payments related to TECFIDERA expired. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.3 billion in cash and marketable securities and $5.9 billion in debt. Let me now turn to our updated full year guidance for 2019. We expect revenues of approximately $14 billion to $14.2 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of approximately 4% to 6%, which is an increase from our initial guidance of 1% to 3% growth. This range is driven primarily by uncertainty in channel inventory levels in the US at the end of the year. We anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense between 15.5% and 16.5% of sales, a slight decrease from prior guidance. This reflects a savings from the termination of the Phase 3 studies aducanumab, as well as additional operating expenses for the Nightstar programs we acquired. We expect GAAP SG&A expense to be approximately 16% to 17% of revenues and non-GAAP SG&A expense to be approximately 15.5% to 16.5% of revenues. We expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 17% to 18% and our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 15.5% to 16.5%. We anticipate full year GAAP diluted EPS of $29.60 to $30.40, representing growth of 37% to 41% versus 2018 and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be $31.50 to $32.30, representing growth of 20% to 23% also an increase versus prior guidance. Of note this guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions as both are hard to predict. I'll now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you, Jeff. Biogen demonstrated strong commercial execution this quarter and we continue to apply our world class capabilities expertise to progress our pipeline, all while maintaining a diligent focus on continuous improvement and strategic capital allocation. Between now and the end of 2020, we expect continued progress as we aim to build inventory franchise portfolio, including 10 mid to late stage data readouts in MS, PSP, lupus, epilepsy, Parkinson\u2019s disease, cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia, stroke and ophthalmology, and potential regulatory approval in the US for VUMERITY in MS. Finally, I want to reiterate our commitment to maximizing returns to our shareholders and bring innovative participation over the long-term. These demands that we continue to allocate capital efficiently, effectively and appropriately. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will always strive to have an optimal capital structure, as well as aim for superior returns from the investment we make. As we are closing a solid quarter, I would like to step back and comment on what we stand for as a company and how we conduct our business. We believe doing the right things for patients, employees, the environment and the communities we serve will help build sustainable value for all our stakeholders including our investors. After 41 years, we are extremely proud of our track record and commitment to sustainability. Finally, I would like to thank our employees around the world who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patient's lives and all of the physician, caregivers and participants in our clinical development programs, our past and future achievements could not be realized beyond the passion and commitment. With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Cory Kasimov : Hey. Good morning, guys. And thank you for taking my question. So want to ask about SPINRAZA. And it sounds like there hasn't been an impact thus far from Zolgensma at least to-date. But I am curious if you're seeing any signs of potential warehousing of the minority portion of the SMA patients that are currently eligible for gene therapy? And how you're thinking about the growth outlook for the product when considering a nice year-over-year jump in sales, but another quarter-over-quarter decline before competition potentially kicks in? Thanks. Jeffrey Capello : So Cory, this is Jeff. So this point we don't see - we haven't seen any indication that there maybe any warehousing, I mean, it's difficult to tell. But there is no impact at this point in time. I mean, as we mentioned patients were up pretty well year-over-year and they were up sequentially. And if you look at kind of the larger segment of that patient pool which is the adult segment, it's 60% of the market, we\u2019ve only penetrated 20% of that, and Zolgensma was not indicated for that. So we think there is ample opportunity to grow within the US and continue to kind of post impressive patient numbers. Outside the US, you know, the opportunity frankly is larger. And if you look at the chart that we put out last quarter, we originally thought that the epidemiology within SMA was 20,000. We now think it\u2019s 45,000. So there is more patients outside the US within the US. We can continue to open up new countries. And our experience in US and in the large European market would indicate that we can continue to kind of penetrate the mature markets and open up new markets. So we think, it's a good growth opportunity in front of us. Michel Vounatsos : Mike? Michael Ehlers : Yeah, Cory, I\u2019ll add to that. Well, I mean, clinically one thing that's - that you need to consider and this is for what Zolgensma indicated for is the under age two - usually the more severe SMA patients for which time is really critical. We know that the time of treatment even before symptoms but certainly as a function of symptoms stage is really essential. So that would tend clinically to be a very different from a typical kind of scenario where you might be waiting for a different new treatment. Michel Vounatsos : So let me share the underlying uptake of patients behind this very successful launch is the most, I will say, positive news in mature markets and in emerging geographies where we are gaining access. So we remain confident. Obviously there are more clinical trials in that space too and it\u2019s still the early days for this new therapeutic alternatives. And we welcome alternative for patients based on the severity of the disease. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a two part. Just wondering Michel or Jeff, if there any original steps you\u2019re considering to bolster your balance sheet here beyond the sale of Hiller\u00f8d facility? And then you are fairly active on the repo front this quarter. Just - should we expect that pace to continue through the second half of the year? And should we read into it as a sign of your confidence in your TECFIDERA IP? Thanks a lot. Michael Ehlers : So, one of the many hallmarks of Biogen is a company with very strong cash flows. We generated $3.4 billion of operating cash flow within the first six months and we've now had the expiration of the TECFIDERA Fumapharm payments. So at this point in time there is really no intent to kind of - if you mean by change the balance sheet, lever up the balance sheet is certainly not the intent. The company generates a lot of cash. With regard to uses of cash, I think we've been very consistent that our capital allocation strategy is centered around optimizing of the capital allocation to maximize shareholder value and we'll continue to do that and the good thing is we've got ample capacity to do that, either vis-\u00e0-vis share repurchase or continuing to add assets to the clinical pipeline, business development, or M&A. So I would look for us to be active across the board, because we\u2019ll have the capacity, it's very strong company from that perspective. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Umer Raffat : Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to focus on TECFIDERA for a second. And it seems that a few ANDA filers have withdrawn their ANDAs and the case has been dismissed under a joint stipulation. So my question is, has there been a formal settlement, because we haven't seen a press release or did those ANDAs just not meet bioequivalence? Jeffrey Capello : So Umer, this is Jeff. We're not going to comment on the specifics of our IP situation, only to say that, as Michelle has said, a lot of interest in kind of getting it resolved. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink. Geoffrey Porges : Thank you very much for taking the question. And congratulations on the good numbers in the quarter. I suppose, I have to ask follow-up on aducanumab. Previously, you disclosed that you are continuing to monitor the patients in the study and to see whether there was any evidence of clinical effect from the - in the pivotal studies with prolonged exposure. Could you share with us what you have found with that extended follow-up? And secondly, in that context, how much are you continuing to invest in the amyloid hypothesis and particularly in 2401 and Elenbecestat, could you kind of reconcile those two for us? Thanks. Michel Vounatsos : Geoff, thank you for asking this important question. Obviously, since we did not present at AIC it is clear to everybody that we are not ready. We are not finished with our analysis of the data, first available at the cutoff date of the futility analysis, but also the data that is coming after the cutoff date of the futility. So Biogen said and will continue to follow the science and these analyses have critical importance, as you can imagine, for the patients, for the community, for public health and also for all the stakeholders. And at the same time, Biogen is trying to new frontiers, which is difficult to define. So we will present the results of ENGAGE and EMERGE studies at the future medical meetings and I hope you appreciate that we cannot say much more at this stage. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Michael Yee : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Appreciate the question. I had a question for Al Sandrock if he's there, or Mike, but that was regarding the comments around BIIB092 the tau PSP study. I know you completed enrollment, I guess, late fall last year, so the data is coming like you alluded to. Maybe just talk to how we should put into context the Phase 2b? How much confidence you would have on the end point, but perhaps more importantly, if there are pre-specified endpoints you're looking at sub-groups? What's important to you define supporting the tau hypotheses for tauopathies or more importantly Alzheimer's? Thanks so much. Al Sandrock : Yeah. Michael, this is Al. So the - we've been saying that the results will be available at the \u2013 later this year toward the end of this year. As you know, in the earlier phase studies we showed about 90% decrease in CSF-free tau. And so we definitely have target engagement, because the antibody was given intravenously and we looked in the CSF at tau. So we have target engagement in CNS. What we're hoping to see is an effect on the rating scale for PSP, which is not that different from the Parkinson's rating scale. As you know, there are - it has many of the - shares many of the features of Parkinson's disease, but there are some additional features that relate to PSP that will also be measured. And yeah, the big question right now is we have target engagement. We have lowered CSF tau. We're hoping to catch the tau as it spreads. The abnormally - the misfolded tau that spreads from cell-to-cell, there is a lot of great data that - there's prime like propagation in the CNS and PSP and in other tauopathies and we\u2019ll see whether or not we catch it as it tries to spread and have a clinical effect. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Ronny Gal : Good morning. And thank you for taking my question. Just couple of quick things on pipeline. On the PSP trial just following on Cory, how many of those patients had tau in their brain imaging? I know that wasn't available ahead of the trial, but I suspect you did it during the trial. And second Mike I noticed your investment in Skyhawk couple of weeks ago. Care to share with your roughly how long before you'll have an oral SME product in the clinic? Michael Ehlers : Okay. Yes, thanks for the question. I'll take both of those. First of all, just one point of clarification with tauopathy and PSP. The current PET imaging tracers for tau don't recognize the form of tau that accumulates in PSP, recognizes the form of tau that accumulates in Alzheimer's disease. This has to do with three hour versus four hour tau. So just to clarify that. None of them would have been imaged because there hasn't been an ability to image tau in the brain before that. On Skyhawk, yeah, that collaboration is proceeding very nicely. We\u2019re working on several targets with them. We are zeroing in on potential new clinical candidates. We don't have a timeline just yet, but I would say that we're very, very happy with the progress on many targets in this way and we hope to get some to the clinic over the next couple of years let's say. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company. Phil Nadeau : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just one question on the EVOLVE MS2 trial, you mentioned that data is going to be next few weeks. Could you do remind us to design of the study? And in particular aside from GI tolerability, what other data is going to be disclosed in the top-line release? And how you would frame risk-benefit just like you come of the space, so what would be a meaningful GI tolerability improvement in your mind? Al Sandrock : Hi, Phil. This is Al Sandrock. So, it's basically a head-to-head study against TECFIDERA. The primary outcome measure is a patient-reported outcome on GI tolerability and we\u2019re looking at essentially all aspects of GI tolerability, whether it's upper or lower, the severity, the duration and hopefully what we'll get at the end of it is an incidents, the idea of the difference in the incidence of GI tolerability events between comparison with TECFIDERA, as well as severity. And talking to our - the prescribers, the MS prescribers, incidence is probably the most important thing. Although, ultimately, you want to try to improve compliance, so we'll also be looking at things like discontinuation rate and which as Mike said in the EVOLVE 1 study, we had a very low discontinuation rate. So, we\u2019re hopeful that we'll see a nice comparison to TECFIDERA in this EVOLVE 2 study. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to follow-up on something Phil said. Can you just talk if you are able to achieve the profile that you've talked about with VUMERITY in terms of, let's say, lowering your incidence? I mean, how does that impact how do you think about the drug commercially. Would you expect to be able to try and switch TECFIDERA patients who are already stable, and because I know mostly GI effects come early in drug or how should we think about VUMERITY commercially if you are able to achieve that profile? Thanks. Michel Vounatsos : So thanks for the good question. Obviously, we need to consider the outset that the patients on TEC after the four, five, first weeks are stabilized that they are doing fine. So the strategy is not to switch, the strategy is to expand. Al Sandrock : Yeah, I mean most physicians that I talked to would not want to switch somebody who is done well, who stabilized the initial phases of taking TECFIDERA and or doing well in terms of tolerability. Of course, if there is breakthrough disease you would consider switching probably to a different mechanism of action. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Salim Syed with Mizuho. Salim Syed : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Mike or Al, I had a question for you actually. You guys have mentioned in the past, I believe that you are looking at new MS targets. And I was curious what your thoughts were on EBV as a target? Thank you. Michael Ehlers : Yeah. So, this is Mike. Look I'll say this has been a long-standing interesting hypothesis. We've really rejuvenated our effort on early targets in MS and novel target including something that might be virally based and other sales based. So early days in a lot of that. But we've created a new highly dedicated group, focused on early stage MS research in novel mechanisms. And so where we see an opportunity, independent of modality we will advance that. Al Sandrock : The EBV is a very interesting virus, so if you look at epidemiological studies and MS, particularly out of Harvard School of Public Health. There is a strong implication that EBV infection precedes the onset of MS. It's very tantalizing that the B-cell follicles that are in CNS in the sub-meningeal space generally they are EBV positive. EBV effects B-cell function and B-cells are, obviously, important in MS as seen by all the drugs that are directed against B-cells, ocrelizumab and BTK inhibitors have seem to have efficacy. So, I think in some ways EBV is very interesting as a causal virus. However, in terms of treatment, once the virus activates the immune system toward an autoimmune state, I don't know whether getting rid of the virus will help. These B-cell follicles molecules in the CNS, perhaps getting rid of the EBV positive B-cells there maybe helpful. But treating the virus itself, you'd have to design a study very, very early, perhaps even before MS even starts. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Brian Abrahams : Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question. Appreciate the strategic updates, and congrats to Joe on his new role. You talked about immunology as more formalized area of focus. I was wondering if you can speak a little bit broadly about how you plan to approach the space, maybe which of your assets you expect to prioritize? And then potential BD and future commercial strategy that you're thinking about within immunology? Thanks. Michael Ehlers : Sure, Brian. This is Mike. I'll start out with that. So we are very happy about this where we're going to start with focus is where we've got existing assets and or expertise. By and large right now that\u2019s really going to start with our lupus program it include BIIB059, the BDCA2 antibody and dapirolizumab pegol, this anti-CD40 ligand Fab. And from that we will look at things that touch on that either within that indication space or perhaps in and around those mechanisms to expand. It will start with those places where we\u2019ve got existing assets and or capability. We think it fits very nicely with a lot of the ongoing programs and things that we're otherwise doing. It also - I\u2019d say on the business development front does give us an ability to look somewhat more broadly at external opportunities we might be able to use for either early or late supplementation of the pipeline. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Matteis with Stifel. Paul Matteis : Great. Thanks so much to taking the question. I wanted to ask a question on business development. What is Biogen\u2019s thinking on the ongoing delays with the Roche Spark deal and what that might mean for your ability to do M&A in areas where you already have a strong presence? For example, you have a pretty broad pipeline and assets either in your pipeline or marketed in a lot of areas of neurology. Does the delay that's going on which seems to be about therapeutic overlap make you at all reluctant to be more aggressive in M&A in areas where you already have a presence? How did this complicate things, if at all? Thanks. Michel Vounatsos : So it's always difficult to kind of I think what you're getting at is kind of antitrust. I think we will take a careful approach as we look at business development. But we don't see that deterrent, to be active from BD or M&A perspective, we will certainly be careful as kind of look at targets. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Evan Seigerman : Hi, guys. Thank you for taking the question and congrats on the progress. One for Al and Michael, so with the recent failure of base inhibitor reported by Amgen, Novartis why does Biogen continue to pursue development of Elenbecestat? And generally given the failure of a beta antibodies, what gives you confidence that targeting tau is the right approach for AD? Michael Ehlers : So Evan, why don't I take the beginning of this? Of course you know, we're highly aware of all the announcements in and around base inhibitors and resent Novartis and Amgen announcement of the termination, they\u2019re discontinuing their base inhibitors. So we're highly aware of this. I would say patient safety is paramount in our clinical trials, including the Mission AD1 and Mission AD2 trials for the base inhibitor that is being conducted in collaboration with our collaboration partner Eisai. Those studies have independent data in safety monitoring board that reviews the data regularly from those Phase III studies. And to-date the DSMB has recommended the studies proceed. They have an ability to look at that data when they want and they are certainly aware of the likewise the safety signals and discontinuation of other programs and they will be assessing as it goes along. As BAN2401, I'll refer back to what Michel commented on earlier, which is that we are in the midst of very thorough analysis of all the ENGAGE and EMERGE data from aducanumab which is an extensive data set and we would like to have a full understanding of that data before we make a specific forward development decisions on BAN2401. Michel Vounatsos : I think we have time for about two more questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with UBS. Carter Gould : Great. Thanks, guys. I guess for Michel or Michael, as far as your comments earlier around rebalancing the risk reward of the pipeline it sounded like that was really kind of externally focused, but I wanted to ask if there is any sort of thoughts underway to also revisit maybe our existing programs and any change there in sort of the hurdle for moving programs forward? Any color there would be appreciated? Thank you. Al Sandrock : Yeah. Carter, good question. So I mean, the few things we would say to maybe flush that out a little bit. I mean, we've had an ongoing effort over some time to really look at the risk reward profile and that means to be able to balance risk in different categories and include things like seeking later stage assets where we can, taking advantage of unique capabilities where we see them leveraging our debt in certain areas like MS and neuromuscular, where we've got very strong franchises, and likewise going after the types of disease where we\u2019ve got high confidence, things where there you've got genetically defined targets and genetically defined patient populations. And you can see examples of that in our pipeline that have been very intentional. These include things like VUMERITY, as a very good example of rebalancing risk, supporting our MS franchise. I think, you see that within our Nightstar acquisition and the mid to late stage clinical programs in gene therapy there, Choroideremia and X-linked retinitis pigmentosa. And hopefully that came across in my emphasis on our confidence in our ASO platform and ASO programs that we've been advancing collaboration with Ionis. In addition to that, I think, and Michel spoke to this, we look to our important clinical readouts, our 10 upcoming clinical readouts in the next 18 months as trigger points, to help define and refine the areas that we really want to concentrate resource and activity on in the future. Michel Vounatsos : If I may just add to the good comments made by Mike, it's also the opportunity to widen the strategic plans and important readouts in the coming months in BIIB059 in lupus. So stay tuned. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Mohit Bansal with Citigroup. Mohit Bansal : Great. Good morning and thanks for taking my question and a very warm welcome to Joe from our side as well. So quickly on guidance, it appears to be indicating a slight decline or maybe flat revenues in the second half versus the first half. You mentioned inventory. But could you please provide little bit more granularity on the process or thought process for remainder of the year. Is RITUXAN biosimilar which is the bigger factor here? Thank you. Michael Ehlers : So we\u2019re not \u2013 we have a policy of kind of giving guidance twice a year and not doing it by the product level, but what I can do is kind of maybe point you to some areas within the historical numbers. Certainly, in the first quarter, Bioverativ inventory sale certainly helped the first quarter inventory growth. You have to look at that. That was a one-time type element. We also, in the second quarter - the MS business was quite strong as a result of the less of an inventory dry down and some gross-to-net favorability, which we don't expect to continue. And then, two other factors that I would highlight is, SPINRAZA will face some more difficult comparisons in the second half of this year compared to the second - first half of this year. The numbers get bigger. And then finally, the RITUXAN and GAZYVA we've said all along that we expect competition to come in the fourth quarter. So if you look at all those factors, it would indicate there would be little more strength in the first half versus the second half. Mohit Bansal : Got you. Very helpful. Thank you. Michael Ehlers : Yeah. Michel Vounatsos : So thank you all for attending our call today. Another very strong quarter for our company, very exciting times at Biogen nowadays. Thank you. Talk to you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining. And you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Third Quarter 2019 Financial Results and Business Update. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Joe Mara, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Joe Mara : Good morning, everyone and welcome to Biogen\u2019s third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. On today\u2019s call, we will be discussing our Q3 results as well as an update on our Alzheimer\u2019s program aducanumab including our plan to file in the U.S. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2 and Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussion related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the Risk Factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today\u2019s call, I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Al Sandrock, EVP, Research and Development and our Chief Medical Officer; Dr. Samantha Budd Haeberlein, Vice President, Late Stage Clinical Development and our CFO, Jeff Capello. Now I will turn the call over to Michel. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you, Joe and good morning everyone. I will start by giving you an outline of this call since we are announcing both Q3 results and news on aducanumab. First, I will review the recent news on aducanumab. Next, I will provide the key highlights of a strong quarter. Al and Samantha will then provide additional details on aducanumab and progress across the rest of our pipeline. Jeff will discuss our financial performance for Q3 and I will close before we open the call for questions. This is an important day as we are announcing that based on discussion with the FDA, we plan to submit a regulatory filing in the U.S. for aducanumab. If approved, aducanumab will become the first therapy to reduce clinical decline in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and the first therapy to show that removing amyloid beta can lead to better clinical outcomes. This is an important milestone providing hope for patients, physicians, caregivers and families around the world. It is also important to highlight that the path taken in the pursuit of discovering and developing breakthrough treatments is not always direct and straightforward. As you know in March, we announced our decision to discontinue the Phase 3 EMERGE and ENGAGE studies for aducanumab in Alzheimer\u2019s disease based on a pre-specified futility analysis. In retrospect the result of our futility analysis was incorrect. Based on what we know now it is clear that the pre-specified futility criteria did not adequately anticipate the effect of all the variables in these trials. So, what happened? First, the decision to stop these trials relied on an earlier and smaller dataset comprised only of patients who had the opportunity to complete 18 months of treatment as of December 26, 2018. At that time, the futility analysis predicted that the trials were unlikely to meet the primary endpoint upon completion. Futility analysis are common in large studies and they use statistical modeling to attempt to predict the outcome of the studies based on a number of pre-specified assumptions and criteria. There are multiple methodologies that can be used for futility analysis and the methodology we use was a well accepted approach. However, based on what we have learned, we know now that the futility analysis did not adequately account for the effect that the earlier enrollment in ENGAGE had on patients overall exposure to high dose aducanumab. Second, in the months following the discontinuation of the studies, our team has continued to analyze the vast set of clinical imaging and biomarker data that the studies have generated. In addition to further analysis of the dataset which informed the futility analysis we also gain access to an analyzed additional data, including data on patients who completed treatment after the cutoff date for the futility analysis as well as data for patients who did not complete the full duration of the study. Once we became aware of the potential implication of this larger dataset, we consulted with external advisors followed by the FDA with a Type C Meeting in June as we began conducting further analysis. Third, the new analysis of the larger dataset, which was conducted in consultation with the FDA, showed that aducanumab had a dose-dependent effect on the underlying pathology as measured by amyloid-PET imaging and reduced clinical decline in patients with early Alzheimer\u2019s disease as measured by the pre-specified primary and secondary endpoints. Based on the second type C meeting held with the FDA just yesterday, we believe this data support regulatory filing. Beyond aducanumab, we are hopeful about the implication of these results for similar approaches targeting amyloid beta, including BAN2401. Looking forward, we plan to submit a regulatory filing in the U.S. in early 2020 and we will continue dialog with regulatory authorities in international markets, including in Europe and Japan. Most importantly, we have a deep commitment to the patients\u2019 community starting with those who participated in our clinical trials. With the support of the FDA, we aim to offer access to aducanumab as soon as possible to eligible patients previously enrolled in the Phase 3 studies, the long-term extension of the Phase 1 PRIME b-study and the Phase 2 EVOLVE study. We will work towards this goal with the regulatory authorities, principal investigators and the institutional review boards with a sense of urgency. I know this development is unexpected for all our stakeholders, including the many patients involved in our clinical studies and their families, our investigators, our investors and our employees. And I am sure you have a lot of questions. We were also surprised when we initially learned about the potential implication of these additional data, but our surprise quickly turned to the hope that we maybe in the position to offer Alzheimer\u2019s patients the first step to reduce clinical decline in this devastating disease. We are humbled and honored by this opportunity and we are committed to following the science and doing the right thing for patients. Now, let me review some financial highlights from the third quarter. Compared to the same period a year ago, Biogen delivered solid top line and bottom line growth. Third quarter revenues grew 5% to $3.6 billion. Third quarter GAAP earnings per share grew 17% to $8.39 and non-GAAP EPS grew 24% to $9.17. Now, let me briefly review our progress against our strategic business priorities. First, we continue to demonstrate resilience in MS and we remain focused on addressing the IP challenge with TECFIDERA, while also preparing for the expected launch of VUMERITY. Second, SPINRAZA revenues grew double-digits both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Third, our biosimilars business continued to grow led by the recent launch of IMRALDI. Fourth, we continue to progress our pipeline with a positive readout on VUMERITY and the addition of two new clinical programs. And fifth, Biogen has continued to be disciplined and focused on capital allocation. As we have demonstrated, we are committed to maximizing returns for our shareholders while continuing to bring innovative therapies to patients, something that demands a thoughtful approach toward all our investment over both the short-term and the long-term. Before turning the call over to Al, I would like to congratulate him on his new role as the Head of R&D at Biogen. I know, I speak for the broader Biogen family in expressing my confidence in Al as a scientist, as a clinician, and as a leader. Al is taking the helm at the time when I believe Biogen R&D has never been stronger. And I believe he is well equipped to continue driving Biogen R&D forward. Al Sandrock : Thank you, Michel. Before diving in, let me first take a moment to say how excited I am, about the opportunity to lead the R&D organization here at Biogen. I\u2019m extremely proud of the team for all the hard work that brought us to today\u2019s announcement on aducanumab, and I believe now more than ever, that Biogen is uniquely positioned to bring breakthroughs in neuroscience and transform the lives of patients with neurological disease. As Michel said, we were all surprised when we learned of the potential implications of the new analysis of a larger dataset from the Phase 3 studies of aducanumab. Following discussions with external advisors and the FDA, we have now come to better understand what happened, and even more importantly with the positive implications of the larger dataset may mean for patients, physicians and the broader scientific community. To start, I will briefly summarize our current understanding of the Phase 3 data, before I turn the call over to Samantha, who will describe in more detail, the series of events and analysis that have led us to the current conclusions and status today. First, it is important to understand what the results \u2013 that the results you will hear about today, which we have analyzed in consultation with the FDA, are based on a new analysis of a larger dataset, than that which was used for the futility analysis. Our primary learning from these data is that sufficient exposure to high dose aducanumab reduced clinical decline across multiple clinical endpoints. This reduction and clinical decline was statistically significant in EMERGE, and we believe that patients \u2013 that the data from patients who achieve sufficient exposure to high dose aducanumab in ENGAGE support the findings of EMERGE. After consultation with the FDA, we believe that the totality of these data support a regulatory filing. Importantly patients included in the futility analysis, were those who had enrolled early in the trials and those early enrolling patients had a lower average exposure to aducanumab in large part due to two protocol amendments that occurred sometime after the start of the trials. These two protocol amendments were put in place precisely to enable more patients to reach high dose aducanumab, and for a longer duration. As a consequence, the larger dataset available after trial cessation included more patients with sufficient exposure to high dose aducanumab. Moreover, differences between EMERGE and ENGAGE can mostly be accounted for by a greater level of exposure to high dose aducanumab in EMERGE due to multiple factors including the fact that ENGAGE started earlier and enrolled earlier then EMERGE, meaning that fewer patients in ENGAGE had sufficient exposure to high dose aducanumab, as well as other factors including differences in the degree of dose suspension due to ARIA. Taken together, we believe that these data and the associated extensive analysis provide compelling evidence that aducanumab reduces the otherwise devastating and inexorable clinical decline of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. To expand further, I will now hand the call over to Samantha. Samantha Budd Haeberlein : Thank you, Al. Let me now describe in more detail how we got here. It\u2019s important to first understand the design of the studies and how that evolved over time. EMERGE and ENGAGE were Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group studies, designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aducanumab in early Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The studies were identical in design. A full enrollment EMERGE included 1,638 patients and ENGAGE included 1,647 patients. Based on the data from the Phase 1b PRIME study of aducanumab, we believed that higher doses of aducanumab may be associated with improved clinical outcomes. However, as the incidents of amyloid related imaging abnormality or ARIA for short, the most common adverse event associated with aducanumab, also increased with aducanumab dose and occurred more often in ApoE4 carriers than non-carriers. The Phase 3 study had a number of design elements, such as titration, dose levels and management with MRI to mitigate and manage the risk of ARIA. In addition, dosing of aducanumab was stratified by ApoE4 carrier status. The low dose was defined as 3 milligram per kilogram for ApoE4 carriers and 6 milligram per kilogram for non-carriers, whereas the high dose was initially defined as 6 milligram per kilogram for ApoE4 carriers and 10 milligram per kilogram for non-carriers. Results from the PRIME study for ApoE4 carriers titrated to 10 milligram per kilogram became available in August 2016. This data showed that the incidence of ARIA as well as discontinuations from treatment due to ARIA in ApoE4 carriers receiving aducanumab titrated to 10 milligram per kilogram appeared to be reduced as compared to the fixed dose cohort. Following this analysis, the protocols for the ongoing Phase 3 studies were amended such that the high dose in ApoE4 carriers would then be increased from 6 to 10 milligram per kilogram. Of note, in each study approximately two-thirds of enrolled patients were ApoE4 carriers, and the number of carriers was well balanced across each of the arms of both studies. Each dose arm had a titration period such that the maximum number of monthly 10 milligram per kilogram doses that any patient in the high dose group could receive in the 18 months study was 14. Moreover, the original protocol recommended that some patients with ARIA suspend their dosing and then restart and remain at a lower dose. ENGAGE enrolled its first patient in August 2015 and EMERGE began enrolling approximately one month later in September, 2015. Two key amendments were made to the protocols during the conduct of the study. In July of 2016, we amended the protocol to allow patients with ARIA who suspended dosing to resume aducanumab treatment at the originally assigned dose. And then in March of 2017 as I mentioned, the protocol was amended to increase the high dose for ApoE4 carriers from 6 to 10 milligram per kilogram after titration. Taken together, these protocol amendments had the effect of allowing more patients to receive their target dose. Since enrollment in ENGAGE had begun and remained ahead of EMERGE, overall more patients in EMERGE were impacted by the protocol amendments and received the 10 milligram per kilogram dosing of aducanumab. On March 21, 2019, we announced the termination of EMERGE and ENGAGE following the outcome of a pre-specified futility analysis. The futility analysis was based on efficacy data on all patients in the two trials who had enrolled early enough to have had the opportunity to have completed the 18 month study period by December 26, 2018. Futility criteria which were pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan would be met if both arms of both trials were predicted to have had less than 20% probability of being positive on the primary endpoint at the end of the study. This probability used pool data from the two trials to predict the future behavior of the remaining patients. This is a well accepted statistical methodology for two trials that are identical in design, such as EMERGE and ENGAGE. However this pooling methodology assumes no large heterogeneity between the studies. At the time of the futility analysis, EMERGE was trending positive, while ENGAGE was not. We did not understand the drivers of these different results. While we did know that the protocol amendments could have had differential effects on the two studies, due to the relative timing of enrollment. We did not anticipate the magnitude of the effect this would have on the data. Following the discontinuation of EMERGE and ENGAGE, additional data from these studies became available, namely the 2,066 patients who had the opportunity to complete the full 18 month study period by March 20th as well as all 3,285 patients who had enrolled in the trials in what\u2019s known as the intent to treat or ITT population. Importantly, once we had applied the pre-specified statistical analysis to the larger dataset, we were excited to see that EMERGE met its primary endpoint on CDR Sum of Boxes or CDR-SB. CDR-SB scores are obtained through clinician interviews of patients and caregivers and assess three domains each of cognition and function, namely memory, orientation judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care. Specifically in the intent to treat population, patients from the high dose aducanumab group showed a 23% reduction in clinical decline from baseline in CDR-SB scores at 78 weeks with a p-value of 0.01. The corresponding results in the opportunity to complete or OTC dataset was also 23% with a nominal p-value of 0.03. The low dose group also had less decline on the CDR-SB than placebo. However, the differences were smaller than in the high dose group and did not attain statistical significance. In EMERGE, patients on high dose aducanumab also showed a reduction in clinical decline as measured by the pre-specified secondary endpoints. Specifically, we saw a 15% reduction in clinical decline as measured by MMSE with a p-value of 0.06, a 27% reduction in clinical decline as measured by ADAS-COG13 with a p-value of 0.01 and a 40% reduction in clinical decline as measured by ADCS-ADL-MCI with a p-value of 0.001. A small numeric advantage for low dose over placebo was observed on all endpoints except for MMSE, MMSE and ADAS-COG measures of cognitive performance in domains relevant to Alzheimer\u2019s disease such as memory, orientation and language. ADCS-ADL-MCI on the other hand is a caregiver rated assessment of activities of daily living, including conducting personal finances, performing household chores such as cleaning, shopping and doing laundry and independently traveling out of the home. In ENGAGE, the primary endpoint was not met though the low dose showed results similar to the low dose of EMERGE. Results of the ITT and OTC analysis of the secondary endpoints in ENGAGE showed no statistically significant differences in decline on MMSE ADAS-COG13 or ADCS-ADL-MCI compared with placebo. However, small numeric advantages for the low dose of a placebo were observed on these endpoints. In addition to the clinical data, we observe supporting data from multiple biomarkers, imaging of amyloid plaque deposition in both studies demonstrated that treatment with aducanumab resulted in a dose and time dependent reduction in amyloid plaque burden compared to placebo with p-values less than 0.001. The magnitude of reduction in the high doses is similar to that seen in the Phase 1b study. aducanumab also demonstrated an impact on CSF biomarkers of tau pathology. A statistically significant reduction on CSF phospho-Tau levels was observed in EMERGE and ENGAGE with a dose proportional response in EMERGE. aducanumab produced a numeric reduction in CSF total-Tau levels in EMERGE and ENGAGE with a dose proportional response in EMERGE. Although the primary and secondary endpoints were not met in ENGAGE in post analysis, the subset of patients who received sufficient exposure to 10 milligram per kilogram aducanumab in this case, at least 10 doses of 10 milligram per kilogram showed similar results to the comparable population from EMERGE, in terms of both amyloid plaque reduction and reduced clinical decline on CDR-SB. The safety and tolerability profile of aducanumab in EMERGE and ENGAGE was consistent with previous studies of aducanumab, with the most commonly reported adverse event being ARIA-E and headache. Although the underlying cause of ARIA-E is not well understood, it is likely that the MRI signal of ARIA-E is due to increased extra cellular fluid. The majority of patients with ARIA-E did not experience symptoms during the ARIA-E episode and ARIA-E episodes generally resolved within 4 to 16 weeks, typically without long-term clinical sequelae. We plan to present further details on the new analysis of the larger dataset from aducanumab at the C Type Meeting in December, which we plan to webcast. So to summarize, first, across multiple clinical endpoints, the larger aducanumab dataset demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of clinical decline in early Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients in EMERGE, and we believe that data from a subset of ENGAGE support these findings.Second, exposure to high dose aducanumab was important for efficacy and differences and exposure to high dose aducanumab largely explain the different result of futility analysis and the new analysis of this larger dataset as well as the different results between the two studies. Finally, following consultation with the FDA, we believe it is reasonable to submit a regulatory filing for aducanumab based on these data. As Michel and Al mentioned, the past that brought us to today was long and complex. We will be working with our investigators to redose eligible patients who had previously participated in the aducanumab clinical trial, and we look forward to working with the FDA as well as regulators around the world to find a path to make the drug available to patients. Most importantly, we envisage a future where physicians may finally have an option to offer patients to help reduce clinical decline in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. I\u2019ll now turn it back over to Al. Al Sandrock : Thank you, Samantha. We believe that these positive results for aducanumab represent a turning point for patients, caregivers, physicians and scientists in the fight against Alzheimer\u2019s disease. More broadly, we believe these results represent an inflection point in neuroscience drug development and validate our core strategy, by demonstrating the removal of aggregated forms of amyloid beta can result in improved clinical outcomes, we believe these results have positive implications for BAN2401, a distinct antibody that also targets aggregated amyloid beta that we are currently evaluating in a Phase 3 study in early Alzheimer\u2019s disease in collaboration with Eisai. More generally, we believe these data may have positive implications for additional assets in our portfolio that target the casual pathobiology of neurodegenerative disease, particularly those validated by human genetics. These include our Tau directed assets for Alzheimer\u2019s disease and primary tauopathies, our alpha-synuclein antibody for Parkinson\u2019s disease and our SOD1 and C9ORF targeting antisense oligonucleotides for ALS. Given our depth of expertise, our deep and interconnected neuroscience pipeline including nine additional readouts expected by the end of next year, we believe that Biogen is uniquely positioned to capture the opportunity in neuroscience, and potentially deliver a suite of breakthrough therapies for diseases of the nervous system. With that in mind, let me now review the highlights across the rest of our pipeline in the third quarter. Starting with MS, this quarter we announced positive top line results from EVOLVE-MS-2, a Phase 3 study of VUMERITY or diroximel fumarate, a novel oral fumarate for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis compared to TECFIDERA. The remedy was statistically superior to TECFIDERA on the studies pre-specified primary endpoint, the individual gastrointestinal symptom an impact scale with a p-value of 0.0003. The proportion of patients who discontinued due to GI adverse events during the five-week treatment period was 0.8% for VUMERITY and 4.8% for TECFIDERA. Of note, discontinuation rate for TECFIDERA is similar to that observed in the Phase 3 studies of TECFIDERA in which 4% of patients discontinued due to GI events. Earlier this month, Alkermes received a tentative approval from the FDA for VUMARITY. We are working with our Alkermes and the agency to secure final approval as quickly as possible. Moving to TYSABRI, previous analysis of real world data from the US TOUCH registry demonstrated that extended interval dosing of TYSABRI reduced the risk of PML by between 78% and 99% in this population. However, whether extended interval dosing preserves the efficacy profile of TYSABRI remains an open question. To this end, at last month\u2019s ECTRIMS meeting, we presented data on the efficacy of extended interval dosing with TYSABRI using data from the TYSABRI Observational Program. After propensity score matching, the results indicated that there was no significant difference in annualized relapse rate or risk of relapse between the two groups. And we recently completed enrollment for the Phase 3b NOVA study of TYSABRI, a two year randomized prospective trial that will directly compare the effectiveness of every six-week dosing versus the approved every four-week dosing regimen after at least one year of standard dosing. Also this quarter the EMA updated the labels of AVONEX and PLEGRIDY to remove pregnancy contra-indications, and where clinically needed to allow use during pregnancy and breast feeding in women with relapsing MS. With these updates interferon-beta therapies are the only MS Therapies in Europe that can be considered for use in MS patients throughout the full course of pregnancy. This is important, given that women are diagnosed with MS at least 2 to 3 times more frequently than men and women are often affected during their childbearing years. Turning to our progress in neuromuscular disorders, at last month\u2019s Congress of the European Pediatric Neurological Society, we presented new interim data from the open label shine extension study of SPINRAZA in children with later onset SMA. Now, including data on patients up to 15 years of age followed for up to six years, this analysis demonstrated that in star contrast to the natural history of SMA patients with Type 2 SMA treated with SPINRAZA demonstrated improvements in motor function as assessed by the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded and patients with Type 3 SMA treated with SPINRAZA demonstrated stable Hammersmith scores and improvement in distance walked. No participants discontinued treatment due to adverse events. And no new safety concerns were identified. Taken \u2013 Taken together, these data again underscore the robust durable efficacy and well-established longer term safety profile of SPINRAZA across a broad range of SMA patients. Also this quarter we published data from the nurture study of SPINRAZA in pre-symptomatic infants in the journal neuromuscular disorders. Data from the nurture study showed that all patients treated with SPINRAZA were alive and achieved the ability to sit without support, non required permanent ventilation, 92% achieved walking with assistance and 88% achieved walking independently. Given SPINRAZA is well-characterized safety profile, we recently announced a Phase 2/3 DEVOTE study to evaluate whether a higher doses of SPINRAZA can provide even greater efficacy than the currently approved dose. Our review of PK/PD data suggested individuals with higher CSF concentrations of SPINRAZA achieved greater improvements in CHOP INTEND and motor milestones. As with any therapy that is developed to address high end men need, companies who lead need to continue to continually explore ways to optimize their treatment. Building on the success of SPINRAZA, we aim to build a broader neuromuscular franchise including ALS. At the meeting of the Northeast ALS Consortium held earlier this month, we presented new data on neurofilament levels assessed in the Phase 1/2 multiple ascending dose study to a person, our antisense oligonucleotide targeting SOD1 in patients with SOD1 ALS. As a reminder, previous data from this study showed that treatment with 100 milligrams of tofersen was associated with a statistically significant reduction in CSF SOD1 protein levels and trends toward slowing of clinical decline as assessed by three independent measures relative to placebo. This new analysis of the same population showed the baseline neurofilament levels in both the plasma and CSF were correlated with baseline disease activity. And treatment with 100 milligrams of tofersen reduced levels of neurofilament in both plasma and CSF. These data further highlight the concordance across datasets generated in this study, including target engagement, clinical and neurofilament data and thus illustrate the potential for an antisense oligonucleotides to target genetic drivers of neurodegenerative disease. In movement disorders, we continue to advance to Phase 2 study of BIIB092 or gosuranemab, an antibody targeting extracellular tau in PSP with data expected by the end of the year. In this Phase 2 \u2013 if this Phase 2 study is positive, we believe we would be in a position to file for regulatory approval. In Parkinson\u2019s disease, we continue to progress the Phase 2 study of BIIB054, an antibody targeting extracellular alpha-synuclein. We expect data from the one year placebo controlled period of this study including data on safety, as well as neuro imaging based assessment of striatal dopaminergic transporter density in the second half of next year. Also this quarter, as we work to build further depth and movement disorders, we dosed the first patient in the Phase 1 study of BIIB094 an antisense oligonucleotide targeting leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 or LRRK2 in Parkinson\u2019s disease. Toxic gain of function mutations in LRRK2 constitutes the most common genetic cause of Parkinson\u2019s disease representing approximately 5% of all Parkinson\u2019s disease cases. In addition to LRRK2s role in familiar Parkinson\u2019s disease, data from the literature suggests that LRRK2 gain of function may also contribute to the pathogenesis of sporadic Parkinson\u2019s disease. As a result, this Phase 1 study will include Parkinson\u2019s disease patients with or without verified mutations in LRRK 2. Importantly BIIB094 leverages the same RNase H media degradation mechanism utilized by tofersen. With the addition of BIIB094 to our pipeline, we are now advancing ASOs targeting the most common genetic cause of Parkinson\u2019s disease, two genetic causes of ALS and taupathology, which underpin several primary and secondary tauopathies including Alzheimer\u2019s disease. And we aim to build further depth across our ASO pipeline, as we continue to emphasize our focus on genetically validated targets and defined patient populations. In acute neurology, we continue to advance the Phase 3 study of BIIB093 or IV glibenclamide, for cerebral edema caused by large \u2013 large hemispheric infarction or LHI. As a reminder BIIB093 blocks SUR1-TRPM4 channels that are hypothesize to mediate brain edema following LHI. Given that these channels are also hypothesized to mediate expansion of Hematoma and Perihematoma edema associated with brain contusion, this month we dosed the first patient in a Phase 2 study of BIIB093 for brain contusion. Approximately 280,000 patients are hospitalized due to head trauma annually in the United States. And we estimate the contusions occur in approximately 25% to 35% of these patients. There are no pharmaceutical agents approved to mitigate contusion expansion, which is associated with worsened clinical outcomes. The primary objective of this new study of BIIB093 will evaluate the proportion of patients with brain contusion, who exhibited an expansion in contusion volume over the course of a 96 hour infusion of BIIB093 versus placebo. Importantly, we believe that the shared pathophysiologic features of LHI and brain contusion exemplify the interconnectivity of neuroscience that we are leveraging as we continue to increase the depth and breadth of our pipeline. This also highlights our strategy to produce \u2013 to pursue multiple indications for a given asset, particularly once we believe safety has been adequately established. And finally, in our Alzheimer\u2019s disease portfolio, this quarter, we completed enrollment in the Phase 2 study of gosuranemab in early Alzheimer\u2019s disease. And we continue to advance the Phase 1 studies of BIIB076, a distinct anti-tau antibody and BIIB080 an ASO aimed at reducing the expression of tau in the central nervous system. Taken together with the positive results of aducanumab, we believe that no other company is better positioned to deliver breakthrough therapies for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Overall, this was a historic quarter for Biogen and for the patients, caregivers, physicians and scientists around the world, who have been waiting decades for a therapy that can reduce the clinical decline of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. With that I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Capello : Thanks, Al. Good morning, everyone. I will now review our financial performance for the third quarter of 2019. As Michel mentioned earlier, we had a strong financial performance in Q3 2019. Total revenues for the third quarter grew 5% year-over-year to approximately $3.6 billion, while GAAP earnings per share increased 17% and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 24%, both compared to the prior year. Overall, our MS business delivered revenues were approximately $2.3 billion in the third quarter of this year, including OCREVUS royalties for approximately $188 million, growing 2% versus the prior year. Global MS revenues in Q3, 2019 were stable versus the prior year with OCREVUS royalties and the total number of patients on our MS products globally continued to grow in the low single-digits versus the prior year. U.S. MS revenues in Q3, 2019 were impacted by a decrease in channel inventory of approximately $30 million compared to a decrease of approximately $5 million in Q3, 2018 and a decrease of approximately $30 million in Q2 2019. Global third quarter TECFIDERA revenues increased 3% versus prior year, as TECFIDERA delivered strong global patient growth of approximately 8% year-over-year. In the U.S., TECFIDERA revenues were flat year-over-year as TECFIDERA share of total prescriptions remained relatively stable compared to the last couple of quarters. Outside the U.S. TECFIDERA performed very well again in Q3 2019 with continued volume increases across all large European markets and Japan versus the prior year, somewhat offset by pricing pressure in several European countries. Q3 global Interferon revenues including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY decreased 10% versus Q3 2018, due to the continued shift from the injectable platforms to oral or high efficacy therapies. TYSABRI worldwide revenues increased 3% versus the third quarter of 2018. We were pleased with this growth into TYSABRI revenues as it continued to perform well in the high efficacy segment. In the US, we grew TYSABRI revenues 4% year-over-year, as we continue to maintain stable TYSABRI share of total prescriptions compared to the last couple of quarters. Outside the US, we grew TYSABRI 2% driven by volume growth in several markets and favorable timing of shipments somewhat offset by pricing pressures. Overall, we were pleased with the execution of our MS franchise and the continued strong performance of our MS business in the third quarter. We remain focused on maintaining resilience and MS market leadership. Let me now move on to SPINRAZA. Global third quarter SPINRAZA revenues increased 17% versus prior year, and 12% versus the prior quarter to $547 million. In the third quarter SPINRAZA achieved year-over-year and quarter-over-revenue growth both in the US and outside the US, driven by continued patient growth across both mature and new markets. And we now have approximately 9,300 patients on SPINRAZA, including the expanded access program in clinical trials. In the U.S. revenues increased 6% versus Q3 2018 and 3% versus Q2 2019. The number of patients on therapy in the U.S. increased 3% as compared to the end of the second quarter of 2019. And importantly, we continue to make strong progress with adults. The largest patient segment with the number of adults on SPINRAZA growing 8% compared to the prior quarter, which is a third quarter in a row with upper single-digit growth. As a reminder, Zolgensma is competing in a limited portion of the market, specifically the approximately 5% of SMA patients were under 2 years old. Within that segment, we have begun to see some impact on SPINRAZA performance. Outside the U.S., revenues increased 27% versus Q3 2018 and 21% versus last quarter, driven by strong performance in established markets such as EU and Japan as well as key markets in both Latin America and Asia Pacific. We were pleased to see double-digit patient growth versus prior quarter outside the U.S. and we are now approved in over 50 countries. Additionally, we recently dosed the first SPINRAZA patients in China. Overall, we were pleased to see continued patient growth across the larger mature markets and continued rapid uptake from our recently launched markets. Given our expected continued patient growth and execution across many global markets, our established product profile and the significant market opportunity, we remain optimistic about our SMA business. In our biosimilars business, we generated $184 million this quarter, growing 36% versus prior year driven by IMRALDI. We estimate that we now have approximately 180,000 patients of biosimilars in Europe. Total anti-CD20 revenues in the third quarter increased 16% versus the prior year, primarily driven by OCREVUS royalties. Q3 OCREVUS royalties benefited by approximately $10 million due to adjustment related to prior periods. We continue to expect RITUXAN revenues to be impacted by the entry of biosimilars in the U.S. beginning next month. Total other revenues in the third quarter decreased 26% versus the prior year driven by the decline in our manufacturing services revenues due to our divestiture of the Hillerod plant. Importantly we continue to see geographic diversification of our revenue base, driven by growth in MS revenues outside the U.S., the continued market expansion of SPINRAZA and our growing biosimilars business. In the third quarter approximately 41% of our product revenues came from outside the U.S. versus approximately 37% in Q3 2018 and 32% in Q3, 2017. We aim to continue capitalizing on global growth opportunities, both our current commercial portfolio and our pipeline of products. Let me now turn to the expense lines on the P&L. Q3 2019 gross margin was 88%, an improvement versus both prior year and prior quarter, which were both 87% due to favorable cost of goods sold, product mix and higher margin contract manufacturing. Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense were both 15% of revenue. R&D expense included approximately $58 million in trial closeout costs for both elenbecestat and BG00011. Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A expense were both 15% of revenue. Q3 GAAP other expense was $27 million and non-GAAP other expense was $23 million. In the third quarter, our GAAP tax rate was approximately 12% and our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 16%. Compared to Q3 2018, our Q3 2019 GAAP tax rate benefited from the remaining amount realized from U.S. corporate tax reform, the change in our tax profile in Q2 2019 and recently enacted tax reform in Switzerland. In the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares at an average price of $233 for total value of approximately $718 million. As of September 30, 2019, we had approximately $3.4 billion remaining on our 2019 share repurchase authorization, which now brings us to our diluted earnings per share. In the third quarter, we booked GAAP EPS of $8.39, an increase of 17% versus the prior year and non-GAAP earnings per share of $9.17, a 24% increase versus the prior year. We generated approximately $1.7 billion in net cash flows from operations in Q3. We ended the quarter with approximately $6.3 billion in cash and marketable securities and $6 billion in debt. I will now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you, Jeff. To summarize, first, the positive clinical results for aducanumab position Biogen to potentially lead the fight against Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Second, these data validates Biogen strategy to focus on an interconnected neuroscience pipeline and productization of target supported by human genetics. Third, our base business continued to deliver solid performance in Q3 2019, driven by strong execution against our strategic priorities. Between now and the end of 2020, we expect continued progress as we aim to build a multi-franchise portfolio including nine additional mid to late stage data readouts, the expected launch of VUMERITY in the U.S. and submitting the regulatory filing for aducanumab in the U.S. while continuing dialog with regulatory authorities in international markets, including in Europe and in Japan. I am proud of the Biogen team for not being deterred by history of disappointment in the pursuit of Alzheimer\u2019s therapies and more so for continuing their work of analyzing the clinical trial data with unprecedented focus and intensity even in light of an apparent futility results. This work reflects Biogen\u2019s steadfast determination to follow the science, tackle the biggest challenges and do always the right thing for the patients. Finally, what is most important today is that in consultation with the FDA, we are excited to be moving ahead and preparing for regulatory filing for aducanumab on the ground of positive clinical results. And we will be redosing eligible patients from our Alzheimer\u2019s trials as quickly as possible. This is a major step in the fight against Alzheimer\u2019s disease and an important inflection point for Biogen\u2019s neuroscience mission. We believe now more than ever that our core focus on neuroscience will enable us to maximize the value for all our stakeholders. First and foremost, for the patients as well as for our shareholders as the leader in neuroscience, we believe that no other company is better positioned to continue to deliver breakthrough therapies for diseases of the nervous system. We will continue to execute on our cost strategy to build a multi franchise portfolio across our core and emerging growth areas. We are inspired by the progress we have made in tackling Alzheimer\u2019s disease and the broader scientific implications of the positive clinical results for aducanumab. I would like to thank all the Biogen employees in particular, those who have been working tirelessly on the aducanumab program and the many more who will contribute to this critical priority over time. I am incredibly grateful for all the patients, physicians and caregivers who have dedicated so much time and efforts to our Alzheimer\u2019s clinical studies and advancing our understanding of this very complex disease. I would like to thank the FDA for their guidance, and independent scientific expertise throughout this process. We will now open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat : Hello. If I may, I only have a question on aducanumab but it\u2019s got three parts, and given the significance of the news today, I would really appreciate if you could bear with us on it. So my three parts are as follows : first, I\u2019m not attempting to correlate the two but Michael Ehlers departure ahead of this data announcement, just wanted to hear are those two things are related in anyway or not. Second, the implication in the data is that the high with insufficient exposure at the high dose, the second trial worked as well. But when we look at CDR Sum of the Boxes low dose actually looks more consistent than the high dose and also for patients that did not make it to the large opportunity to complete dataset, those patients actually especially in MMSE more consistent than the patients that did have a sufficient exposure. So I guess I\u2019m just trying to understand how spot on is that finding on patients that had a sufficient exposure and those are the ones that drove efficacy. Thank you so much. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you, Umer. This is Michel. Mike decided to leave the company on his own and I can cannot thank him enough for his many contributions over the past three and half years to Biogen. So, thanks, Mike. And at the same time I\u2019m extremely confident in Al\u2019s leadership as a clinician too, as a scientist to take the helm at the time where the R&D portfolio never been as stronger, the team also and the capabilities. Al Sandrock : Umar, this is Al Sandrock, and I will turn it over to Samantha later for follow-up. But look, your point is well taken, the low dose is consistent across ENGAGE and EMERGE, and that\u2019s because the particularly the second protocol amendment, really affected the high dose arm of \u2013 in the carriers. So in the low dose arm or in the protocol amendments had less of an effect and I think that\u2019s one of the main reasons for the consistency in the results across the two studies. I\u2019ll turn it over to Samantha for a follow-up. Samantha Budd Haeberlein : Yes, that\u2019s correct. Umar you\u2019ll also see that in the high dose for ENGAGE that we do have a partial response on ADAS-Cog13, and the ADCS-ADL-MCI. And so the potential read that you have there on CDR-Sum of Boxes and MMSC is that these are potentially less sensitive as endpoints. So what Al said is that in the high-dose group we know that we have less doses than we \u2013 at the high dose than we had in EMERGE, and we also know that the studies were to some degree impacted by dose suspensions due to ARIA, so dosing is a complex combination of duration, magnitude and no interruptions. Umer Raffat : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Phil Nadeau : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. It\u2019s also, as you might imagine on aducanumab. I guess in two parts. First, if you pull the data from ENGAGE and EMERGE, would the pooled results still be positive on the primary endpoint and kind of related to that, could you give us some sense of what the differences between ENGAGE and EMERGE were in exposures at those high doses. It seems like the trials didn\u2019t start far apart, there\u2019s just a month, so kind of in response to the last question, you mentioned exposures rely on dose suspensions and whatnot. Can you give us some sense quantitatively of how different the patient populations at that high dose were in ENGAGE and EMERGE in terms of their exposure? Thank you. Samantha Budd Haeberlein : Certainly. So the first part that if we pulled the outcomes on ENGAGE and EMERGE at the high dose essentially you\u2019ll get an intermediate effect, not much more complicated than that. But we are looking at these stand-alone studies as two independently identically designed studies. The second part of the question, which I had forgotten actually, Phil Nadeau : Differences in ENGAGE and EMERGE, Samantha Budd Haeberlein : Yes, so they started one month difference between the two studies, as I mentioned and they remained different throughout the entirety of the studies and that initial one month at certain periods of the studies in particularly through the protocol amendments was greater in the middle of the studies and more details around this will come at the presentation in CTAD. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Terence Flynn : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Maybe two parts for me as well. Just wondering if you can share any additional commentary on the second Type C Meeting, did FDA agree that a single positive trial could be sufficient for approval or is that likely a review question? And then can you give us the rates of ARIA in the high dose arms of the two trials? Thanks. Al Sandrock : Yes, hi, this is Al. It\u2019s generally our policy not to comment too much on the content of regulatory interactions. I will say though that they thought it was reasonable for us to submit an application to \u2013 for approval. So that\u2019s the main, that was the upside of the meeting. Samantha Budd Haeberlein : And the second part of the question was on ARIA and high dose and that was consistent in incidence for the studies that we have previously reported, and we\u2019ll give more details on that at CTAD. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges from Leerink. Please go ahead. Geoff Porges : Thank you very much and thanks for having Samantha on the call. It\u2019s very helpful. First, could you answer whether the analysis that you presented and presented to the agency has been independently verified. What confirmation of both the statistics and the results do you have? Secondly, do you have any intention or plans for a confirmatory pivotal trial to supplement these two trials? And then I hate to sort of push on the issue of the type, the FDA meeting but did the FDIC, the full analysis or did the FDA just here the company summary of the analysis? Thanks. Al Sandrock : Let me with the last question and I\u2019ll let Samantha answer the first couple. First of all, the FDA did see the full analysis of both studies and I would also say that the only study we have planned right now is the redosing study and any further study, we\u2019ll update you as soon as we plan one. Samantha Budd Haeberlein : Thanks, Al. Going to your first question, Geoff. Have we had independent review. As we mentioned, one of the first steps that we undertook was to engage external advisors to help us review this data and that did include independent statistical experts, but the data that we did take to the FDA as Al says was a full dataset, which was an analysis of the blinded data conducted using the same statistical analysis plan as we had originally planned for the end of the study. And the validity of the dataset was the first thing that we analyzed together with the FDA. To your second question on whether we are conducting another study. As we\u2019ve mentioned, our next steps are twofold, one is the FDA indicated to us that it is reasonable for us to file these two studies, and for us to go ahead and put together a re-dosing study for the patients who were in previously enrolled studies of aducanumab. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Michael Yee : Thanks. Thanks for the question. Appreciate it. Al or Samantha, I guess, just wanted to understand, ENGAGE a little bit more specifically in the high dose you appropriately say that there was a slightly negative trend overall in the high dose. But in the subgroup of exposure patients, which as you think about a third of it, they had a nice benefit. I guess the question is how do you think about the patients you did not have enough exposure, did they drive a strong negative trend? Are those patients at harm? How do you think about that since that\u2019s a huge majority of the patients and how is that explainable given the difference in EMERGE? Thanks. Al Sandrock : Thanks, Michael. I\u2019ll start. Look, I don\u2019t think \u2013 first of all there is a slight negative. I would say that that was just basically no effect. And then those who did not have the high dose, I would not say that they had a negative effect, in fact, in many ways, there was either neutral or positive effect. But I would point out this, you remember the 6 milligram per kilogram dose arm in PRIME, that everybody was wondering about. You always ask me questions about it. I remember, Michael, and we thought that was an outlier. Well, maybe that wasn\u2019t the outlier. Maybe that was true in that the 3 milligram per kilogram that looked like it was trending was the outlier. So in other words, what I\u2019m saying is that there is a very sort of sharp dose response, if you will, you have to get to high dose of aducanumab and intermediate dosing at least in an 18-month trial is not enough. Michael Yee : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Cory Kasimov : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess first just to ask Phil\u2019s question more directly, can you tell us yet how many patients got the 14 doses of 10 mg per kg in each study in the full dataset? And then as a follow-up, did you see any difference in ApoE4 carriers versus non-carriers, especially in the patients who completed after the futility cohort and would have had more exposure to the higher dose? Thanks. Samantha Budd Haeberlein : Yes. So the first thing I want to mention is, in terms of the numbers of subjects who had the particular dataset that you\u2019re referring to more dose, more than 10 doses of 10 milligram per kilogram, there\u2019s more than a 10% difference between the two studies, but that\u2019s not the only parameter of difference that is important for dose. As I\u2019ve mentioned, you need to achieve high dose for long enough, but also have no interruptions, and so that\u2019s a more complex calculation between the two studies. Michel Vounatsos : ApoE4 versus non. Samantha Budd Haeberlein : So your question regarding ApoE4 carriers versus non-carriers, the analysis that we\u2019ve conducted to date has been on the entire studies. And as we\u2019ve mentioned for EMERGE, we have a positive but we met the primary endpoint for the entire patient population and details of subgroups is something that will come to later. And we\u2019ll have details at CTAD. Cory Kasimov : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question and all the detail on aducanumab. Al, I just have a couple of regulatory type of questions all related. If half of the EMERGE achieved significance at the high dose and none of ENGAGE achieved it, is it you guys expectations that the PRIME study could count as one of the two pivotals? Second one is, does a conditional approval, pending another successful Phase 3 did that come up in the FDA discussion? And then third, have you had any discussions with the European regulators on the data? Thank you. Al Sandrock : Let me start with the last question first. So we have just started to contact the European regulators that we haven\u2019t had any substantive discussions as of yet. In terms of the EMERGE and ENGAGE, I \u2013 we looked at \u2013 we look at ENGAGE in totality as a positive study that stands on its own. And remember, as Samantha said we use pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes, we didn\u2019t look at a subset. We looked at all the patients and based on that, we believe the study met its primary endpoint and the secondary endpoints as well. I think that whether or not a single trial can be approved, there are circumstances where an FDA can approve a drug based on a single study, it\u2019s up to them to determine what those circumstances are, and so I\u2019ll just leave it at that and then I would say that ENGAGE, we believe, we showed the data for example in those who achieve sufficient exposure to 10 milligrams per kilogram. We do see evidence of efficacy. So I would say that EMERGE stands on its own, ENGAGE has supportive evidence, and I would also say that PRIME is supportive, it\u2019s a well controlled Phase 1b, some may call it Phase 2 trial, and we\u2019ll submit all the data. Samantha Budd Haeberlein : Just to add there, Al, EMERGE is the study that met its primary endpoints. I think you said ENGAGE. Al Sandrock : Did I say anything wrong? Samantha Budd Haeberlein : Yes. Al Sandrock : Yes. I get confused in times. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Brian Abrahams : Hi there. Thanks for taking my questions. So a question, just a little more clarity on the ENGAGE study, for the subgroups of patients I guess for both ENGAGE and EMERGE with 10 interrupted \u2013 receiving 10 uninterrupted high doses. Can you talk about the baseline characteristics for the aducanumab verse placebo arms across both studies and how well balanced those were? And then, can you maybe help us understand how feasible was it for patients? I guess, once the protocol \u2013 was protocols, were amended to remain on 10 uninterrupted doses or is the lesson here that if you do need to temporarily discontinue for ARIA or whatever reason you\u2019re probably best off not restarting the drug? Thanks. Samantha Budd Haeberlein : So, thanks. Thank you for the question. I want to point out that the analysis that we conducted in close consultation with the FDA around determining who in ENGAGE did have a response were exploratory analysis. And any time that you look at a subset of patients who you have very important questions in regards to whether they are balance for the baseline characteristics. The studies overall, were very well balanced for all baseline characteristics and as I mentioned, ApoE4 status. But those subgroups are exploratory in nature and they help us understand that dosing is important for efficacy. And in the context of an 18-month trial, one does tend to see that you need a certain number of doses for clinical benefit of aducanumab. However, that\u2019s not the same as one would anticipate in a real world situation where an individual is taking aducanumab for an extended period of time, for a dose interruption would likely be of less significance. Al Sandrock : Yes, I agree with Samantha. I think that dose suspension in the context of an 18-month study was \u2013 it could be problematic, because they didn\u2019t achieve enough of the high dose. But in clinical practice, we don\u2019t do 18 month treatment periods. We\u2019re going to treat patients for longer periods of time. And in that situation I think dose suspension may be acceptable in some patients. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Matthew Harrison : Great, thanks for taking the question. I guess a follow-up and sort of second question from me. So first one is, you\u2019ve been talking about exposure and dose a lot. Could you just broadly comment on how many of these patients actually achieved all the factors that you were looking for and how easily you think that will be the case in clinical practice. And I guess, the related question to that is, dose exposure curve that you\u2019re sort of talking about Al. I mean, what were their characteristics that were different were the kinetics of the amyloid plaque reduction different in these subgroup of patients with the achievement of tau or amyloid reductions were they significantly different. I\u2019m wondering what you think is sort of biologically happen to account for this steep dose exposure curve [indiscernible]? Al Sandrock : These were good questions Matthew and we\u2019re still learning as we look at the data, but I would say this, the \u2013 even in MCI patient, if you look at the amount of amyloid in the brain, it\u2019s tremendous. It took 20 years to build that much up and in the context of an 18 month trial, you have to remove a large amount of amyloid. I think that\u2019s what distinguishes as you aducanumab and BAN2401, is that we can \u2013 it\u2019s safe enough to achieve the doses that allow us to remove a large amount of amyloid. And if you don\u2019t remove a large amount, you\u2019re not going to get an effect. Also there is a lag. You remove amyloid, and then there is a little bit of a lag for the clinical effect. We saw that in PRIME for example, where we did have some amyloid lowering of six months, but we saw no difference in the clinical outcomes at six months. It was \u2013 it took the 12-month time period to see \u2013 to start to see an effect on clinical outcomes. So in addition to a large amount of amyloid removal, I think you need to have a little bit of time for that, for that biological activity to have an effect on clinical outcomes That\u2019s what we see and I would say that if you look at the amyloid-PET results that was on one of the slides and those who had more than 10 doses of 10 milligrams, you can see that the SUVR score is very similar in ENGAGE in that subgroup of patients in ENGAGE to the EMERGE total dataset. So \u2013 and so again, what it says is that if you give it enough of the high dose, you can achieve a certain amount of amyloid removal and that certain amount is what\u2019s required to see the reduction in clinical decline in an 18 month study. Samantha Budd Haeberlein : Yes, Al just add to that, on the question of numbers. On the graph that you\u2019ve just referred to, you got the end numbers. So they were 147 for EMERGE and 116 for ENGAGE in that CDR-Sum of Boxes analysis. But the question you ask of how many patients have the precise criteria? Well there aren\u2019t precise criteria. Dose response is not binary. And so, given the levels of dose you have a different response and it\u2019s a bit of a sliding scale. So we have that exploratory analysis that we disclosed to explain what it is we learned around the importance of dose, but there is no perfect number of doses that are required, it\u2019s not binary. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Ronny Gal : Hi everybody. And thank you for taking the question. And I\u2019m going to stay with aducanumab here. I\u2019m just kind of struggling with the movement from the Interim Futility Analysis to efficacy with relatively small number of patients. Just looking at the number of completed that you have here in EMERGE, you move from 803 patients in the futility analysis to 980 patients in the treatment. So it\u2019s about 180 more patients. If we assume a third of those were on the high dose, 60 more in your total number of folks that you have amyloid beta that you calls got sufficient exposure is at the end of the trial, 127 I kind of wonder if there is just a very small number of patients that drove the entire movement. If you can discuss a little bit that issue of how many patients actually contribute to the difference between stopping the trial for futility and showing efficacy would be appreciated. And then I\u2019m going to \u2013 if you don\u2019t mind going to throw my second one in and it will be different, not to kind of just for the variability. And do you have any way to protecting the highest dose TYSABRI from biosimilars through the first-generation products. If you can discuss that at all, I would appreciate it. Thanks. Al Sandrock : Ronny, this is Al. My head is swimming even just with the first question. But, so I think first of all you should remember that in EMERGE even at the time of this utility analysis, that study was trending positive as Samantha said. And then we add those additional patients and it didn\u2019t take that many now to then in the April dataset to see that \u2013 they had met its primary endpoint. And then I would also say that we also looked at the patients who had not completed 18 months, all the rest of the patients, which is roughly half the patients because we only looked at the first half, the first half of the enrollees for futility. So it\u2019s a large number of patients that we ended up looking at and I remind you that result that you saw in that slide was all the patients in EMERGE, who had been randomized, the ITT population and it was using the prespecified primary and secondary endpoints. And then I now forgot the second question. Ronny Gal : Before you jump into that if you look at the slide that you had Slide 22, the number of patient aducanumab that you have there is the number of patients received enough dose. The questions from some of my peers, was how many patients got exposed and both the numbers that we\u2019re seeing on aducanumab on Slide 22 are the numbers we should be thinking about? Samantha Budd Haeberlein : So I just want to recap that Slide 22 was a piece of exploratory analysis, it is not the subset, to be release are supported, it\u2019s just a particular analysis to emphasize the point that there are subjects in ENGAGE, whom if they do have sufficient dosing, do support the outcome of EMERGE. Al Sandrock : I would also say Ronny that the, PET was done in a subset of patients to \u2013 so the numbers that you see on the left side, which is the amyloid-PET are from \u2013 the only the subset who got the PET imaging. Ronny Gal : And the numbers on the right, that\u2019s still not the complete set, this is just a \u2013 some sort of a subset. Samantha Budd Haeberlein : That\u2019s correct. Ronny Gal : And the second question was around, high dose TYSABRI? Michel Vounatsos : IP protection for TYSABRI. Jeff Capello : So what we would say that Ronny it\u2019s Jeff, is obviously what we can see kind of what happens with regard to the Phase 3 trials that are going on with regards to biosimilars and we\u2019re supportive of biosimilars coming into the market. We obviously have biosimilars business. We just have to see how their products do and we\u2019ll deal with it when it comes. Joe Mara : And probably we have time for about two more questions. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Jay Olson : Well, hi. First off, I want to congratulate you for hanging in there and delivering these aducanumab results today. This is very promising news for Alzheimer\u2019s patients and their families. And second of all, I want to thank you for taking my questions. Can you comment on the clinical meaningfulness of aducanumab\u2019s efficacy profile and how does it line up with your target product profile in terms of improvements in cognition and function. Are there any gaps in the profile as you know it now, and how do you know if you optimize the efficacy at the 10 mg per kick dose or would it make sense to test higher doses? Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : Jay, I\u2019ll start and then Samantha will follow up. We believe it is clinically meaningful, we heard that anything above 20% is clinically meaningful as a neurologist being the first drug of its \u2013 of its kind we have no drugs right now that affect the clinical decline in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This would be the very first. So anything North of 20%, we believe is clinically meaningful and I would also add that \u2013 in clinical practice. I think that MCI patients, will be \u2013 if approved though enjoy the benefit of living an more independent life for longer periods of time. If you look at that AD, the activities of daily living, It\u2019s a 40% effect and that\u2019s a caregiver assessment of whether or not that the patients can live independently, can do their household chores, etcetera so. That\u2019s all very clinically meaningful results. Jay Olson : There\u2019s a question around the dose to 10 mgs? Samantha Budd Haeberlein : Yes. So the question of whether we had achieved the correct dose. I think what we have learned clearly is that dose is very important, but that if individuals do receive 10 milligram per kilogram then they do have an efficacious response. I think the trials unfortunately were hampered by a number of operational and other implications that meant \u2013 that not enough patients got 10 milligram per kilogram, so we do believe that would be the correct dose. Jay Olson : Great, thank you. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Paul Matteis from Stifel. Please go ahead. Paul Matteis : Great, thanks for fitting me in. Really appreciate it. Within the high dose arm in the ENGAGE study, can you talk about the magnitude of plaque reductions you observed in patients who titrated all the way up to the highest dose versus patient who ever stopped at 6 mg per kg and I guess, does a differential magnitude of plaque reduction in those patients that I\u2019ll tell the same narrative you\u2019re seeing on the difference in clinical outcomes? And then can you just tell us anything else about other measures of function in the engage subset of patients, who titrated all the way up to 10 mgs per kg? Thanks so much. Samantha Budd Haeberlein : Thank you. So, to your first question in amyloid plaque reduction, we do believe that PET measurement of amyloid plaque reduction is a very sensitive tool of dose and you\u2019ve correctly identified that ENGAGE at the high dose is showing a lower reduction than in EMERGE and we do believe that, that is a clear reflection of the lower doses that were achieved in that high dosing group in ENGAGE. And the second question was. Paul Matteis : Other measures that function... Samantha Budd Haeberlein : Other measures that function. Yes, so the exploratory analysis that we have demonstrated for you, we focused on the primary endpoint, and we do not have the same analysis for the functional endpoints, but you do have those results for the overall study where even in ENGAGE, we do have some response on the functional scores, albeit not statistically significant. Joe Mara : Okay, thank you. And I\u2019ll turn it back to Michel for some closing comments. Michel Vounatsos : So thank you all for attending our Q3 call characterized by the go-to file decision for aducanumab with the US FDA, but also with a solid performance for the quarter. Today is about hope and opportunity for the patients first but also for the shareholders. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Carmen, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Financial Results and Business Update. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Joe Mara, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin. Joe Mara : Good morning, and welcome to Biogen's fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of the biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2, and Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted our slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Al Sandrock, EVP, Research and Development; and our CFO, Jeff Capello. Now, I will turn the call over to Michel. Michel Vounatsos : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, let me start with some financial highlights. Biogen closed 2019 with quarterly revenues of $3.7 billion, an increase of 4% compared to the same period a year ago. For the full year 2019, Biogen generated $14.4 billion in revenues, representing growth of 7% year-over-year. Full year 2019 GAAP earnings were $31.42 a share, a 46% increase versus full year 2018. Full year 2019 non-GAAP earnings were $33.57 a share, a 28% increase versus full year 2018. We are pleased with the strong year-over-year growth, as we continue to execute on our strategy for long-term leadership in neuroscience. Now, let me review the year. First, full year MS revenue, including OCREVUS royalties, were $9.2 billion, an increase of 2% versus the prior year. The number of patients on our MS products globally increased 3% versus the prior year, driven by strong patients growth in emerging markets, as well as all of the large mature European markets, and our business demonstrated resilience in the US. Our team has executed well, demonstrating our ability to compete in an increasingly crowded market. We launched VUMERITY in the US as an important new oral treatment option. It remains early in the launch, but so far, we are pleased with the level of interest from patients and physicians. Second, SPINRAZA generated full year global revenues of $2.1 billion, a 22% increase versus the prior year. This blockbuster performance was driven by strong year-over-year revenue growth in the US and even greater revenue growth outside the US. Including the expanded access program and clinical trials, over 10,000 patients are now being treated with SPINRAZA. Third, full year biosimilars revenue was $738 million, which represents 35% growth year-over-year, driven primarily by IMRALDI. We estimate that our biosimilars generated approximately EUR1.8 billion of savings to the European healthcare systems in 2019, which we expect will continue to increase in 2020. This is critical as we work to create financial headroom for innovation and contribute to the long-term sustainability of the healthcare system. We also bolstered our biosimilars business this quarter with a new transaction with Samsung Bioepis. This provides us access to two new potential biosimilars in ophthalmology with a significant market opportunity in major markets worldwide, including, for the first time, in the US, as well as commercialization rights to our anti-TNFs biosimilars in China. Fourth, this was an historic year for R&D organization. We are inspired by what the positive implications of the aducanumab data may mean for patients, physicians and the broader scientific community, who have been waiting decades for a therapy that can reduce the clinical decline of Alzheimer's disease. We are actively engaging with the FDA as well as regulators in Europe and Japan, and we look forward to completing a regulatory filing in the US as soon as possible. In addition, there has been important progress related to the re-dosing study, as we have successfully submitted the protocol to the FDA, and we are currently working with the sites and ethics committees towards study initiation. Fifth, beyond aducanumab, we continue to expand and progress our pipeline with approval for VUMERITY in the US, a positive data readout for BIIB059 in lupus, and adding seven new clinical program in MS, ALS, Parkinson's disease, ophthalmology and brain contusion. 2019 was one of our most productive years in R&D, and we believe we have multiple opportunities for near-term value creation, as we prepare for multiple potential launches in the early 2020. Sixth, our cash flow generation remains strong and continue to provide us with significant optionality and flexibility to allocate capital. In 2019, we generated approximately $7.1 billion in cash flow from operations, an increase of approximately 14% versus the prior year. Throughout the year, we repurchased approximately 24 million shares for a total value of approximately $5.9 billion. As we have stated previously, we view share repurchase as an important element of thoughtful and value-creating capital allocation. At the same time, we have the financial flexibility and capacity to continue to evaluate potential external business development and M&A opportunities. Over the past three [ph] years, we have executed 15 business development transactions, which have contributed to the significant expansion of our pipeline. We executed four deals over the past three months alone, including our proposed transaction with Pfizer for a potential symptomatic therapy with potential application in both Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. As we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to maximizing returns to our shareholders, while continuing to bring innovative therapies to patients, something that demands a thoughtful approach towards all our investment over both the short and the long term. In summary, 2019 was a very productive and successful year for Biogen as we executed on our strategy and continued to deliver noticeable progress. Our core MS business continued to demonstrate resilience with growth in both patients and revenues, and we are excited to be launching VUMERITY. SPINRAZA continued to grow in the US and even more so outside of the US, as we continue to expand into new geographies. With over 10,000 patients on therapy and the largest body of clinical data in SMA, SPINRAZA remains a foundation of care in SMA. We grew our biosimilars business, and we expanded our portfolio and geographic presence. We are preparing to lead in the fight against Alzheimer's disease as we plan for a US filing for aducanumab. Beyond aducanumab, we expanded and progressed our pipeline with seven new clinical programs and a positive data readout in lupus. And we generated ample cash flow as we focus on strategically allocating capital to maximize shareholder return over the long term. I will now turn the call over to Al for a more detailed update on our recent progress in R&D. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Thank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I would like to welcome back Dr. Maha Radhakrishnan as the new Chief Medical Officer at Biogen. Maha brings more than 16 years of experience across multiple geographies in a broad range of therapeutic areas. She previously worked with us here at Biogen as Vice President, Europe and Canada Medical, and Vice President, US Medical, and subsequently held senior positions in medical affairs at Bioverativ and Sanofi. Maha's extensive background will be crucial as we prepare for future pipeline launches, including the potential launch of aducanumab. As Michel discussed, 2019 was a historic year for Biogen. In addition to announcing positive results on aducanumab, we made significant progress on building a multi-franchise portfolio by receiving approval for VUMERITY, adding seven clinical programs and advancing two programs to Phase III. Reflecting our modality-agnostic approach, our neuroscience pipeline now includes small molecules, antibodies, other advanced biologics, antisense oligonucleotides and gene therapy. Let me now turn to the advances we made in the fourth quarter, starting with Alzheimer's disease and dementia. At the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease, or CTAD, annual meeting held last month in San Diego, we presented top line results from the Phase III studies of aducanumab in early Alzheimer's disease. Final analysis of these data showed that EMERGE was a positive study with a high dose regimen of aducanumab achieving statistical significance on both the pre-specified primary endpoint of CDR Sum of Boxes, as well as on all three pre-specified secondary endpoints. On the other hand, data from the ENGAGE study did not meet the primary endpoint, although we do believe that data from patients who achieved sufficient exposure to high dose aducanumab in ENGAGE support the findings of EMERGE. Please note that we do not expect to present additional data on aducanumab prior to a regulatory decision by the FDA. As Michel said, with the support of the FDA, we are working to initiate the open-label Aducanumab re-dosing study as soon as possible. We have successfully submitted the protocol to the FDA, and we are currently working with the sites and ethics committees towards study initiation. In this study, eligible patients previously enrolled in our clinical studies, including patients previously treated with either aducanumab or placebo, will be titrated to 10 milligrams per kilogram aducanumab infusions every four weeks. In addition to aducanumab, we continue to advance a broad Alzheimer's disease portfolio, including the Phase III study of BAN2401; BIIB080, a tau-targeted antisense oligonucleotide in Phase I; BIIB076, an anti-tau antibody in Phase I; and gosuranemab, a distinct anti-tau antibody in Phase II for which we expect data next year. As we continue to develop our Alzheimer's portfolio, we aim to expand into even earlier patient populations to potentially prevent the clinical onset of the disease. To that end, our collaboration partner Eisai, along with the Alzheimer's Clinical Trials Consortium, plans to initiate the AHEAD 345 [ph]. AHEAD 345 is comprised of two studies termed A3 and A45. The A3 study will evaluate low-dose BAN2401 versus placebo in cognitively normal individuals who are currently below the threshold for amyloid positivity but are at high risk for further amyloid accumulation. The A45 study will evaluate high-dose BAN2401 versus placebo in individuals who are amyloid positive but show little to no cognitive impairment. Together, these studies will evaluate whether administration of BAN2401 can slow amyloid accumulation or cognitive decline in the very early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Turning to MS and neuroimmunology, this quarter, we were pleased to announce that VUMERITY, a novel oral fumarate, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS. Detailed results from the Phase II EVOLVE-MS-2 study, which directly compared patient-reported GI tolerability of VUMERITY and TECFIDERA, were presented at the annual meeting of the European Charcot Foundation in November and published in the journal, CNS Drugs, earlier this month. Specifically, on the primary endpoint, these data showed that patients treated with VUMERITY self-reported 46% fewer days with intensity scores of at least 2 on the Individual Gastrointestinal Symptom and Impact Scale compared to TECFIDERA. This result was highly statistically significant with a p-value of 0.0003. Consistent with these data, the proportionate patients who discontinued the study due to GI adverse events was 0.8% for VUMERITY and 4.8% for TECFIDERA. Together, these data indicate that VUMERITY offers a clinically meaningful improvement in GI tolerability compared with TECFIDERA. Across our MS portfolio, we continue to advance BIIB091, an oral BTK inhibitor in Phase I; BIIB061, an oral remyelinating agent in Phase I; and opicinumab, a Phase II anti-LINGO antibody for which we expect data in the middle of this year. Moving to our progress in immunology, there remains a tremendous unmet medical need for people living with lupus, including both cutaneous and systemic forms. Treatment options for lupus are limited, and new medicines are needed to manage this difficult-to-treat and chronic disease. Our work in lupus builds on a long history that Biogen has in immunology, including both home-grown assets and collaborations. We were very excited to report positive data this quarter from the Phase II LILAC study of BIIB059, a potential first-in-class anti-BDCA2 antibody discovered and developed by Biogen, in two forms of lupus that affect a total of approximately 800,000 individuals in the G7. This two-part study evaluated BIIB059 versus placebo in individuals with active cutaneous lupus Erythematosus, or CLE, with or without systemic manifestations, and in individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE, with active joint and skin manifestations. With a p-value of less than 0.001, the CLE part of the study met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant response of BIIB059 on the percentage change from baseline in the CLASI-A score at week 16. The SLE part of the study also met its primary endpoint of reducing disease activity as measured by change from baseline in the total number of tender or swollen joints at week 24. In this study, patients treated with 450 milligrams of BIIB059 experienced a statistically significant reduction of 3.4 total active joint counts compared to placebo. In addition, improvements in skin disease and overall disease activity were consistently observed across multiple secondary endpoints. The safety and tolerability of BIIB059 support its continued development, and we are planning to move forward to Phase III. We believe that the BIIB059 program exemplifies important elements of our broader approach to R&D at Biogen. For example, by implementing biomarkers of target engagement and a measure of clinical efficacy early in clinical development, we were able to generate compelling proof of biology data and preliminary proof of concept data in Phase I, which were subsequently confirmed in a well-controlled Phase II study. We believe that such de-risking strategies may serve to increase the probability of success of other programs across our portfolio. In neuromuscular disorders, last month, at the International Symposium on ALS/Motor Neuron Disease, Biogen, Ionis Pharmaceuticals and our collaborators were awarded the Healey Center International Prize for Innovation in ALS. Presented by the ALS Center at Massachusetts General Hospital, this award recognized our contributions to the discovery and development of tofersen, our antisense oligonucleotide for SOD1 ALS. At this meeting, we were pleased to present the final data from the Phase I/II study of tofersen, which demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in CSF SOD1 protein levels and trends towards slowing of clinical decline as assessed by three independent measures compared to placebo. Furthermore, treatment with tofersen reduced levels of neurofilament in both plasma and CSF. We are encouraged by the concordance across data sets generated in the study, including target engagement, clinical and neurofilament data, and the broad potential of antisense oligonucleotides to target genetic drivers of neurodegenerative disease. We expect data from the Phase III VALOR study of tofersen next year. In addition, we continue to advance the Phase I studies of BIIB078, an ASO for C9orf72-mediated ALS, and BIIB100, a small molecule inhibitor of XPO1 for sporadic ALS. Turning to ophthalmology, this quarter, we completed enrollment in the Phase III STAR study of BIIB111 in choroideremia, a rare X-linked inherited retinal disorder that inevitably leads to blindness and currently has no approved treatments. Choroideremia affects approximately 15,000 individuals in the G7 and is caused by loss of function mutations in the gene encoding Rab escort protein 1, or REP1. BIIB111 is a gene therapy aimed to address the underlying cause of this disease by expressing an AAV2-packaged REP1 transgene. In Phase I/II studies, patients treated with BIIB111 demonstrated a higher rate of maintained vision compared to natural history. In addition, a subset of patients treated with BIIB111 in Phase I/II studies demonstrated a meaningful improvement in visual activity, as defined -- sorry, in visual acuity, as defined by a gain of at least 15 letters corresponding to three lines on the eye chart. Specifically, 21% of patients treated with BIIB111 demonstrated an improvement of at least 15 letters at one year, as compared to only 1% observed in the natural history study. The Phase I/II studies also demonstrated that BIIB111 was generally well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. We are encouraged by these early signs of efficacy and safety and look forward to data from the Phase III study of BIIB111 toward the end of this year. We are also advancing the Phase II/III study of BIIB112 in XLRP with data expected in the middle of next year. In stroke, we continue to advance the Phase III study of BIIB093, or IV glibenclamide, for cerebral edema caused by large hemispheric infarction, or LHI. In a Phase II study, treatment with BIIB093 was associated with a 46% reduction in midline shift, an imaging measure of cerebral edema, and reduced mortality by over 50%. We look forward to data from the Phase III study of BIIB093 in LHI by the end of next year. In addition, the Phase II study of TMS-007 continues to progress. TMS-007 is a small molecule modulator of plasminogen that has the potential to become a best-in-class thrombolytic drug candidate for patients following an acute ischemic stroke. Data from this study are expected by the end of this year. Within movement disorders, we continue to advance cinpanemab, or BIIB054, an anti-alpha-synuclein antibody for Parkinson's disease, with Phase II data expected in the second half of this year, as well as the Phase I study for BIIB094, an antisense oligonucleotide targeting LRRK2. Last month, we reported top line results from the Phase II PASSPORT study of gosuranemab for PSP. The primary endpoint was not met, and we therefore discontinued the development of gosuranemab for PSP and other primary tauopathies. While we were disappointed in this result, we chose to continue the Phase II study of gosuranemab in early Alzheimer's disease, given the potentially significant differences in disease pathophysiology. And in neurocognitive disorders, we continue to advance a Phase II study of BIIB104, an AMPA receptor potentiator for cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. We now expect data from this study in the second half of this year -- of next year. Finally, we had a productive quarter on the business development front. Building further depth in ophthalmology, last month, we entered into an agreement with Catalyst Biosciences to develop and commercialize pegylated CB 2782 for the potential treatment of geographic atrophy, or GA. GA is an advanced form of dry age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, that leads to blindness, has no approved therapies and affects approximately 1 million individuals in the US alone. This molecule is a novel protease that selectively cleaves C3, a genetically validated target in AMD. And we are encouraged by preclinical data demonstrating that a single intravitreal injection of this protease eliminated over 99% of C3 from the vitreous humor for at least 28 days. In addition, this quarter, we initiated a collaboration with CAMP4 Therapeutics to leverage their Gene Circuitry Platform to potentially identify a suite of druggable targets in microglial signaling pathways already known to play a causal role in neurological disease. And most recently, we announced an agreement to acquire a novel CNS-penetrant small molecule inhibitor of casein kinase 1, or CK1, from Pfizer. CK1 is a key regulator of circadian rhythms, which can become dysregulated and contribute to irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder, or ISWRD, in Parkinson's disease, as well as sundowning in Alzheimer's disease. ISWRD is a non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease, characterized by fragmented sleep, severe fatigue and difficulties with activities of daily living. Sundowning affects approximately 20% of AD patients and causes patients to become confused, anxious and agitated later in the day. In a Phase I study -- Phase Ia study, this molecule demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and proof of mechanism. Specifically, there was a statistically significant and dose-related increase in salivary melatonin concentration, a marker of circadian phase modulation. We believe this may represent an innovative symptomatic treatment for both AD and PD, and we expect to initiate a Phase Ib study by the end of this year. This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, and we expect it to close in the first quarter of 2020. Overall, Biogen R&D delivered significant progress in 2019. We believe we are in a strong position today with 27 clinical programs, including six programs in Phase III, 12 in Phase II and nine in Phase I, with a deep preclinical pipeline across multiple modalities. With our plan to file aducanumab in the US and multiple additional near-term opportunities ahead of us, we believe that no other company is as well positioned to develop potentially breakthrough medicines for patients living with devastating neurological diseases. I'll now pass the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Capello : Thanks Al. Good morning, everyone. Let me now provide more detail on our financial performance for 2019 and share with you our guidance for 2020. Let's start with revenues. As Michel mentioned earlier, we had a very strong performance in Q4 2019 across all of our core business areas. Total revenues for the fourth quarter grew 4% year-over-year to approximately $3.7 billion and grew 7% for the full year to $14.4 billion. Overall, our MS business delivered revenues of $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019, including OCREVUS royalties of approximately $205 million. MS revenues in Q4 2019 decreased 1% versus prior year without OCREVUS royalties and increased 2% including OCREVUS royalties. US MS revenues in the fourth quarter of 2019 benefited from an increase in channel inventory of approximately $135 million compared to an increase of approximately $105 million in Q4 2018. Based on historical results, we typically see a decrease in channel inventory in the first quarter, following year-end build of inventory. Full year MS revenues were $9.2 billion, including OCREVUS royalties of approximately $688 million. Full year MS revenues decreased 1% versus the prior year without OCREVUS royalties and increased 2% versus the prior year including OCREVUS royalties. Global fourth quarter TECFIDERA revenues were $1.2 billion, a 5% increase versus the prior year. This included revenues of $877 million in the US, an increase of 2% versus Q4 2018, and $284 million outside the US, an increase of 12% versus the fourth quarter of 2018. TECFIDERA benefited from an increase in channel inventory in the US of approximately $100 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to an increase of approximately $60 million in Q4 2018. Throughout 2019, we were pleased to see four consecutive quarters of relative stability in our share of total prescriptions for TECFIDERA in the US. In addition to strong performance from TECFIDERA, we launched VUMERITY in late Q4 in the US and recorded $5 million of revenue, all of which we attribute to channel loading. Outside the US, TECFIDERA again performed very well in the fourth quarter with strong patient growth in all major European markets and approximately 50% patient growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America versus the prior year. For the full year, worldwide TECFIDERA revenues were $4.4 billion, an increase of 4% versus the prior year. This included $3.3 billion in the US and $1.1 billion in sales outside the US. Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $516 million during the fourth quarter, a decrease of 14% versus Q4 2018 due to a continued shift from the injectable platforms to oral or high-efficacy therapies. This included $359 million in the US and $157 million in sales outside the US. Interferon revenues outside the US were negatively impacted by channel dynamics and timing of shipments. Within the US, AVONEX and PLEGRIDY benefited from an increase in channel inventory of approximately $30 million compared to an increase of approximately $35 million in Q4 2018. For the full year, worldwide interferon revenues decreased 11% to $2.1 billion, consisting of $1.4 billion in the US and $675 million in sales outside the US. TYSABRI worldwide revenues were $473 million this quarter, an increase of 2% versus the fourth quarter of 2018. This included $270 million in US and $203 million outside the US. In the US, revenues increased 5% versus the prior year, representing the fourth consecutive quarter of improved performance on a year-over-year basis. Within the US, inventory levels for TYSABRI were relatively stable compared to an increase of approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Throughout 2019, we were pleased to see relative stability in TYSABRI's share of both new and total prescriptions in the US. Outside the US, TYSABRI revenues decreased 2% versus the prior year as revenues were negatively impacted by channel dynamics and timing of shipments. For the full year, worldwide TYSABRI revenues were approximately $1.9 billion, an increase of 2% versus prior year. We recorded US revenues of $1 billion and $850 million internationally. Overall, we were very pleased with the performance of our MS business in 2019 and are focused on maintaining the resilience of this franchise in light of new competition entering the market. Let me now move on to SPINRAZA. Global fourth quarter SPINRAZA revenues were $543 million, a 16% increase versus the prior year and relatively flat versus the third quarter. In the US, SPINRAZA revenues for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $243 million, an increase of 3% versus both Q4 2018 and Q3 2019. The number of patients on therapy in US increased 2% as compared to the end of the third quarter of 2019, with growth coming from both the pediatric and adult patient segments. We continue to make strong progress with adults, as more than 50% of the new starts in Q4 were adults. And growth in adults exceeded our overall patient growth. As a reminder, the adult population is the largest segment of the market. We have continued to see an impact from gene therapy within the infant population, which represents approximately 5% of the total SMA market. Outside the US, SPINRAZA revenues in the fourth quarter of 2019 were $300 million, an increase of 28% versus the prior year and a decrease of 3% versus the prior quarter. Outside the US, we saw strong growth in patients across all regions, with broad growth from both existing and newly launched countries. The number of commercial SPINRAZA patients increased approximately 10% versus the third quarter of 2019. Despite strong overall patient growth, fourth quarter ex-US SPINRAZA revenues decreased slightly versus the third quarter of this year due to a combination of loading dose dynamics, country mix, the timing of shipments in certain markets and pricing dynamics. Overall, we were very pleased with SPINRAZA's performance again this quarter, as we saw continued patient growth across the large mature markets and strong uptake in the emerging markets. Additionally, more than 50% of our revenue came from outside the US, and there remains significant opportunity to reach additional patients, particularly outside the US. For the full year, worldwide SPINRAZA revenues increased 22% to $2.1 billion, driven by 9% growth in the US to $933 million and 30% growth outside the US to $1.2 billion. Let me now move on to our biosimilars business, which generated revenues of $196 million this quarter, growing 25% versus the prior year. We estimate that we have more than 200,000 patients receiving treatments with our three anti-TNF biosimilars, which is a significant increase of approximately 70% versus the prior year. BENEPALI is the leading ENBREL biosimilar in Germany, the UK and Italy. FLIXABI is the most prescribed Remicade biosimilar in Italy. And IMRALDI is the leading HUMIRA biosimilar in major markets such as Germany and the UK. For the full year, biosimilars revenues grew 35% to $738 million. Turning to our anti-CD20 revenues, we recorded $601 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 12% versus the prior year, primarily driven by OCREVUS royalties. Full year anti-CD20 revenues were $2.3 billion, a 16% increase versus 2018. In the fourth quarter, we saw the first entry of a RITUXAN biosimilar. We expect additional biosimilar entrants in 2020, which we expect will put further pressure on RITUXAN revenues. Also as a reminder, our royalty rate on US sales of OCREVUS resets every calendar year. Total other revenues were $146 million in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 12% versus the prior year due to the timing of shipments. Other revenues were $708 million for the full year, an increase of 21% versus 2018. As a reminder, other revenues in the first quarter of 2019 benefited from a large one-time shipment to Bioverativ. In addition, note that other revenues are variable and difficult to predict. Let me now turn to gross margin performance. Q4 2019 gross margin was 88% of revenues versus approximately 86% in the fourth quarter of 2018. The improvement in gross margin was due to slightly lower royalties, as well as lower cost related to our other revenues. Gross margins for the full year 2019 were approximately 86%, relatively flat compared to full year 2018. Q4 GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense was 19% of revenue or $692 million. Q4 R&D expense includes $63 million related to the transaction with Samsung Bioepis, the $45 million opt-in payment we made to Ionis related to BIIB080, and $30 million related to our collaboration agreements with CAMP4 Therapeutics and Catalyst Biosciences. Full year GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense was 16% of revenue or $2.3 billion. Q4 GAAP SG&A expense was 18% of revenue or $665 million. Q4 non-GAAP SG&A expense was 18% of revenue or $662 million. Both GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A increased versus the prior quarter, primarily due to increased commercial and medical investments, as well as the timing of spend on G&A. Full year GAAP SG&A was 17% of sales or $2.4 billion. Full year non-GAAP SG&A was 16% of sales or $2.3 billion. GAAP other expense, which includes interest, was $49 million in the fourth quarter, and income was $83 million for the full year. Non- expense was $50 million in the fourth quarter and $110 million for the full year. The difference between these GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven primarily by gains on strategic investments, which we classify as GAAP only. In the fourth quarter and the full year, our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 16%. Compared to the prior year, GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for both the full year and the fourth quarter of 2019 benefited from a non-recurring change in the Company's tax profile in 2019 and the sale of the remaining portion of higher-tax inventory in 2018 due to inter-Company effects. Furthermore, the GAAP rate also benefited from the unfavorable prior-year effect of US tax reform in 2018. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 178 million for the fourth quarter and 187 million for the full year. Throughout 2019, we repurchased approximately 24 million shares at an average price of approximately $249 for a total value of approximately $5.9 billion, including approximately 7.7 million shares in the fourth quarter for a total value of approximately $2.1 billion. As of the end of the year, we had a total of approximately $6.3 billion in share repurchase authorization outstanding, including the new $5 billion plan approved by the Board in December 2019, which now brings us to our diluted earnings per share. In the fourth quarter, we booked GAAP EPS of $8.08, an increase of 71% versus the fourth quarter of 2018, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $8.34, a 19% increase versus the prior year. For the full year, GAAP EPS was $31.42, a 46% increase versus 2018, and non-GAAP EPS was $33.57, a 28% increase versus 2018. We generated approximately $2 billion in net cash flows from operations in Q4 and approximately $7.1 billion for the full year, marking the final year where cash flows are impacted by payments to Fumapharm. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.9 billion in cash and marketable securities and $6 billion in debt. Let me now turn to our full year guidance for 2020. We expect revenues of approximately $14 billion to $14.3 billion. We anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense to be between 15% and 16% of revenues. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A expense to be approximately 19.5% to 20.5% of revenues. We anticipate our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for 2020 to be between 18% to 19%. And we anticipate full year 2020 GAAP diluted earnings per share results of $29.50 to $31.50 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $31.50 to $33.50. It's important to note that this guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions, as both are hard to predict. This guidance does assume our proposed transaction with Pfizer closes. Our guidance also assumes a stable share count off the fourth quarter of 2019 and no change to foreign exchange rates. Importantly, our guidance also assumes no generic competition in the US for TECFIDERA in 2020 and assumes additional commercial and R&D expenses related to aducanumab. This guidance reflects our best assumptions as of now. And as a reminder, we will provide an update mid-year on our second quarter earnings call. I'll now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you, Jeff. We delivered strong performance in 2019 with growth across all of our core business areas, double-digit earnings growth versus a year ago and strong execution across each pillar of our strategy. For 2020, we aim to continue our momentum by executing well on our strategic priorities across MS, SMA, biosimilars and our pipeline, with a priority on aducanumab. We are actively preparing for the potential launch of aducanumab with an initial focus on the US. This includes implementing a thorough go-to-market model, hiring the sales force, building out our medical teams and preparing for market access. In addition, we are actively engaging with regulators outside of the US, including Europe and Japan. Beyond aducanumab, our pipeline is maturing. We now have six programs in Phase III and 27 clinical programs overall, an increase from 17 just three years ago. We have multiple near-term opportunities for value creation, including in Alzheimer's disease, ALS, stroke, lupus, ophthalmology and biosimilars, as we aim to build a multi-franchise portfolio. Between now and the end of 2021, we expect 11 mid-to-late stage data readouts, including Phase III readouts for tofersen in ALS, BIIB111 in choroideremia and BIIB093 in large hemispheric infarction, and eight Phase II readouts across MS, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ophthalmology, schizophrenia, acute neurology and neuropathic pain. As the leader in neuroscience, with asymmetric [ph] core capabilities, we believe that no other company is better positioned to continue to deliver breakthrough therapies for diseases of the nervous system to address a significant and growing unmet medical need. We'll continue to execute on our core strategy to build a multi-franchise portfolio across our core and emerging growth areas. I want to reiterate our commitment to maximizing returns to our shareholders and bringing innovative therapies to patients over the long term. This demands that we continue to look at capital efficiently, effectively and appropriately. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will always strive to have an optimal capital structure, as well as aim for superior returns from the investment we make. I'd like to take a moment to discuss how we brought the purpose as an organization as we aim to pioneer science for the betterment of humanity. This includes doing the right thing for patients, our employees, the environment and the community, all of which we believe contributes to a long-term sustainable shareholder value. I am proud of what Biogen stands for, and I believe this approach positions us well to be a sustainable organization over the long term, as we remain focused on being the leader in neuroscience to address the tremendous societal needs in this space. Finally, I would like to thank our employees around the world, who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patients' lives, and all of the physician, caregivers and participants in our clinical development programs. Our past and future achievements could not be realized without their passion and commitment. We will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Geoff Porges : Thank you very much, and congratulations on the quarter and the results and all the progress. Just a couple of questions, Jeff, on the guidance. Could you talk about what assumptions are built into your guidance about the effect of the risdiplam imminent launch on SPINRAZA? And also just have you incorporated the full launch costs for aducanumab? Your sales force and everything you mentioned that, but is it fully budgeted in that guidance? Thanks. Jeffrey Capello : So thanks for the questions, Geoff. So with regard to risdiplam, we are assuming that that product does launch. And so we're anticipating, as everyone else is, to kind of see the data and kind of what it means. We'd just remind people that we have 10,000 people on therapy today doing very, very well with a very low discontinuation rate. So we'll see kind of what happens on the data and how that product is received. But certainly, there's a lot of growth opportunity for us ahead. With regard to aducanumab, we're not going to give specific perspective on numbers in terms of the launch, but I would just point you back to looking at the SG&A guidance, which is up quite a bit from a percentage perspective, and you get a sense of the amount we're spending year-over-year relative to that that we spent last year. And that is I think the prudent thing to do, given the significant opportunity ahead of us, which we're quite excited about. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Great, thanks for taking the question. Maybe just two for me. Just wondering if you can give us any more detail on what's gating to the aducanumab filing. And then, are you expecting a priority review? And then the outlook in terms of the ex-US regulatory filings there, do you have a similar level of confidence in filing in both Europe in Japan as you do in the US? Thank you. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Hi, Terence, this is Al. It's basically a matter of putting together documentation, the electronic Common Technical Document. It's an electronic document with hyperlinks, etc. It's a matter of assembling all that and submitting that to the FDA. And in terms of the engagement, we've been engaged with them since last -- the first Type C meeting last June, and it's been very constructive. I've never -- this is a unique situation to me. It's pretty unusual, I think, across the industry. But I'll say that it's been -- there has been a high level of constructive engagement ever since last June. And with respect to the other regions, we have started our engagement with them, but it's still early days. But we do anticipate that we will be filing at some point in those other regions as well at some point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Ronny Gal : Good morning. Congratulations on the results, and thank you for taking the questions. You mentioned you're beginning to -- the redosing trial. I wonder if you can just tell us a little bit about what you're trying to achieve with that trial. Essentially, now that you've got the protocol, what are the endpoints and when -- what is the data that we should see from that? And then second on VUMERITY, can you describe a little bit the launch plans here? I guess it didn't really make commercial step yet. Can you talk a little bit about whether you intend to give it the same kind of parity business model to TECFIDERA? Or would there be some things you do with VUMERITY that -- in terms of access, support and so forth, that will be better or worse than TECFIDERA? Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Hi Ronny, it's Al. The main reason for the redosing study were humanitarian reasons. We had all these patients who had volunteered to be in our clinical studies. They helped us develop aducanumab. We felt we owed something to them. Many of them had expressed a desire to the investigators that they wanted the drug. So that's the primary reason. As I said in my notes that -- in my script that it's a single-arm study. Basically, every patient gets titrated up to 10 milligrams per kilogram aducanumab, and all patients who were in prior studies, including placebo patients, are eligible. In a single-arm study, the main thing you can really look at is safety and tolerability. And we had always envisioned doing a long-term extension study. In fact, we had one in place to evaluate long-term safety and tolerability. And so that's the primary endpoint of the study. In addition, of course, we'll answer -- we'll take a look at efficacy as best you can in a single-arm study because we would be interested in continued -- if there's durable effect, obviously, we'll be looking at amyloid and other biomarkers, and we'll also see whether or not a treatment gap had any effect on these kinds of markers. Michel Vounatsos : So, Ronny, concerning the second part of your question, with a superior to take [indiscernible] we have the opportunity with VUMERITY to strengthen the overall fumarate portfolio. But TECFIDERA remains front and center in our promotion. You see the performance. We continue to support. And again, a key metric will be to increase the share of fumarate down the road. We are pleased with the access to date that is superior to what we have seen from competition a few months after launch, and for some competitors, 12 months after launch. So we are pleased with the access. We monitor very closely the Start Forms and the grads [ph]. We are pleased to see so far that there is more Start Forms being issued ex tech than tech. So this is a -- but it's still the beginning. It's a bit too early. We'll come back with more color when we have more data. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Phil Nadeau : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. It's actually on TECFIDERA and the IP. I believe, we are going to get a decision on the IPR next week. Can you remind us in the case where the IP were to fall, what would be the next steps, what is the appeal process there? And then secondarily, what is the status of the court case? Can you give us an update on the timelines there, should the IPR actually go your way next week? Thanks. Jeffrey Capello : Yeah, so it's Jeff. So there is a -- expect a decision, from the IPR perspective, no later than the end of the first week of February. So that will be the first of the three decisions. Depending on how that goes -- if it goes in our favor, that's great. If it doesn't, we plan to appeal, and the appeal process typically takes 12 to 18 months. Two other cases, West Virginia and Delaware, are expected to read out some point mid-year, plus or minus a month or two. Depending on how those go those go -- if those go our way, that's great. If not, we plan to appeal those, and the appeal period, again, tends to take 12 to 18 months. So we obviously await kind of the results of that. We do believe we have valid patents. Nonetheless, these outcomes are difficult to predict. There's a number of considerations need to be weighed. There's obviously multiple decisions that we just talked about. There's the appeal periods and then there's handicapping whether or not people -- if we're unsuccessful, we'll launch at risk. So it's difficult to predict in the short term. So we'll keep people apprised of kind of the developments as we move our way through the year. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat : Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. Al, I just wanted to focus on Alzheimer's for a minute, if I may. And it's very clear that FDA has a long history of approving CNS drugs, which have failed and/or negative trials in the past. However, every time FDA goes down that direction, I find that they pool results across every single thing. So my question is, if you pool results across ENGAGE, EMERGE and Phase Ib, what does that look like? That will be very helpful to understand. And also, how many post-hoc analysis were done before you guys arrived at the Protocol Version 4 population? I mostly ask because I'm trying to understand how we should think about what should be the p-value, given all the splits that theoretically should be thought about before we arrived at the PV4. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: So Umer, this is Al Sandrock. We haven't disclosed the results of any other kinds of analyses, including pooling or subsets. So we're not going to do that this morning. But I would say that I would not assume that -- I mean, when you look back in the history of approved drugs, I wouldn't say it's always the case that pooling is done. I think that there is -- there are exceptions to that. And so I would not assume that here, and let's see. Your question -- the other question was how many post-hoc analyses? We did say it was post-hoc, but I don't remember how many there were. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham : Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I just have a few. On SMA, in clinical development, patients on ZOLGENSMA switched back to SPINRAZA. Just curious if you guys have seen evidence that this is occurring in the real world. And then Al, bigger picture question on Alzheimer's. So if I assume that A-beta antibody is an anchor therapy, when we look down the road at combination approaches, is there sort of a fast path to derisk? In other words, do you feel like FDA -- you can look at surrogate markers such as a PET imaging initially, and then down the road, look at cognition. Just wanted to get a sense for looking at post-aducanumab. Thanks. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Yeah. So we -- your first question was about SMA and ZOLGENSMA. I don't really consider that as switch-back, if you will, because if they've had ZOLGENSMA, arguably that -- they're still on it, if you will. They're getting the effect of the gene therapy. So in some ways, it's like a combination of adding SPINRAZA. We have heard about that. It does happen in the real world. And you might want to -- you might wonder why people are doing that. I think it's because parents and the physicians feel like there might be more room to improve, and so that's what I hear from -- in the real world. And in terms of data from that, we are starting to collect that data. But we have -- we don't have any conclusions at this point. But we are -- because it's happening in the real world. And since we're very interested in real world evidence, we are starting to collect that data. In terms of Alzheimer's and combination, one of the reasons why we built the pipeline the way we did was that we had always envisioned combination therapy. And the first obvious thing to combine aducanumab or BAN2401 with would be an anti-tau or a tau ASO, something that affects tau. We were actually pleasantly surprised that aducanumab already affects tau, though. So we'll have to keep that in mind. But nevertheless, I think the most obvious thing to do would be to combine with tau as the next step, and then maybe that there are certain stages of the disease that need the combination more than other stages. And in terms of a fast track, yeah, we will employ biomarkers, not only of the toxic proteins that we're trying to reduce, A-beta and tau, but also potentially other kinds of biomarkers that look at additive effects in a more expedient way. But ultimately, I anticipate we will need to show some effect of the combination on reducing clinical decline further. I think that will still be important. Unless you can do it, in other words, if you're in an early stage of Alzheimer's where there is no cognitive impairment, you may not be able to do it where biomarkers alone may be the only approach. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Michael Yee : Thanks for the question. You had made some comments around preparation for aducanumab, including SG&A. Could you just put a little more color around, I guess, the work being done in terms of timing of when you actually expect the sales force to be on? And maybe some comments around what you're hearing from payers and what they would -- how they are putting in perspective this type of drug and what type of actions that type of drug would get. And then just a quick one also for Al, there is a DIAN-TU study reading out. I'm sure people will try to make read-throughs into what this means for the beta amyloid about -- this is maybe just a comment on anything to know or your perspective on that study. I appreciate it. Michel Vounatsos : So Michael, if I can get started with the launch readiness, actually, the work started more than two years ago with an understanding of the patient journey from origination to diagnosis, the referral dynamics that change from market to market, and even within the US, which is different, understand the different types of markets within the US, it's -- the different segments. We have finalized the go-to-market for the US. This has been approved, and this is funded in our budget, as discussed. And hiring has started, first with the medical affairs, obviously. Engagement with scientific leaders also at the community level is important. And also the biomanufacturing needs to be stepped up and be ready for eventually a large demand with the functional support, okay, to support the increased engagement and team. In terms of price, it's still early, even if we are making progress. We engage with stakeholders, because as you can imagine, there is almost no drug cost today. So we engage with patient association, pharmacoeconomics, through leaders and all the customers, mostly in the US and beyond the US. Beyond the price, it's all about the access condition and the affordability. We know that the more we wait, the more transition -- that people will transition to full-blown assistance and loss of dependence, which costs so much to the society. So basically, we start engaging, and hopefully, we'll have all the incentives in that field in order to further invest in R&D. This is our belief. So good progress, step by step, but we engage broadly and we ask for advice and we listen. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Hi Michael, it's Al. DIAN-TU -- so DIAN is the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network. So obviously, in these patients, amyloid is likely to be causal because most of the dominantly inherited mutations that lead to ultimately [ph] Alzheimer's disease are patients either in APP, the amyloid precursor protein, or enzymes that process it. And so I think that these are very interesting studies. My understanding is that solanizumab and gantenerumab are being tested. If the results are positive, I think that that would lend further support to the amyloid hypothesis. If the results are negative, I'd want to see that there is evidence of target engagement and biological changes in the brain before I make any conclusions. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Cory Kasimov : Great. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on capital allocation, and given the Company's current portfolio and pipeline, considering prevailing market dynamics, how do you look at the relative attractiveness between continued share repurchases, considering the 6 plus billion in dry powder you have there, and business development opportunities? I guess, do you have enough bandwidth to do both in a meaningful way? And do you -- and how much of an appetite do you have on the acquisition front at this time? Thanks. Jeffrey Capello : So Cory, it's Jeff. Thanks for the question. So we're in a good position from that perspective. We have no net debt as of the end of the year. In 2019, we generated $7 billion of cash flow and we expect that we'll have a strong cash flow year again in 2020. So we've got the financial flexibility to do both, and we have been doing both. Over the last three years, we've done 15 M&A BD type transactions, spending $3.5 billion. And in the last year alone, we bought back 24 million shares for almost $6 billion. So our interest is strong in terms of building the pipeline. We've taken the pipeline from 17 clinical assets to 27, significant increase. And then, of those 27, there's 11 that have important readouts in the next two years, five of which could have a meaningful impact on the Company. So we feel good about that. We'd like to continue to add to those assets and build the pipeline. But at the same point, we have $6.3 billion of authorized share repurchase capability as well. So we'll continue to make good decisions that are in the best interest long term of the shareholders and we'll have the capacity to do both. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Matthew Harrison : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I had one for Al on two pipeline program. Al, can you just comment why a LRRK2 ASO could be differentiated from the kinase inhibitors that we see in development? And then maybe just share your views on anti-LINGO in MS. Has that changed since you initiated that study or any updated views there? Thanks. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: So LRRK2 is a wonderful target, we believe, for Parkinson's disease, not only for the patients with familial PD due to LRRK2 mutations, but also potentially even for sporadic Parkinson's disease. And the ASO, it's another approach to -- instead of inhibiting the enzyme with a small molecule, you reduce the levels of LRRK2, and it remains to be seen. One thing I'll say about the ASO is that it's CNS. Because we give it intrathecally, it's only going to affect LRRK2 in the central nervous system, whereas a small molecule may have affects on the enzyme in other places. But I would say other than that, it's kind of early days for whether or not these drugs will be effective. And in terms of anti-LINGO, the Phase II study that we're doing now is different from the first Phase II study in the sense that we selected patients based on advanced imaging to be sure that they actually had demyelination based on MTR and actually had intact exons based on DTI. We also chose the dose that looked the most promising, based on the first Phase II study. And we're combining it with multiple different kinds of immunomodulators. In the first trial, we only combined it with interferon, but now we're combining it with TECFIDERA, TYSABRI as well as interferon to see whether or not the level of inflammatory disease in the brain affects remyelination. And perhaps when you have less inflammation, the oligodendrocyte precursor cells may be able to remyelinate better. So that's the difference. And we'll find out soon whether or not the second trial is positive. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jay Olson with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Jay Olson : Hi, congrats on a successful 2019, and thanks for taking the question. Could you elaborate on the rationale for studying BAN2401 in patients whose amyloid levels fall below the threshold of positivity? And is the goal here to create a complementary positioning for BAN2401 in patient segments that would be distinct from aducanumab? Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Well, we do view this -- we do view the two drugs as part of a multi-drug franchise, and we will use the drugs where they naturally fit the best, and we'll need data for that. Just because they're not positive based on a visual read, that doesn't mean there's no amyloid accumulation. So I think that's the distinction. And in some ways, A345 study looks at -- between the two studies, looks at both Stage 1 and Stage 2, both of the -- both stages as defined by the FDA guidance document that came out last year on the various stages of Alzheimer's disease. So I would say that those two studies evaluate both Stage 1 and Stage 2, and both are important to study, I believe. Joe Mara : There's probably time for two more questions. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Evan Seigerman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question. Evan Seigerman : Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter. I'm just looking towards next week with the potential results from the IPR. If they were to not go your way, would you consider re-prioritizing your business development priorities versus share repurchases? Or would you have to wait until you kind of see the results of the court cases mid-year? Michel Vounatsos : So thanks for the good question. And we see business development M&A opportunities as being independent from what happens next week or what happened six months ago, in March. We continue to remain -- we are very engaged on BD opportunities, and the team continue to look at the opportunities to create value for the shareholders, and this will be independent from any event. Jeffrey Capello : Yeah, and just as a reminder, we ended the year with no net debt. And in 2019, we generated $7 billion in operating cash flow. So we've got the capacity to do both. Operator : The final question will come from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with SunTrust. Please go ahead with your question. Robyn Karnauskas : Hi, thanks for the question. Just to give us some comfort, as the investors and we think about Alzheimer's, should it be approved, given that you've [ph] a huge amount of antibody, can you give us any comfort around cost of goods and margins that it wouldn't be too harmful? I know you guys have very good manufacturing capacity, but that's still a lot of antibodies. So when would we learn this? And can you give us any comfort that the dollar amount to make this drug isn't extremely high that it would overburden the system? Thanks. Jeffrey Capello : Yeah. So thanks for the question. So it's obviously something we've been looking at for a while. And I'll say -- I don't want to get into too much specifics with regard to that at this point in time, but we're comfortable that given the nature of the substance that we'll produce, it will be a fair margin and that it will do well economically. Joe Mara : So I'm going to turn it back over to Michel for his closing comments. Michel Vounatsos : So thank you all for being on the call. We turned the page of a very strong 2019, and now, the team at Biogen is ready for a very material 2020 and, obviously, with a priority for a potential aducanumab. Thank you for your attention. Joe Mara : Thank you. End the call. Operator : Thank you again for joining today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect.+",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen First Quarter 2020 Financial Results and Business Update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Joe Mara, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin conference. Joe Mara : Good morning, and welcome to Biogen's first quarter 2020 earnings call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of the biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2, and Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We\u2019ve also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Al Sandrock, EVP, Research and Development; and our CFO, Jeff Capello. Now, I will turn the call over to Michel. Michel Vounatsos : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I want first to acknowledge the challenging situation the global COVID-19 pandemic has created for so many people. Our hearts go out to everyone who has been impacted. We applaud the way our employees and everyone across the entire health care system is breaking down barriers and working together to address this pandemic. And we are committed to doing our part to support communities worldwide. At the same time, we are also committed to learning from the current situation and working to develop innovative new operating models, such as accelerating our digital capabilities which we believe will better position Biogen for the future. During these challenging and unprecedented times, Biogen\u2019s mission and purpose remain the same. Over half a million patients around the world rely on us today to supply important medicines for serious diseases and there still remains an urgent need to develop innovative therapies for the millions of patients suffering from devastating diseases of the nervous system. Let me now provide you with an update on how we are operating our business throughout the pandemic. First, I would like to recognize the resilience and the adaptability of the Biogen team. Biogen personally felt the painful impact of these global crisis as many of our employees became sick early on and orders have since been affected. We have been fortunate that as of today all of our employees have recovered or are recovering. Most of our affected employees have continued to work and fulfill their duties. We are grateful to the public health authorities for all they have done and we are also thankful for the courage and compassion of the health care workers who have been helping us and continue to support so many. We took a number of actions early on to support our stakeholders and society at large, including, committing $10 million from the Biogen foundation to support global response efforts, launching a consortium with the Broad Institute of MIT Harvard and Partners Healthcare to build and share a biobank and giving Biogen employees who have recovered, as well as their close contacts, the opportunity to donate samples and medical data. Pursuing a process development and manufacturing collaboration with Vir Biotech, which is developing potential antibody therapies for COVID-19, providing medical equipment and supplies to Partners Healthcare in Massachusetts and developing and donating 3D printed personal protective equipment in Massachusetts and North Carolina. Engaging with investigators who may want to evaluate the potential of our interferon therapies or our anti-TNF biosimilars to treat COVID-19, facilitating volunteer efforts by our medically trained employees to serve as health care workers on the frontlines and by other [ph] employees to serve the community, and implementing policies and practices to safeguard our employees and communities, including asking almost all the employees to work from home at this stage. These are our initial commitments and we will continue to look for additional ways to help. At the same time, we have remained intensely focused on operating our business to serve the needs of all our patients and stakeholders. I am proud to see the Biogen team demonstrate agility by quickly defining innovative approaches to both mitigate risks and identify new opportunities across R&D, manufacturing, medical and commercial operations. Let me provide you with an update on several key areas of our business. At this time our supply chain around the world is functioning well. We continue to operate our manufacturing facilities and are working with organization across our supply chain to maintain continuity. And we continue to closely monitor the evolving situation. We are carefully considering recent regulatory guidance on conducting clinical trials during the pandemic and the safety of participants in our clinical programs is our top priority. To help mitigate the impact to our clinical trials, we are pursuing innovative approaches such as remote monitoring, remote patient visits and supporting home infusions. While we expect there may be some impact with timelines for some of our clinical programs, importantly we still expect the vast majority of the 10 remaining readouts we have recently highlighted to occur before the end of 2021. We have continued to have frequent interactions with the regulatory authorities, including for aducanumab. We have adjusted our commercial and medical affairs operations and accelerated our digital engagement with customers. We are working with regulators to enable home infusions for TYSABRI where appropriate. To date, our business and financials have remained strong. We believe that we are in a strong position to remain the leader in neuroscience based on the strength in our core business areas, a healthy balance sheet and financial position and a robust pipeline across several important disease areas. We continue to believe we have multiple opportunities for significant near-term value creation as we aim to be build a multi-franchise portfolio in areas such as Alzheimer, ALS, stroke, ophthalmology and lupus. Now, let me turn to highlights of the first quarter, starting with our financials. First quarter revenues grew 1% to $3.5 billion. First quarter GAAP earnings per share grew 13% to $8.08 and non-GAAP grew 31% to $9.14. Turning to our progress across our strategic priorities. First, we have made good progress towards the regulatory filing in the US for aducanumab. We have continued to have constructive engagement with the US FDA. We now have an open BLA and we have started to submit modules of the filing. We have participated in additional formal interaction using mechanisms such as Type C meetings and we are preparing for a pre-BLA meeting currently scheduled for the summer, following that meeting we expect to complete the filing in Q3. I'd like to thank the FDA and the aducanumab team at Biogen who have adjusted to working under the currency circumstances with COVID-19, in particular as some members of the Biogen team were directly impacted. Outside the US, we have had initial aducanumab discussions with regulators in Europe and Japan, although these interactions are still in the early stages. In March the first patient was dosed in the EMBARK re-dosing study, which aims to provide access to aducanumab for eligible patients previously enrolled in our aducanumab clinical studies. While we collect important data in the study, we do not believe it is required for the filing. From a manufacturing standpoints we currently expect to have adequate supply to meet anticipated demand for aducanumab initially using our facility in RTP, North Carolina which will later be complemented by the large next generation state of the art facility we are building in Solothurn, Switzerland. The construction is complete, and its validation remains on track. We expect it to be operating by the end of this year and to be producing some of the commercial supply of aducanumab in mid-2021. Overall, together with our collaboration partner, Eisai, we remain optimistic about the prospect of bringing aducanumab to market as the first therapy to reduce clinical decline in Alzheimer's disease. And we continue to progress in our market preparation \u2013 sorry, and launch readiness with an initial focus on the US. We hope that aducanumab marks the beginning of an era of new potential treatments for Alzheimer's disease. And we aim to build a broad franchise across multiple targets and modalities. This includes BAN2401 which we are collaborating on with Eisai, multiple programs targeting tau, our collaboration with CAMP4 to identify new druggable targets, our acquisition of CK1 from Pfizer as a potential symptomatic therapy and our new collaboration with Sangamo to develop a gene regulation therapies for a range of neurological indication including Alzheimer's disease. Second, Q1 MS revenues, including OCREVUS royalties were $2.3 billion, an increase of 9% versus the prior year. The number of patients on our MS products globally increased to 3% versus the prior year and our business continue to demonstrate resilience. We continue to launch VUMERITY in the US. We have been able to secure unrestricted access for VUMERITY faster than other recent competitive launches. We have also been pleased to see that a large proportion of VUMERITY patients have come from therapies older than TECFIDERA and approximately 30% of VUMERITY patients are na\u00efve to treatment. We also make progress with our first ex-US regulatory filing of VUMERITY in Israel and plans to pursue approval in other the major markets worldwide. We were pleased that the claims of our TECFIDERA patent were upheld by the US Patent Office in a positive decision on the IPR challenge. This decision has been appealed and is pending. We expect decision from the Federal District Courts in Delaware and West Virginia and the actions later this year. Third, SPINRAZA generated first quarter global revenues of $565 million, a 9% increase versus the prior year, and a 4% increase versus the prior quarter, including the expanded access program and clinical trials over 10000 patients are being treated with SPINRAZA. This quarter important new data were published showing that clinically meaningful benefits SPINRAZA can deliver for teens and adults with SMA and we initiated a new study to evaluate the potential for even greater efficacy with a higher dose of SPINRAZA. Fourth, first quarter biosimilars revenue were $219 million, which represent 25% growth year-over-year. We estimated that our biosimilars generated approximately \u20ac1.8 billion of savings to the European Healthcare Systems in 2019 which we expect will continue to increase in 2020. This is critical as we work to create financial headroom for innovation and continue and contribute to the long-term sustainability of the healthcare system. Fifth, beyond Alzheimer's disease, we continue to develop and expand our pipeline. In particular, this quarter we submitted a regulatory fighting for an intramuscular formulation of PLEGRIDY in the US and in Europe which may be another important option for MS patients. Sixth, our cash flow generation remains strong and continue to provide us with significant optionality and flexibility to allocate capital. In Q1, we generated approximately $1.5 billion in cash flow from operations. We continue to have the financial flexibility and capacity to evaluate potential external business development and M&A opportunities and remain active on the BD front. As we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to maximizing returns for our shareholders, while continuing to bring innovative therapies to patients, something that demands a thoughtful approach towards all our investment over both the short and the long term. In summary, despite the challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Biogen has continued to execute well on our strategy. I will now turn the call over to Al for a more detailed update on our recent progress in R&D. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Thank you, Michel. And good morning, everyone. Before I begin let me first take a moment to say how proud I am of the way the R&D organization has stepped up in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm inspired by their resilience and their unwavering commitment to our patients. Let me now review the steps we have taken within R&D. In line with recent global regulatory guidance, we have developed a set of principles to guide our clinical trial conduct under these exceptional circumstances. First, the safety of all of our clinical trial participants and our health care providers, as well as the integrity of the data we collect will remain paramount. Second, given the importance of our clinical trials to patients with serious diseases, we aim to continue our ongoing trials, as long as the risks to patient and healthcare provider safety, as well as data integrity can be sufficiently mitigated. Third, we are generally allowing enrollment of new patients, sites and countries into ongoing clinical trials. However this may be stopped on a study by study basis if such enrollment compromises our ability to mitigate risk to patient and health care provider safety and data integrity. Fourth, we may allow for the initiation of new clinical studies on a region by region basis, as long as the risk to safety and data integrity can be sufficiently mitigated. However, we are implementing a limited pause on the initiation of new clinical trials evaluating molecules which suppress the immune system or specifically modulate antiviral responses with a reassessment in the coming months. This includes pausing the initiation of the planned Phase III study of the pegylated anti-CD40 ligand fab in systemic lupus erythematosus in collaboration with UCB. And fifth, we are reviewing informed consent forms from all studies to ensure that potential risks associated with travel to study sites and where applicable product specific risks of viral infection are appropriately highlighted. At the same time, we are continuing to monitor how the current situation may impact our projected timelines for ongoing studies. While the situation remains fluid, we continue to expect the vast majority of the 10 remaining mid to late stage data readouts that we recently highlighted to occur by the end of 2021. However, we do anticipate that a portion of these 10 readouts will be delayed including the Phase III study of BIIB093, or IV glibenclamide for large hemispheric infarction, as this study involves administration of BIIB093 in an acute hospital setting. As we move forward, we will continue to prioritize both patient safety and data integrity. But we are not able to provide further details on the timing of readouts at this stage. As Michel mentioned, we are pursuing a number of initiatives to mitigate further impact to our ongoing clinical studies. These include remote monitoring, remote data verification, supporting patients and staff travel to study sites, launching a direct-to-patient delivery service for our investigational therapies, supporting at home infusions and providing telemedicine options to minimize the number of missed study visits and study withdrawals. Finally, each study in our portfolio will undergo a COVID-19 specific risk assessment to highlight study specific risks to operational or scientific aspects, identify appropriate mitigation strategies and ensure compliance with evolving regulatory guidelines. We recently rolled out remote site monitoring and we are working to implement the remainder of these initiatives as soon as possible. In parallel with these efforts to mitigate risk to our pipeline, we aim to elucidate - help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying COVID-19 pathogenesis and advance the development of potential therapeutic solutions. To this end, this month we announced that we are launching a consortium that will build and share a COVID-19 biobank working with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and Partners HealthCare which includes Massachusetts General Hospital and Birmingham Women's Hospital. This biobank aims to centralize and facilitate study of a large collection of de-identified samples and medical data with the aim of unraveling the biology of COVID-19, linking molecular signatures with clinical presentation and accelerating the search for potential treatments. Many of my Biogen colleagues have been eager to find ways to help during this pandemic and we are proud to be a founding member of this consortium. The biobank will include samples and medical data from volunteer Biogen employees who have recovered from COVID-19, as well as their close contacts. And last month we signed a letter of intent and began collaborating with Vir Biotechnology to accelerate process development and manufacturing of human monoclonal antibodies that may neutralize SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. We are proud to leverage our extensive expertise and capabilities in advanced biologics manufacturing to collaborate with Vir and potentially accelerate the development of therapies to combat this epidemic. Finally, given the effect of that type 1 interferon show and the antiviral response in-vitro. we are engaging with investigators who may be interested in evaluating the potential of our beta interferon products in the treatment of COVID-19. In sum, the R&D organization at Biogen has taken significant steps to respond to the unprecedented challenge posed by COVID-19. We aim to continue advancing our innovative neuroscience pipeline, while contributing to the shared understanding of COVID-19 biology and the advancement of potential treatments. Let me now turn to the advances we made across our pipeline in the first quarter, starting with Alzheimer's disease and dementia. As Michel point mentioned, we continue to make progress toward the regulatory filing for aducanumab in the United States. We have begun to submit BLA modules and expect to complete the filing in Q3. At the virtual ADPD meeting earlier this month, we held an encore presentation of the aducanumab Phase III topline results. The data in this presentation were previously presented at the CTAD Annual Congress last December. And last month, we dosed the first patient in the EMBARK re-dosing study. In this study eligible patients previously enrolled in our clinical trials, including patients previously treated with either aducanumab or placebo, will be titrated to 10 milligrams per kilogram aducanumab infusions every four weeks. Beyond aducanumab, we continue to advance a broad Alzheimer's disease portfolio including the Phase III study of BAN2401, BIIB080, a tau-targeted antisense oligonucleotide in Phase I and BIIB076, an anti-tau antibody in Phase I, and gosuranemab, a distinct anti-tau antibody in Phase II. Turning to neuromuscular disorders. Last month an independent observational cohort study evaluating the safety and efficacy of SPINRAZA in 139 teens and adults with SMA was published in Lancet Neurology, representing the largest study of SPINRAZA in teens and adults to date. In contrast to the natural history of SMA, this real-world study found that treatment SPINRAZA was associated with statistically significant increases in total Hammersmith scores compared to baseline at 6, 10 and 14 months of treatment. Of note, a clinically meaningful improvement defined as an increase of at least three points in the Hammersmith scores was observed in 40% of patients at the 14 month assessment. No new safety concerns were identified and no serious adverse events were reported. These data once again underscore the durable efficacy and well-established longer term safety profile of SPINRAZA across a broad range of SMA patients, including adults. Last month we dosed the first patient in DEVOTE, a Phase II/III study evaluating whether higher doses of SPINRAZA can provide even greater efficacy than the currently approved dose. This study was motivated by SPINRAZA as well characterize safety profile, as well as our PKPD data suggesting that individuals with higher CSF concentrations of SPINRAZA achieve greater improvements in CHOP INTEND scores and motor milestones. Also last month, we submitted an IND for BIIB105, an antisense oligonucleotide targeting ataxin-2 for sporadic ALS. The FDA has since reviewed the IND and deemed it to be safe to proceed. We are particularly excited by this program for the 90% of our ALS patients who have sporadic disease. Trinucleotide repeat expansions in the ataxin-2 gene have been associated not only with an increased risk of developing ALS, but also with an increased rate of disease progression in those patients. Importantly, ataxin-2 was originally identified as a modifier of TDP-43 toxicity, a pathology common to more than 90% of the ALS population suggesting that reduction of ataxin-2 could be therapeutic in the sporadic ALS population. Moving to our progress in MS and neuroimmunology. For patients with relapsing forms of MS, PLEGRIDY remains a convenient treatment option with a well-established safety and efficacy profile. However tolerability, including injection site reactions has been the leading cause of discontinuation. At the ACTRIMS meeting held in February, we presented data investigating whether intramuscular administration of PLEGRIDY might reduce injection site reactions compared to subcutaneous dosing, while maintaining bioequivalents. On the primary endpoint there was bio equivalence between the two routes of administration on plasma exposures. We also found that the proportion of patients reporting injection site reactions was reduced by over 50% after intramuscular dosing compared to subcutaneous dosing. We have submitted regulatory filings for an intramuscular formulation of PLEGRIDY in both the United States and the EU. In March, the FDA updated the labels of AVONEX and PLEGRIDY to include data to assist health care providers when considering use during pregnancy. This follows label updates in Europe last year that removed the contraindications for use during pregnancy. These changes to the label are significant given that women are diagnosed with MS at least two to three times more frequently than men and women are often are often affected during their childbearing years. We recently received top line data from Opus, a randomized Phase II study exploring the efficacy, safety and tolerability of natalizumab as an adjunct of therapy in patients with drug resistant focal epilepsy. However, the primary endpoint was not met and thus we have decided to discontinue development of natalizumab in drug resistant focal epilepsy. Last month data from the Phase I/II dose escalation study of BIIB112 are AAV-based gene therapy targeting X-linked retinitis pigmentosa or XLRP, were published in Nature Medicine. Overall, results from this study indicated an acceptable safety profile and dose responsive gains in visual function with 7 of 18 patients experiencing early increases in central retinal sensitivity that were sustained at month 6 of follow up. And in business development, we recently announced a broad collaboration with Sangamo Therapeutics to leverage their proprietary zinc finger protein platform. This technology enables the generation of designer DNA binding proteins that can be easily packaged into an AAV vector and serve as specific potent and tunable regulators of gene expression. Through this collaboration we have also - we also have access to Sangamo's capsid engineering platform, which has the potential to potentially - which has potential to identify novel capsids to allow more efficient and specific delivery of AAV payloads to the central nervous system. We will first focus on programs for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and a third neuromuscular disease target with exclusive access to up to 9 additional neurological targets. Overall, we remain undeterred in our mission to develop novel therapies for devastating neurological diseases and I am proud of our team's agility in responding to this pandemic. I am optimistic that we will work through these challenges, mitigate potential impacts to our programs and continue to progress our pipeline. I will now pass the call to Jeff. Jeffrey Capello : Thanks, Al. Good morning, everyone. Prior to starting my comments on the financial performance, I want to highlight that we believe the fundamentals of our business are strong and we are well-positioned. Our products are important therapies for patients living with serious diseases. We have strong operating process, enabling us to operate effectively through these challenging times. We also pride ourselves in our ability to execute well commercially. In addition, we are well capitalized financially. These are however unprecedented times that will have an impact on our business. I will now review our financial performance, highlighting the various factors to give you a sense of our performance and then wrap up with commentary on our outlook. I'll start with our revenues. Total revenues for the first quarter grew 1% year-over-year to approximately $3.5 billion. It's important to note that we believe Q1 benefited from approximately $100 million attributed to accelerated sales due to COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in Europe. As a reminder, Q1 2019 included a benefit of approximately $200 million in other revenues due to the sale of hemophilia inventory to Bioverativ. Overall, we executed well in our MS business, delivering revenues of approximately $2.3 billion in the first quarter of this year, including OCREVUS royalties of approximately $162 million, growing 9% versus prior year. Global MS revenues in Q1 2020 increased 7% versus the prior year without OCREVUS royalties. US MS revenues excluding OCREVUS increased 4% or $58 million versus the prior year. US MS revenues in Q1 2020 were impacted by a decrease from channel inventory of approximately $115 million compared to a decrease of approximately $170 million in Q1 2019. We estimate that we had $54 million in additional sales due to a greater number of shipping days in the quarter. Roughly half of which impacted the inventory quarterly change. In addition, we believe we benefited from a net $15 million sales impact due to COVID-19 primarily impacting TECFIDERA. Outside the US, our MS revenues grew 11% or $77 million on higher volumes, with minimal price impact and an estimated COVID-19 beneficial impact of $59 million, primarily split between TECFIDERA and interferon. Global first quarter Fumarate revenues, including TECFIDERA and VUMERITY increased 10% versus the prior year, driven by revenue growth both in the US and outside the US. In the US, Fumarate revenue grew at 8% or $60 million versus prior year. US Fumarate revenues were impacted by a decrease in channel inventory of approximately $85 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared to a decrease of approximately $110 million in Q1 2019. Versus the prior year, we saw favorable demand for TECFIDERA which we believe is primarily due to the extra shipping days and COVID-19 impact with roughly stable underlying performance without those impacts. After an initial channel load in Q4, VUMERITY had sales of $2 million in the US in the first quarter of 2020. And we were making good progress securing access and reimbursement. Within the US we were pleased to see strong execution with continued stability in our share of total prescriptions for the fumarates versus the prior quarter, in light of increased competition. It's important to note that the vast majority of TECFIDERA and VUMERITY prescriptions in the US are delivered via mail order and as a result we do not expect a significant impact to TECFIDERA due to COVID-19. Outside the US, TECFIDERA again performed very well with Q1 2020 revenues growing 15% or $42 million, including an estimated benefit of approximate $28 million due to inventory dynamics related to COVID-19. Importantly, the number of TECFIDERA patients outside US grew by approximately 13% versus the prior year, driven by positive patient growth in the large European markets and approximately 40% patient growth in Latin American, Asia-Pacific combined. In total, we were pleased to see strong global patient growth for TECFIDERA of approximately 8% year-over-year. Q1 global interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY decreased 7% versus Q1 2019 due to continued shift from the injectable platforms to oral or higher efficacy therapies. In the US, interferon revenues decreased 11% or $35 million versus the prior year. Within the US AVONEX and PLEGRIDY were impacted by the continued transition to oral and high efficacy therapies and by decreasing channel inventory of approximately $35 million [ph] compared to a decrease of approximately $50 million in Q1 2019, partially impacted by the extra shipping days. Similar to TECFIDERA the vast majority of interferon prescriptions in the US are delivered via mail order. Outside the US, interferon revenues were stable versus the prior year with an estimated benefit of approximate $21 million due to increased channel inventory related to COVID-19. Given their safety profile and potential antiviral properties, we are seeing an increased interest in our interferon products, which may present an opportunity for less erosion in this franchise going forward. This is a dynamic that we'll watch carefully as time progresses. TYSABRI worldwide revenues increased 13% or $62 million versus the prior - versus the first quarter of 2019. In the US TYSABRI revenues increased 13% versus the prior year or $33 million. US TYSABRI revenues were impacted by an increase in channel inventory of approximately $5 million compared to a decrease of approximately $10 million in Q1 20 19. Within the US, we were pleased to see roughly stable adjusted volumes and share of new prescriptions, as well as an increased share of total prescriptions for TYSABRI versus the prior quarter. Outside the US, TYSABRI revenues increased 14% or $29 million versus the prior year, with an estimated benefit of approximately $7 million due to increased channel inventory related to COVID-19. Q1 2020 TYSABRI revenues benefited by approximate $20 million due to pricing adjustment in Italy related to prior periods. Outside the US, we are pleased to see continued patient growth of 4% for TYSABRI versus the prior year. Given that TYSABRI is administered in the physician's office or hospital setting, we do expect an impact from COVID-19 on TYSABRI sales. As we attempt to mitigate this risk, we are working to enable TYSABRI home infusions within the US where appropriate. Overall, we were pleased with the execution of our MS franchise and the continued strong performance of our MS business in the first quarter. While there is some uncertainty in our MS trajectory given COVID-19, particularly for TYSABRI, there are also opportunities and we remain encouraged by the resilience of our market leading franchise. Let me now move on to SPINRAZA - excuse me. Global first quarter SPINRAZA revenues increased to 9% for the prior year to $565 million. In the US, revenues increased 5% versus Q1 2019 and decreased 3% versus Q4 2019. The number of patients on therapy in the US increased 1% as compared to the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, driven primarily by growth in the number of adults. We believe US SPINRAZA revenues benefited by approximately $6 million due to COVID-19. In addition, leading indicators suggest that we may be seeing a decrease in new patient starts, particularly among adults, as well as a decrease in compliance, both related to COVID-19. We are aware that some physicians and hospitals are delaying SPINRAZA dosesm as they make difficult prioritization decisions, while confronting COVID-19. Although we continue to work to ensure patients receive this critical treatment and I've seen more centers come back online. Outside the US, SPINRAZA revenues increased 12% versus Q1 2019 and 10% versus Q4 2019, driven primarily by increased penetration across all major geographies. With an estimated benefit of approximately $5 million due to increased channel inventory related to COVID-19. Outside the US, we have also seen a moderate impact on demand for SPINRAZA due to COVID-19, which we expect may continue. As a reminder, the first quarter of last year benefited from a positive pricing adjustment of $14 million in France, negatively impacting the year-over-year comparison. In total outside the US, the number of commercial SPINRAZA patients increased approximate 10% versus the prior quarter. Broad growth occurred again across all major regions with an increased number of countries contributing, as we continue this very successful product launch. Overall, we were pleased with SPINRAZA\u2019s performance in the first quarter. While we recognize there is some uncertainty in its trajectory given COVID-19 pandemic, we still believe there are continued opportunities for growth, given the significant number of untreated patients, including in many established and emerging markets. Let me now move on to our biosimilars business, which generated $219 million in this quarter, growing 25% versus the prior year or $44 million. We estimate that there are now approximately 215,000 patients using our biosimilars in Europe. BENEPALI remains the number one prescribed Enbrel biosimilar across the major EU five markets. FLIXABI volume grew 90% versus the prior year, and IMRALDI volumes grew 28% versus fourth quarter. Despite our biosimilars business benefiting by approximately $15 million due to COVID-19 with the quarter, this business again performed well and has the opportunity to continue to grow both in Europe, as well as potentially within the US and other geographies with our additional assets. Total anti-CD20 revenues in Q1 increased 1% versus the prior year with increased OCREVUS royalties offsetting decreased revenues from RITUXAN due to recent introduction of biosimilar. Total other revenues in the first quarter decreased 63% versus the r year, due primarily to the prior period sale of approximately $200 million of hemophilia inventory to Bioverativ in the first quarter of 2019. Let me now turn to gross margins. Q1 2020 gross margin was 87%, an improvement versus the 83% in the prior year, due to lower contract manufacturing revenue and was relatively stable versus the prior quarter. Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense were both 13% of revenue. As a reminder, R&D expense in the first quarter of 2019 included approximate $39 million related to our agreement with Skyhawk, and approximately $45 million in net closeout costs for the Phase III studies of aducanumab. R&D expense in Q1 2020 was lower in part to the timing of milestones which are difficult to predict. Note, in the second quarter of 2020 we expect to record a GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense of $125 million for the license fee related to our collaboration with Sangamo. Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A were both 16% of revenue. We still expect SG&A to increase throughout the year, as we ramp up our commercial preparations for aducanumab. Q1 GAAP other expense was $120 million, which included $61 million in unrealized losses on investments, primarily driven by decrease in the fair value of our equity investment in Ionis. Q1 non-GAAP other expense was $60 million. In Q1 of this year, our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were both approximate 17%. In the first quarter 2019 our GAAP FX tax rate included a one time charge related to the planned divestiture of our Hiller\u00f8d. Denmark manufacturing operations, as well as higher unrealized gains. We repurchased approximately 7.3 million shares in the first quarter at an average price of $303 for a total value of approximately $2.2 billion. The share repurchase program authorized in March 2019 has now been completed and as of the end of the first quarter approximately $4.1 billion was remaining under the share repurchase program authorized in December. That now brings us to our diluted earnings per share. In the first quarter we booked GAAP EPS of $8.08, an increase of 13% versus the prior year and non-GAAP earnings of $9.14 per share, a 31% increase versus the prior year. We generated approximately $1.5 billion in net cash flows from operations in Q1. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.8 million in cash, marketable securities and $6 billion in debt. As we think about the balance of the year, we acknowledge that these are unprecedented times and there's significant uncertainty. Let me now outline what we do know. We again performed well operationally in the first quarter and saw some benefit from accelerated sales that occurred relative to COVID-19. We expect some volatility in revenues between the quarters. We have seen some disruption start to materialize, particularly for TYSABRI and SPINRAZA due to physician administration and facility capacity, as we have seen some delays in dosing. We believe our therapies are essential for patients and we are actively working to help patients maintain their dosing schedules. We are also mindful of the potential macro risks from the economic environment and the impact on the health care systems, including a potential impact on payer mix. At the same time, as demonstrated in the past, we remain focused on strong commercial execution, which we believe may in part help mitigate these risks. We also may benefit from a potential decrease in competitive pressures across several business areas and potentially renewed interest in our interferon therapies. As a reminder, we have a policy to update our guidance once a year and in July and we should hopefully know more by then. Let me now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you, Jeff. I am incredibly proud of how the Biogen team has responded to the current situation. Our employees all around the world have demonstrated their resilience and dedication to advancing our mission, as well as their compassion and empathy in wanting to be part of the solution to this terrible disease. Our business has remained strong. We delivered solid financial results in the first quarter and we have demonstrated a GDP in adapting many aspects of our operations, including the conduct of most of our clinical trials. While do we do anticipate some risks to our business as a result of the pandemic, we believe our opportunities for value creation remains compelling, given the significant unmet medical need in the diseases we are pursuing. With a strong core business in MS, SMA and biosimilars, we believe we have the foundation to continue building a multi-franchise portfolio. We believe the vast majority of our 10 data readouts remains on track to complete before the end of 2021. Importantly, we have made good progress on the aducanumab filing and we are actively preparing for potential commercial launch, as we are getting ready to lead the fight in Alzheimer's disease. Finally, I want to reiterate our commitment to maximizing returns to our shareholders and bringing innovative therapies to patients over the long term. These demands that we continue to allocate capital efficiently, effectively and appropriately, as we have demonstrated in the past we will always strive to have an optimal capital structure, as well as aim for superior returns from the investments we make. Our response to this current situation exemplifies our broader purpose as an organization as we aim to pioneer science for the betterment of humanity. This includes doing the right thing for patients, employees, the environment and the community, all of which we believe contribute to long-term sustainable shareholder value. I am proud of what Biogen stands for and I believe this approach positions us well to be a sustainable organization over the long run, as we remain focused on being the leader in neuroscience to address the tremendous societal needs in this space. Now more than ever, I would like to thank our employees around the world who are dedicated to making the positive impact on patients' life and all of the health care workers who are on the frontlines battling COVID-19. I have been truly impressed how the entire health care community has stood up in the space of this quarantine [ph] times. With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Marc Goodman from SVB Leerink. Your line is open. Marc Goodman : Yes, good morning. On the ADU filing, it just seems like there's been a change in the language a little bit with regards to the filing. I guess, everybody was kind of assuming that you had filed or were about to file and now it just seems like there was a delay. Can you give us a little more color on what's going on behind the scenes? Is it - is it COVID related? Is it a change in the language of what you're hearing from FDA? And then just secondarily, can you just give us a little more color on what you're talking about with the interactions in Europe and Japan as well? Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : So thank you for the question that is the focus of the attentions of everyone and a priority within the organization. Again, we are on track and we are receiving input from the FDA and we are engaging very well. I would say, there are two main reasons. While it's taking a little bit more time and at the company we are prioritizing the quality of the submission versus the timing. We don't want to rush and then face challenges. So the quality is important and we have to keep in mind that there is an unprecedented dataset, plus COVID, okay? The database - database lock was in November and is very complex with more than 3000 - 3200 patients, multiple biomarkers and multiple endpoints. And if you couple that with we could be a one [ph] it makes a complex and unprecedented dataset. So I just want to put that upfront before Al build on that. Al? Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Yeah. So can you hear me? So I just want to \u2013 I have to say that it's \u2013 look, timing is not easy to predict. We were trying to do that since the initial announcement in October and this is an unusual process. But I want to emphasize that we now have an open BLA. We've started to submit modules. We have continued constructive engagement with FDA and we believe we're on track in terms of the potential for approval. There's - I wouldn't read too much else into this. And in terms of your second part of your question, which I believe was Japan and Europe, we have started engagement. It's still kind of early relative to the process with FDA, but we have started. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Terence Flynn : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a follow up there, I was just wondering if you can tell us if the FDA has asked for any additional analysis of aducanumab data. And then Michel and Al, I would just be curious if your level of confidence in the dataset is the same now as when it was when you announced your intention to file for approval last year? Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : So level of confidence remains the same. Al, will take the rest of the question. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Yeah. I would say that we are constantly doing analysis, but nothing really has changed in terms of - nothing has come up in the data that changes our interpretation of the data. Our view of the fundamentals hasn't changed. And I emphasize that we remain constructively engaged. These additional type C meetings are really to further engage with FDA. As we have been since the very beginning actually, starting last June when we had our first type C meeting. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Umer Raffat : Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question Michel, a quick one for you and one for Al. Michel, you keep mentioning the word good progress on describing aducanumab, even though it seems like you now probably need a pre-BLA meeting which didn't sound like was the case previously. So can you elaborate on that. And Al, it seems like I'm just reading the [indiscernible] what you just said and it seems like you're having to run additional analyses, and that those might be the reason why additional meetings are happening with FDA. And I guess my question is has FDA previously shared feedback with you on the way you guys did imputations for non-completers because you might recall, the reason EMERGE [ph] hit on the high dose was because the effect size in the completers was assumed to be the same as non- completers and also the whole question around whether FDA would want you to pull the data, has FDA shared feedback? We're not asking what the feedback is, but has FDA shared the feedback with you on that? Michel Vounatsos : So Umer, last time we had the opportunity to dialogue. We didn't have an open BLA. We didn't have to file to the FDA. So there is good progress. We had traditional type C meetings and you have to read here high interest from the FDA. So this is what we continue to qualify as being positive progress. Al? Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Umer, I would just say that we had always planned to have a pre-BLA meeting with FDA. That hasn't changed. That was always in the planning. And look, some members of the team did get COVID and I can tell you it's hard to work when you have COVID. The fatigue, mental or physical fatigue was such that there were some people who were affected by the disease. So I think that - that's part of it, but I would say that most of it is that - I would say the main point is that nothing has come up with the data that has changed our interpretation. We believe EMERGE is a positive study. It was positive on the pre-specified primary and all three secondary endpoints. You know, I mean, we have done an analysis on ENGAGE to try to figure out why that result was different. But we believe that the fundamentals are the same and that the potential for approval remains the same as Michel said from the very beginning. Michel Vounatsos : And if something would have change, we\u2019ll communicate so. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Your line is open. Ronny Gal : Hi. Unfortunately, we probably have to \u2013 thank you for taking the question. We\u2019ll stay with the aducanumab theme. I guess the question is twofold. First one, have there been new questions that were raised by the data. I mean we all are familiar with some of the issues you've raised before and how you address them. But essentially as you kind of look on this and as the FDA now has an open BNA [ph] opportunity might have access to the data. Have new questions that have not been raised before raised by this? And second, should we expect you to present any more data from aducanumab during this year and any new analysis that you expect to present before we actually get to see the FDA review? Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Ronny, this is Al. There really are no new questions today. You know, as I said earlier that the data you know, we haven't \u2013come up with nothing that really changes our interpretation of the data. And so I would say that fundamentally there are no big changes and no new questions. And I would also say that we're not planning on presenting anything more publicly at this time, until - hopefully until approval. But that's our plan. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau from Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Phil Nadeau : Morning. Thanks for taking my question. Again, sticking with the aducanumab theme, I guess a two part question. One is, just going back again to what has changed in the Q4 call. It sounded like you had said at that time all that need to happen was some submission of documents and there was no mention of additional type C meetings approved BLA meetings. So I guess, where we all mistaken that you still need to have those meetings and that was always part of the plan or did something come up again kind of asking the same question that prompted the need for those meetings? And then second, I think we were all trying to debate here as is the FDA is interested in aducanumab. I know you said that there's a high level of interest, but could you maybe give us some better sense of the FDAs current appreciation for the data and whether you can determine if there's controversy within the FDA about the quality of the results? Thanks. Michel Vounatsos : Al? Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Phil, this is Al, I just want to say that this is an unusual process. You know, this is unlike anything I've ever been involved with before my 22 years at Biogen. So - and the nature of this process has been collaboration from the very beginning from the type first type C meeting. So it's been a highly collaborative process, I would say and then you know yes, submission of documents is easier to say. But the BLA is pretty complex. There are multiple sections, multiple modules and so I know it sounds easy to pull together submission. But let me tell you it's not. And I think that - and it's been difficult to predict the timing partly because it's been an unusual process right from the beginning and we've always, you know, quite frankly we've been having type C meetings since last June and that hasn't changed actually that the fact that we're doing type C meetings has been the same since the very beginning. So those are the main points. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. Your line is open. Michael Yee : Thanks for the question. And if it hasn't been said before, hope you guys are very safe, you know, we all know how hard it's been hit and everyone in the financial community appreciates it. I guess my question is for Al, you mentioned in the pre-BLA meeting, I know this is coming up. Can you just maybe talk about what type of topics or key questions would be addressed there? And is it safe to say that additional subgroup analyses like positive versus negative and geographical differences, those type of analyses have been done and are all part of this package? Thanks so much. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Well, I would say that geographic issues, subgroup analyses, that\u2019s standard practice for every single BLA I've ever been involved in. In fact, there are sections of the model [ph] that call for looking at data from the various geographies. So that's not - that's not different from any other BLA I've ever been involved in. At a typical pre-BLA meeting you go through - it's more like an operational meeting, you have various sections of the FDA that \u2013 they\u2019re going to be involved in the review of the BLA. You sit down and you talk about how it's going to be submitted. What's going to be submitted exactly, and there's some agreement on the operational aspects of the actual submission. That's the typical pre-BLA meeting. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Jay Olson : All right. Thanks for taking my question. It's great to hear you all well and I want to commend you for the work that you're doing to fight COVID-19. I had a question maybe a little longer term question about aducanumab. And as you begin to contemplate home infusion of TYSABRI, does that set the stage for potential delivery of aducanumab by home infusions and will that be done by Biogen employees or are you going to engage a third party to do that? Thank you. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Well, home infusion - the home infusion of intravenous drugs has been in place for decades. I used to prescribe some drugs by home infusion myself back when I practiced and so it's not uncommon, whether or not it will be done with aducanumab, we haven't disclosed yet, but it would not be something that would be difficult to imagine. It's a - it's a very well the infusions themselves are very well tolerated. So it would not be difficult to imagine that after approval. Michel Vounatsos : Having said that, I think that launching a product in the post-COVID environment would be very interesting to assess, beyond I would say the normality of what we are preparing on many aspects, the ability to meet beyond digital channels face to face, how to engage, but also infusion and much more. And this we are getting ready. There are two dynamic going on, one is managing the lifecycle of well-established product. This is what we are doing, we are doing very well and launching a new product in a COVID environment is a challenge, in a post-COVID its still yet to be assessed. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Evan Seigerman : Hi, all. Thank you for taking the question. I'm actually not going ask on aducanumab. I want to ask one, so yesterday there was an appellate court ruling on the 001 patent for TECFIDERA highlighting a potential launch of the banner monomethyl fumarate. Kind of how should we interpret this ruling? And if you were to lose one or both of the upcoming district court cases on TECFIDERA, how would you act to protect the franchise? Jeffrey Capello : So Evan, this is Jeff. So you know the banner product is not a directly substitutable A/B product. So I think that's the first thing that's important to understand. So if and when it gets launched we don't think there'll be a significant impact at this point in time. And then with regard to the two court cases, obviously we were very pleased to get the favorable ruling from the IPR ruling and I think that's the third time that patent is stood up. So we think we've got a pretty strong patent position. However if we're unsuccessful with either the two district court cases, we've got VUMERITY as a product that we can kind of look at, is a fumarate strategy that we're looking at. We've got growth opportunities around the world in pretty strong results outside the U.S. We think SME has got good growth potential, BBU and then of course you've got the aducanumab potential as well. So you know, I think we\u2019ve got a pretty strong franchise will grow around it. Evan Seigerman : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Cory Kasimov : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, going back to aducanumab, I wanted to better understand what it means to submit modules for your BLA before having that pre-BLA meeting, was this - I guess was this always a rolling BLA submission, was that the intent all along just trying to understand the meaning and having this pre-BLA meeting we didn't think this was going to be necessary as of the last call? Thanks a lot. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Yeah. So Corey, this is Al. I - the common technical document is composed of various modules and there for example quality modules related to manufacturing process. There are non-clinical sections and then there's the clinical sections which culminates in a clinical overview which is - so there are summary documents of the actual study reports of individual clinical studies. And so those are the three main sections. And as you can imagine the non-clinical was you know, it was already kind of ready because not much has been done since - non-clinically since the early days. It still had to put together the actual documentation and so forth. So those are the - those are the sections of the common technical document. They're all submitted electronically and so - and look we had starting in around October or so we did start to contemplate submitting modules as they became available. That was our plan. But at pre-BLA meeting is still pretty common practice, as I said to get both sides Biogen and FDA to be agreed to have agreement on the operational aspects of the of the CPD. So I would not read very much into that as I said, we had planned to have that meeting from the very beginning. Joe Mara : We probably have time for about two more questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Matthew Harrison : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Sorry to stay on aducanumab, but I'm really struggling with the commentary that you're giving this morning. So I was hoping maybe you could just talk about one specific thing. I mean I think your prior guidance was that you would have a filing in early 2020 and today you're talking about a 3Q filing which seems like a significant delay to me, yet your characterization seems like nothing has changed and you know sort of all of your expectations are in line. So it seems like there's a significant disconnect with the timeline versus your commentary and I'm just hoping you can maybe take a moment to explain to us what has happened. Thanks. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: So our goal right from the very beginning was to try to provide estimates of timing of this filing since actually the announcement in October. But the timing is always not easy to predict. And in fact, as I said before this is an unusual process, so it's even harder to predict timing when you have a process that actually is pretty unusual and in my experience unique. I would just say that the constructive engagement though has been there since the very beginning that continues. These type C meetings are formal ways to have engagement with FDA, pre-BLA meeting is another formal meeting with FDA to continue on the path to approval. We have an open BLA and yes there's is a - we said early 2020, so now it's Q3, we did have some impact from COVID, but I would say that overall what we're saying is that the potential for approval we're still on track with that. Operator : And our next and final question for the day will come from the line of Carter Gould from Barclays. Your line is open. Carter Gould : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question and squeezing me in. I guess maybe different spin on the aducanumab question. Obviously we got Gantenerumab data, a DIAN-TU data in the quarter. Al, can you maybe provide your perspective on the appropriateness of reading through from the lack of cognitive benefit in that study to aducanumab and if these data have in any way kind of changed the conversations with FDA? Thank you. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Thanks, Carter. First of all, I want to congratulate Randy Bateman and all the investigators in DIAN-TU. I think it's a beautiful study. It's very hard to do because although they are - it's a homogeneous population in terms of they all have autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease from the genetic and biological point of view, it's pretty heterogeneous in terms of clinical, they could be two decades, one decade, a few years prior to becoming symptomatic. So how do you pull data from that heterogeneous clinical collection? Also it's a relatively small study, 50 patients per arm I believe roughly. So the DIAN-TUlooked at both Solanezumab and Gantenerumab. Solanezumab had no change in amyloid PET based on imaging. And there was no effect. So that's not too surprising. Gantenerumab did have an effect on amyloid PET. However, I want to compare the magnitude of the effect between Gantenerumab and aducanumab. And the only way to do that really is to use the centiloid scale. The whole point of the centiloid was developed so that you can compare cross studies because people use PET ligands, people have different reference regions that they use to obtain the SUVR score. In the PRIME study, 10 milligrams per kilogram of aducanumab was associated with a change in the centiloid scale of about 57 in one year, in the DIAN-TU study, Gantenerumab was associated with a change from baseline of about 14 centiloid units over four years. So I think that's pretty different. And we were trying to make at the CTAD meeting is that dose matters and that the robustness of amyloid removal matters and we saw that in the data and I think we presented that. So in some ways I looked down at the DIAN-TU data and I think it kind of confirms what we have been saying that you have to have high doses and robust removal of amyloid in order to see a clinical benefit. Joe Mara : I\u2019ll turn it over to Michel for some closing comments. Thanks, everybody. Michel Vounatsos : So thank you all for attending the call. I would like to say that even if personally affected by this terrible pandemic, Biogen is demonstrating superb resilience. Biogen is even stronger today and we are well-positioned for the future starting with aducanumab, but also looking forward to all the important readouts in the coming period. Joe Mara : Thank you, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Second Quarter 2020 Financial Results and Business Update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Joe Mara, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Joe Mara : Good morning, and welcome to Biogen's second quarter 2020 earnings call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2, and Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results and our GAAP to non-GAAP financial guidance. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We\u2019ve also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Al Sandrock, EVP, Research and Development; and our CFO, Jeff Capello. Now, I will turn the call over to Michel. Michel Vounatsos : Good morning everyone. And thank you for joining us. With a focus on strong execution, we have continued to serve patients, advance our strategic priorities and delivered another strong financial quarter. Let me begin with some important developments. First, we have completed our submission for US approval of aducanumab, an unprecedented opportunity for patients and for Biogen to potentially bring to market the first therapy to reduce the devastating clinical decline and meaningfully change the cause of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. I am incredibly proud of the Biogen\u2019s team for their dedication and tireless work leading to the completion of our regulatory submission on July 7. This submission followed ongoing collaboration with the FDA and includes data from a comprehensive clinical development program, including EMERGE, the first positive Phase III study ever in this space. Together with supporting data from the Phase III ENGAGE study and positive results from the Phase Ib PRIME study. Our data show that aducanumab may help to both reduce the decline of cognitive function and help patients\u2019 ability to perform certain activities of daily living, which for some patients may result in independence for a longer period of time. In terms of next steps, we anticipate receiving a response from the FDA within 60 days from the submission date, notifying us if the submission has been accepted, and if accepted whether we have been granted priority review, we plan to communicate both of these decisions via a press release. We have progressed in our US launch readiness, including increasing our medical engagement with experts and thought leaders to better assess how aducanumab could potentially impact clinical practice. We have started to make progress engaging with payers and defining aducanumab\u2019s value proposition, and we have now established a cross-functional team dedicated to site readiness, which is currently operational. Outside the US, we made significant progress this quarter. We had formal meetings with the EU regulators as we prepare to submit the filing and we are beginning to ramp up our launch readiness efforts in Europe. In Japan, we had informal regulatory interaction and are preparing for formal consultation with the PMDA. Overall, together with our collaboration partner Eisai, we remain optimistic about the prospect of bringing aducanumab to market as the first therapy to meaningfully change the course of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. And we have continued to progress in our market preparation and launch readiness with an initial focus on the US. We believe that aducanumab marks the beginning of an era of new potential treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and we aim to build a broad franchise across multiple targets and modalities. This includes BAN2401 in Phase III, which we are collaborating on with Eisai, including a new study in preclinical Alzheimer\u2019s. Multiple programs targeting tau and our collaboration with Sangamo to develop gene regulation therapies for a range of neurological indications, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease. We believe Biogen is uniquely positioned to lead the fight in Alzheimer\u2019s disease over both the short and the long term. Second, we are disappointed in the recent court decision in West Virginia regarding our patent for TECFIDERA. We are appealing the decision and intend to vigorously defend our IP. No matter what the final outcome will be, we still believe Biogen is well positioned for shareholder value creation as we work to capitalize on growth opportunities in our core business and [Technical Difficulty] uniquely positioned and the time is now for Biogen to lead in the evolution of this space. We have a deep pipeline of 29 clinical assets, including seven in Phase III or filed and seven mid-to-late stage data readouts by the end of 2021, with near-term value creation opportunities beyond Alzheimer\u2019s disease in other important areas, such as ALS, ophthalmology, lupus and stroke. Third, as we announced yesterday, Jeff will be stepping down as CFO in August. I\u2019d like to thank Jeff for his many contributions to the company, including establishing a very strong team, helping to deliver consistent results quarter-over-quarter, strengthening our finance processes and operations and creating a disciplined cost management culture. We are pleased that Jeff will be staying on for a brief period to ensure a seamless transition. We wish him well in his future endeavor. I will now review our Q2 performance and progress against our strategic priorities. Compared to the same period a year ago, second quarter revenues grew 2% to $3.7 billion. Second quarter GAAP earnings per share grew 22% to $9.59 and non-GAAP EPS grew 12% to $10.28. Importantly, we saw improved momentum in June following an impact from COVID-19 earlier in the quarter. First, Q2 MS revenues, including OCREVUS royalties, were $2.3 billion. The number of patients on our MS product globally increased 3% versus the prior year and our business continued to demonstrate resilience. We saw strong market share performance for our MS portfolio this quarter with increased share of new prescriptions in the US and stabilized market share in Europe. Overall, our fumarate products had a strong quarter as we focused on maximizing the potential for TECFIDERA and VUMERITY combined. Although we were disappointed in the performance for VUMERITY, it\u2019s important to note that the MS market in the US has been significantly impacted by lower new patient starts and switches due to COVID-19, as well as reduced engagement with physicians, which have both impacted the launch of VUMERITY. Importantly, we believe the market is increasingly aware that VUMERITY is clearly differentiated in terms of better GI tolerability and may represent a better treatment alternative for many MS patients. Going forward, our strategic focus is now on VUMERITY, and we are increasing our resource allocation to maximize this next-generation fumarate. We are hopeful that this approach combined with the potential recovery in the dynamic portion of the market will help improve VUMERITY\u2019s trajectory in the second half of the year. Outside of the US, this quarter, we were very pleased to have submitted regulatory filing for VUMERITY in Canada and Switzerland and we plan to file in the EU by the end of this year. A critical part of our strategy in MS is and will continue to be investing in lifecycle management and innovative new approaches to help address the remaining unmet medical needs. We look forward to the readout of opicinumab this year, which could represent transformative new approaches slowing or even potentially reversing disability progression through remyelination. In addition to opicinumab, we continue to advance BIIB061 and overall remyelination therapy and BIIB091, an oral BTK inhibitor with potentially best-in-class profile, and we believe these important assets will bolster our broad portfolio of treatments for MS going forward. Across our current MS products, our focus on lifecycle management is a high priority. We recently filed for approval of a subcutaneous formulation [Technical Difficulty] both US and EU to offer a competitive dosing profile in the high efficacy space. We continue to advance the potential use of extended interval dosing for TYSABRI. We are advancing an intramuscular formulation of PLEGRIDY to potentially improve its tolerability profile, and we are leveraging label updates regarding the use of interferon during pregnancy. We remain committed to MS. And regardless of the outcome of the TECFIDERA litigation, we are focused on maximizing the broad opportunities we have with both present and future product offerings. Second, SPINRAZA. SPINRAZA generated second quarter global revenues of $495 million, a 1% increase versus the prior year. We are pleased with this performance in light of dosing delays due to COVID-19, which peaked in mid-April and began to normalize in May and June. Including the expanded access program and clinical trials, over 11,000 patients are being treated with SPINRAZA, an increase of 30% versus the prior year. This quarter, we presented important new data at the virtual Cure SMA meeting, showing an unprecedented benefit on survival for pre-symptomatic SMA patients treated with SPINRAZA. Data from the NURTURE study continue to demonstrate the compelling benefits SPINRAZA can provide to patients. This follows the publication of independent real-world data earlier this year, demonstrating the clinically meaningful benefits SPINRAZA can deliver for teens and adults, which represent the largest portion of the market. SPINRAZA continues to be the only therapy approved for SMA patients of all ages with clinically meaningful and sustained efficacy across all age groups. We recently announced our plans to initiate a new clinical study, evaluating the safety and efficacy of SPINRAZA when administered to infants following gene therapy. We believe there is a strong scientific rationale and a high need to evaluate the potential added benefit of SPINRAZA in this population. We have seen real-world demand for SPINRAZA in this setting with 40% of patients in the long-term extension of the Phase I study of gene therapy going on to receive SPINRAZA. Further, in our lifecycle management in SMA, we are also investigating whether higher dose of SPINRAZA could result in even greater efficacy through the DEVOTE study. Third, biosimilars revenues for the second quarter were $172 million as we observed an impact from COVID-19, particularly early in the quarter. We estimate that our biosimilars generated approximately \u20ac1.8 billion of savings to the European healthcare systems in 2019, which we expect will continue to increase in 2020. This is important as we work to create financial headroom for innovation and contribute to the long-term sustainability of the healthcare systems. In addition, Samsung Bioepis recently initiated a Phase III study for our potential biosimilar referencing EYLEA as we work to expand into ophthalmology and additional geographies, including Japan and the US. Fourth, beyond Alzheimer\u2019s disease, we continue to progress our pipeline. We initiated a new Phase I study in movement disorders. We presented positive first-in-class data for BIIB059 in cutaneous lupus erythematosus and the positive Phase I/II results for tofersen in SOD1-ALS were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Fifth, our cash flow generation remains strong and continue to provide us with significant optionality and flexibility to allocate capital. In Q2, we generated approximately $2 billion in cash flow from operations. We have $5.3 billion in cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet, providing us with the financial flexibility to continue to evaluate external business development and M&A opportunities. As we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to maximizing returns for our shareholders as we aim to bring innovative therapies to patients, something that demands a thoughtful approach towards all our investment over both the short and the long term. In summary, Biogen has continued to execute well on our strategy, including the recent BLA submission for aducanumab in the US. While we are mindful of the potential risk to TECFIDERA, we believe we are well positioned as we continue to build a multi-franchise portfolio, leveraging the interconnectivity of our deep neuroscience pipeline. We expect seven important mid-to-late stage readouts by end of next year and we have several opportunities for meaningful value creation in areas of high unmet medical need beyond Alzheimer\u2019s, including ALS, ophthalmology, lupus and stroke, as well as continued innovation in MS and SMA. I will now turn the call over to Al for a more detailed update on our recent progress in R&D. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Thank you, Michel. And good morning everyone. I would like to start by thanking the Biogen team for their hard work as they continue to advance our R&D programs during these challenging times. Although some uncertainty remains on the impact that COVID-19 is having on our studies, I\u2019m pleased that the majority of our clinical trials are currently on track or only slightly delayed with seven mid-to-late stage readouts expected by the end of next year. Let me now turn to the advances we made across our pipeline in the second quarter. Starting with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. As Michel mentioned, we have completed the BLA submission for aducanumab to the FDA. This submission is based upon EMERGE, the first positive Phase III study for a therapy to reduce clinical decline in Alzheimer\u2019s disease; supporting data from ENGAGE, although this study did not meet its primary endpoint; and positive results from the Phase Ib PRIME study. We participated in a pre-BLA meeting with the FDA. During which, the agency reiterated that submitting a BLA based on data from EMERGE, ENGAGE and PRIME was reasonable. We look forward to working with the FDA during their review and continuing our engagement with other regulators around the world. I want to congratulate the team for achieving this important milestone in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis. We also continue to develop a broader Alzheimer\u2019s disease portfolio and believe we are well positioned for sustained leadership in this disease area. Part of this strategy includes expanding into even earlier patient populations with a goal of delaying or perhaps even preventing the clinical onset of the disease. To that end, our collaboration partner Eisai, in conjunction with the Alzheimer\u2019s Clinical Trials Consortium announced initiation of the AHEAD 345 clinical study to evaluate BAN2401 in individuals with preclinical Alzheimer\u2019s disease. These individuals have intermediate or elevated levels of amyloid in their brain. Together, the A3 and A45 studies will evaluate whether early administration of BAN2401 can suppress the progression of amyloid and tau pathology and reduce cognitive decline in the very early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The results of the BAN2401 Phase II study, as well as the similarities between BAN2401 and aducanumab give us reason to be optimistic regarding the ongoing Phase III study for BAN2401 in early Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Beyond amyloid beta, we continue to advance several programs aimed at different drug targets, including tau, which when misfolded is the principal constituent of neurofibrillary tangle, a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s pathology. The accumulation and spread of misfolded tau in the brain correlates with disease progression and may make it amenable to clearance via antibody-based approaches, which we believe target extracellular forms of the protein. Our lead tau asset is gosuranemab, a monoclonal antibody currently in a Phase II study in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This study is fully enrolled with data expected in the first half of next year. In addition to gosuranemab, we also have BIIB076, a distinct anti-tau antibody in Phase I. We are also advancing our ASO-targeting tau BIIB080, which may reduce the synthesis of all forms of the protein, both intracellular and extracellular. Moving to our MS portfolio, we continue to advance a number of initiatives aimed at further unlocking the value of our existing franchise. To that end, we presented new data across our MS portfolio at the AAN meeting in May. Among the data presented were new data on TYSABRI, which supported previous findings that extended interval dosing is associated with a lower incidence of PML, and may maintain comparable efficacy as assessed by serum neurofilament light biomarkers. The efficacy of extended interval dosing as compared to the standard dosing regimen is being accessed prospectively in the ongoing NOVA study, which has an expected readout in the first half of next year. In addition, we are pursuing what we hope will be transformative approaches in MS. The most advanced asset in our MS pipeline is opicinumab or anti-LINGO, which is a potential first-in-class remyelination agent to promote neuronal repair and potentially reverse disability in MS. The safety and efficacy of opicinumab as an add-on to existing disease-modifying therapies in MS is currently being evaluated in the Phase IIb AFFINITY trial. AFFINITY takes advantage of data from the prior SYNERGY Phase II study in MS and a subsequent post-hoc analysis to identify what we believe are additional criteria needed to identify the right patients, the right dose and the right measurements to assess the therapeutic potential of opicinumab. We also have an oral remyelination agent BIIB061 in Phase I that has a target distinct from that of anti-LINGO. Additionally, we have BIIB091, a small molecule BTK inhibitor in Phase I. We believe that BIIB091\u2019s highly potent and selective non-covalent inhibition of BTK may make it a best-in-class molecule. Turning to neuromuscular disorders, we presented an update on the ongoing NURTURE study at the Cure SMA meeting this last month. NURTURE, which is the long study ever done on the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients with SMA, evaluates nusinersen in infants who had initiated treatment shortly after birth and prior to the onset of symptoms. The new analysis showed that all 25% or 100% of children up to 4.8 years of age were alive and remain free of permanent ventilation, with 88% walking independently and 96% able to walk with assistance. We are pleased to report that the US label of nusinersen was recently updated to include the additional data gathered in the NURTURE study. In ALS, the results from the Phase I/II trial of tofersen in patients with genetic ALS due to mutations in SOD1 were published in the New England Journal of Medicine this month. This study showed promising signs of efficacy across multiple clinical and biomarker endpoints. We are encouraged by these results and look forward to the results of the ongoing Phase III VALOR study, which is expected to read out late next year. We believe that the tofersen results have positive implications for our other assets for ALS, including BIIB078 for ALS due to mutations and C9orf, the most common genetic cause of the disease, as well as our program targeting ataxin-2. Next, I would like to turn to the encouraging progress we are making in lupus. Last month, at the European College of Rheumatology meeting, we presented results from our Phase II LILAC study, evaluating the safety and efficacy of BIIB059, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody targeting BDCA2 in individuals with active cutaneous lupus erythematosus or CLE with or without systemic manifestations. BIIB059 treatment resulted in a dose response on the CLASI-A score, a well-defined and reliable outcome measure to detect CLE skin disease activity. Specifically, study participants with CLE treated with BIIB059 showed statistically significant reductions in CLASI-A score at week 16 versus placebo with a p-value on the primary endpoint of less than 0.001. BIIB059 was discovered and developed by Biogen scientists and has the potential to be the first anti-BDCA2 antibody for the treatment of lupus. We plan to initiate a Phase III program for BIIB059 in the first half of next year. In collaboration with our partner UCB, we aim to start in Q3 of this year the Phase III program for dapirolizumab pegol in patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus despite being treated by standard of care therapies. This Phase III program follows promising results from the Phase IIb clinical trial; of which, interim results were presented at EULAR in June of 2019. Together with BIIB059 and dapirolizumab, both in late-stage development, we are well positioned to potentially build a meaningful franchise in lupus, a disease in which patients need better treatment options. Turning to ophthalmology, we continue to advance our gene therapy programs for inherited retinal disorders, including BIIB111 for choroideremia and BIIB112 for X-linked retinitis pigmentosa, both diseases with no approved treatments. We expect data from the Phase III study of BIIB111 in the first half of next year. Importantly, this represents our next pivotal readout and our next potential commercial product after aducanumab. We also expect data from the Phase II/III study of BIIB112 in the first half of 2021. We are pleased to have entered into a licensing agreement with Massachusetts Eye and Ear infirmary to develop a potential treatment for inherited retinal degeneration due to mutations in the PRPF31 gene, which are among the most common causes for autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. In summary, we continue to progress a broad and deep pipeline focused on neuroscience aimed at capitalizing on the breaking science, including the advancements in imaging, CSF and blood-based biomarkers and the significant unmet need in this space as we work to create a multi-franchise portfolio. Through the end of next year, we have a significant number of expected mid-to-late stage readouts across a diverse set of important therapeutic areas, including MS, ALS, ophthalmology, Parkinson\u2019s disease, stroke and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. We believe that our pipeline will be a source of sustained innovation to help drive long-term growth of the company. I will now pass the call to Jeff. Jeffrey Capello : Thanks, Al. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased that Biogen had another strong quarter despite the COVID-19 challenges as we continued to execute well. We remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial capacity to continue to grow the business over the long term. I will now review our financial performance in the quarter and provide an update to our full-year guidance. Total revenues for the second quarter grew 2% year-over-year to $3.7 billion. As a reminder, we believe that the Q1 2020 revenues included a benefit of approximately $100 million attributed to accelerated sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic, of which, we believe $75 million approximately was utilized in the second quarter of this year. Overall, we executed well in our MS business, delivering revenues of $2.3 billion in the second quarter, including OCREVUS royalties of $208 million, declining 2% versus the prior year. Global MS revenues in the second quarter decreased 4% versus the prior year without OCREVUS royalties. Importantly, in the current COVID-19 environment, we believe our MS products are well positioned versus the competition based on treatment guidelines from the MS International Federation. US MS revenues, excluding OCREVUS, were approximately flat versus the prior year. We were very encouraged to see growth in share of new prescriptions TYSABRI and interferon within the quarter despite the recent increase in competition. Outside the US, our MS revenues were $615 million, a decline of 11% versus the prior year, due in part to a negative effect of foreign exchange rates of approximately $35 million. In addition, we believe that the first quarter 2020 MS revenues outside the US included a benefit of approximately $59 million attributed to accelerated sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic, of which, we believe approximately $37 million was utilized in the second quarter. Importantly, outside the US, we drove strong patient growth of 7% as our leading MS therapies continued to be very well received. Global second quarter fumarate revenues, including both TECFIDERA and VUMERITY, increased 3% versus the prior year, driven by revenue growth in the US. In the US, fumarate revenue grew 6% versus the prior year. US fumarate revenues were impacted by an increase in channel inventory of approximately $15 million in the second quarter 2020, compared to a decrease of approximately $15 million in the second quarter of last year. Second quarter VUMERITY revenue was $9 million, and we now have access and reimbursement for the vast majority of commercial lives covered. Within the US, we were pleased to see strong execution with growth in our share of both new and total prescriptions for the fumarates versus the prior quarter. As Michel mentioned, we are increasing our resource allocation for VUMERITY and it\u2019s important to note that COVID-19 is impacting overall new prescription volumes in the US, making new product launches more challenging, including for VUMERITY. Outside the US, TECFIDERA second quarter 2020 revenues declined by 4% with demand growth offset by price and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. We believe that Q1 2020 TECFIDERA revenues outside the US included a benefit of approximately $28 million attributed to accelerated sales through the COVID-19 pandemic, of which, we believe approximately $17 million was utilized in Q2 2020. Importantly, the number of TECFIDERA patients outside the US grew by approximately 12% versus prior year, driven by approximately double-digit patient growth across Europe and approximately 38% patient growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific combined. Q2 global interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, decreased 13% versus Q2 2019, due to continued shift from the injectable platforms to oral or high-efficacy therapies. In the US, interferon revenues decreased 9% versus the prior year. However, we were pleased to see growth in share of new prescriptions and stable share of total prescriptions in the second quarter; something we have not seen in some time as we have continued to see increased interest in the interferons since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Outside the US, interferon revenues decreased by 22% versus the prior year. We believe that the first quarter 2020 interferon revenues outside the US included a benefit of approximately $21 million attributed to accelerated sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Of which, we believe approximately $15 million was utilized in the second quarter of this year. TYSABRI worldwide revenues decreased by 9% versus the second quarter of 2019. In the US, TYSABRI revenues decreased 8% versus the prior year, which we estimate is equally impacted by inventory dynamics and the impact of COVID-19 given delays in dosing at infusion sites. Within the US, we were pleased to see roughly stable adjusted volumes and share of new prescriptions versus the prior quarter. Outside the US, TYSABRI revenues decreased by 11% versus the prior year, negatively impacted by approximately $12 million due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates as well as channel dynamics. In addition, we believe that Q1 2020 TYSABRI revenues outside the US included a benefit of approximately $7 million attributed to accelerated sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic, of which, we believe approximately $5 million was utilized in the second quarter 2020. Importantly, outside the US, we were pleased to see continued patient growth of 5% for TYSABRI versus the prior year. We believe TYSABRI is well positioned to play an increasingly important role in MS treatment with several important initiatives, including pursuing TYSABRI subcutaneous administration, the potential for extended interval dosing and an option for home infusion. Overall, we were pleased with the execution of our MS franchise and the continued strong performance of our MS business in the second quarter. We remain focused on maximizing the resilience of our market-leading franchise. Let me now move on to SPINRAZA. Global second quarter SPINRAZA revenues increased 1% versus the prior year to $495 million. In the US, revenues decreased 9% versus the second quarter 2019 and decreased 11% versus the first quarter 2020. The number of patients on therapy in the US increased by 6% as compared to the prior year and decreased slightly versus the prior quarter as we believe COVID-19 had an impact on new patient starts. Although the US SPINRAZA business was impacted by COVID-19 in the second quarter, we were pleased with our overall execution as we saw more centers come back online and most patients continue to receive their therapy, though with some dosing delays. We saw strong improvement in maintenance doses in June and exited the quarter with good momentum. Outside the US, SPINRAZA revenues increased 10% versus the second quarter of 2019, demonstrating strong performance despite the impact of COVID-19, broad growth across all major regions of the world with an increased number of countries contributing as we continue this very successful product launch. Importantly, we are encouraged that the recently-published independent real-world data on the use of SPINRAZA in adults has helped us to secure broader reimbursement for older patients in certain European markets. Overall, we were pleased with SPINRAZA\u2019s performance in the second quarter despite the challenges of COVID-19. Importantly, we now estimate that there are over 60,000 patients with SMA in global markets. And we expect to commercialize significantly higher than our previous estimate of 45,000. We see continued opportunities for growth for this well-established product given the efficacy of SPINRAZA and the strength of our real-world evidence coupled with a significant number of untreated patients across many established and emerging markets. Let me now move onto our biosimilars business, which generated $172 million this quarter, decreasing by 7%, partially due to market dynamics due to COVID-19. We believe that the first quarter 2020 biosimilar revenues included a benefit of approximately $15 million attributed to accelerated sales due to COVID-19 pandemic, of which, we believe approximately $9 million was utilized in Q2 2020. Q2 biosimilars revenues were also negatively impacted by a relatively higher slowdown in new treatment for immunology patients as a result of COVID-19, impacting both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter comparisons. We estimate there are now approximately 215,000 patients using our biosimilars in Europe. BENEPALI remains the Number one prescribed Enbrel biosimilar across the major EU5 markets. FLIXABI volumes grew 58% versus the prior year, and IMRALDI volumes grew 46% versus the prior year. Despite our biosimilars business being impacted by COVID-19 within the quarter, we have the opportunity to continue to grow both in Europe, as well as potentially within the US and other geographies with our additional assets. Total anti-CD20 revenues in the second quarter decreased by 17% versus the prior year with increased OCREVUS royalties offset by decreased revenues from RITUXAN due to COVID-19 dynamics and continued erosion from biosimilars. Total other revenues in the second quarter increased 155%, excuse me, versus the prior year, due primarily to approximately $330 million in revenues related to the license of certain manufacturing-related intellectual property to one of our corporate partners, which impacted contract manufacturing revenues. Note, this was a previously-anticipated transaction in 2020. Let me now turn to gross margins. Q2 2020 gross margin was 89%, an improvement versus 87% in the prior year, due to higher margin contract manufacturing revenue and improved versus the prior quarter. Q2 GAAP R&D expense was 18% of revenue and non-GAAP was 15% of revenue. In the second quarter, we recorded a GAAP expense of $208 million and non-GAAP R&D expense of $125 million, both related to our collaboration with Sangamo Therapeutics. Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A were both 15% of revenue. We still expect SG&A to increase in the second half of the year as we ramp up our commercial preparations for aducanumab. Q2 GAAP other income was $63 million, which included $103 million in unrealized gains on investments, principally driven by an increase in the fair value of our equity investments in Ionis Pharmaceuticals and Sangamo. Q2 non-GAAP other expense was $30 million. In Q2 this year, our effective GAAP tax rate was approximately 22%, an increase from approximately 14% in the second quarter of 2019. This is due to a non-recurring prior year income tax benefit on a change in our tax profile and a current year income tax expense related to a net valuation allowance. For the second quarter of 2020, our effective non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 19%, an increase from approximately 14% in the second quarter of 2019, primarily due to the non-recurring benefit of the prior-year change in our tax profile. We repurchased approximately 9 million shares in the second quarter at an average price of $313 for a total value of approximately $2.8 billion. As of the end of the second quarter, approximately $1.3 billion was remaining under the share repurchase program authorized in December 2019, which now brings us to our diluted earnings per share. In the second quarter, we booked GAAP EPS of $9.59, an increase of 22% versus the prior year and non-GAAP earnings per share of $10.26, a 12% increase versus the prior year. We generated approximately $1.95 billion in net cash flows from operations in the second quarter. We ended the quarter with $5.3 billion in cash and marketable securities and $7 billion in debt. Let me now turn to our updated full-year guidance for 2020. Due to the many factors potentially impacting the intellectual property situation for TECFIDERA, our updated guidance does not include any operational impact from potential generic entry this year. With that assumption in mind, we expect revenues of approximately $13.8 billion to $14.2 billion. We anticipate GAAP R&D expense to be approximately 16% to 17% of total revenues. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A expense to be approximately 17.5% to 18.5% of total revenues. We anticipate our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 18.5% to 19.5% and our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 18% to 19%. We anticipate full-year 2020 GAAP diluted earnings per share results of $32 to $34 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $34 and $36. It\u2019s important to note that this guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions as both are very hard to predict. Our guidance assumes a stable share count off the second quarter of 2020 and no change to foreign exchange rates. Before I conclude, I would like to say that I have truly enjoyed working as a CFO of Biogen. I\u2019m proud of what I have been able to contribute and I believe Biogen is in a stronger position for long-term shareholder value creation with multiple opportunities ahead of it. I wish the best of luck to the entire Biogen team moving forward. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you so much, Jeff. Biogen continued to demonstrate strong execution this quarter. We again delivered solid financial results, made strong progress advancing our strategy of building a multi-franchise portfolio and importantly one step closer to a potential approval for aducanumab as the first therapy to reduce clinical decline in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. I want to reiterate our commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders and bringing innovative therapies to patients now and over the long term. This requires that we continue to allocate capital efficiently, effectively and appropriately, as we have demonstrated in the past we will always strive to have an optimal capital structure as well as aim for superior returns from the investments we make. Finally, our organization takes it very seriously the recent racial injustice events and the considerable health inequity that still exists as highlighted by the COVID-19 crisis. Now more than ever, we are focused on advancing our broader purpose as an organization as we aim to pioneer science for the betterment of humanity. This includes doing the right thing for patients, our employees, the environment and the community; all of which we believe contribute to long-term sustainable shareholder value. This also includes accelerating our efforts in diversity and inclusion across the organization Biogen was already taking a leading position from hiring to the way we conduct clinical trials and working to ensure that the most vulnerable have access to our therapies. I am proud of what Biogen stands for and I believe this approach positions us well to be a sustainable organization over the long term as we remain focused on being the leader in neuroscience to address the tremendous societal needs in this space. Again, I would like to thank our employees around the world who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patients\u2019 lives, including ensuring access to our therapies during these challenging times. With that, we will open the call for questions. Joe Mara : As a reminder, we would appreciate if you can limit yourself to one question as there are a number of analysts on the call. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Cory Kasimov : Hey, great. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Let me say Jeff it's been great working with you at Biogen. So my question is toward the recently announced Phase III pre-symptomatic Alzheimer study. Can you elaborate on the rationale of choosing BAN2401 over aducanumab? I guess what about that - how has that made it more attractive to initially move into the study? Is it the lack of required dose titrations or something else? Thanks a lot. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Cory, this is Al Sandrock. I actually heard every third word of your question. So I'm not sure, but I think you were asking about BAN2401 in preclinical Alzheimer's disease and perhaps comparisons to aducanumab. If that's true, then I would say that, yes, BAN2401 and aducanumab are very similar antibodies. They both prefer to bind to aggregated forms of a-beta and they both show robust effect on amyloid PET imaging and also both have shown a reduction in clinical decline in Phase II or Phase 1 and Phase III trials. We have - we're very excited that our partners at Eisai are initiating this clinical study with the Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials Consortium. I believe that starting earlier is the best approach for - it turns out for all these neurological diseases and so we look forward to seeing the results of that. I'm not sure I heard your question but I hope I answered it. Michel Vounatsos : So we did support the preclinical study with BAN2401 while we focused on the filing for aducanumab. We will revert back on lifecycle management opportunities during the entire continuum of the disease for patients once we have a readout and answer from the FDA on how we move forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Jeff also want to say it's been great working with you. Another one on aducanumab. I know the next decision is - the next step is a decision from FDA. But when you look at ENGAGE versus EMERGE, just wondering if you could go into any detail of the analysis over, say, the past six months to nine months that you guys have done with the FDA, whether that could be published or at a medical conference or anything that you can share with us in terms of what the developments have been over the past pretty much six - since the beginning of this year. Thank you. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: So Geoff, just to make sure we get the gist of your question, you are asking more about the timing over the next few months? Geoff Meacham : No, no, just the quality of the analysis and the details of the data analysis for aducanumab in support of the filing. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Well, I'm not sure I heard your question, Geoff. But I think - look the filing is based on these studies; EMERGE, ENGAGE and PRIME. EMERGE is the first study to show an effect, not only on the primary endpoint but all three pre-specified secondary endpoints. We believe that data from ENGAGE, that portions of the data from ENGAGE, a negative study, that portions of it do support the analysis that we did with EMERGE, and then - and also PRIME, which was published shows even though the clinical endpoints were exploratory endpoints on the highest dose, there was an effect on MMSE, as well as CDR-Sum of Boxes. And again very similar that the lower doses did not show much of an effect. So consistent with the findings from ENGAGE and EMERGE, you really need to get to the higher dose. And I think our data are all consistent with that. Geoff Meacham : Okay. Thanks, Al. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Umer Raffat : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess if I may focus on TECFIDERA, VUMERITY for a second. Michel, you mentioned you're working on two lifecycle management programs for PLEGRIDY and TYSABRI, but I feel like the most important lifecycle management program that's been on the market for a few months but has been a complete laggard has been VUMERITY. And my question is, why is that and why is almost every single precedent on lifecycle management capturing well above 25% share and up to 80%. I would just love to hear your take on commercial perspective on what happened on this? Michel Vounatsos : Yeah, thank you for the question. And I share the disappointment for the performance to date on VUMERITY and you can anticipate that based on the patent life that we have, we are working on lifecycle management opportunities for the long run. We did launch VUMERITY in December and we had encouraging platforms start forms and then COVID came, and this impacted significantly the patients' new starts and the switches. So we did not anticipate when we launched in December that three months down the road, there will be COVID. And at that time, you will remember because you asked few times the question, the strategy was not a switch strategy, it was a fumarate strategy to enhance the share of the fumarates and the results are not bad. But this is not an excuse for the lack of performance to date of VUMERITY, for which the US organization is all over it. So what it shows is that it's difficult, it's challenging to launch. When there is a shutdown, it is challenging to change your behavior when you cannot meet the prescriber. Having said that, now the entire focus is pivoting on VUMERITY, and this is the good time because we have a very good access, close to 90%. We increased significantly the resource allocation. This is a next-generation fumarate with good data. Fumarate is differentiated as you know in terms of GI tolerability. It doesn't mean that all the patients on TECFIDERA could benefit from VUMERITY because those who are stable should stay on TECFIDERA, but it is a significantly enhanced focus of the organization on one brand, VUMERITY, the new generation fumarate and the next month should speak. So, we don't give up, and you should not. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with SVB Leerink. Marc Goodman : Yes, good morning. Jeff, I was wondering if you could talk about the SG&A guidance. It looks like it's $300 million less than it was before. There has been no change in the ramp-up in your spend commitment for adu in the second half of the year. So, where are the cuts coming from? Thanks. Jeffrey Capello : Thanks, Marc. So, in this pandemic, we've found that - obviously, there's much less travel going on, much less conferences, meetings and other discretionary spend. And so, the vast majority of that difference in guidance is due to the fact that we have significant savings in the second quarter, and we anticipate that those savings will continue in the back half of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jay Olson with Oppenheimer. Jay Olson : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Since you submitted the aducanumab BLA in a modular fashion, can you comment on whether the FDA began enrolling review of those modules or if they waited until the entire BLA submission was completed before initiating their review? Thank you. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Well, I don't want to comment on FDA's internal processes. It's true that we did submit modules as they became available to submit. And so, they've had some modules for some months now. But whether or not they reviewed them? I don't, you know. That's FDA internal processes and I can't comment on it. Jay Olson : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Michael Yee : Hey, good morning. Thanks, and congrats on the progress, particularly, Al, with the filing. Those were unprecedented. Maybe, Al, can you just comment on a simple question about how you think about priority review and whether or not there is any reason it would not be and whether or not you guys logically used a voucher? And then you made a nice comment about Europe, how you're preparing there to file. So, is that actually, you've had a discussion with them, and you've gotten sort of a similar agreement? Just comment there on Europe. Thank you so much. Operator : Speakers, you may be on mute. Joe Mara : I'm not on mute. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a two-part for me. I was just wondering, Jeff, if you can comment on what drove the change to the revenue guidance, anything more specifically? And are you assuming SPINRAZA is going to grow in the back half of the year? And then I was wondering more broadly, maybe a question for Al. If you can confirm that IQVIA was the CRO for the ADU Phase III trials? I'm just wondering how involved the company was in the filing process and if they were party to the discussions with the FDA? Thank you. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Hi, this is Al Sandrock. I'm not sure Michael heard my answer previously, so I'm going to repeat it. On the priority review question, we do have a voucher. We received one when we got nusinersen approved. But we haven't commented on how we're going to use it, when we're going to use it. We do expect to hear about whether or not we have priority review at the time the FDA notifies us of the acceptance of the filing, and so we'll leave it at that. In terms of the ex-US regulators, I think that was the second part of your question. We have engaged formally with the EMA, and we were in the process of preparing a filing for the European submission. And we have had also informal interactions with the Japanese regulators, and we're preparing that filing as well. Jeffrey Capello : So, maybe moving to Terence's question on kind of what drove the difference in guidance. I'd point you back to the first quarter where we left guidance the way it was before, even in light of the COVID pandemic and with the view that we wanted to see how things played out. Now, as we sit here at the end of July, we've got a better sense of what the impact was on the second quarter and it was both the unwind of the activity from the first quarter, which we described, plus some headwinds in some businesses still like SPINRAZA and TYSABRI. We expect some of those headwinds to continue into the back half of the year. So, the vast majority of the difference in guidance is due to kind of continued COVID impact, which was difficult to predict when we did the guidance. But I would also point out that we did see a significant strengthening of the business through the months of the second quarter, particularly if you look at US SME business, where April was a very challenging month and then we saw a strengthening in May and then significant strengthening in June. So, another comment would be, we went with a fairly wide range because we're still kind of assessing how quickly it comes back. So, big difference is the COVID impact for the full year with post guidance down, but we did see a strengthening in SPINRAZA, which was encouraging. So, we'll have to see how all of that plays out. And then I think there was a question on IQVIA. Yes, IQVIA was the CRO that helped us to conduct the Phase III trials of aducanumab. However, they were not involved in any of the regulatory interactions that we've had with the FDA. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One Al, could you just clarify on the comment you just made around priority review voucher. It sounds like you're not willing to say whether or not you use it to file for adu. And then secondly, can you just comment on anti-LINGO? What will you view as a positive result from that study or what do you need to see to move that into Phase III? Thanks. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Hi, Matthew. Yes. So, in terms of the prior - it's right, we're not - we're not willing to comment on whether or not we've used our Priority Voucher. And in terms of anti-LINGO, the primary endpoint is the overall response core, which looks - which is a four components score, looking at walking, EDSS and 9-hole Peg Test in the dominant arm and 9-hole Peg Test in a non-dominant arm. So, four components. And we're looking at whether or not patients overall improve. Because as you know, MS affects different parts of the central nervous system and at times you can have improvement in one area and worsening in another. So, we wanted to know whether or not, overall, the patients improved. In addition to that, of course, we're going to be looking at imaging measures related to myelination. So, for example, Magnetization Transfer Ratio, MTR, is a good measure of myelination and we'll be looking at that. So, in addition to the clinical, we'll be looking to see if we have biological measurements that are consistent with myelination. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Ronny Gal : Good morning, everybody. Congratulations on nice results and thank you for taking the question. You have presented before the submission there of aducanumab various of the patients. And you discussed with us the idea that you've done the same and even more advance with the FDA. I was wondering if you can share with us what is the primary patient cut used for the review, is it total set of patients all those who received certain number of high doses versus placebo? And to the extent you can answer that, I was wondering if you can share anything instead, if you're using copay and rebate differences to drive the adoption of VUMERITY going forward or is it just a difference in the educational focus of the organization? Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: So, Ronny, I'll take the first part. So, we submitted all the data from those three studies that I mentioned, EMERGE, ENGAGE and PRIME. And what the FDA chooses to look at is, that's their purview. I will say that in terms of the negative study, ENGAGE, we do - we have analysis that show that those who received the highest dose over a sustained period of time do show evidence of efficacy similar to what we found in EMERGE. And so, that's the data we presented to CTAD and ADPD and that's why we believe there are supportive evidence coming from ENGAGE. Michel Vounatsos : So, concerning the second part of the question on VUMERITY, since the focus now is on VUMERITY not on the fumarate, I can tell you that all levels are aligned, at the payer level, at the patient services level, at the salesforce level - including incentive schemes -- to shape their behavior, at the medical affairs level. So, the organization is absolutely aligned and focused on all of those levers. Next five months will be critical. Ronny Gal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company. Phil Nadeau : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jeff, let me add my well-wishes as you move on to your next opportunity. Thanks for the help over the years. Question for you, Al. In the prepared remarks, you suggested that the FDA in the pre-BLA meeting noted that the submission of aducanumab based on the three studies is reasonable. I'm curious whether you can provide any more detail on the pre-BLA meeting, what topics were discussed, what feedback did you receive and maybe in particular did the FDA indicate whether an Advisory Committee would be likely? Thanks. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Hi. Yes, so, it's our policy not to talk about the content of our regulatory interactions. So, I'm not - I'm not prepared to go any further than what I said in my prepared remarks. In terms of the Advisory Committee, it would not be unusual for the first disease modifying therapy of this type to be reviewed at an Advisory Committee. So, we are starting to prepare for one. Whether or not we have one and when it will be, will be up to the FDA. And we expect to hear that at around the time that we notified of whether or not the files has been accepted. Phil Nadeau : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Tim Anderson : Thank you. I have a question on aducanumab. Tau as a biomarker, which in Alzheimer's has really risen in prominence over the last few years. These are measured as tests, or if you remember, CSF. The amount of tau biomarker data you collected in ENGAGE and EMERGE was quite low in the context of the size of those few trials. And I'm wondering what FDA's feedback has been to you on this in terms of potentially wanting more tau biomarker data? My understanding is that the new EMBARK study, you are capturing tau on everyone. I think that includes tau imaging. So, any commentary on that would be helpful. And then, you guys have been willing to disclose you've asked for priority review. What I haven't heard you talk about is whether you've requested breakthrough therapy designation, which is arguably a better litmus test for how FDA views the data we have. Thank you. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: So, Tim, you're right that tau has risen in prominence as an important biomarker and perhaps drug target in Alzheimer's disease. And that's because if you look at what correlates best with clinical progression, tau accumulation seems to do so. However, our - and our belief is that there is an interaction between amyloid beta and tau. And it's possible that tau could be triggered - tau misfolding and spreading could be triggered by a number of factors, trauma for one. But it could be that amyloid beta also does. And our data would be consistent with that in the sense that when we lowered, we use aducanumab, which is specific for amyloid beta and we see downstream effects on tau, both by imaging and by CSF. And the reason why it's not that many patients is that, first of all, it's hard to convince patients to undergo a lumbar puncture twice or - and also we were introducing a new tau PET imaging ligand, and we're already imaging patients with - for amyloid. So, having to do two PET scans, two different types of PET scans is a lot to ask for patients. But we do think we have adequate data to show a convincing effect on tau, not only in the CSF but also by imaging. And I've now forgotten the second part of your question. Tim Anderson : Breakthrough. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Oh! Breakthrough. Yes, well, we do have fast track status and we expect to hear about a priority review. And with the fast track status., we have the opportunity to engage with FDA. And I'll say that we've-- we very much appreciate the level of engagement we've had, essentially since last June, where we've had a number of constructive, collaborative interactions with FDA. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Brian Abrahams : Hi, there. Thanks so much for taking my question. Question on SPINRAZA and SMA dynamics. What would you guys be looking for out of the new study in combination with gene therapy? Is there any sort of bar from reimbursement perspective that one might expect for a combo use? And then, can you comment on any additional commercial prep or evolution and strategy had a potential entry of an oral? Thanks. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Well, the reason for doing - I'll take the first part, Brian. The reason for doing this study is mainly because, A, clinicians are already doing it, but there's no data from the study on whether or not it's helpful to patients. In fact, the European Journal of Pediatric Neurology just published a consensus statement of European experts in SMA. And they point out that there's a real lack of data on the use of this combination therapy and they called for more studies on it, and so, we're happy to be doing one. And the key question is, do you see improvement beyond what you see with just one therapy alone when you add SPINRAZA to Zolgensma or Zolgensma to SPINRAZA. And so, it's really looking at a motor milestone, whether you maintain them better, whether you gain more and more motor milestones. So, it's really mostly about efficacy. Michel Vounatsos : And I think that it's a very good to help clinicians prioritize which therapeutic option to use based on research and not based on speculation or claims. If you look at the competitive landscape, for realty plans, it's still hard to speculate because there is no labor yet. FIREFISH was pretty consistent, SUNFISH was underwhelming in terms of achieving the objectives. When I speak to scientific leaders, their position is we need to wait for the long-term safety and efficacy profile of the product. And for the gene therapy, I think we have a profile that starts to be well characterized. And if I refer back to the latest consensus published in the European Journal of Pediatric Neurology, there is still uncertainty for the older population behavior, the infant ease. And they see a link with the potential risk to the wait. So, the scientifically those basically encourage at looking at all the options. For Biogen, we stand behind the efficacy and safety of SPINRAZA in all age groups, and we have a larger body of evidence. The product is approved now in 50 countries. So, we believe that SPINRAZA will continue to be really a very good treatment and alternative in this context, where there is a bit more treatment in this market, which is good for the patients. So, we are working to enhance the efficacy by increasing the dose. I'm not sure others can do that. And last but not least, there is the response study after gene therapy. So, I think it's good in order to best educate the market. So, we are confident. Brian Abrahams : Thanks, Michel. Thanks, Al. Joe Mara : We have time for two more questions. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Evan Seigerman with Credit Suisse. Evan Seigerman : Hi, all. Thank you very much for taking my question and congrats on the progress. So, in the press release out last night from Mike's appointment, it was clear that you emphasized his expertise in value creating strategic financial considerations. Should we read this as an evolution to more or larger transformative business development as under Jeff's leadership there was only really one major deal, which was the Nightstar acquisition? Michel Vounatsos : Well, together with Jeff, we delivered on 18 deals. And remember, we believe we have an inequity in the space where we are specialized. So, the sweet spot is early stage. This is where we can add most value. And I am delighted to see this portfolio maturing extremely well with very important readouts in the coming 12 months and beyond, that will start to impact the market 2024, 2025. And in between now and the '24, '25, there is one big hope, which is aducanumab. So, I can tell you that we continue to be very active on the BD M&A front. But at the same time, we are very careful while we approach aducanumab potentially. And we will always invest in the interest of the long-term shareholder value creation. Evan Seigerman : Great, thank you. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Robyn Karnauskas : Great. Thanks for taking my question, and thanks, Evan, for the segue. So, I want to ask about the Phase III STAR trial for choroideremia. You've got data coming up, you'll be first. Walk us through what the bar is, and then what would be the best-case scenario to secure the best reimbursement for the drug? And then, what would be the next steps to be able to treat even younger patients with the disease as many people get it when they are very-very young? Thank you. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Hi, Robyn. This is, Al. Yes, so the BIIB111, which is our gene therapy for choroideremia, the Phase 3 trial is about 160 patients and the primary endpoint of the bar, as you point out, is the proportion of patients who have a greater than 15 letter increase from baseline in the best corrected visual acuity. That's the FDA standard. It's a two-arm trial, placebo. And so, we just need to have better improvement in visual acuity in the treated patients versus the non-treated patients. This trial was initiated in December of 2017. We announced our last patient in November of 2019. And so, we do expect to read out in the first quarter of next year. And the Phase 3 trial is on the heels of a Phase 1 trial, which was a single-arm study and it compared the proportion of patients who had an improvement in best corrected visual acuity relative to a natural history study and the drug did show some very encouraging results on that endpoint. So, we're just basically using the same endpoint for Phase III and trying to hit the standard set by the FDA. Thank you. I'd like to hand it over to Michel, just for some closing comments, please. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you so much, Joe, and thank you for attending. I want to thank Jeff again for his many contributions to our company. At Biogen, it's all about pioneering in neuroscience. So, we are approaching a very exciting phase of our 40 years plus of development. Our pipeline and all the many allocation of capital in that space is maturing. We have very important readouts in the coming 10 months. We have seven Phase III and we are very close to open a new page, if FDA allows, with aducanumab. Thank you all for your attention. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you all for joining and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Third Quarter Earnings Call and Financial Update. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Joe Mara, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Mara, you may begin your conference. Joe Mara : Thank you and good morning, and welcome to Biogen's third quarter 2020 earnings call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2, and Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results and our GAAP to non-GAAP financial guidance. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We\u2019ve also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Al Sandrock, EVP, Research and Development; and our CFO, Mike McDonnell. Now, I will turn the call over to Michel. Michel Vounatsos : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As you all know, aducanumab Advisory Committee meeting is scheduled for November 6th. This is our highest priority, and we are very focused on preparing for this meeting. At the same time, the TECFIDERA situation in the U.S is clearly a near-term challenge, which we will discuss. Before I continue, I would like to welcome Mike McDonnell, our new CFO. Mike's background and track record of accomplishment make him well prepared to be a very strong contributor to Biogen and I know he looks forward to getting to know many of you. Now let me review some key recent developments. First, we are very pleased that the FDA has accepted our BLA for aducanumab with Priority Review and has stated that, if possible, they plan to act early. As I mentioned, the Advisory Committee is of course an important event on the path to potential approval and we are actively preparing to participate and share our perspective on our clinical data. Outside the U.S. early this month, we submitted a marketing authorization application in Europe, and we are preparing for regulatory submission in Japan, following the recent former meeting with the PMDA. We have progressed in our U.S launch readiness, as we remained focused on appropriate engagement with scientific leaders, treatment sites, defining aducanumab's value proposition and establishing collaboration across multiple stakeholders to help prepare for the potential introduction of the first therapy to meaningfully change the course of Alzheimer's disease. Outside the U.S., we are continuing to ramp up our launch readiness, particularly in Europe and Japan. Beyond aducanumab, we continue to advance our broader Alzheimer's disease portfolio, including BAN2401 in Phase 3 and multiple targeting programs targeting tau. Also, in neurodegeneration, we are proud to be collaborating with Denali, a premiere innovative neuroscience company, pioneering novel approaches for treating brain diseases. This collaboration provides us a mid stage small molecule LRRK2 inhibitor program, which expands our pipeline of potential therapies in Parkinson's disease across multiple modalities. We also received exclusive options rights to two programs for neurodegenerative diseases using Denali's innovative Transport Vehicle platform, including for amyloid beta antibodies. With the deep pipeline, aducanumab now under review and our recent collaboration with Denali, we believe we are well-positioned to lead in the fight against both Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, the number one and number two, most common neurodegenerative diseases with an urgent need for novel treatments. More broadly, we have continued to develop and expand our deep pipeline, which now includes 30 clinical assets with 8 in Phase 3 or field, including the recent initiation of the Phase 3 program for dapirolizumab pegol in lupus with UCB. As we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to maximizing returns for our shareholders as we aim to bring innovative therapies to patients, something that demands a thoughtful approach towards all our investments over both the short and the long-term. Let me know discuss where we see Biogen strategically as we believe we are in a transitional period with several upcoming inflection points. As we manage through the erosion of TECFIDERA in the U.S., Biogen remains focused on strong execution against our strategy. We are the leader in neuroscience. We differentiated core capabilities as we aim to leverage breaking science to address the tremendous unmet medical need in this space. We are leveraging better understanding of disease biology, including the underlying genetics, as well as advances in biomarkers, such as novel imaging of the brain to help reduce the risk in developing therapies for many previously intractable diseases. We are building on a strong financial track record with the core business in MS, SMA and biosimilars, and we believe we are entering a new phase of important clinical readouts and value creation opportunities. We will continue to work to maximize the potential of our broad MS portfolio, including the launch of VUMERITY and the life cycle management for TYSABRI and the Interferon. Despite increased competition, we believe SPINRAZA can continue to grow and serve as a foundation of care based on the most well-established efficacy and safety profile in SMA. SPINRAZA has demonstrated sustained clinically meaningful benefits from pre-symptomatic infants to adults, and its safety profile has enabled us to begin assessing a higher dose for potentially even greater efficacy. We see biosimilars as another potential growth driver, while providing headroom for innovation. We are working to expand into the U.S and China with the potential to commercialize two new ophthalmology biosimilars with a global market opportunity of approximately $11 billion. Importantly, Samsung Bioepis recently announced that the Marketing Authorization Application was accepted by the EMA for SB11, a potential biosimilar referencing Lucentis. We remain optimistic about the prospect of launching aducanumab as the first therapy to meaningfully change the course of Alzheimer's disease and this will be an important short-term and long-term growth driver for the company. In addition to aducanumab, we believe our pipeline could enable a second wave of growth in the mid 2020s, driven by areas such as ophthalmology, stroke, lupus and ALS. Importantly, we expect 6 mid to late stage data readouts by the end of 2021. We plan to continue pursuing external business development opportunities to further expand our pipeline. In just under 4 years, we have committed nearly $5 billion of business development and executed 20 transactions. Going forward, we will continue to prioritize the stability of our organization to support our current portfolio, while preparing for the potential introduction of a number of new products starting with aducanumab. We will be focused on diligent execution, capturing every opportunity for efficiency and cost savings. In summary, We have continued to execute well on our strategy. We believe we are well-positioned to serve our current and future patients as we built a multi franchise portfolio, leveraging the interconnectivity of our deep neuroscience pipeline. We have a very strong balance sheet and we will remain focused on maximizing long-term shareholder value creation. I will now turn the call over to Al for a more detailed update on our recent progress in R&D. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Thank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by thanking the Biogen team for their hard work in making significant progress advancing our R&D programs. This includes milestones across key areas, such as the regulatory filings of aducanumab, pipeline progression and business development. Starting with Alzheimer's disease, as Michel mentioned, we are working through the regulatory procedures for aducanumab around the world. We're also diligently preparing for the FDA advisory committee meeting on November 6. Also in Alzheimer's disease, our collaboration partner Eisai, dosed the first patient in the AHEAD 3-45 clinical program, which is designed to evaluate BAN2401 in individuals with preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Through the results of this trial, we hope to learn whether BAN2401 can suppress the progression of amyloid and tau pathology and reduce cognitive decline in the very early stages of Alzheimer's disease. This quarter, we also announced an exciting collaboration with Denali Therapeutics, to co-develop and co-commercialize Denali small molecule LRRK2 inhibitor DNL151 in Parkinson's disease, the second most common neurodegenerative disease. LRRK2 is a negative regulator of lysosomal function and certain mutations in the LRRK2 gene increase the risk of Parkinson's disease. We will examine the therapeutic potential of LRRK2 kinase inhibition in patients with and without known genetic risks for Parkinson's disease. Our hope is that 151 could be a first-in-class oral therapy that slows the progression of the disease. This collaboration also provides us with the exclusive option to license two preclinical programs, utilizing Denali's Transport Vehicle platform. This platform is designed to enhance the brain uptake of large therapeutic molecules by leveraging the transferrin receptor, which is highly expressed at the blood-brain barrier. One of these two programs seeks to enhance the delivery of an anti-beta amyloid antibody across the blood-brain barrier. We are pleased to be collaborating on this platform with Denali, a pioneer in enhancing the delivery of large molecules into the central nervous system. Moving to our MS portfolio, at the AdComs meeting last month, we presented new data from the EVOLVE MS-2 trial that further reinforced the clinically meaningful improvement in gastrointestinal tolerability associated to VUMERITY as compared to TECFIDERA. Specifically, patients taking VUMERITY reported a lower likelihood of experiencing GI symptoms that interfered with daily activities or were associated with missed work and use less concomitant medication to treat GI symptoms. Also at ECTRIMS, an analysis of real-world data in patients receiving TYSABRI extended interval dosing showed no significant differences in the rates of new T2 lesions, T2 lesion volumes, or brain atrophy on brain MRI scans when compared to patients receiving the currently approved every 4-week dosing regimen. These data contribute to a growing body of evidence that suggested TYSABRI extended interval dosing has similar efficacy to that of standard dosing, while reducing the risk of PML. The efficacy of extended interval dosing as compared to the standard dosing regimen is being assessed prospectively in the ongoing NOVA study, which is expected to read out next year. Additionally, we presented real-world data showing the treatment with TYSABRI was associated with significant improvement in 9 of 12 patient reported neuro quality of life domains. Whereas in patients treated with OCREVUS, there were improvements in 4 of 12 domains. Moving to our MS pipeline, we were disappointed to learn that AFFINITY, the Phase 2b study of opicinumab did not meet its primary endpoint or secondary end points. As a result, we have decided to discontinue development of opicinumab. Nevertheless, we remain committed to the therapeutic approach of repairing the central nervous system, and still believe that remyelination has the potential to provide a therapeutic benefit for MS patients. We are continuing to analyze the significant data set from this study to further inform our MS research in this area, including for BIIB061. Turning to neuromuscular disorders, following productive engagement with the FDA, we are advancing plans for a study to evaluate the benefit of tofersen when initiated in presymptomatic carriers of SOD1 mutations that have been linked to ALS. Akin to the NURTURE study of SPINRAZA in SMA, this study is designed to evaluate the ability of tofersen to delay clinical onset or slow disease progression of ALS when initiated prior to clinical symptom onset. We plan to initiate this study next year. Also in ALS I'm happy to report that we dose the first patient in our Phase 1 study of BIIB105 in antisense oligonucleotide targeting ataxin-2. Ataxin-2 was originally identified as a modifier of TDP-43 toxicity, a pathology common to more than 90% of the ALS population suggesting that reduction in ataxin-2 could be therapeutic across most ALS populations, other than that due to SOD1. Additionally, I would like to provide an update on our SMA gene therapy asset BIIB089. The FDA had previously placed a clinical hold on BIIB089 due to dorsal root ganglion toxicity, a pathology commonly observed in preclinical studies and which may also occur following use of the currently available AAV mediated SMA gene therapy. Thus we've made the decision to discontinue BIIB089 and will instead focus on the pursuit of next generation SMA gene therapy technology that we believe will address the DRG toxicity. Lastly, we are happy to announce that in collaboration with UCB, we have dosed the first patient in our Phase 3 program for dapirolizumab pegol in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus with active disease, despite being on standard of care therapies. In summary, we continue to build and advance a deep neuroscience pipeline that seeks to enhance -- to address patients' needs by leveraging both organic growth and external collaboration. This approach is evidenced by our recent agreement with Denali and also Scribe Therapeutics where we are pursuing cutting edge CRISPR technology to potentially develop gene therapies for ALS. We believe this mix of internal development and external collaboration allows us to maximize the value of our R&D programs and provides a source of sustained innovation to help drive long-term growth of the company. I will now pass the call to Mike. Michael McDonnell : Thank you, Al. Good morning, everyone. I'm excited to join Biogen and look forward to getting to know many of you. Biogen had another solid quarter despite the recent entrants of generic TECFIDERA and the continued impacts of COVID-19 as we continue to execute well. We remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial capacity to continue to grow the business over the long-term. I will now review our financial performance in the quarter and also provide an update to our full year guidance. Total revenue for Q3 was $3.4 billion, a decline of 6% versus the prior year. This decline was mostly driven by TECFIDERA generic entry and is inclusive of a 1% unfavorable currency impact. Total MS revenue, including OCREVUS royalties was $2.3 billion, a decrease of 4% versus the prior year. MS revenue during the third quarter began to experience the impact of the entrants of multiple generics of TECFIDERA in the U.S., while Q3 TECFIDERA revenue outside the U.S was $283 million, representing an increase of 1% versus the prior year with continued patient growth. During the quarter, we saw improvement in VUMERITY trends, including an increased number of new starts. We believe VUMERITY can be an important product given its differentiated GI tolerability profile, as Al mentioned. TYSABRI had a strong quarter with Q3 global revenue of $516 million, growing 7% versus the prior year. We were pleased to see continued global patient growth of 4% for TYSABRI versus the prior year. We believe TYSABRI is well-positioned to play an increasingly important role in the treatment of MS. And we are working on several important initiatives, including subcutaneous administration, an option for home infusion and an option for extended interval dosing. Moving now to SMA. Global third quarter SPINRAZA revenue was $495 million, a decrease of 10% versus the prior year and stable versus the prior quarter. In the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue decreased by 23% versus the prior year as we continue to see an impact of COVID-19 on both new starts and maintenance doses, as well as additional competition. Outside the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue was stable versus the prior year and grew 10% versus the prior quarter. Although COVID-19 and new competition have had an impact on SPINRAZA, we see the potential for global growth given a very strong efficacy and safety profile and a significant number of untreated patients across many established and emerging markets. Moving to our biosimilars business. Revenue was $208 million this quarter, an increase of 13% versus Q3 2019. Q3 biosimilars revenue, despite returning to growth continued to be negatively impacted by a slowdown in new treatments and reduce clinic capacity for immunology patients as a result of COVID-19. BENEPALI our first and largest biosimilar became the number one prescribed etanercept product across Europe. We estimate there are now approximately 220,000 patients using our biosimilars in Europe. And we believe we have the opportunity to continue to grow in Europe, as well as potentially within the U.S and other geographies. Total anti-CD20 revenue in the -- in Q3 was $560 million, a decrease of 6% versus the prior year with increased OCREVUS royalties offset by decreased revenue from RITUXAN due to COVID 19, and continued erosion from biosimilars, a trend we expect to continue to impact RITUXAN. Total other revenue in the third quarter increased 15% versus Q3 2019 to approximately $126 million. Turning now to expenses. Q3 GAAP R&D expense was $1.1 billion or 34% of revenue. Non-GAAP R&D expense, which excludes $601 million related to our collaboration with Denali was $540 million or 16% of revenue. Beginning in Q3, material upfront payments associated with significant collaboration and licensing arrangements are excluded from non-GAAP R&D expense in order to better reflect our core operating performance. Year-to-date, non-GAAP results also reflect this change as the $125 million upfront payment related to the collaboration with Sangamo in the second quarter of 2020 has also now been excluded from non-GAAP R&D expense. Q3 GAAP SG&A expense of $573 million and non-GAAP SG&A of $569 million were both 17% of revenue. Within the U.S., we are reallocating some TECFIDERA resources to support the launch of VUMERITY as well as aducanumab, although we will continue to fully support our broader MS portfolio. In addition, we are ramping up our commercial preparations for aducanumab, which will create some upward pressure on SG&A. However, as always, we will continue to diligently manage our operating expenses to ensure we remain efficient across the organization. In Q3 of this year, our effective GAAP tax rate was approximately 25%, an increase from approximately 12% in the third quarter of 2019. This increase is primarily due to prior year favorability from Swiss tax reform as well as current year unfavorability, primarily driven by non-cash deferred tax adjustments related to TECFIDERA. For the third quarter of 2020, our effective non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 18%, an increase from approximately 16% in the third quarter of 2019. Third quarter GAAP net income was $702 million and non-GAAP net income was $1.4 billion. GAAP diluted earnings per share in the third quarter was $4.46, a decrease of 47% versus the prior year and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $8.84, a decrease of 4% versus the prior year. We repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares in Q3 for a total value of approximately $1.3 billion. The share repurchase program authorized in December of 2019 was completed as of September 30, 2020 and our Board of Directors has authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program. In Q3, we generated approximately $1.2 billion in net cash flows from operations. Capital expenditures in Q3 were $84 million and free cash flow was approximately $1.1 billion. We ended the quarter with $4.6 billion in cash and marketable securities and $7.4 billion in debt. Additionally, our $1 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn as of the end of the quarter. Let me now provide an update to our full year guidance for 2020. Our guidance was last updated in July and assumed no generic entry for TECFIDERA. During the third quarter, we began to experience the impact of generic entrants with more than 10 TECFIDERA generics approved and at least 6 now in the market and discounted prices of approximately 90%. Our guidance assumes significant erosion of TECFIDERA in the fourth quarter of 2020, the pace of which is difficult to predict. As a result, we now expect full year revenue to be between approximately $13.2 billion to $13.4 billion. We expect full year 2020 GAAP diluted EPS to be between $25.50 and $26.50, and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $32.50 and $33.50. Of note, this range excludes the upfront payments associated with the Sangamo and Denali collaborations during the second and third quarters of 2020, respectively. The upfront payment associated with the Q2 Sangamo transaction equates to roughly $0.65 per share. It's important to note that this guidance does not include potential impacts from new acquisitions or large business development transactions, as both have elements that are hard to predict. This financial guidance also assumes that foreign exchange rates as of September 30, 2020 remain in effect for the remainder of the year. I'll now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you, Mike. Biogen has remained focused on strong execution across our core business in MS, SMA and biosimilars, while continuing to advance our strategy of building a multi-franchise portfolio. I want to reiterate our commitment to maximizing returns to our shareholders and bring in innovative participation now and over the long-term. This requires that we continue to allocate capital efficiently, effectively, and appropriately. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will always strive to have an optimal capital structure, as well as aim for superior returns from investments we make. Again, we are actively preparing for the aducanumab Advisory Committee and a potential launch. The unmet medical need and cost to society for Alzheimer's are tremendous and mounting. Alzheimer's creates a cost burden of approximately $550 billion per year in the U.S and the cost for caring for an Alzheimer's patient can be over $0.5 million. Alzheimer's deprives many patients of the independence. By the age of 80, approximately 75% of people with Alzheimer's disease live in a nursing home at a per patient cost of approximately $100,000 per year. The approval of aducanumab would be an unprecedented milestone for patients, their families and society at large, and will represent an important short-term and long-term growth driver for the company. Finally, we are focused on advancing our broader purpose as an organization, as we aim to pioneer science for the betterment of humanity. This includes doing the right thing for patients, our employees, the environment, and the community, while accelerating our efforts in diversity and inclusion, all of which we believe contribute to long-term sustainable shareholder value. These issues are all interrelated. For example, environmental issues are central to human health. To that end, I am incredibly proud of our recently launched 20-year, $250 million Healthy Climate, Healthy Lives initiative. This includes a goal to eliminate our fossil fuel emissions by 2040 and to be a catalyst for positive change by advancing the science around how fossil fuel impact human health and taking action to promote climate and health equity. Finally, I would to thank our employees around the world, who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patients life, including ensuring access to our therapies during these challenging times. With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. As you've prepared for the AdCom, any notable new analyses or data points that we should expect to hear about as you try to frame the risk benefit for the drug here? And then congratulations on the European filing. Anything notable in terms of similarities or differences here versus your discussions with the FDA that you can call out on the European side? Thank you. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Hi. This is Al. We've done lots of analysis. We've been doing that for more than a year in collaboration with FDA. We -- we are working exceptionally hard and the team is working exceptionally hard to prepare for the AdCom, and we're very excited about sharing our perspective on that day. Terence Flynn : On the EU difference -- difference in the EU? Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: The EU, we just filed after some formal meetings and we expect to hear back and start the engagement process. And in Japan, we are just had our formal interactions and we'll be filing soon. Operator : We will take our next question from Marc Goodman with SVB Leerink. Marc Goodman : Hi, good morning. Question is really about expenses. You're about to lose $3 billion at TECFIDERA sales, and I was just curious how come you're not announcing some type of restructuring plan, or just significant cost cutting to help offset that? I mean, I understand that VUMERITY is still there, but clearly there's a disconnect between the sales of those two and big sales with those two. And then just secondarily, can you talk about any tax rate implications because of TECFIDERA sales going away? Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : So, thanks for the good question. We are always obviously looking at savings opportunity and how to be an even more efficient operation mostly when we face the potential launch of TEC in the U.S, which is certainly a material impact. We did extract approximately $400 million from our infrastructure in order to be a leaner and simpler organization, and we have an array of measures in place in order to simplify the back office and try to save additional resources. You need obviously to understand that we still have a $6 billion plus business with MS in a highly competitive environment where we need to absolutely resource in order to defend our leadership position. VUMERITY is immaterial for now, but the signing is demonstrating some good signs and we'll come back to it. So we need to stay on and continue to resource the launch of VUMERITY, and obviously there's aducanumab. We use the learning from COVID and utilization also to gain efficiency. But again, we need to continue to resource the base business. We need to prepare for the launch of aducanumab, because we are optimistic and at the same time, we try really to save what we can. Michael McDonnell : Yes. So I'll just quickly add to that, Marc. Thanks very much for the question, Mike speaking. I think just to add to what Michel was saying, a little bit of color, running at about 17% of revenue SG&A, we feel like it runs pretty efficiently. As Michel said, we are reallocating some costs and resources to the aducanumab launch and in support of VUMERITY. And obviously we do need to continue to support the MS franchise, but I would just point out that any cost savings that we have, we guided for only the fourth quarter, we're not guiding for '21 at this time. But obviously you wouldn't see cost impacts around this until 2021, which we'll talk more about when we get to 2021. On your question around the tax rate, I think you were reacting to a comment in the prepared remarks. Given the change in the cash flow profile and the profitability profile for TECFIDERA, there was a deferred tax adjustment that was required to be booked relating to evaluation allowance, which had a modest impact on the effective tax rate for the quarter. So hopefully that's helpful. Michel Vounatsos : So if I may add to what Mike said, TECFIDERA is still above a $1 billion ex-U.S. If we remove completely the U.S market and it's growing. And there are some countries where we are launching TECFIDERA. So we see continuing to resource the overall $6 billion plus MS franchise and also TECFIDERA ex-U.S. Operator : We will take our next question from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, as you guys think about the Advisory Committee and you think about potential path to approval, what do you think is the risk that the FDA may think about approving aducanumab in a certain subgroup of patients where they think the risk benefit is better compared to the overall patient population? If you could comment on that, that would be helpful. And then, Mike, can you just comment on inventory trends in the quarter? Thanks. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Hi, Matthew. This is Al. We -- look, the FDA has all the data. We continue to believe that aducanumab has a substantial evidence of efficacy. If we didn't believe that we wouldn't have filed. And we look forward to sharing all the data at the FDA Advisory Committee, including potential subgroups. And it's in the FDA's hands at this point. Joe Mara : Yes, this is Joe. In terms of your question on inventory, I would just say, it wasn't a significant impact in the quarter and not something that we called out. Operator : We will take our next question from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Michel, I know you were super excited the day you guys decided to file with FDA. I don't know if it's just the virtual nature of this call today, but I'm not quite hearing that at least on the call for the EU filing. Is there something EU is raising, which is different than FDA? I'd be curious to what you say on that, Michel. And Al, I know when the data was presented, there were several very important aspects of the data that weren't showing. And I think the assumption was they're probably consistent with the overall analysis, but can you speak to whether you're expecting FDA to focus on the APOE4 carriers versus non carriers? And can you remind us if the efficacy is consistent in those two groups, as well as if we only looked at patients without ARIA, if you expect -- is the efficacy delta consistent with the overall conclusion? Michel Vounatsos : So let me take the first part of your question, Umer. So we are equally excited about all the interactions with regulators all around the world. Having said that, the U.S FDA will certainly influence as a cascade, all the regulators. We had actually to refocus our team on the U.S FDA, because we were approved by other agencies who wanted to meet and wanted us to share the data. So I will not speak about China and all the markets, Australia, Canada, Switzerland, et cetera. So certainly the focus is on the U.S FDA, the November 6, we are excited and we are optimistic and then the others will unfold naturally, hopefully. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Hi, Umer. On your question about carriers versus non carriers, look, I don't want to speculate as to what the FDA will ask the advisors at the Advisory Committee. But if they go there, we're prepared. We're -- there's -- we haven't shown our subgroup data yet. We will at some point and for all I know it may come up at the Advisory Committee. But we're eager to share our perspective on the data, whatever comes up. Operator : We will take our next question from Evan Seigerman with Credit Suisse. Evan Seigerman : Hi there. Thank you so much for taking the question. So one from Michael, nice to meet you on the phone. So with the erosion of TECFIDERA, why did you opt to authorize an additional share repurchase program versus, say, allocating your capital elsewhere to maybe help grow revenues? Aside from aducanumab, how do you plan on addressing this decline in revenue and earnings that we're now seeing? Thank you. Michael McDonnell : Sure. Evan, nice to meet you, and thanks very much for the question. Look, Biogen for a period of time now has been very active in allocating capital. As Michel mentioned in the prepared remarks, just in the last 4 years, 20 transactions approaching $5 billion, and obviously the company has returned significant capital to shareholders in the form of share buybacks. And we expect both of those activities are going to continue. Obviously, we're going to continue to be active on the BD front as the company has been before. And notwithstanding the situation with TECFIDERA, we've got $4.6 billion of cash on hand as of the end of September. A modest amount of debt, net debt, I think $2.8 billion. We've got still very significant cash flow and a very pristine balance sheet. And we intend to utilize that for both BD and share repurchases and the logic of the share repurchase just completely aligns with that. Evan Seigerman : Okay, great. Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : So we do remain, Evan, very active on BD and the organization can continue to do both. Return shareholder to the -- capital to the shareholders, and also adds to the business momentum and we have prepared for both. Working very hard on that. Evan Seigerman : Great. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company. Phil Nadeau : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Al, one for you. I'm curious you've been asked a few times about the AdCom, but kind of dodged the questions of what your argument is going to be. I'm curious if you maybe just give us a brief preview of what the key elements are of your argument that aducanumab has a positive benefit risk. What parts of the data where you highlight, and then on the risk side, how will you deal with the area? And then just kind of a follow-up question to that. It is 2 weeks before we expect to see the proofing documents released publicly, has Biogen received them yet? Thanks. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: So, look our argument rests on the fact that we have a robustly positive study in EMERGE, positive on the pre-specified primary and all secondary endpoints. We have a supportive study in the Phase 1b trial, which was published in Nature a few years ago. And then we have ENGAGE and we believe we understand why ENGAGE was a negative study, and our belief is that it doesn't detract from the positive study. And in terms of the risks, the main risk is ARIA. We believe it's manageable that we've learned how to deal with it with MRI monitoring, with titration. And so we believe the benefit risk is worthy of approval. If we didn't think that, we wouldn't have filed. And so that's -- and in terms of the briefing book, we're not going to comment on the briefing book. It'll -- as stated in the FDA register, it will be made publicly available 2 days prior to the actual Advisory Committee meeting. Operator : We will take our next one question from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Michael Yee : Hi. Thanks for the question. Just following up, can you just comment about the language on how the FDA may plan to act early? What does that mean? Is that way earlier and just maybe you keep emphasizing that. So just maybe add some color on that. And if you -- if it was early, would you actually be ready to launch literally any day if that actually happened? And if it's not the case that it goes that way, can you just rightsize which way expenses would be going? Because I think you spent a lot -- preparing for this, which is optimistic but just what that need to be adjusted? Just maybe some color there. Thank you so much. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: I'll take the first part, Michael. In terms of acting early, the FDA has had the data since last June. Our first -- right after our first Type C meeting, we sent them all the primary data. That could be one reason why they said that they could act early. And we see the Advisory Committee has scheduled pretty early relative to the timeframe that they have until the PDUFA date of early March. Okay, go ahead. Michel Vounatsos : Concerning the launch readiness, the short answer is absolutely yes. We have continued -- we have increased the medical engagement with scientific leaders. We have engaged with payers. We are working on the value proposition and the potential price. We are making progress. There is a across functional team working on the site readiness. They're willing to meet and to engage despite COVID. We have certainly enhanced the digital capability for which the baseline was already very strong. Patient engagement and patient services has been increased because we anticipate many, many requests call advice from patients. We have a very rigorous approach to the potential launch by specializing focusing first on the most important treatment centers, the specialist, and then going to the broader population, obviously engaging with the Medicare. And again, the burden of the disease is so high that there's a high interest from all the parties we meet, even if we are the only one building the infrastructure somehow, which is a challenge, but very pleased with the progress. We will be ready. Joe Mara : You address the last part, which is just expenses and \u2026 Michael McDonnell : Yes. I mean, look, I think hopefully, our optimism is clear and the scenario we're planning toward is a successful launch of aducanumab, and hopefully unlikely event that we don't have approval. Of course, we would have an obligation to look at our cost base. Michael Yee : Thank you guys. Very helpful. Operator : We will take our next question from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Cory Kasimov : Great. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow-up on something, Michel, that you just mentioned around pricing. I will acknowledge upfront putting a giant cart before the horse. But if aducanumab is approved, can you just talk about your latest thoughts on how to potentially to price this to best summarize the products potential and accessibility? And since everyone seems to be asking two, just a housekeeping for Michael. With SPINRAZA sales down 10% this quarter, I mean, you alluded to both competition as well as kind of the continued effects of COVID. Is there any way to delineate that a little bit and talk about roughly speaking, what to do to each one? Michel Vounatsos : So we are also making progress on the potential price for aducanumab, should it be approved, it's still premature. But we are engaging broadly with pharmacoeconomists, ICER and other advisors. As I alluded into the note earlier, the cost to society is so high. We are working on certainly assessing very clearly the clinical meaningfulness and what will be the value that aducanumab will provide to the different set of customers, starting by the patients, the caregivers, the payers and all aspects related to this value creation that aducanumab will bring, not only the year one, but over the entire life of the product, even beyond potentially the patent -- when the patent expires. So it's too early. We will come back to that and we are taking this question. We have a lot of, I would say, serious focus and dedication and advice from others. Michael McDonnell : So, Cory, on the second part of your question I'll try to give you some data points that are hopefully helpful and just kind of speaking in year-over-year terms. So globally SPINRAZA was down 10% year-over-year. And you'll see in some of the charts that we put up that patients are actually up 21% year-over-year. And the dynamics that factor into this are a few things. One is product dosing dynamics. We have fewer loading doses versus maintenance doses as the product matures. Secondly, there are COVID impacts. We can't precisely tell you what that number is. It's kind of hard to tease out, but there are certainly when we see fewer new patient adds going through loading doses and some dosing delays, we know that part of the reason is, is related to COVID and patients not getting into to get those treatments. There's some country mix in the mix here, so to speak, and some of the patient growth that we've had is coming from countries where the prices are lower. And lastly there is competition from ZolGensma and Evrysdi. So those are kind of all in the mix to precisely say what the COVID piece is. It's not something that we can completely tease out. We know it is in the mix and hopefully those metrics that I gave you are somewhat helpful. Cory Kasimov : Yes, definitely. Thank you. Michael McDonnell : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Ronny Gal : Congratulations. Thank you for the call. One, just a clarification. And again, nice meeting you initially on the phone. The message basically on the cost structure that, look, we might have to take a look at our cost structure, but we will wait until we know the outcome of aducanumab before we decide how to do this. Just clarifying that this is, this has gone to message as we think about the cost structure in 2021. And second, just staying on the SMA side, can you guys give us a feel for your share of new starts in the U.S and internationally, just so we can kind of have a model forward of how the market would split up. Michael McDonnell : Sure. So, Ronny, it's Mike speaking. So on your interpretation on the costs, as we've said, we're gearing up for a launch of aducanumab that does add some pressure to SG&A. And that is something that we're very focused on, obviously getting right. We have reallocated some resources, as I said, in the prepared remarks from TECFIDERA to aducanumab as well as the support of VUMERITY. We are going to continue to support the MS platform. As Michel said, we have over a $1 billion franchise outside of the U.S in TECFIDERA, which is important to remember. And so that's kind of the state of play in terms of the fourth quarter that we've guided to today. And we'll have more to say about all of our financial metrics as we get into 2021 and provide -- presumably guidance for next year at that time. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Yes, Ronny, in the second part of your question, I don't think we've gotten to that level of detail in terms of kind of shares in new starts and whatnot. Michel Vounatsos : But if you want, I can add a bit more color on what we see in terms of market dynamic, at least in the U.S with a recent launch. Recently combined with the COVID environment is certainly generating some switch from SPINRAZA and this is understandable because of the perceived convenience. But the SUNFISH data is showing clearly some limitation mostly because of the -- of target tox potentially and the 5 milligram ceiling that may impact efficacy while the weight of the kit [ph] increases and patients and physicians start to be aware of that. But nevertheless, at the time of launch, patients are attracted by a potential oral medication, but it's not that easy, 365 times a year with a challenging dosing versus 3 times a year only and take it and being sure that you get the dose. So we believe that based on the data that we have and all the real world evidence from infants presymptomatic to symptomatic adults at the end of the day, safety and efficacy profile mostly will prevail, should prevail. That's why we remain reasonably optimistic about the SPINRAZA once this wave of enthusiasm is a bit behind us. Ronny Gal : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : Hey guys, thanks for the question. I just had a couple of quick ones. Michel, on the chance of the panel isn't favorable or FDA doesn't approve, what do you think could be some of those changes to the strategy? If it's more aggressive BD, does the $5 billion buyback announced today preclude the potential for doing a larger, more transformational deal? And then just a quick follow-up on SPINRAZA. Just, can you speak directionally that how much of the switch dynamic was in play in the U.S this quarter and would that be an indicator for the bigger OUS market? Thank you very much. Michel Vounatsos : So, just on -- to start on SPINRAZA, we saw approximately 200 patients, if I\u2019m not mistaken -- being switched to the new launch every day. But again, we are confident that over time SPINRAZA will remain the foundational therapy for the treatment of SMA. Concerning the first question on what do you think about the strategy is. Well, I would like to start by reminding we are assessing that we remain optimistic about the potential launch of ADU and this is the underlying assumption. But nevertheless, if ADU fails, we're still in a very strong position. We seem to be very profitable. We have a deep pipeline, we have a strong balance sheet, and we have a large portfolio in CNS, and this will enable long-term growth and value creation. So the prospects are not necessarily defined by the binary event, but they will be certainly affected in case of ADU failing. We have a pipeline, we have opportunity in optha, in stroke, in lupus, in ALS and biosimilars. We have the bigger deal with Denali. We have the rest of the portfolio in AD, the leadership position in neurodegenerative disease still here and we have overall 30 clinical assets, 8 filed, or in Phase 3. And we have the entire portfolio with life cycle management opportunities. And as I said, I believe that SMA, SPINRAZA will remain the foundational therapy. So the cost discipline will be there all the time, as discussed by Mike. Michael McDonnell : Yes, I think the other point that I would just add is you mentioned, you asked whether the share repurchase authorization precludes BD, and the answer as we said before is, it doesn\u2019t. We will continue to do both. And I would just remind that the authorization is very flexible. There's no timestamp on it. So we will continue to do both and be active, and we have a balance sheet that\u2019s in a great position which we\u2019re pleased about. Geoff Meacham : Okay. Thank you. Michael McDonnell : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Sumant Kulkarni with Canaccord. Sumant Kulkarni : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. If aducanumab is approved, do you expect the formal risk evaluation and litigation strategy program to be put in place? And we know you said you are ready to launch on day one, but what about the infrastructure around the burden caused by a potential REMS program? Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: This is Al. With respect to the REMS program, it\u2019s hard to say at this point. We are still in the review process. I would say that we believe that the risk of ARIA is manageable and the community has learned how to manage this risk over the years. Whether that requires a REMS or not is up to the FDA. Sumant Kulkarni : Thank you. Joe Mara : Maybe you can repeat that -- the other part of the question for us, if you don\u2019t mind? Sumant Kulkarni : Just about the infrastructure around the burden caused by a potential REMS program, is that ready to go in case you need to have one in place? Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Well, we\u2019ve done that before. We know how to do REMS programs, whatever they may be. And so we would be ready for that, yes, including the education piece, which is typically one of the most important aspects of REMS programs. Sumant Kulkarni : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Jay Olson with Oppenheimer. Jay Olson : Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. I\u2019d like to switch gears and ask about Parkinson\u2019s disease. As a leader in neurodegeneration, could you share your vision for the future treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease where you have an alpha-synuclein antibody and there's recently been signals of efficacy from Prothena and Roche. And then you also had your LRRK2 program with Denali and then there several gene therapies in development with competitors. So, which of these approaches do you think is most promising and where does Biogen fit into the competitive landscape? Thank you. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Yes, thank you very much. So we -- we\u2019re very excited about the potential in Parkinson\u2019s disease. As you pointed out, the Prothena, Roche antibody looked like there was some efficacy in Parts 2 and 3 I believe of the UPDRS score with additional support from digital measures and some imaging outcome measures as presented at the Movement Disorder Society meeting about a month or so ago. And we have our own alpha-synuclein antibody. It's different, in the sense that it's more specific for aggregated forms of alpha-synuclein, and we expect a readout on that in the coming months. We also have antisense oligonucleotide program directed against alpha-synuclein. You pointed out the LRRK2 inhibitor. We have the lead program there, the Denali 151 program, an oral small molecule LRRK2 inhibitor. And that could work not just in patients with LRRK2 mutations, but also there is ample evidence of lysosomal hypofunction in other cases of PD, even patients that don\u2019t have LRRK2 mutations. And so the potential is there that it could work in a broad range of Parkinson\u2019s patients. And then as you pointed out on other lysosomal gene, arguably as GBA, patients who are homozygous for GBA have Gaucher\u2019s disease or lysosomal storage disease. Those who are heterozygous have an increased risk of Parkinson\u2019s disease. And so we have preclinical programs directed against that as well. And as I said, we have the ability to license two programs with the Transport Vehicle program. I\u2019d also point out that earlier this year we did a deal with Sangamo, which includes not only opportunities gene therapy programs in Alzheimer\u2019s disease but also Parkinson\u2019s disease. One of our lead programs there's a gene therapy program on alpha-synuclein. So, I think there's a broad range. I think there's a lot of very good, validated targets, validated by human genetics and by clinical pathologic data in humans and we have multiple modalities, gene therapies, small molecules, as well as antisense oligonucleotides at our disposal. Joe Mara : Thank you. We appreciate all the questions. We probably have time for about one more. Operator : And we will take our next question from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Brian Abrahams : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. So, you touched on some of the additional regulatory meetings you held outside the U.S. on aducanumab. I\u2019m curious, on your feedback from Japan, specifically, in particular the rollout of the Phase 1/2 study that you had conducted there and whether you see potential for ex-U.S. regulators such as those in Japan to act early? And then just really quickly on the MS franchise, you\u2019ve got several next-generation agents like 091, 107 and 061, but they\u2019re all relatively early and would probably come online after additional exclusivity losses. So just wondering how you're thinking about the lifecycle there, whether you have a predilection for flexing down spend long term until these come to fruition or are you thinking about augmenting the mid-stage MS portfolio to leverage the commercial infrastructure you have in place? Thanks. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: So, Brian, I think with respect to ex-U.S. filings, I mean, as Michel said, we are equally optimistic about filings outside of the United States, we just aren\u2019t as advanced in terms of the procedure. We just filed in EMA, we haven\u2019t even filed yet in Japan. And so, we are eager to start the regulatory procedures. And as Michel said, we are equally optimistic. On the second part \u2026 Michel Vounatsos : On the lifecycle management of MS, we\u2019ve never been that reach in terms of clinical program and advancements in our MS portfolio and pipe, the early pipe with BTK and all the opportunities we have to develop or co-develop some of our products and we have lifecycle management opportunities with TYSABRI, with the EIV, with subcu, Avonex, a new label, Plegridy, IM. So we have plenty of opportunities to create market events. And as you saw despite the potential launch of a high efficacy product of aducanumab that becomes -- the class becomes -- the segment becomes very crowded. TYSABRI continues to do very well, because it\u2019s very well documented and well appreciated by the patients and the physicians. So we are confident in the rest of the portfolio, I would say, beyond the challenging situation we are facing with the TEC in the U.S. There is an entire franchise beyond this very specific case. And the commitment of the company beyond RMS for remuneration [ph] over the long-term. So, Biogen continues to support MS like day one. So thank you all for your attention. Exciting time at Biogen, and we are all looking forward for early November for more news from the AdCom and looking forward taking the company to the next step after this event. Thank you all. Have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Call and Financial Update. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hencke, Director, Investor Relations. Mr. Hencke, you may begin your conference. Mike Hencke : Thank you, Jake. Good morning, and welcome to Biogen's fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including our GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2, and Table 4 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We\u2019ve also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Al Sandrock, EVP, Research and Development; and our CFO, Mike McDonnell. I will now turn the call over to Michel. Michel Vounatsos : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I would like to start by thanking Joe Mara for his excellent contribution to Biogen during the past 14 years, and also congratulation for his well-deserved promotion. At the same time, I\u2019m delighted to have Mike Hencke, stepping into the role. As we\u2019ve announced last week, the FDA has extended the review timeline for aducanumab in the U.S to June 7. We are committed to working with the FDA as it completes its review of the aducanumab application and we continue to stand behind our clinical data. We believe our results support approval. Let me now review the year. 2020 was a year of uncertainties due to COVID-19 for both society at large and also for our industry. And I am proud of what the Biogen team delivered. For the full year 2020, Biogen generated $13.4 billion in revenue, representing a 6% decrease year-over-year, as we are experiencing the erosion of TECFIDERA revenue in the U.S due to the impact of generic entry. Full year 2020 non-GAAP earnings were $33.70 a share, a slight increase versus full year 2019. Now let me review our progress against our strategic priorities. First, full year MS revenues including OCREVUS royalties were $8.7 billion, a decrease of 6% versus the prior year. Excluding TECFIDERA in the U.S., our global MS revenue remained relatively stable for both Q4 and the full year versus 2019. Despite the challenges of launching a new product during COVID-19, we were pleased to see strong improvement in trends for VUMERITY, which has become the number two MS product and the number one overall, in terms of new prescriptions in the U.S. We believe these results demonstrate our ability to maintain leadership and execute well, despite increased competition, the erosion of TECFIDERA revenue in the U.S and COVID-19. Second, SPINRAZA generated full year global revenues of $2.1 billion, a 2% decrease versus the prior year. Q4 global revenues was stable versus Q3. While SPINRAZA is facing increased competition in the U.S., which has been exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19, this was offset by continued growth outside the U.S. We remain committed to further exploring the potential to enhance outcomes for patients with SPINRAZA. This includes the DEVOTE study testing a higher dose, as well as the recent initiation of the RESPOND study evaluating SPINRAZA in patients with a sub-optimal clinical response to gene therapy. There are important questions that remain unanswered on the other approved treatment options. And we are committed to generating relevant data to further inform treatment choices. We believe that SPINRAZA will remain a foundation of care in the treatment of SMA. Third, biosimilars delivered solid performance despite continued COVID-19 impact, with revenues of $796 million for 2020, which represents 8% growth year-over-year. We estimate that the use of biosimilar generated approximately \u20ac2.4 billion of savings to the European Health Care Systems in 2020, which should help expand access and create headroom for new innovation. We also made important progress towards potential geographic expansion and future growth for biosimilars business with the filing of SB11, referencing LUCENTIS in the U.S., where, over the next 5 years biosimilars are expected to generate over $100 billion in savings. Fourth, 2020 was a very positive year for our R&D organization. Last year we submitted regulatory filing for aducanumab in the U.S., EU and Japan. We remain ready to launch aducanumab in the U.S if and when it is approved. Our teams have evaluated the availability of specialists, infusion capacity, the ability to confirm the pathology of amyloid beta, MRI capacity and formulary approval processes. We believe there are several 100 sites in the U.S that are ready to start treating patients should aducanumab be approved. Beyond aducanumab, we addressed or advanced 12 new clinical programs last year across MS, ALS, Parkinson's disease, depression, and biosimilars, including for in Phase 3. Importantly, we entered new strategic collaboration with Sage and Denali, providing access to potential first-in-class therapies for serious neurological disorders, such as depression and Parkinson's disease. Our collaboration with Sage adds important late stage diversification through Phase 3 programs in both major depressive disorders and postpartum depression with critical readouts expected this year and asset in depression would offer multiple synergies across Biogen's existing portfolio. Overall in 2021, we expect eight mid to late stage data readouts including four programs in Phase 3. Fifth, our cash flow generation continues to provide us with significant flexibility to allocate capital. During 2020, we returned approximately $6.7 billion of capital to shareholders and allocated roughly $3 billion for business development to enhance our pipeline. In summary, 2020 was a very productive year for the company as we have executed in our strategy. Despite the challenges from COVID-19 and TECFIDERA generics, we have maintained global leadership across our core businesses in MS, SMA and biosimilars, and we have made significant progress towards building a multi franchise portfolio. As Mike will outline with our guidance, we believe 2021 will be a reset year for the company financially on both the top and bottom lines, but we believe we can grow the company over the long-term. As we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to maximizing returns for our shareholders, as we aim to bring innovative therapies to patients. I will now turn the call over to Al for a more detailed update on our recent progress in R&D. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Thank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by thanking my colleagues in R&D for their dedication to discovering and developing innovative, potentially life changing therapies for patients in need. As a result of their hard work, 2020 was a year of milestones for Biogen. We made significant progress toward building a multi franchise portfolio with 10 programs now in either Phase 3 or filed across a number of key therapeutic areas. We are proud that after more than a decade of work aimed at introducing the first treatments that treat the underlying pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, we have completed regulatory filings of aducanumab in multiple geographies. We hope that these filings will pave the way to the introduction of the first therapies that may slow the inevitable clinical decline in patients around the world suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, our collaboration partners at Eisai initiated the AHEAD 3-45 trial, designed to evaluate whether BAN2401 may be a benefit in people with the early pathology of Alzheimer's disease even before they're aware of cognitive impairments. Finally, we bolstered our early and late stage pipeline through both internal development and collaborations with leading neuroscience companies, including Denali, Sage and Sangamo. Let me now turn to the progress we made in the fourth quarter, starting with Alzheimer's disease and dementia. The clinical trials of aducanumab were the first to show in randomized double-blind placebo controlled studies in an antibody that target aggregated forms of amyloid results in the robust removal of amyloid plaque and reduce its clinical decline in Alzheimer's disease. Recently, Eli Lilly released results from the Phase 2 trial of donanemab, another anti- amyloid antibody for Alzheimer's disease. These top line results indicate that donanemab is now the third molecule after aducanumab and BAN2401 to show that antibodies that target the amyloid plaque and produce a robust effect on amyloid plaque reduction also produced a clinical benefit. These Phase 2 results seen with donanemab were comparable to what was demonstrated by aducanumab in its Phase 3 trials in terms of amyloid plaque reduction as measured in centiloid as well as clinical effect as measured on a composite scale of ADAS-Cog activities of daily living. We plan to present further details on these data at the upcoming AD/PD meeting in March. These data continued to strengthen our belief that antibodies that target the forms of a-beta concentrated in the amyloid plaque may produce therapeutic benefits, thus distinguishing these molecules from earlier anti-amyloid antibodies. Thus, we are optimistic about the potential for BAN2401 that is currently being evaluated in the Clarity Phase 3 trial. The target enrollment for Clarity has recently been increased by approximately 200 patients to mitigate COVID-19 related dosing challenges in consultation with the FDA. Nevertheless, the anticipated readout timing of Q3 2022 remains unchanged. In addition to anti-amyloid therapies, we continue to pursue a number of approaches targeting tau, which when misfolded, is the principal constituent of neurofibrillary tangles, another hallmark of Alzheimer's pathology. We expect data from the Phase 2 study of gosuranemab, our anti-tau antibody that aims to prevent the spread of tau in the brain in the first half of this year. We also have BIIB080, a tau targeted antisense oligonucleotide that aims to reduce the production of all forms of tau. In collaboration with Ionis, we recently learned that the Phase 1b multiple ascending dose study in mild Alzheimer's disease patients, a BIIB080 treatment was generally well-tolerated and resulted in a dose and time dependent reduction from baseline in CSF total tau and phospho-tau with durability of effect. We plan to present additional details at an upcoming scientific meeting. We are currently finalizing plans to advance BIIB080 into a Phase 2 study in Alzheimer's disease. In summary, across amyloid and tau, as well as other targets in the preclinical stage, we are advancing an industry leading pipeline that seeks to alter the course of Alzheimer's disease. Turning to MS, we have made significant progress in bolstering our existing MS franchise. This includes the approval of intramuscular PLEGRIDY in the United States and in the European Union, a positive CHMP opinion for subcutaneous TYSABRI and the submission of a marketing authorization application for VUMERITY in the EU. Additionally, we expect a readout for the NOVA study, evaluating the efficacy of extended interval dosing of TYSABRI by midyear. We recently added BIIB107, an antibody that targets alpha4 integrins to our MS pipeline. The clinical utility of targeting alpha4 integrins has been proved with TYSABRI, a highly efficacious treatment for relapsing MS. BIIB107 is a new molecular entity that has demonstrated higher binding affinity, reduced Fc effector function and a predictable pharmacological effect in preclinical study. Our intent is to integrate all of our learnings from TYSABRI including extended interval dosing so as to optimize safety, the dosing regimen and patient convenience while maintaining the high efficacy of TYSABRI. In neuromuscular disorders, we aim to continue enhancing the therapeutic benefit of SPINRAZA and recently announced that we dosed the first patient in the RESPOND study, which will evaluate the effect of SPINRAZA in patients who have had a suboptimal clinical response to gene therapy. We also continue to enroll patients in the DEVOTE study, which is evaluating whether the higher doses of SPINRAZA can provide greater efficacy than the currently approved dose. In ALS, we recently enrolled the last patient in the Phase 3 trial evaluating to a person an SOD1 ALS, and we look forward to the readout in the second half of this year. In movement disorders, we were disappointed to learn that the Phase 2 study of BIIB054 in Parkinson's disease did not meet the primary or secondary endpoints. Based on our Phase 1 data in CSF samples with BIIB054, we believe we have tested doses in the Phase 2 trial that were sufficient to engage extracellular alpha-synuclein in the central nervous system. As a result, we have decided to discontinue development of BIIB054 and plan to present detailed studies at a future scientific -- study results at a future scientific meeting. Nevertheless, we believe that the study provides a high-quality clinical data set that can be used to inform our future reference in Parkinson's disease. Denali recently announced completion of the Phase 1b study for BIIB122, otherwise known as DNL151, a small molecule inhibitor of LRRK2 which met target and pathway engagement goals. We expect to initiate late stage clinical development in Parkinson's disease patients by the end of this year. In stroke, TMS completed enrollment for the Phase 2 trial of TMS-007 in acute ischemic stroke in Q4 of 2020, and we are excited about the upcoming readout expected in the first half of this year. TMS-007 is a small molecule modulator of plasminogen and is hypothesized to facilitate thrombolysis selectively at the site of the clot, while simultaneously exerting an anti-inflammatory effect to help reduce the risk of additional tissue damage. We believe the targeted mechanism of action of TMS-007 may result in significant advantages over recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, which currently remains the standard of care for ischemic stroke. This includes potentially extending the therapeutic window to 12 hours or beyond, up from the 3 or 4.5 hour window of TPA and reduce the risk of adverse bleeding events. For these reasons, we believe TMS-007 represents a potential best-in-class thrombolytic agent. We continue to enroll patients in the Phase 3 trial of BIIB093 for the treatment of cerebral edema caused by large hemispheric infarction, despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we've had a very productive quarter on the business development front, executing a number of collaborations that provide access to innovative potential first-in-class therapies. Significantly accelerating our expansion into neuropsychiatry, we entered into a collaboration with Sage, a leader in psychiatry. Major depressive disorder, or MDD, and postpartum depression or PPD are highly prevalent disorders, and we believe that Sage's lead asset, zuranolone has the potential to be a first-in-class oral therapy for both. We look forward to multiple Phase 3 upcoming Phase 3 readouts for zuranolone this year, which includes WATERFALL, for the episodic treatment of MDD; CORAL, for rapid response therapy when co-initiated with standard anti-depressive therapy and MDD and SKYLARK in PPD. Beyond zuranolone, we will also collaborate on SAGE-324 currently in development for essential tremor, with a readout of the Phase 2 study expected in early 2021. Furthering our commitment in ophthalmology, we entered into a collaboration with ViGeneron with the goal of developing gene therapies to treat inherited retinal diseases. With this collaboration, we aim to use ViGeneron's proprietary AAV capsids to efficiently transduce retinal cells via intravitreal injections, which could potentially be performed in the clinic and offer efficacy via significantly enhanced retinal area coverage as compared to sub-retinal injection through surgery. More recently, we entered into a collaboration with Atalanta Therapeutics based on technology that comes from the RNA therapeutics Institute at the University of Massachusetts, started by Nobel laureate, Dr. Craig Mello. As part of this collaboration, Atalanta will utilize its proprietary branched siRNA platform to develop potential treatments for multiple CNS targets, including HTT for the treatment of Huntington's disease. This collaboration with Atalanta, combined with our recent collaborations with Sangamo, Scribe, ViGeneron and the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, as well as our long-term collaboration with Ionis extend our ASO and RNAi capabilities and complement our ongoing efforts in gene therapy, including the development of our gene therapy assets for inherited retinal disorders. Additionally, we created a gene therapy accelerator unit to focus on solving the key technological challenges in the field with the goal of bringing to market more gene therapies that may transform the lives of patients. In 2020, Biogen R&D assembled and progressed a cutting edge neuroscience pipeline, employing state-of-the-art therapeutic modalities against genetically well validated drug targets. As a result, we believe we are well-positioned for growth in a transformative year with eight clinical trial readouts anticipated, including four pivotal programs. We remain optimistic on the opportunities ahead of us. And we believe we are entering a promising time for neurotherapeutics and their ability to meaningfully impact the lives of patients, including potentially bringing the first therapy to change the course of Alzheimer's disease. I will now pass the call over to Mike. Michael McDonnell : Thank you, Al, and good morning, everyone. Biogen had another solid quarter despite the challenges from COVID-19 and TECFIDERA U.S generics as we continue to execute well, and maintain global leadership across our core businesses. We remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial capacity to continue to grow the business over the long-term. I will now review our financial performance for the quarter and also share with you our guidance for 2021. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of $2.9 billion declined 22% versus the prior year both actual and constant currency. Total revenue for the full year of $13.4 billion declined 6% versus the prior year at both actual and constant currency. This decline was mostly driven by TECFIDERA generic entry in the U.S. Total MS revenue for the fourth quarter, including OCREVUS royalties of $1.8 billion, decreased 24% versus the prior year both actual and constant currency. Total MS revenue for the full year, including OCREVUS royalties of $8.7 billion, decreased 6% versus the prior year at actual currency and 5% at constant currency. This decline was also driven by the entrance of multiple generics of TECFIDERA in the U.S. Excluding U.S TECFIDERA, total MS revenue including OCREVUS royalties, was relatively flat both in the fourth quarter and the full year versus the prior year, demonstrating the resilience of our MS business in a competitive market. Global [ph] TECFIDERA revenue for the fourth quarter of $608 million declined 48% versus the prior year, and revenue for the full year of $3.8 billion declined 13%. Outside of the U.S., fourth quarter TECFIDERA revenue of $288 million increased 1% versus the prior year and full year revenue of $1.2 billion increased 3% with continued patient growth. During the quarter, we saw continued improvement in VUMERITY trends. VUMERITY revenue was $39 million in the fourth quarter. TYSABRI fourth quarter global revenue of $475 million was relatively flat versus the prior year and full year revenue of $1.9 billion grew 3% for the full year. We were pleased to see continued global patient growth throughout the year and believe TYSABRI is well-positioned to play an increasingly important role in the treatment of MS as we progressed several important initiatives, including subcutaneous administration and extended interval dosing. Moving now to SMA. Global fourth quarter SPINRAZA revenue of $498 million decreased 8% versus the prior year at actual currency and 10% at constant currency. In the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue decreased by 34% versus the prior year as we see an impact from competition, which is exacerbated by COVID-19. Outside the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue grew 13% versus the prior year with strong growth in emerging markets, partially offset by the maturation of larger European markets. For the full year, global SPINRAZA revenue of $2.1 billion decreased 2% versus the prior year at actual currency and 1% at constant currency. Full year U.S SPINRAZA revenue decreased 16% and full year revenue outside the U.S grew 9%. Although new competition and COVID-19 have had an impact on SPINRAZA, as you heard from Michel and Al, we believe SPINRAZA has a very strong efficacy and safety profile and will continue to be a foundation of care. Moving to our biosimilars business. Fourth quarter revenue of $197 million was flat versus the prior year at actual currency and declined 4% of constant currency. Full year revenue of $796 million grew 8% versus the prior year at actual currency and grew 6% at constant currency. Our biosimilars business continues to be negatively impacted by pricing pressure, as well as a slowdown in new treatments and reduced clinic capacity due to COVID-19. Despite the continued impact of COVID-19, we continue to be the leading anti-TNF biosimilar provider in Europe and BENEPALI continues to be the number one prescribed etanercept product across Europe. We believe we have the opportunity to continue to grow in Europe, as well as within the U.S and other geographies by commercializing new products developed by our Samsung Bioepis JV and other biosimilar products. Total anti-CD20 revenue in the fourth quarter of $419 million decreased 30% versus the prior year with relatively flat OCREVUS royalties and a 45% decrease in revenue from RITUXAN. Total anti-CD20 revenue for the full year of $2 billion decreased 14% versus the prior year, with a 23% increase in OCREVUS royalties and a 29% decrease in revenue from RITUXAN. The decrease in RITUXAN revenue is due to the impacts of COVID-19 and accelerating erosion from biosimilars. Turning now to gross margin. Fourth quarter gross margin was 83% of revenue versus 88% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was due to the declines in TECFIDERA and RITUXAN, both of which are high margin products as well as higher costs related to our corporate partner revenue due to product mix. Gross margin for the full year 2020 was 87% versus 86% in 2019. Moving now to expenses. Q4 non-GAAP R&D expense was $642 million and includes $68 million related to external collaboration agreements with Scribe, Atalanta and ViGeneron. Full year non-GAAP R&D expense was $2.1 billion. Q4 non-GAAP SG&A was $793 million, including approximately $100 million related to launch preparations for aducanumab. Full year non-GAAP SG&A was $2.5 billion, including approximately $250 million related to aducanumab. In Q4 of this year, our effective non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 16% flat versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Our full year effective non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 18% versus approximately 16% in 2019. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of the company's common stock for a total value of $400 million. Throughout 2020, we repurchased 22.4 million shares for a total value of $6.7 billion. As of December 31 2020, there was $4.6 billion remaining under the share repurchase program, which was authorized in October of 2020. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 154 million shares for the fourth quarter and 161 million shares for the full year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $4.58. Full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $33.70, a $0.13 increase versus the prior year and above our most recent guidance range. In 2020, we generated approximately $4.2 billion in net cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures for the full year were $425 million and free cash flow was approximately $3.8 billion. We ended the year with $3.4 billion in cash and marketable securities, and $7.4 billion in debt, resulting in $4 billion in net debt. Additionally, our $1 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn as of the end of the year. Let me now turn to our full year guidance for 2021. We expect full year 2021 revenue to be between $10.45 billion and $10.75 billion; non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $17 and $18.50 per share; and capital expenditures to be between $375 million and $425 million. It is important to note that this guidance is based on a number of critical assumptions, which are currently uncertain. Changes in these assumptions could materially impact our results. Our guidance assumes aducanumab will be approved in the U.S by June 7, although uncertainty remains on the FDA's decision. If aducanumab is approved in the U.S., we would expect an immediate launch. However, those titration will result in less revenue per patient in the initial months of treatment. As a result, we would expect only modest revenue for aducanumab in 2021, ramping thereafter. Post commercialization, we would book 100% of net revenue in the U.S., and A size profit share of 45% would be booked in a separate line item, which is not part of R&D or SG&A. In addition, while the erosion of our U.S TECFIDERA business to date has been slower than anticipated, if we are unsuccessful in our legal appeals, we expect a sharp decline during the first half of 2021 and this is our guidance assumption. We also expect significant erosion of RITUXAN in the U.S. Along with TECFIDERA, we expect that the reduction in revenue from these high margin products will put pressure on our gross margin percentage. Also as a reminder, in Q2 of 2020, we recorded $330 million in revenues related to the one-time license of certain manufacturing related intellectual property, which was at 100% gross margin. We expect non-GAAP R&D expenses will be between $2.35 billion and $2.45 billion. We remain committed to our long-term growth through continued investment in our pipeline, which has now grown to a total of 33 programs across 10 therapeutic areas including 10 programs, which are in Phase 3 or filed. Importantly, we expect our pipeline to generate eight important mid to late stage readouts this year including four in Phase 3. We expect non-GAAP SG&A expenses will be between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. This estimate includes an approximate $600 million investment in support of the potential launch of aducanumab. Of this amount, approximately $200 million would be reimbursable by Eisai and would be reflected as collaboration profit sharing, post commercialization and not part of SG&A. In addition, it is important to note that we have allocated a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity to aducanumab, which could impact 2021 results if aducanumab is not approved. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate for 2021 to be between 16% and 17%, and we assume we will utilize a portion of the remaining share repurchase authorization of $4.6 billion throughout the year, although this will depend on a variety of factors including our business development activity. Foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2020 are assumed to remain in effect for the year net of hedging activities. And we have not included any impact from potential tax or health care reform or any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions. Going forward, we plan to update our full year financial guidance each quarter. I'll now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you, Mike. Biogen demonstrated resilience and strong execution in 2020 positioning as well to manage the impact of the TECFIDERA generics and to make 2021 a transformative year for the company as we continue executing on our strategy to build a multi franchise portfolio. We are advancing an industry leading pipeline for Alzheimer's disease. We are waiting an important decision on aducanumab in the U.S now expected by early June. As AI described, our belief in the therapeutic approach of targeting amyloid plaques has never been stronger. We believe that our data supports the approval of aducanumab and we are optimistic about BAN2401 one in Phase 3. We are also pursuing complimentary approaches targeting tau pathology with three clinical assets targeting extracellular tau with an antibody or intracellular tau with an ASO. We begin 2021 with an expanded and diversified pipeline and we anticipate eight mid to late stage readouts by the end of this year. These include four pivotal and four Phase 2 readouts across a number of therapeutic areas characterized by significant unmet medical needs, such as ALS, stroke and the new Phase 3 programs in MDD and PPD with Sage. We also expect significant milestone across our core business this year. In MS, we are launching intramuscular PLEGRIDY and we are planning for the potential launch of subcutaneous TYSABRI as well as important data on extended interval dosing in the middle of the year. As we build for the medium to long-term, we aim to scale our digital capabilities to further meet the need of patients. As part of our vision to lead in Alzheimer's disease, we are excited to be collaborating with Apple to develop potential digital biomarkers that may aid in diagnosing and monitoring disease progression at the earlier stage of cognitive decline. I want to reiterate our commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders and bring innovative therapies to patients over the long-term. This demands that we continue to allocate capital efficiently, effectively and appropriately. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will always strive to have an optimal capital structure as well as aiming for superior returns from the investment we make. Lastly, I would like to reflect upon Biogen's long standing commitment to corporate responsibility. Our dedication to patients and the broader society is not only limited to developing novel therapeutics for patients suffering from serious diseases, but extends much further. At Biogen, we take a holistic view of health and strive to improve the broader society we serve. Now, more than ever, we continue to invest in climate and health, access and equity as well as diversity and inclusion. In closing, I would like to thank our employees around the world who have demonstrated dedication to making a positive impact on patients' life and all of the physicians, caregivers and participants in our clinical development programs our past and future achievements could not be realized without a passion and commitment. We will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. And Matthew, you may be muted. Please unmute your line. Maxwell Skor : Oh, sorry about that. This is Max Skor on the line for Matthew Harrison. Can you elaborate on the design of the RESPONSE study? How do you define suboptimal response to gene therapy? And what are your expectations around how long it will take to enroll the study? Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you for the question. I will answer. It demonstrates basically our commitment to best inform clinical practice based on the new modalities that we have for the good and for the benefit of patients. It was also our mindset in terms of having SPINRAZA as the foundation of care in SMA treatment. Al? Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Yes. The RESPONSE study and will enroll about 60 patients. It's based on physician determination that RESPONSE is suboptimal based, for example, on CHOP INTEND scores. And in the future, we may also be advocating for other measurements of suboptimal response. But yes, it'll be a 2-year study and we'll look to see whether motor milestones based on scale, such as the Hammersmith score are improved by adding a SPINRAZA. Operator : We will now move to our next question. We'll hear from Terrence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I just had a two part one. I was just wondering if you can, Michel, maybe provide any perspective on the decision here to include aducanumab approval in your guidance. And then anything you can share at this point regarding your pricing strategy broadly. I know you're probably not going to give specifics, but can you just talk high level? Do you see this more as a specialty price drug versus a primary care biologic and any early read from payers? Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : Providing the guidance it's basically the best reflection on how we see the business moving forward. Even these are assumptions that we decide on, that may not represent the reality moving forward, which is basically the business in which we are. But this is the best belief that we have, while we speak. Concerning price, we are getting there. We had very large engagements with many stakeholders. And basically, there are two main dimensions. The first one is the clinical meaningfulness, and potentially in terms of cognitive functions, but also functional aspects on activity of daily living. This is one side of the equation. The second one is the cost of Alzheimer's to society, which is nowadays more than $550 billion a year in the U.S. The cost for caring per patient, and if I\u2019m not mistaken, its more than $0.5 million. By the age of 80, 75% of the patients are in nursing home and this costs more than $100,000 a year. And these are the main element that we consider in our wide engagement on the important topic of price we are getting there, as I said, but too early to give more specifics. Operator : We will now move to our next question. We will hear from Marc Goodman with SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Marc Goodman : Yes, good morning. On adu, I'm just -- we're all trying to understand given your close working relationship with the FDA and how long it's been going on and how much data they have already gotten, it's hard for us to understand what else they could possibly need, what they don't know. So I was wondering if there was any type of color you could just give us on that? Was there any data from the EMBARK study that they were asking for? Just any more clarity around the situation would be helpful? And then just secondly, just on the SG&A, $600 million that you're committed to, can you just talk about how the gating of spend is going to be -- is that on launch? Meaning it's all going to be in the second half of the year? Or half of that in the first half of the year? Just trying to understand if adu was not approved in the middle of the year, how much of that spend is actually going to take place? Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : Thanks for the great question. I will take the first part -- sorry, the second part on the SG&A and Al will come back on the data aspect, the important data aspect. So concerning the SG&A, basically we have only one opportunity to potentially launch well such an important product. So we basically, we sought to deliver a major launch for what could be the first product able to deliver meaningful clinical and functional value to patients affected by the disease and these are potentially 10 million patients in the U.S. It's a multibillion opportunity for the company. We resource to win. Al? Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Yes, we've been saying all along that we're under review. And as a normal course, during the review process, there are information requests from FDA. And more recently, we had one that required the submission of additional analyses and clinical data. And that led to a major amendment which led to the PDUFA delay. Beyond that, I don't want to provide too much more detail on to the specifics. Michel Vounatsos : So Mike will provide a bit more color on the part of your second question on the sequence. Michael McDonnell : Yes. So, Marc, good morning. I think it's a couple of points of note. Obviously, we'll gait the spend as best we can in the event that we don't receive approval. You should not expect that we would be able to mitigate 100% of those costs, but we would be able to mitigate a meaningful portion and obviously, we would maximize the amount that we would mitigate. The other point that I would just remind on is that in the U.S., substantially all of the costs that we incur for aducanumab are subject to our agreement with Eisai, which in the U.S is reimbursable at the rate of 45%. And so when you look at the guidance that we gave, the $600 million that's in SG&A, there's about $200 million that would be reimbursable out of that, that would come through on a different line in our P&L on our collaboration sharing line. And the reason why that ratio was a little bit different than you would expect is because the accounting is complex, and it differs a bit pre and post launch. Some of the Eisai reimbursements are actually netted in that $600 million and then the rest come through that collaboration line. But at the end of the day, economically, it is a 45% reimbursement schedule. That's important to remember. Operator : We'll now move to our next caller in the queue. We'll hear from Umer Raffat with Evercore. Go ahead, please. Umer Raffat : Thanks so much for taking my question. Al, I was just looking to understand how you're thinking through the emerging data from EMBARK redosing study. And I guess what I'm wondering is when you look at, for example, the first interim 24-week efficacy results, do you overlay that with the last data point on a patient-by-patient basis coming off of Phase 3? Or are you comparing the curve in that first 24 weeks versus the curve in the first 24 weeks of the EMERGE and ENGAGE Phase 3s? I guess the challenge with that would be that the initial two Phase 3s were dose titrating in the first 24 weeks. I'm just curious how you're thinking about that. Thank you. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Hi, Umer. Yes. Thank you. Yes, well, we're still enrolling EMBARK. We're partway through enrollment. You're right that the first, as presented at the recent meeting that the first analysis is that 6 months roughly. But some of those issues that you just pointed out are good issues that will need to be addressed in the analytical plan. But, yes, we're still enrolling patients. It's an important study and we should be hopefully completing enrollment soon in the first half or so of this year. Operator : We'll now move on to our next question. We'll hear from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Cory Kasimov : Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. Good morning, guys. I guess, AI just a follow-up on the EMBARK question. Is -- are you taking looks at this where if the FDA needed or was requesting information, you'd be able to provide it to them? And then I just wanted to ask if you can kind of frame this pending Phase 2 read out for your anti-tau antibody BIIB092 that's coming up here in the first half kind of remind us of the trial design what you're hoping to show here. Thank you. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Yes, thanks, Cory. Yes, so we will endeavor to provide FDA whatever they asked for in their information request. And if that requires -- looks at trials that are still enrolling or are still ongoing, we will do so. In terms of BIIB092, what we're looking for is an effect on Alzheimer's progression in this largely early stage patients. BIIB092 is -- has shown in Phase 1 trials to have a substantial decrease in extracellular tau. And so -- and the hypothesis is that we're going to block the spread of tau from cell to cell. It's a hypothesis that there's a prime like spread of tau in Alzheimer's disease. So we're going to see over the course of about 1-year, whether or not we affect the progression of Alzheimer's disease using the typical clinical outcome measures. Operator : Now moving on to our next caller in the queue, Evan Seigerman, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Evan Seigerman : Hi, all. Thank you so much for taking the question. So I'm referencing a comment you made earlier, Al, talking about 2021 being a reset year. But taking aducanumab out of the picture, how do revenue and earnings grow in 2022 and beyond? I'm really trying to understand if your outlook and kind of your comments, mainly predicated on aducanumab, there are other significant drivers that we should be thinking about and referencing. Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : Mike? Michael McDonnell : Yes. Thanks very much for the question. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we do believe that we have the ability to grow the company over the longer term. Obviously, aducanumab is the catalyst. But we've also got a lot of other very interesting opportunities. We've got 33 programs, including 10 in Phase 3. As we talked about, 8 readouts in 2021, including four in Phase 3. I would point you to our existing products, which are expanding in a lot of the international markets. Biosimilars, I would say the same. The pipeline is very rich. I think Sage is a great addition and we have others. So, obviously, aducanumab is the catalyst, but we do believe that we have the ability to grow the company for the longer term based on what we have in the pipeline and the other pieces that I just mentioned. Michel Vounatsos : So we expect many readouts this year. So that's why I qualified the year as being transformative. Even if there is a financial reset, transformative in terms of data readouts which is somehow unprecedented for the company with four Phase 3, and four Phase 2s. And in terms of the largest potential based on epidemiology is certainly MDD and PPD. So we -- for which the late stage, they had positive readouts in randomized studies in PPD, and MDD, and we are hopeful. And beyond those, there is EYLEA [ph] and ALS in Phase 3. But beyond aducanumab, we have this pipeline progressing very well. And the core business is solid, it's resilient and we count on that. Financially, we are sitting on cash and we can continue to complement this pipeline. So there are plenty of reasons to believe. Operator : We will now move to our next caller, Michael Yee with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Michael Yee : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to ask, Al, as a follow-up to his comments around Lily. Whether you believe that data is growing confidence for the scientific community and possibly the regulators, they had a very interesting design, but they also used a different endpoint. And obviously this brought people over to placebo. So maybe you could just follow on, Al, with some of those comments and how you're thinking about that as it relates to even people in the Alzheimer's community who are pretty outspoken about a-beta. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Yes, I think it's helping to support the amyloid hypothesis and supports the concept of targeting amyloid in Alzheimer's disease in the early stages. Lily began working on this antibody, they started publishing on this back in 2012. When they found that to remove preexisting plaque they had to go after -- they had to use an antibody that would get into the -- that would get to the plaque and they showed in animals that the pyroglu-specific anybody achieved that. And they now have confirmed that you get the same thing in humans by amyloid PET imaging. I think it's great to see that they also seem to show an effect on clinical decline. They use a composite measure of ADAS-Cog and IADL, which I think they did because it's a somewhat small study. I think it's like a couple of hundred patients, 200 or 300 patients. And so, they had to use a more sensitive endpoint. But it is composed of endpoints that we all recognize in the Alzheimer's field as being important endpoints for the measurement of the disease. So, I think it adds to the body of evidence that suggests that targeting amyloid with the right antibody to get to the plaque and remove plaque is the right approach. Operator : We will now take our next question from Paul Matteis with Stifel. Paul Matteis : Hey, great. Thanks so much for taking question. I was wondering if you could talk about where you are in refining some of the kind of key real-world elements for the usability of aducanumab? Specifically, I think in studies you had six MRIs in the first year. Is that something you expect to be the case in the real world if this is approved? And if so, what can you do on your end to actually make this more usable beyond just kind of a small number of core academic centers that have these intrinsic capabilities? Thanks a lot. Michel Vounatsos : Al? Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Yes, so MRI is useful for monitoring ARIA, and we do expect that there will be MRI monitoring requirements once aducanumab is approved, if it's approved. But the quantity and the timing will require further discussions with regulators around the world. Michel Vounatsos : Yes. Concerning the launch sequence, we are obviously starting with the most important high-volume centers that are getting ready to treat. And as mentioned earlier, these are hundreds and this is already substantial. Keep in mind that there is an amyloid beta confirmation most probably that will have to be done, and obviously over time we will expand down the pyramid to larger targets. Operator : Our next question will come from Phil Nadeau with Cowen & Company. Phil Nadeau : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. One on financials. In SPINRAZA's U.S. trends, it looks like there was about a 34% decline in Q4 '20 versus Q4 '19. You referenced COVID and then also competition in those trends. Curious if you could quantify the impact of COVID, and so how much will rebound once the pandemic subsides versus competition and the patients that might be lost more permanently? Thanks. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you for the question. And we are watching this trend very carefully. And I will start and then Mike will add. First of all, we are pleased with $2.1 billion overall revenue for SPINRAZA in 2020 despite COVID. So in the U.S., the majority of the impact is COVID, as per the input from the team. Patients are scared to go to the centers, so they delay the dosing. Some sites have been closed or limited capacity or staffing in order to dose the patients. And last but not least, COVID is accelerating some switches to alternative treatments that exists. We've seen the peak of switch in September, and then we've seen a decline of those. And we've seen also, very encouragingly for us, some patients deciding to return to SPINRAZA for reasons of efficacy, perceived efficacy, for reasons of side effects. And last but not least, following the spike of launch, we've seen a rebound in demand for SPINRAZA towards the end of the year. Mike? Michael McDonnell : Yes. Not a lot to add to that. I would say that we would describe it as, in the U.S. competition, which is exacerbated by COVID, we are still growing outside of the U.S. Obviously, in a pandemic that makes the idea of an oral more attractive, because you can avoid coming to a health care facility. So, the idea that somebody would switch from an injection to an oral becomes more prominent in our current environment, and conversely it's a little less likely that somebody would switch off of an oral to an injection in that situation. So the impacts that we saw in the fourth quarter in the U.S., we would attribute it all to competition exacerbated by COVID. How much of each is a little bit hard to parse out exactly, but it is both. And I think at the end of the day, the important point is that we continue to really believe in the efficacy of SPINRAZA and its safety profile, and we do believe it will continue to become -- it will remain a very important treatment option, particularly once we get through the pandemic. Michel Vounatsos : So we remain hopeful for SPINRAZA. Again, this is a very important asset. As we said many times, it's an efficacy play, and hopefully with the rates of vaccination, this will be better reflected into the drug utilization rather than a perceived convenience. At the end of the day, the SUNFISH data remains -- the part two of SUNFISH remains, one out of two patients experiencing disease progression and our product remains extremely well documented with broadest label and we continue to invest in innovative research. Operator : We'll now move to Jay Olson with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Jay Olson : Good morning and thank you for taking the question. You spoke about the positive read across from Lilly's Phase 2 data for donanemab. Can you please remind us how the finding profile, the specificity and PK profile for aducanumab compares to donanemab? Thank you. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Yes. This is Al. So aducanumab binds to aggregated forms of a-beta, both soluble oligomers as well as insoluble fibrils. And as such, since both are concentrated in the plaque, aducanumab binds to the plaque. It was actually initially discovered based on amyloid plaque immunoreactivity assay. And by targeting the plaque, it removes amyloid quite efficiently in the brain. Donanemab binds to the pyroglutamated form of a a-beta, which is present early in plaque. It's thought to kind of seize the plaque, if you will, and it forms part of the dense core. So in that way it targets plaque as well. So, different ways of targeting the plaque essentially. In terms of PK, I don't know too much about the PK of donanemab, but I suspect since it's an antibody. It has roughly similar characteristics to other monochrome antibodies, roughly half life of two weeks, et cetera. Operator : We will now move to our next question. We will hear from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist. Please go ahead. Robyn Karnauskas : Good job. Thanks guys for taking my question. Another one for you, Al, on donanemab. So the CFO of Lilly had mentioned that given the unique clearing mechanism, that it could have the potential to provide high levels of plaque clearance after limited duration dosing. And I was just curious as think about the competitive landscape assuming aducanumab is approved, how -- do you see intermittent dosing as being competitive to aducanumab? And how do you think the competitive landscape can shape up with that profile? Thanks. Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: Yes. Thanks, Robyn. It's going to be interesting. I think it's a large market and I think it'll accommodate multiple therapeutic options, which hopefully will be available for patients. The concept of intermediate dosing or down-dosing perhaps after changing a dose, after plaque removal, is an interesting one. It's something that can be tested and is being evaluated across multiple drugs, aducanumab, BAN2401, as well as donanemab. I would say that one thing is, there's the effect on neurodegeneration with respect to plaque removal, but there may also be other effects, more acute effects. When you listen to patients in particular, you may have heard at the FDA Advisory Committee, that patients seem to have untoward effects after stopping aducanumab, and then they regain some of these benefits after restarting in a relatively short period of time. And that's -- and something similar has been seen with other antibodies, including BAN2401. That second piece maybe something more associated with synaptic function, which may be more associated with the soluble oligomer side of things and I think that will remain to be learned about in future studies. Operator : Looks like we have time for one final question. We will now hear from Salim Syed with Mizuho. Salim Syed : Great. Thanks for all the color, guys. Appreciate all the color on aducanumab as well specifically. Al, just one for me on donanemab as well. So when I go back to the FDA AdComm docs, and this is a line in there in the quote, this anti-amyloid beta antibodies cannot be considered as a signal class. They are distinct at the molecular level and the differences have an impact on their mechanism of action, including eminent lists, including binding characteristics et cetera. That was a pretty strong point that the FDA had made in the briefing docs. And it seems like now you're saying that donanemab is helping the case. So, I'm just curious how all this is getting reconciled. Should people be looking at beta-amyloid antibodies as a single class or not? Alfred Sandrock, Jr.: No. That's a really good question and I tried to sort of make that point in my prepared comments this morning. But the first generation of antibodies did not really target the amyloid plaque. For example, solanezumab, which was a Lilly antibody, bound to monosoluable monomeric amyloid -- a-beta. And if you read the 2012 paper on the plaque-specific antibody, they were concerned that such an antibody will not get to the plaque and remove plaque, pre-existing plaque. So even while they had solanezumab in development, Lilly began working on a plaque-specific antibody. And so, I think that's what those FDA documents might've been pointing to, that it's not just that you have an anti-amyloid antibody. You have to have those that will target the plaque and remove pre-existing amyloid plaque in patients. I think also bapineuzumab, bapineuzumab was nonselective. It bound to soluble monomeric as well as insoluble aggregated forms of amyloid as well as soluble aggregated. And that led to issues with dosing. And so, I think that's what they meant is perhaps solanezumab and bapineuzumab may not have shown clinical efficacy for these kinds of reasons, but I think we should not assume that this next generation of antibodies that target the plaque better. Look, we all learned from the early studies, right? And so, I think donanemab is another example where those that target the plaque and remove amyloid robustly in humans. And if you study early stage patients, selected for carefully, you will see efficacy. Michel Vounatsos : Okay. So we believe 2021 will be a transformative year for Biogen, and I want to thank you all for your attention to our call. Have a good day. Operator : And with that, ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude your conference for today. We do thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen First Quarter Earnings Call and Financial Update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hencke, Director, Investor Relations. Mr. Hencke, you may begin your conference. Mike Hencke : Good morning, and welcome to Biogen's first quarter 2021 earnings call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including our GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2, and Table 4 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Al Sandrock, Head of Research and Development; and our CFO, Mike McDonnell. As a reminder, during the Q&A portion of the call, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question. I will now turn the call over to Michel. Michel Vounatsos : Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. With a strong focus on operation and execution we have continued to serve patients and advance our strategic priorities. While we know that 2021 will be a financial researcher for the company, we are pleased with our operational performance during Q1 with first quarter total revenues of $2.7 billion and first quarter non-GAAP ES of $5.34. These results were driven by solid performance across MS, SMA, and biosimilars together with continued strong cost management. We are ready to launch aducanumab in the U.S. should we receive a regulatory approval, and we anticipate an FDA decision by the June 7 PDUFA date. If approved, aducanumab will be the first therapy to meaningfully change the cost of Alzheimer's disease and will represent a significant growth and value creation opportunity. Our cross functional team in the U.S. has been working for months in preparation for the potential launch of aducanumab. We have identified and evaluated key sites of care that have the necessary infrastructure for Alzheimer's patients. We believe that more than 600 of these sites will be ready to treat patients shortly after a potential approval. Our team is currently working to evaluate the capacity at these and other sites to absorb an influx of Alzheimer's patients. Together with Eisai, we were pleased to support us against Alzheimer's in the development of BrainGuide, a platform which is powered by Amazon Web Services. BrainGuide aims to increase brain health awareness and empower people to take action based upon responses to a memory questionnaire. We hope that BrainGuide along with our collaboration with Apple, aiming to identify digital biomarkers of cognitive health will enable people to seek care sooner in order to maximize the benefits of treatment. We are also working to ensure an equitable launch to facilitate broad access to aducanumab, should it be approved including underserved population, a critical issue that has been highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic. I am pleased to announce that outside the U.S., we recently submitted additional regulatory filings in Brazil, Canada, Switzerland, and Australia, adding to our earlier submissions in Europe and Japan. Turning to our progress towards our strategic priorities first, Q1 overall MS revenue, including OCREVUS royalties was $1.7 billion. Putting aside the entry of TECFIDERA generic the U.S., our broader MS business continue to demonstrate resilience and progress, excluding TECFIDERA in the U.S., the number of patients on our MS products worldwide increased approximately 5% versus the prior year. Importantly, in the current COVID-19 environment, we believe our MS products are well-positioned versus the competition based on our current treatment guidelines. We were very pleased to see strong revenue growth for VUMERITY, which is now the number one oral MS product in terms of new prescription in the U.S. We believe this performance is a testament to a strong product profile and our team's ability to execute well. Validating our plan, announced mid-last year to accelerate the launch of VUMERITY. We are also excited that TECFIDERA recently received a regulatory approval in China. Furthermore, we continue to advance new approaches to help address the remaining unmet medical need in MS. This quarter, we launched an intramuscular formulation of PLEGRIDY in both the U.S. and EU, which we believe offers an improved tolerability profile, and we obtain approval for subcutaneous administration of TYSABRI in the EU, with the first expected launch in Germany, while we await a regulatory decision in the U.S. We also continue to advance the potential use of extended interval dosing for TYSABRI, with important data expected in the middle of this year. Second, SPINRAZA generated first quarter global revenues of $521 million, while SPINRAZA is facing competition in the U.S., which has been exacerbated by the impacts of COVID-19 we were encouraged to see that SPINRAZA discontinuation decreased versus Q4 of last year. Outside the U.S. been SPINRAZA continued to perform very well with 13% revenue growth versus Q1 of last year. Overall, SPINRAZA remains the market leading treatment for SMA and we believe it will remain a foundation of care. Third, our biosimilars business delivered revenue of $205 million. We are pleased with this performance as the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a slowdown in new treatment starts and reduced clinic capacity for immunology patients in Europe. We aim to continue to grow our biosimilars business and create additional financial headroom for innovation by launching new products. To that end, we recently announced the collaboration with Bio-Thera Solutions to develop and commercialize BAT1806, a proposed biosimilars referencing ACTEMRA, currently in Phase 3 development. Biogen will have the right to commercialize BAT1806 globally in countries outside of China, which will expand our global biosimilars footprint. Fourth, this quarter, we continue to meaningfully progress on our pipeline. We reported Phase 2 data in essential tremor, and we expect seven additional mid-to-late stage readouts this year. Gene therapy represents a key area of focus for Biogen as we continue to pursue multiple modalities. To this end, we recently announced our plan to build a new state of the art gene therapy manufacturing facility at our RTP site in North Carolina. Fifth, our cash flow generation remains strong and continue to provide us with significant flexibility to allocate capital in Q1. We generated approximately $769 million in cash flow from operations and 676 million in free cash flow. As we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to maximizing returns to our shareholders as we aim to bring innovative therapies to patients. I will now turn the call over to Al, for a more detailed update on our recent progress in R&D. Al Sandrock : Thank you, Michel and good morning everyone. As always, I'd like to start by thanking the Biogen team for their hard work as we continue to advance our R&D programs. We achieved a number of key milestones this quarter and we look forward to seven additional readouts anticipated this year, including pivotal trials in major depressive disorder, postpartum depression, ALS, and choroideremia. Let me now turn to the advances we made across our pipeline in the first quarter. Starting with Alzheimer's disease, as Michel mentioned, this quarter we submitted additional regulatory filings for aducanumab in Brazil, Switzerland, Canada, and Australia. Together with our prior filings in the U.S., EU, and Japan, we have now submitted filings in seven key geographies, and continue to engage with regulators as they review the aducanumab data. Turning to the lecanemab or BAN2401, our collaboration partner Eisai has recently enrolled the last patient in the Phase 3 clarity study in early Alzheimer's disease. We look forward to the readout in Q3 of next year. Additionally, we plan to present detailed results from the Phase 1b study of BIIB080 in mild-Alzheimer's disease at the upcoming AAIC meeting later this year. BIIB080 is a tau-targeted antisense oligonucleotide that aims to reduce the production of all forms of tau both intracellular and extracellular. The Phase 1b study demonstrated that BIIB080 was generally well-tolerated and resulted in a dose and time dependent reduction from baseline in CSF total tau and phospho-tau with durability of effect. We are currently finalizing plans to advance BIIB080 into a Phase 2 study in Alzheimer's disease. Moving to MS, we are presenting new data across our portfolio at the AAN meeting this week. An updated analysis of data from the TOUCH Prescribing Program of TYSABRI showed an 88% reduction in the risk of PML when used with extended interval dosing or EID, as compared with standard interval dosing. This supports previous findings that showed that EID is associated with a lower incidence of PML. We continue to generate state of the art real world data through MS PATHS. In MS PATHS, Biogen is collaborating with 10 leading MS centers in the U.S. and Europe to generate standardized quantitative data from a diverse MS patient population as they are being seen in the clinic. More than 17,000 patients have been enrolled in MS PATHS to date and we aim to use quantitative measurements across a range of key clinical dimensions, high position MRI measurements of MS disease activity, patient reported data using a validated quality of life instrument, led biomarkers such as neurofilament, and electronic health records to obtain a more holistic view of MS and gain insights on how currently approved drugs are affecting real world outcomes. Moreover, with the use of modern analytical methods, such as machine learning, we hope to make new discoveries about the key subtypes and stages of MS, as well as its pathogenesis. At the AAN meeting, we were showing data from the MS PATHS that showed that extended interval dosing of TYSABRI may maintain comparable efficacy to standard interval dosing, as assessed by the rate of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions on MRI scans, quantified by advanced image analysis software, which we developed in collaboration with Siemens. A prospective study of the efficacy of extended interval dosing is being assessed in the ongoing NOVA study, from which we expect top line results around mid-year. Also being presented at AAN, another study leveraging data collected using MS PATHS demonstrated that TYSABRI can lead to clinically meaningful improvements in aspects of mental and social health, as assessed by the neuro qual, a validated instrument that that evaluates physical, mental and social effects reported by patients with neurological disorders. For 11 of the 12 domains tested, the adjusted rate of improvement was greater for patients treated with TYSABRI than for those treated with OCREVUS. Also being presented at AAN is the first real world analysis of VUMERITY treated patients. The retrospective study of 160 patients found that overall persistence was high, with 88% of individuals remaining on VUMERITY at eight months, and that treatment discontinuation due to GI adverse events was low at 3.8%. These results follow a recent publication of EVOLVE-MS-2, a Phase 3 5-week randomized multicenter study that assessed the GI tolerability of VUMERITY and TECFIDERA using self administered questionnaires. The study demonstrated that only 9.5% of VUMERITY treated patients indicated that GI symptoms interfered quite a bit or extremely with regular activities, as compared to almost 29% of TECFIDERA patients. We believe that the differentiated tolerability profile of VUMERITY will lead to improved adherence to therapy. In addition to our established treatments, we aim to leverage our MS pipeline to address the remaining unmet need in MS. This includes our oral remyelination program BIIB061, our oral BTK inhibitor BIIB091, as well as our next generation anti-VLA4 antibody that seeks to build on the success of TYSABRI in the high efficacy space. Turning to neuromuscular disorders, we are presenting an update on the ongoing DEVOTE study testing a higher dose of SPINRAZA at the AAN meeting this week. Data from the patients enrolled in the Part A openLabel safety evaluation cohort, followed for up to approximately five months were consistent with the well-characterized safety profile of the currently approved 12 milligram dose of SPINRAZA. The emerging safety profile of the higher dose supports its continued development as we evaluate the potential for greater efficacy. We also added an additional cohort to the Phase 1 study of BIIB078, our C9ORF ASO for ALS. Safety data has been supportive of escalating the dose, enabling us to conduct a more complete evaluation of the therapeutic index. The Phase 1 study, containing the additional cohort is now expected to readout in the first half of next year. In neuropsychiatry, last month, Sage Therapeutics released an interim analysis of the ongoing openLabel Phase 3 SHORELINE naturalistic study of zuranolone in major depressive disorder. The data showed that in the completed 30 milligram zuranolone cohort, approximately 70% of participants with a positive response to an initial two week treatment required at most one additional zuranolone treatment during the one-year study. SHORELINE also showed that following the two-week treatment, more than 70% of patients in the 30-milligram cohort and 80% of patients in the 50-milligram cohort achieved a positive response as evaluated by the 17 item Hamilton rating scale for depression. In both the 30 milligram and 50 milligram cohorts, SHORELINE demonstrated an adverse event profile consistent with previously reported data. Adverse events, including somnolence, dizziness, and sedation were observed to be more frequent in the 50 milligram cohort, but were similar in severity to events seen with the 30 milligram treatment of zuranolone. We believe these data further supports the potential therapeutic effective of zuranolone, and we look forward to the readout of the waterfall study of zuranolone in major depressive disorder anticipated later this quarter. Next, I would like to turn to movement disorders. In collaboration with SAGE, we recently announced that SAGE-324, also known as BIIB124 met the primary endpoint of a statistically significant reduction from baseline, compared to placebo in the upper limb tremor score on pre-specified components of the essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale or TETRAS at day 29. This corresponded to a 36% reduction from baseline in upper limb tremor amplitude in patients receiving BIIB124, compared to our 21% reduction with placebo. BIIB124 also demonstrated a safety profile consistent with previously reported data. This trial was designed to test the high-end of the dose range established in Phase 1 studies, 60 milligrams. In an effort to determine whether or not proof of concept could be established in essential tremor BIIB124 clearly shows efficacy in essential tremor, but at this dose, the incidence of somnolence was 68%, but 62% of patients going to a lower dose and 38% of patients discontinuing treatment. We are working closely with SAGE to plan next steps for the development of BIIB124. The unmet need in tremor, essential tremor is significant. There have been no new drugs approved for essential tremor in more than five decades. The drugs currently used to treat essential tremor have tolerability issues of their own, which limits their use in clinical practice. We believe more can be done to help patients with this most common movement disorder that interferes with activities of daily living and hampers social engagement. In Parkinson's disease, the Phase 1 and Phase 1b studies of BIIB122, a small molecule LRRK2 inhibitor are now complete, and the safety and biomarker goals were achieved, which we believe support continued development of BIIB122. As previously announced with our collaboration partner Denali, we expect to initiate late stage clinical development in Parkinson's disease patients by the end of this year. Our R&D organization delivered a number of important milestones in the first quarter of the year. We believe there's much to be excited about with seven additional readouts expected by the end of the year, including pivotal readouts in major depressive disorder, postpartum depression, ALS, and choroideremia. I will now pass the call over to Mike. Mike McDonnell : Thank you, Al. Biogen had another solid quarter despite the challenges from TECFIDERA, U.S. generics, and COVID-19 as we continue to execute well, across our core businesses. We remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial capacity; continue to grow the business over the long-term. I will now review our financial performance for the quarter and share with you an update to our full-year guidance for 2021. Total revenue for the first quarter of $2.7 billion declined 24% versus the prior year at actual currency and 25% at constant currency. This decline was mostly driven by the continued impact of TECFIDERA generics in the United States. Total MS revenue for the first quarter, including OCREVUS royalties of $1.7 billion decreased 26% versus the prior year at both actual and at constant currency. This decline was also driven by the continued impact of TECFIDERA generics in the US. Excluding U.S. TECFIDERA, total MS revenue, including OCREVUS royalties were relatively flat, demonstrating the resilience of our MS business in a competitive market. Global TECFIDERA revenue for the first quarter of $479 million declined 56% versus the prior year. Outside of the U.S., first quarter TECFIDERA revenue of $317 million declined 2% versus the prior year. Normalizing for accelerated shipments due to COVID-19 of approximately $28 million in Q1 of 2020, revenue outside the U.S. increased 7% with continued patient growth. During the quarter, we saw continued improvement in VUMERITY trends. VUMERITY revenue was $74 million in the first quarter and is now the number one MS oral product in terms of new prescription share in the U.S. TYSABRI first quarter global revenue of $503 million declined 4% versus the prior year. As a reminder, in Q1 of 2020, TYSABRI revenue benefited by approximately $40 million, due to a combination of extra shipping days in the U.S., and the pricing adjustment in Italy. Normalizing for these dynamics revenue grew 4% year-over-year, as we saw a 5% increase in global TYSABRI patients. We continue to believe TYSABRI is well-positioned to play an increasingly important role in the treatment of MS as we progress several important initiatives, including subcutaneous administration, and extended interval dosing. Moving now to SMA. Global first quarter SPINRAZA revenue of $521 million decreased 8% versus the prior year at actual currency and 12% at constant currency, although we were pleased to see 5% growth in global SPINRAZA patients versus the prior year. In the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue decreased 37% versus the prior year as we continue to see impact from competition exacerbated by the impacts of COVID-19. Outside the U.S. SPINRAZA revenue grew 13% versus the prior year, including approximately $40 million, due to timing of shipments in Q1 of 2021. Moving now to our biosimilars business, first quarter revenue of $205 million decreased 6% versus the prior year at actual currency, and 13% at constant currency. Normalizing for accelerated shipments due to COVID-19 of approximately 15 million in Q1 of 2020, revenue was flat year-over-year.  Our biosimilars business continues to be negatively impacted by pricing pressure, as well as a slowdown in new treatments and reduced clinic capacity due to COVID-19. Despite the continued impact of COVID-19, we continue to be the leading anti-TNF biosimilar provider in Europe and BENEPALI continues to be the number one prescribed etanercept product across Europe. We believe we have the opportunity to continue to grow in Europe, as well as within the U.S and other geographies by commercializing new products.  Total anti-CD20 revenue in the first quarter of $389 million decreased 25% versus the prior year. RITUXAN revenue decreased approximately 50% versus the prior year, partially offset by a 29% increase in OCREVUS royalties. We expect continued erosion of RITUXAN due to biosimilars. Turning now to gross margin, first quarter gross margin was 82% of revenue, down versus 83% in the prior quarter and down versus 87% in Q1 of 2020. The continued reduction in gross margin was primarily due to the declines in TECFIDERA and RITUXAN, both of which are high margin products. We expect to continue to experience downward pressure on gross margins. Moving to expenses and the balance sheet, first quarter non-GAAP R&D expense was $514 million. First quarter non-GAAP SG&A was $595 million, including approximately $75 million related to the launch preparations for aducanumab, net of reimbursement from Eisai. In the first quarter of this year, our effective non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 16% versus approximately 17% in the first quarter of 2020. During the first quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of the company's common stock for $600 million. As of March 31, 2021, there was $4 billion remaining under the share repurchase program authorized in October of 2020, and we expect to utilize a portion of this throughout the remainder of the year. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 152 million shares for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the first quarter was $5.34. In the first quarter, we generated approximately $769 million in cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures were $93 million and free cash flow was approximately $676 million. We ended the quarter with $7.3 billion in debt, and $3.4 billion in cash and marketable securities, resulting in $3.9 billion in net debt. In addition, our $1 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn as of the end of the quarter. Let me now turn to our updated full-year guidance for 2021. Our full-year 2021 revenue guidance remains at $10.45 billion to $10.75 billion despite unfavorable currency dynamics, which I will explain in a moment. We are increasing our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance from our previous range of $17 to $18.50 to a range of between $17.50 to $19. Our capital expenditure guidance is unchanged at $375 million to $425 million. This financial guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates as of March 31, 2021 will remain in effect for the remainder of the year, net of hedging activities. It is important to note that we are reaffirming our revenue guidance despite an expected currency headwind of approximately $80 million net of hedging activities to our full-year 2021 revenue guidance, due primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar from January 1 of 2021 through March 31 of 2021. Our guidance continues to assume that aducanumab will be approved in the U.S. by June 7 of 2021, although uncertainty remains on the FDA\u2019s decision. If aducanumab is approved in the U.S., we would expect an immediate launch. However, dose titration will result in less revenue per patient in the initial months of treatment, and as a result, we would expect only modest revenue for aducanumab in 2021 ramping thereafter. We continue to expect rapid erosion of our U.S. TECFIDERA business, as well as significant erosion of RITUXAN in the U.S. We expected that the decreased revenue from these high margin products will put pressure on our gross margin percentage. Note that our gross margin in Q1 2021 was 82% of revenue, which reflects this dynamic. We now expect full-year non-GAAP R&D expenses will be between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion, and non-GAAP SG&A expenses will be between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. This guidance reflects our expectation that both R&D and SG&A will increase beginning in the second quarter, due to new collaborations, program readouts, and aducanumab investments as we prepare for the potential launch. Our full-year SG&A estimate continues to include an approximate $600 million investment in support of the potential launch of aducanumab. Of this amount, approximately $200 million would be reimbursable by Eisai and would be reflected as collaboration profit sharing post commercialization, and not part of SG&A. We expect we will utilize a portion of the remaining share repurchase authorization of $4 billion throughout the year, although this will depend on a variety of factors, including our business development activities. We have not included any impact from potential tax or healthcare reform or any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions in our guidance. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you, Mike. Biogen continue to demonstrate resilience and strong execution in the first quarter of the year. And we believe we remain on track to make 2021 a transformative year for the company. This of course starts with a potential approval of aducanumab in the U.S. The unmet need and cost to society for Alzheimer\u2019s disease are tremendous and mounting. Alzheimer\u2019s creates a cost burden of over $600 billion per year in the U.S., and the cost for caring for Alzheimer's patients can be over half a million dollars. Alzheimer's deprives many patients of their independence. By the age of 80, approximately 75% of people with Alzheimer's disease leaving the nursing home at a probation cost of approximately $100,000 per year. The potential approval of aducanumab will be an unprecedented milestone for patients, their families, and society at large. Beyond aducanumab, we continue to advance our neuroscience pipeline as we work to create a multi-franchise portfolio. We look forward to the seven expected mid-to-late stage readouts this year. Across a range of therapeutic areas such as Alzheimer's disease, ALS, ophthalmology, depression, and stroke including four in Phase 3. I want to reiterate our commitment to maximizing returns to our shareholders and bringing innovative therapies to patients over the long-term. These demands that we continue to allocate capital efficiently and effectively, while maintaining operational discipline and managing costs. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will always strive to have an optimal capital secure, as well as aim for super returns from the investment we make. Lastly, I would like to reflect upon Biogen\u2019s long standing commitment to corporate responsibility. Our dedication to patients and the broader society is not only limited to developing novel therapeutics for patients suffering from serious diseases, but extends much further. At Biogen, we work with purpose to advance science to address the urgent and long-term challenge facing humanity. Now, more than ever, we continue to strengthen environmental, social, and governance priorities across the company. To underscore this commitment, we have decided to incorporate an ESG metric into our corporate scorecard to help ensure that we accelerate actions across these critical issues. In closing, I would like to thank our employees around the world who have demonstrated the dedication to making a positive impact on patient\u2019s lives, and all of the physician caregivers and participants in our clinical development programs. We are living through challenging times with COVID-19 and our achievements could not be realized without a passion and commitment. We will now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Yee of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Michael Yee : Hey, guys, good morning and thanks for the question. It sounds like you remain quite optimistic about a potential approval for adu, I was just wondering if you could make some comments about the work you've done with both sites and payers? I know that if this does get approved, there's a lot of uncertainty around pet reimbursement and logistics and MRI monitoring and things of that nature, so could you just maybe comment about the work you've done there and how confident you are that that will be fairly smooth? Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : Thanks for the question, Michael. The focus of the team since many months in the U.S. was first to identify and assist the sites of care in terms of infrastructure advice and processes because we anticipate that there will be, if approved a very large influx of patients. We know that the availability of specialists and diagnosis capabilities are a bottleneck. So, we had to prepare the sides of care, and we have worked all around the country in order to identify those today.  We anticipate approximately 600 ready to treat, but many more on the works. So, this work was managed by a cross functional team and obviously we started with the medical engagement and scientific leadership. And we are pleased with where we are in terms of those sites, and the ability to welcome the patients, to diagnose the patients, to dose the patients, to monitor the patients, including the fine processes such as [formula releasing], who is in-charge of what?  So the team has done a very thorough work, and I am pleased with the progress each time I review the operation in the U.S. and the launch readiness. We are bridging, we are passing some new milestones. I am also pleased with the digital capability that is an overlay of reach contact and [awareness building] towards different stakeholders, not only the physicians, but also the patients and end-patient services. As you know, so far, neither PET nor CSF amyloid are reimbursed in the U.S. CSF is reimbursed in Europe, not in the U.S., but we believe there is a path forward. Concerning price, I think that we are there, Mike. We have done a thorough, you know, engagement with different stakeholders considering the burden of the disease and the clinical meaningfulness that aducanumab will bring.  And we have engaged with pharmacoeconomics, including ICER, many times and others in the U.S. and beyond. So, I think that the team is ready. And I'm pleased with the progress. And actually, the three months edition were like a gift for the team, because we are never fully ready for such a launch. And I must also appreciate the collaboration from Eisai in this launch readiness. Michael Yee : Yeah. Perfect. Look forward to it. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ronny Gal of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Ronny Gal : Hi. Good morning, everybody and thanks for taking the call. I one on TECFIDERA, to the extent that you are successful in prosecuting the appeal or getting an [usual patent], can you discuss how that will impact the market? That is, I know you got a few settlements, and I'm wondering if those products were going to stay on the market or will they have to exit the market if you \u2013 basically your agreements \u2013 if you're able to win the appeal? Mike McDonnell : Yeah. So Ronny it\u2019s Mike. Thank you for the question. And, you know, as we said, we do expect to hear something on the appeal in the first half of this year. And as we sit here on April 22 that could really come at any time now. There are many generics on the market, as you know. And our legal team has worked extremely hard to try to win this appeal and overturn this decision. To the extent that we are successful, obviously, that would be very good news on winning the appeal, but there would be a push forward from there. And so in order to come up with, you know a quantification of potential financial benefit, it would be premature and it would be hard to calculate immediately. It would be the type of situation where we would get the good news, and we would have to navigate from there on a number of additional steps that we would have to go through to get to, you know, finalization and how the generics that are in the market now would react? It's a little bit hard to predict, before that would actually happen. So, I would say that, obviously, it would be very good day and good news, and we're working very hard, and we believe in our case. But we would have to, sort of evaluate the ruling what it says. And we would communicate more in terms of potential benefits, as soon as we knew what that course looked like. Ronny Gal : Let me sharpen this just a little bit, do you have any settlements that will allow any generic to stay on the market longer-term, even if you win? Mike McDonnell : Yeah, that's not something that we can, you know, kind of comment on with specificity, Ronny. You know, again, yeah, we're \u2013 and I apologize for that. But this is one where, again, we have a great legal team that's working very hard and overturning this appeal and we're very hopeful to hear something very soon and you know, we'll communicate more on exactly what it all means. You know, we\u2019d have to look at the ruling and the specifics and we have to see the reaction of the generics that are in the market before we really could answer that. Ronny Gal : Right. Appreciate it. Mike McDonnell : Thanks for the question. Operator : Our next question comes from Marc Goodman of SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Marc Goodman : Yes. Good morning. Can you give us more color on SPINRAZA outside the United States, and maybe talk about some of the regions that just, you know the underlying trends and what's going on there? And then just at TECFIDERA, China, can you help us, are you booking sales? Is that something that you view as a big opportunity? Thanks. Michel Vounatsos : Thanks for the question. We are very pleased with the performance of SPINRAZA ex-U.S. and I'm also pleased with the performance in the U.S. even if, you know we did face some discontinuation due to the compounded effect of COVID, and also the perceived the enhanced modality with the [indiscernible] the convenience. And so there are lots of learning that are coming from the U.S. to apply to Europe and ex-Europe. We can see a very strong resilience in core European markets, and we can see a very fast momentum of growth in the emerging geographies. So, all-in-all, I am very pleased. I think that moving forward with the pandemic improving with the rate of vaccination, the fear to visit institution will gradually decrease, and the [indiscernible] data continues to reinforce the [indiscernible] that basically the product is not that [difficult issues] for the toddlers above the age of five. The dose limitation because of all the reasons that we all know, basically is set the limit in terms of efficacy, while the weight of the young adult or toddler young adult increase, which is the largest part of the market, and where we have faced some switches.  So obviously, the learning from the U.S. will benefit probably ex-U.S. in an environment where we should have less of the pandemic. I am pleased with the emerging economies where rare diseases were not the priority for so long, and nowadays, you know, on the agenda in terms of resource allocation, so very good momentum. Concerning TECFIDERA, in China, you know, it's a second product approved in China for Biogen and I am delighted about that. As you know, I was posted there for my previous company during four years with my family. And I fundamentally believe into the long-term potential of this market that is already the number two in the world. So, the demand is tremendous. And epidemiology is rapidly emerging with similarities with the one of West. So, incidence is lower for MS, but they are still more than 100,000 patients. The rate of diagnosis and the rate of treatment with the [DMT\u2019s] is extremely low. It's less than 5% of the market. So, disabilities are high, and it gives a great opportunity to establish TECFIDERA together with the rest of the portfolio with a bit more time hopefully. China is an important market for Biogen. We are managing Asia-Pac [with Japan] from China.  We have partnered with a Chinese company on a biosimilar. So it's an invest geography. Obviously, we don't lose the focus on the rest, but good momentum in China, we have a great team, more than 200 people. And it's only the beginning. Thank you for the questions. Operator : We'll take our next question from Yatin Suneja of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Yatin Suneja : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question on zuranolone; can you maybe talk about the expectation from the upcoming waterfall study? The importance of durability, and how should we think about, you know, durability beyond the two-week dosing period? Do you need to [indiscernible] you know, beyond Day 15 and how the powering might be structured after the primary endpoint? Thank you. Al Sandrock : Hi, this is Al. Yeah, so the primary endpoint is the efficacy at Day 15. And, you know, a key secondary endpoint is the durability, if you will at Day 42. And, you know, there's two ways to look at that. One is, does it stay separated from placebo or perhaps more importantly, what happens between Day 15 and Day 42 on the efficacy on HAM-D score in the treated patients.  And so, I think that if you look at prior precedents, the latter is probably more important than the former. But I think both will need to be looked at. And then of course, the key durability comes from the data from SHORELINE, which shows that patients who responded to the initial course of treatment need at most one additional treatment, about 70% needed at most one additional treatment for an entire year. So, I think that both kinds of durability are important. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Umer Raffat of Evercore. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat : Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. Michel, Michael, I would just like to understand the doc repurchase trends better, and I'm specifically looking at over $10 billion worth of repurchases that were done between 4Q 2019 through 3Q 2020 versus around a billion that's been done in 4Q 2020 and 1Q 2021. I'm just trying to understand the drop in magnitude better. And I realize we can't necessarily correlate that to one specific thing, but I would just love to understand the thought process there? Mike McDonnell : Umer it\u2019s Mike. Thanks for the question. So, a couple comments. I would say that, you know, we did buy back $600 million in the quarter and we continue to be very committed to our share repurchase program, and we continue to see our stock as a very accretive investment and we will continue to buy back stock and utilize a portion of the remaining $4 billion authorization throughout the rest of the year, as we said.  You know, if you look back five years, Biogen\u2019s repurchase, something on the order of 71 million shares for a total value of $20 billion. And I would say that we've certainly availed ourselves of a great opportunity there. And I think that you do have to differentiate levels of cash flow prior to the entry of generics for TECFIDERA. Obviously, that was a highly profitable product with a large revenue base in the U.S., that's now eroding pretty rapidly. So, we don't have the level of free cash flow that we had prior to that, but with that said, we still do have a meaningful amount of cash with $3.4 billion on hand at the end of the quarter. And we remain very committed to share repurchases. There is a differential obviously, in the level of free cash flow, and we had a lot of excess cash on hand during various periods of time, even more than we have now, prior to the generic situation. So, within the confines of what we can do, we remain very committed. 600 million is still a pretty meaningful number. And we will continue to evaluate a very robust pipeline of BD opportunities.  We will continue to invest in those, you probably saw that we announced investment in a biosimilar opportunity with BioThera that we're excited about, and we will continue to repurchase shares. And we have the wherewithal to do that. So, I wouldn't read too much into the volume as being a sign that we're not committed to it, because we're something that we continue to see as a very accretive investment. Operator : We'll take our next question from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Matthew Harrison : Great. Good morning. Al, I was wondering if you could just comment on tau, and you know, just given what we've seen from some of the other studies, what your level of confidence is in the space you readout that's coming up. Thanks. Al Sandrock : Yeah. Hi, Matthew. Well, you\u2019re talking about gosuranemab BIIB092, which is our antibody that targets essentially extracellular tau, trying to prevent the spread of tau from cell-to-cell. And you're right, I mean, the Roche negative results do make us think that, you know that it's tough to target tau with an antibody, but we remain hopeful. We haven't seen the data from our own Phase 2 results yet. It\u2019s a large study, 650 plus patients testing several doses. And we're testing it in the early stages of Alzheimer's.  So, I think it's a robust study, that'll enable a very good go, no go decision to Phase 3. I did mention BIIB080 in my prepared comments because it's a different approach to tau. It's using an antisense to decrease the production of tau and it should affect both intracellular and extracellular forms of tau. Very different approach and we're excited about the results that we found in Phase 1 in terms of dose and time dependent reduction in tau expression, as seen in the CSF, and we're looking forward to sharing those results later this year at a scientific meeting. Operator : We will take our next question from Brian Abrahams of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Brian Abrahams : Hi, guys, thanks so much for taking my question. On aducanumab, can you maybe remind us, again of the Phase 3 monitoring requirements for safety in those studies, and maybe your latest views on what you think would be most appropriate in a real world setting? I guess what preparation centers would need to have for both management and monitoring, as well as optimizing benefit risk on the patients who start adu? Thanks. Mike McDonnell : Hi Brian. The main adverse event associated with adu is ARIA-E. And that's readily monitored by very standard sequence used for MRI scans. And in the Phase 3 trial, most of the \u2013 almost all of the monitoring was done within the first year of treatment because the risk ARIA goes down with time as the longer you treat, the less likely you are to get ARIA-E. And I believe we had six or nine scans in the trial. But we don't think that you'll need that many.  We were being extra cautious in our Phase 3 trials, exactly how many we\u2019ll need will obviously depend on our discussions, if we get to them or when we get to them in terms of the label, which we don't have yet. I would remind you that most of the ARIA-E were asymptomatic. I'd say about two-thirds were asymptomatic. And when symptomatic they were \u2013 the symptoms were generally mild, such as headache and confusion. So, I think it's readily dealt with, readily managed adverse event. And I think the sites \u2013 because almost all, I mean, virtually every center, even a private practice clinics have access \u2013 ready access to MRI, and as I said, it's a standard sequence. So, I don't think it's going to be a major problem to monitor for ARIA. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Colin Bristow of UBS. Please go ahead. Colin Bristow : Hey, good morning and congrats on the quarter. On the [EMBARK trial], I believe you reduced the planned enrollment from 2,400 to 1,800. I was just wondering, could you give us some color on the drivers of this? Was it a slow enrollment and your expectations? But most importantly, I wondered if you could give us \u2013 do you have any data around the enrollment rates from the aducanumab arms versus placebo arms for the [feeder trials]? Thanks. Mike McDonnell : Yeah, thanks for the question. EMBARK is enrolling, the rate of enrollment is actually as predicted, it's enrolling on track. But as you noted, the total number of patients to be enrolled was reduced. And the main reason for that was that there were eligibility requirements, medical eligibility requirements that were not met by many of the patients who were seeking to enroll in EMBARK. I'd say though, that the interest level on the part of patients, as well as investigators remains high. And as I said, the enrollment does remain on track. And I don't have the data on whether or not there's differential enrollment from the different feeder arms. Operator : We'll take our next question from Evan Seigerman of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Evan Seigerman : Hi all, thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to touch on the recent data readout of SAGE-324, while you had the [statistic result] on the primary, we did see a very high discontinuation rate in the treatment arm. Two things, can you remind us how you plan to mitigate this in a pivotal trial? And what is the acceptable rate of somnolence for a successful commercial asset in [indiscernible]? Thank you. Mike McDonnell : Well, you're correct that, as I stated in my comments, the primary endpoint was met, which I think and I want to congratulate my colleagues at SAGE for that. That's a major result. The obvious thing to do now since we tested the high-end of the dose range is to see whether we can reduce the dose, mitigate some of the adverse events while maintaining efficacy. There may be other [maneuvers] such as changing the dosing algorithm, if you will, perhaps easing up to a dose, titrating, and other approaches would include potentially looking at the key subgroups. In terms of what's acceptable? I think that's a very tough thing to answer definitively. I think that every patient looks at the benefit they're receiving from a drug and the tolerability issues they have to accept with the drug. It\u2019s probably a day-to-day decision that patients make and in this situation, they can see themselves of what's going on with the tremor. And perhaps there'll be several doses one day, that'll allow patients to choose between doses that optimize for them the benefit versus the risk. Michel Vounatsos : Evan, I think that at this stage of development, the mindset of the team is to try to do better than what we have seen with this initial Phase 2, 60% or so symptomatology and approximately 30% discontinuation. So, it's a fascinating question that you asked. It's all about the benefit risk, but the mindset is you should try to do better. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jay Olson of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Jay Olson : Hi, thanks for taking my question. My question is about your subcu strategy. Do you consider subcu TYSABRI as a complement to IV TYSABRI or substitute that will eventually replace IV TYSABRI? And since there was a study of subcu aducanumab, can you remind us about your plans for a subcu form of aducanumab and how you will apply your experience from subcu TYSABRI to aducanumab? Michel Vounatsos : So, thanks for the question. We are very excited by the momentum we see behind TYSABRI, high efficacy and a mechanism that is eventually is slightly favored in the current environment versus beta cell depleters. You know, the [stigma] around TYSABRI was always the risk of PML, and with the data we generate and the extendedly interval dose and hopefully the data with the Nova study media readout we should really shed light on the optimal dose and mostly frequency of the treatment.  Subcu is an opportunity to enlarge the target. When we look at the prescriber\u2019s landscape for TYSABRI, which is a tremendous success, it's extremely limited. And is it because of the infusion centers? Is it because of the risk of PML? Probably both. Here we are combining the opportunity of accessing high efficacy with the subcutaneous dosing. So, we should be in a position to enlarge the use and the targeting for TYSABRI. Operator : We'll take our next question from Geoff Meacham of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham : Hey, guys, good morning and thanks for the question. On [adu], I was just curious if you guys have provided any more materials to regulator, I wasn't sure for the details from the EMBARK study. We're getting factor. And just real quick on tau, Al wanted to just your view of the tau imaging what Lily did just to be able to assess Alzheimer\u2019s disease severity, is that something that you think down the road could be implemented in your studies? Thank you. Al Sandrock : Hi, Jeff. Yeah, we remain on track for the PDUFA date of June 7 and obviously if we had submitted major additional data that would affect that. So, but other than that, we don't want to comment on what we're, you know, submitting our interactions with FDA except to say that we continue to have regular meetings with them. And to us, everything's on track for a PDUFA decision on by the PDUFA date. In terms of tau, the concept of using tau imaging essentially to stage patients is a very interesting and novel concept.  And they showed that there are certain, if you look at amyloid pet as well as tau pet, you could potentially choose patients with the right stage of Alzheimer's disease that would maximally benefit from an amyloid lowering agent such as donanemab and potentially aducanumab and BAN2401. So, I think it's a very interesting concept. I think it's something that we need to look at again and with further study, but it's something that could potentially be useful. Operator : We'll now take our last question from Sumant Kulkarni of Canaccord. Please go ahead. Sumant Kulkarni : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Given you\u2019re so deep in the FDA review of aducanumab, other than perhaps stage of Alzheimer's disease of patients, what are your latest thoughts or expectations on any specific limitations and labeling of adu, perhaps by APOE4 carrier status or other more genetic oriented variables? Mike McDonnell : Yeah, I wish I could, you know, I just can't answer those types of questions. We're still in the middle of our review process. And I'm sensitive to the fact that we're under review. So, one day soon, I hope to be able to discuss all that with you. Sumant Kulkarni : Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : I want to thank you all for joining the Biogen call today. We remain focused on flawless execution and our operation in order to deliver on our guidance. We are also focused on the velocity of our [pipe]. And in the short run, we are very excited with important readouts and obviously with a critically important regulatory decision for aducanumab. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. That now concludes the call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Second Quarter Earnings Call and Financial Update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a Question and Answer session. [Operator Instructions]  Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hencke, Director, Investor Relation s. Mr. Hencke, you may begin your conference. Mike Hencke : Good morning. And welcome to Biogen 's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I would encourage everyone to go to the Investors Section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including our GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today.  Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2, and Table 4 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.  I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail.  On today's call, I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos, Dr. Al Sandrock, Head of Research and Development, and our CFO, Mike McDonnell. We will also be joined for the Q&A portion of our call by Chirfi Guindo, Head of Global Product Strategy and Commercialization, and Alisha Alaimo, President of our U.S. Organization.  As a reminder, during the Q&A portion of the call, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to 1 question. I will now turn the call over to Michel. Michel Vounatsos : Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. We have completed the first half of a transformative year for Biogen with progress across our Neuroscience Portfolio. However, I would like to start by addressing the confusion and criticism surrounding the recent approval of ADUHELM.  We are cognizant of the key issues raised by the community and are working to provide additional clarity through the following goals : exploring all options to maximize patient access including for the underserved population and those more at risk due to ethnicity, educating on the updated label language, which I will discuss, publishing our Phase 3 results in a peer-review ed journal and disseminating additional data to inform clinical practice including the management of ARIA, expediting the execution of the Phase 4 confirmatory study, and leveraging the unique data generation opportunity we have with EMBARK, the longest and most comprehensive longitudinal study for an Alzheimer's disease therapy. Biogen stands behind our clinical data from 8 studies, with more than 3,000 patients that supported accelerated approval. As the FDA's current Chief stated publicly earlier this month, ADUHELM was approved appropriately on very solid grounds and represented the right thing to do for the patients.  I want to be clear that Biogen stands behind the integrity of the review process. Respectful dialogue between the industry and regulators is standout and essential to advance the understanding of the therapeutic data driving innovation, as demonstrated more recently by the COVID-19 vaccines development programs of last year.  We believe the accelerated approval pathway has transformed the treatment of oncology and now has the potential to transform the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We appreciate the concerns about the price and are committed to ensure sustainability of the system and maximizing access for patients.  Without access, every day that passes we estimate that approximately 1,000 Americans move from the early stage of Alzheimer's to moderate or severe dementia, and therefore may no longer be appropriate for any session of treatment with ADUHELM.  This is why we are working with a sense of urgency to engage with the community, with payers, with CMS, and with policymakers to discuss potential innovative approaches with the goal of ensuring the price does not represent access issues for patients. With that said, I would like to focus on the fundamentals.  Another quarter with solid underlying financial performance that exceeded our expectation. The accelerated approval of ADUHELM for people suffering from Alzheimer's disease and key readouts across our diversified portfolio. First, the accelerated approval of ADUHELM represents the first new therapy for Alzheimer's disease in almost 20 years.  Biogen has a deep history of building new markets and delivering innovative and impactful therapies to patients in need. We pioneered and currently maintain the market-leading portfolio of therapies for MS. We delivered the first approved and market-leading therapy for SMA. Now, with ADUHELM, we have the first approved therapy to address a defining pathology of Alzheimer's disease, which we believe represents a significant value creation opportunity for years to come.  To lead us in successfully executing on our long-term leadership strategy, I am pleased to announce that Rachid Izzar will be head of our newly created Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia business unit, and will join the Executive Committee of Biogen.  Rachid is currently in charge of Biogen's Intercontinental Region and our Biosimilars business unit. He's experienced across multiple geographies and global position will service well as he works to maximize our potential impact on the lives of people living with this devastating disease.  We have seen strong indications of very high initial patient interest in ADUHELM, as well as increased referrals from PCPs to specialist. However, it will take some time for sites to get up and running.  While some large centers have said they will refrain for now for administering ADUHELM to patients, many of the sites are moving forward with internal processes, such as pharmacy and therapeutics, or P&T committee review, with some accelerating faster than we had originally planned.  Of the 900 sites approximately, which we expected to be ready shortly after approval, we estimate that approximately 325, or 35% have completed a P&T review with a positive outcome or indicated that they won't retry a P&T review.  We have also seen some sites leverage external infusion centers if they face internal resistance or are waiting clarity on their facility's internal process. We continue to believe that, consistent with our clinical trials, more specialists will require confirmation of amyloid beta pathology, either via PET or CSF, which is also taking time to schedule and coordinate. In terms of reimbursement, it is still the early days. And I am pleased to say that we have seen the first examples of Medicare Advantage plans approving pre-authorisation. We welcome the recent opening of the National Coverage Determination analysis by CMS for monoclonal antibodies targeting amyloid-beta, including ADUHELM.  We believe this process will provide additional clarity on coverage for Medicare beneficiaries and drive consistency of access across the country. We expect that regional Medicare Administrative Contractors and Medicare Advantage plans will provide coverage for ADUHELM while the NCD analysis is underway. We believe that CMS 's swift decision to initiate the NCD analysis is a testament to the large unmet need in Alzheimer's disease and the urgency to clarify access for patients. We obtained new lable language for ADUHELM in July, to clarify, that treatment should be initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease or mild Alzheimer's dementia.  This is the population studied in our clinical trials, and where we generated clinical evidence as stated in Section 14 of the ADUHELM label. This updated language aligns with our consistent expectation that ADUHELM will be prescribed mainly by specialists for patients in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease.  And this update has been well received by the community, including prescribers, payers, and policymakers. Outside the U.S., we continue to engage with regulators regarding the ongoing review in Europe, Japan, and other markets, while also continuing to submit new regulatory filing around the world.  In addition, we are pursuing early access mechanisms wherever possible, including an early access program and a charge managed access program. We recognize that building a new market for Alzheimer's disease is an unprecedented undertaking, and that this is just the beginning of our journey as we aim to make ADUHELM, and potentially Lecanemab, accessible to patients around the world.  We believe our teams are well-equipped to successfully execute on a well-defined strategy aimed at long-term leadership for Biogen in Alzheimer's disease. Second, this quarter our pipeline delivered meaningful mid-to-late stage results in key areas including depression, stroke, and biosimilars. The positive WATERFALL Phase 3 trial for zuranolone in major depressive disorder is a significant milestone towards bringing a differentiated potential treatment option to the 17 million patients suffering from depression in the U.S. alone. The observed rapid onset of benefit, in as soon as 3 days, in addition to a differentiated tolerability profile and 2-week dosing regimen underscore.  I would believe that if approved, zuranolone would be a multi-billion-dollar product. We were also excited to see positive data from the Phase 2a trial of TMS-007 in acute ischemic stroke. Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide, and those who survive may suffer irreversible damage of the brain.  We are highly encouraged by the results of the trial, and we immediately moved forward with executing the option to acquire TMS-007. Should both zuranolone and TMS-007 be approved, Biogen will be in a leadership position in offering novel therapies for Alzheimer's disease, the number one neurodegenerative disease; depression, one of the most common mental health disorder; and stroke, a leading cause of neurologic disability.  In addition to these readouts, we had a positive Phase 3 readout for our biosimilars referencing ACTEMRA. With this positive results in hand, we begin to prepare for a regulatory filing. As with any Company engaging in breakthrough science, we also had setbacks in some programs, including our anti-Tau antibody in Alzheimer's disease and our gene therapy programs in ophthalmology.  Third, we reported a solid quarter as we continue to execute well across our core business of MS, SMA, and biosimilars. And we are pleased to be raising our revenue guidance for the year, which Mike will discuss. Q2 overall MS revenue, including OCREVUS royalties, was $1.8 billion.  Putting aside the entry of TECFIDERA generics in the U.S., our broader MS business continued to demonstrate resilience with a 5% increase in patients worldwide. This performance underscore our ability to execute well.  We were very pleased to see continued revenue growth for VUMERITY, which remains the number 1 oral MS product in terms of new prescriptions in the U.S. We believe this performance is a testament to VUMERITY's strong product profile.  Given the progress of the VUMERITY 's launch-to-date, in addition to plan ned ex-U.S. launches, we believe VUMERITY can reach over $1 billion in annual sales over time. We also continue to invest in new potential treatment to address the remaining unmet medical needs for MS patients.  Last week, we announced a license and collaboration agreement with InnoCare for Orelabrutinib and innovative CNS penetrant Phase 2 BTK inhibitor for the potential treatment of all forms of MS. This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. Next, SPINRAZA generated second quarter global revenues of $500 million.  While SPINRAZA is facing competition in the U.S., which has been exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, we were encouraged to see that SPINRAZA's discontinuation continue to decrease versus Q1 of this year. Total revenue in the U.S. was flat versus the prior quarter.  And SPINRAZA continued to perform very well outside the U.S., with 23% revenue growth versus Q2 of last year. SPINRAZA remains the market-leading treatment for SMA, and we stand behind SPINRAZA 's proven efficacy and well established safety profiles across all types of SMA.  In fact, our market research indicates that SPINRAZA 's perceived efficacy among adults has improved over the past year and exceeds the efficacy perception for therapeutic alternatives, including rizeplan. Although we face near-term competitive pressure in SMA, we believe SPINRAZA can continue to grow over the medium to long-term, both in the U.S. and globally, driven by overall market growth, the efficacy and safety profile in all age groups, continued data generation, particularly in older patients, and further geographic expansion.  Our Biosimilars business delivered revenue of $202 million this quarter. While we remained focused on executing against our currently market ed therapies, we also looked to expand our portfolio, including our recent collaboration with Biotech and a positive CHMP opinion for our biosimilar referencing LUCENTIS.  Fourth, we still have 2 key Phase 3 readouts anticipated in the remainder of 2021. This includes the Phase 3 study for Tofersen, potentially the first genetically targeted therapy for ALS, as well as an additional Phase 3 for zuranolone in major depressive disorder.  Given the incredible unmet medical need in ALS and encouraging results from the prior to present trial, we recently initiated an individual compassionate use program to provide Tofersen to the most rapidly progressing patients suffering from SOD1 ALS.  Taken together, these developments represent a significant step forward in our goal of transforming Biogen from what was once an MS Company, to one that is built upon a multi-franchise portfolio across a broad spectrum of neuroscience therapeutic areas. I would like now to turn the call over to Al for a more detailed update on our progress in R&D. Al Sandrock : Thank you, Michel. I'd like to start by saying a few words about aducanumab. The accelerated approval of aducanumab has generated discussions reflecting a broad range of opinions, including about its efficacy, the FDA selection of the accelerated approval path, and the regulatory process in general.  Since June 7th, the FDA has made several clarifying statements on these topics. As always, we deferred to the FDA as the lead voice on such matters. They are the independent regulatory body charged with weighing the data expertly and dispassionately in order to make critical decisions that have the potential to impact millions of people. But I thought it would be helpful to add our perspective about several of these topics, including our interactions with the agency. We are proud of the work our dedicated team has done to develop aducanumab and the hope it brings to patients with Alzheimer's disease.  We are equally proud of the professionalism both our team and the FDA demonstrated during a very lengthy process. We therefore welcome a formal review into the interactions between FDA and Biogen on the path to the approval of aducanumab.  A better understanding of the facts is good for everyone involved to assure confidence in both the therapy and the process by which it was approved. We will cooperate fully with the review, even as we prioritize the issues that affect patients.  I want to underscore that it is normal and appropriate for scientists and clinicians to discuss the data from experiments and clinical trials to debate and to disagree on the interpretation of the data. That is how science advances, and we welcome these discussions.  However, I would like to correct some of the misinformation we have seen recently. First, several people have stated that all anti-amyloid antibodies clear amyloid from the brain. This is factually incorrect.  First-generation anti-amyloid antibodies, such as bapineuzumab and solanezumab, are not specific for aggregated forms of A beta or target soluble and monomeric A beta, and crenezumab, being an IgG4, is deficient in effector function. As a result, these antibodies do not clear amyloid from the brain.  This slide shows the amyloid PET imaging results from the peer reviewed literature of these first-generation antibodies. Crenezumab and solanezumab had no significant difference from placebo on amyloid plaque burden. Bapineuzumab did a show a significant difference from placebo in the Phase 3 trials.  But this was largely driven by an unexplained increase in amyloid plaque burden in these placebo treated patients in the mild to moderate stage of Alzheimer's disease. We believe this increase in amyloid plaque in placebo patients must have been a superious result, as we now know that plaque buildup reaches a maximum by the time the patients have mild cognitive impairment.  In short, there is no evidence that the first-generation antibodies against Abeta actually removed amyloid plaque. There is no basis for using the failure of these antibodies as a reason not to approve aducanumab. We have also seen statements that all of aducanumab's results are post hoc; that is also factually incorrect.  The primary and secondary endpoints had been pre-specified in the Phase 3 trial protocols and statistical analysis plans before the first patient was enrolled into the trials. The aducanumab label shows the results on these pre-specified endpoints based on data that had already been collected at the sites by the time the trials were prematurely terminated on 03/21/2019.  Separately, some have contended that ARIA led to unblinding. We took great care to ensure that the neurologists who assess the clinical outcome measures did not know about the occurrence of ARIA. One way in which we assured ourselves that unblinding did not affect the results was to examine the clinical outcomes after ARIA was seen.  If ARIA had effective blinding, the results after ARIA might be expected to change. This slide shows that the results, excluding data that had been obtained after ARIA events, were the same as the overall results. Thus, we are confident that unblinding due to ARIA did not affect the results of the Phase 3 trial of aducanumab.  And finally, some people have opined that the approval of aducanumab would inhibit the development of other drugs for Alzheimer's disease. This statement is contradicted by precedent. Prime example that the history of drug approvals for HIV-AIDS, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and multiple sclerosis to name just a few.  In neurology, the first medicine ever approved for MS was in 1993 when when beta interferon received accelerated approval in the U.S.. Within the next several years, two other types of beta interferon were approved after controlled clinical trials showed that they slowed the progression of disability.  Today, there are more than 20 drugs approved for the treatment of MS, all of which reduce the risk of relapse, or slow the progression of disability, or both. All new molecular entities were approved based on randomized controlled clinical trials that continued to be conducted to this day, nearly 30 years after the accelerated approval of beta-interferon.  We believe a similar situation is just starting to unfold with Alzheimer's disease. Over the coming years, data will become available from Phase 3 trials of several second-generation antiamyloid antibodies which are capable of effectively removing amyloid plaque. And we also will have the results of the post-marketing trial of aducanumab.  These data should address any residual uncertainty surrounding the efficacy of this class. In the meantime, the main serious risk associated with aducanumab is ARIA. Based on data from the Phase 3 trial, ARIA, which is an amyloid -related imaging abnormality, occurred in 41% of patients who took aducanumab, 10 mg/kg, and 10% of patients who took placebo.  Of the patients taking aducanumab that experienced ARIA, 24% experienced clinical symptoms. In other words, about 10% of patients treated with the approved dose of aducanumab experienced symptomatic ARIA, serious symptoms were reported in 0.3% of patients. Alzheimer's disease is 100% fatal. And before death, it robbed people of themselves. Should these additional clinical studies confirm that this class of drugs is effective in slowing clinical decline, as Michel mentioned, patients who lack access to aducanumab may no longer be appropriate for treatment. We have been discussing the aducanumab data for many months now.  Aducanumab was approved for use in the U.S. on June 7th, and the data are summarized clearly in the label. Our hope is for doctors to discuss the benefits and risks of taking aducanumab, with their patients and caregivers, based on rational analysis and accurate information.  We are doing what we can to provide that information to the prescribing community in a number of ways. First, we will continue to present at scientific forums and publish analyses from our Phase 3 trials of aducanumab with a focus on publishing the primary manuscript and disseminating additional data to inform clinical practice, including the management of ARIA.  This includes 4 presentations planned for the AAIC Conference next week. Second, we are moving with a sense of urgency to finalize the design of the aducanumab post-marketing confirmatory Phase 4 controlled study intended to verify the clinical benefit of aducanumab in Alzheimer's disease. We are still working through the details and are actively engaged with regulators. Our goal is to execute this study as expeditiously as possible and well ahead of the post-marketing commitment of approximately 9 years. Third, we have a unique data generation opportunity with EMBARK, with the embark long-term extension study.  Just this month, we enrolled our last patient in the trial, bringing the total enrollment in the study up to roughly 1,700 Alzheimer's disease patients. The two-year EMBARK study will include patients previously treated with aducanumab for up to approximately 6.5 years, thereby generating important long-term safety and efficacy data for aducanumab. We've planned to present the EMBARK baseline data at an upcoming medical meeting, which should yield important insights on the effects of treatment interruption, the longer-term impact of reducing amyloid plaques, and the potential benefits of continued treatment.  Lastly, we plan to initiate a real-world observational study in Alzheimer's disease called ICARE AD-US in order to collect real-world long-term effectiveness and safety data on aducanumab. We're also evaluating additional formulations of aducanumab with the goal of increasing patient confidence.  Last month, we initiated a Phase 1 study to evaluate bioavailability of a subcutaneous formulation of aducanumab and continued to engage with regulators on the appropriate development strategy. Finally, we continue to advance our innovative pipeline of potential Alzheimer's disease treatments. This includes Lecanemab, our other anti-amyloid antibody that we are collaborating on with Eisai. Lecanemab was recently awarded breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA, and we are working with Eisai to engage with the FDA and pursue the optimum regulatory pathway. We also look forward to the readout of the Clarity Phase 3 study of Lecanemab expected next year.  In addition to our anti-amyloid approaches, we are also targeting Tau, the primary component of Neurofibrillary tangles, another pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Although we were disappointed to learn that the Phase 2 study of gosuranemab in early Alzheimer's disease did not meet the primary or secondary endpoints, we do not believe these results diminish the relevance of Tau as a potential therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease. Whereas we have discontinued the BIIB092 program, we are continuing the development of BIIB080, our antisense oligonucleotide, which aims to reduce the production of all forms of Tau, both intra and extracellular. Results of the Phase 1 trial will be presented at AAIC next week. In addition to Alzheimer's disease, this quarter we continue to progress a broad neuroscience pipeline with positive data readouts in depression and stroke, both areas in need of innovation.  First, in neuropsychiatry in collaboration with Sage, we were excited to learn that the Phase 3 WATERFALL Study, evaluating a 50 milligram dose of zuranolone in major depressive disorder, achieved its primary endpoint. Despite the pronounced placebo effect observed in the WATERFALL study, 2 weeks of zuranolone treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in depressive symptoms at day 15, as measured by the HAM-D 17 scale, versus placebo. Zuranolone treatment also resulted in a rapid onset of action showing treatment effects at day 3, 8, and 12. The safety profile was similar to that seen previously in that most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild to moderate in severity, and we observed no signal of increased suicide idealization or behavior, or withdrawal symptoms.  We continue to believe that zuranolone, with its rapid treatment response, durable treatment effects after a 2-week dosing period, and differentiated tolerability, has the potential to transform treatment for people suffering from depression. We are now working with Sage to determine the optimum filing path.  The WATERFALL study is also -- is part of the robust development program for zuranolone, which also includes the ongoing SHORELINE, CORAL, and SKYLARK studies. We expect to report topline data from CORAL and SHORELINE in 2021. We are working with Sage to evaluate enrollment rates for the SKYLARK study, and we'll provide updates when that work is completed.  We also obtained positive data from the Phase 2a study of TMS-007 in acute ischemic stroke. Current standard of care in the treatment of ischemic stroke calls for the use of thrombolytic agents within 3-4.5 hours of symptom onset. The approved agents also carry the risk of intracranial hemorrhage, or ICH, which increases with time. During the Phase 2a study of TMS-007, now referred to as BIIB131, the patients were dosed 4.5 to 12 hours after the onset of stroke symptoms with an average of 9.5 hours. There was no symptomatic ICH in the BIIB131 group. When compared to placebo, BIIB131 increased the rate of recanalization of occluded intracranial arteries, as visualized by MRI angiography in patients with large vessel strokes.  Moreover, more patients regain the ability to function independently as measured by the Modified Rankin scale at day 90 compared to placebo. We are encouraged by the results of this study and are hopeful that BIIB131 could have the potential to be a next-generation thrombolytic drug that safely extends the treatment window after stroke onset. We plan to advance BIIB131 into the late stages of development as soon as possible. We also bolstered our MS pipeline through a proposed license and collaboration agreement with InnoCare for a Phase 2 oral small molecule BTK inhibitor for the potential treatment of MS.  Orelabrutinib, a covalent BTK inhibitor with high selectivity and demonstrated CNS penetrant, is currently being studied in a global placebo-controlled Phase 2 study in relapsing remitting MS. The ability of orelabrutinib to cross the blood-brain barrier, combined with its high kinase selectivity, differentiates it from other BTK inhibitors currently in development for MS.  Looking toward the remainder of the year, we also have two pivotal readouts remaining in ALS and depression. Earlier this month, we completed the 1-year placebo controlled treatment period of the Phase 3 study of Tofersen in SOD1 ALS, and we expect a readout by this fall.  We also recently enrolled the first participant in ATLAS, a Phase 3 trial of tofersen initiated in clinically pre-symptomatic SOD1 mutation carriers. Our hope is that treating people earlier in this disease may provide the best opportunity to slow or even delay the onset of this terrible disease.  In summary, this quarter, our R&D organization made significant progress advancing our pipeline. In addition to the accelerated approval of aducanumab, we completed 5 mid-to-late stage readouts in several key therapeutic areas characterized by high unmet need, including depression and stroke. The field of neuroscience is rapidly advancing. And with the investments we have made in prioritizing genetically validated targets, deploying biomarkers in early stage clinical programs, and building our human and technological capabilities, we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of the many opportunities offered by this exciting area of science for the benefit of patients. I will now pass the call over to Mike. Mike McDonnell : Thank you, Al. As Michel noted, we were very pleased with our second quarter results as we continue to execute well. We continue to face competition from TECFIDERA generics in the U.S., which impacted our year-over-year financial performance. However, as we move forward, we remain fully focused on our core business, as well as the launch of ADUHELM in the U.S..  Total revenue for the second quarter of $2.8 billion, declined 25% versus the prior year at actual currency and 26% at constant currency. This decline reflects the impact of TECFIDERA generics, in addition to approximately $330 million in revenue, that was recorded in Q2 2020, related to the 1-time license of certain manufacturing-related intellectual property.  We were, however, encouraged to see total revenue increase by 3% versus Q1 of 2021, primarily driven by the MS franchise and OCREVUS royalties. Total ADUHELM revenue for the second quarter was $2 million.  I would refer you to our slides and commentary that we gave on our June 8th call for details on the accounting with Eisai and Neurimmune. Total MS revenue for the second quarter was $1.8 billion inclusive of OCREVUS royalties.  Looking now at some of the individual products within MS. Global TECFIDERA revenue for the second quarter was $488 million. In the U.S., second quarter revenue of $178 million increased versus the prior quarter due to seasonality and shipping dynamics, and we expect TECFIDERA in the U.S. to continue to decline throughout the year.  Outside of the U.S., second quarter TECFIDERA revenue of $309 million increased 15% versus the prior year, with 6% underlying patient growth. We were pleased with the continued ramp in VUMERITY revenue from $74 million in the first quarter to $91 million in the second quarter. And as Michel mentioned, we believe that VUMERITY can become a $1 billion annual revenue product over time. TYSABRI second quarter global revenue of $524 million, increased 21% versus the prior year, benefiting from shifting dynamics in both the U.S. and outside the U.S. We were pleased to see 7% growth in global TYSABRI patients. And we believe TYSABRI remains well-positioned to play an increasingly important role in the treatment of MS.  Moving now to SMA. Global second quarter SPINRAZA revenue of $500 million increased 1% versus the prior year at actual currency and decreased 3% at constant currency. In the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue of $149 million decreased by 29% versus the prior year, as we see continued impact from competition.  Outside the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue grew 23% versus the prior year, although some of this growth was attributable to accelerated shipments. Moving now to our Biosimilars business. Second quarter revenue of $202 million increased 18% versus the prior year at actual currency, and 9% at constant currency. This growth occurred despite our Biosimilars business continuing to be negatively impacted by pricing pressure, as well as a slowdown in new treatments and reduced clinic capacity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the continued impact of COVID-19, we are now the leading anti-TNF provider in Europe. Total anti-CD20 revenue in the second quarter of $440 million decreased 8% versus the prior year.  RITUXAN revenue decreased approximately 32% versus the prior year, partially offset by a 23% increase in OCREVUS royalties. Second quarter gross margin was 83% of revenue, up slightly from 82% in the prior quarter, and down from 89% in Q2 2020. The reduction in gross margin versus the prior year was primarily due to the declines in TECFIDERA and RITUXAN, both of which are high margin products. In addition, Q2 2020 includes approximately $330 million in revenue related to the 1-time license of certain manufacturing-related intellectual property, which was at 100% gross margin.  Moving now to expenses in the balance sheet. Second quarter non-GAAP R&D expense was $585 million, which included approximately $50 million of upfront payments related to 3 business development deals; one with Bio-Thera for biosimilars, a second with Capsigen in gene therapy, and a third with Ginkgo to develop a novel gene therapy manufacturing platform.  Second-quarter non-GAAP SG&A was $635 million, including approximately $115 million related to ADUHELM. Note that beginning in the second quarter, Eisai 's reimbursement of the U.S. SG&A cost is reflected in the collaboration profit-sharing line.  Second quarter collaboration profit sharing reduced our Net operating expenses by $15 million, which includes a reimbursement of $85 million from Eisai related to the commercialization of ADUHELM in the U.S. In the second quarter of this year, our effective non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 16% versus approximately 19% in the second quarter of last year.  Second quarter non-GAAP income attributable to non-controlling interest of $84 million includes a milestone payment of $100 million to Neurimmune, related to the launch of ADUHELM in the U.S. Note that Eisai 's 45% share of this milestone, payment was recognized in the collaboration profit-sharing line.  During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of the Company's common stock for $450 million. As of June 30, 2021, there was $3.6 billion remaining under the share repurchase program authorized in October of 2020. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 150 million shares for the second quarter.  Non-GAAP diluted EPS in the first quarter was $5.68, which increased from $5.34 in Q1 of 2021. In the second quarter, we generated approximately $1.2 billion in cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures were $72 million, and free cash flow was approximately $1.2 billion.  We ended the quarter with $7.3 billion in debt, $4 billion in cash and marketable securities, and as a result, $3.3 billion in net debt. Additionally, our $1 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn as of the end of the quarter.  Overall, we remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial capacity to grow the business over the long term. Let me now turn to our updated full-year guidance for 2021. We are increasing our full-year 2021 revenue guidance from our previous range of $10.45 billion to $10.75 billion to a new range of $10.65 billion to $10.85 billion, primarily as a result of stronger performance in our MS franchise and higher OCREVUS royalties.  We are maintaining our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance of $17.50 to $19, not withstanding the inclusion of the $125 million upfront payment related to our recently announced collaboration with InnoCare, which we expect to incur in Q3.  This payment was not included in our previous guidance. Our Capex guidance is unchanged at $375 million to $425 million. Our guidance continues to assume modest ADUHELM revenue in 2021 due to dosing titration, the need for sites to prepare to diagnose and treat patients, and the time that it will take to secure payer coverage.  We continue to expect revenue to start ramping in 2022 and beyond. We expect continued erosion of both TECFIDERA and RITUXAN in the U.S., and that the decreased revenue from these high-margin products will put pressure on our gross margin percentage. Note that our gross margin in the second quarter of 2021 was 83% of revenue, which reflects this dynamic.  Full-year non-GAAP R&D expenses are expected to be between $2.45 billion and $2.55 billion. This updated R&D guidance range includes the expected $125 million upfront payment in the third quarter of 2021, which as I mentioned, was not included in our prior guidance.  Full year non-GAAP SG&A expenses are expected to be between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. This range is consistent with our previous guidance and continues to include an approximate $600 million ADUHELM investments.  Of this amount, approximately $200 million would be reimbursable by Eisai and is reflected as collaboration profit sharing effective April 1st and not part of SG&A. Of course, as the launch progresses, we will actively manage the pace of this spend. This guidance continues to reflect our expectation that both R&D and SG&A will be higher in the second half of the year than they were in the first half due to collaborations such as InnoCare, program readouts, and investments in ADUHELM.  We expect we will utilize a portion of the remaining share repurchase authorization of $3.6 billion throughout the year, although this will depend on a variety of factors including our business development activities. We assume that foreign exchange rates as of June 30, 2021 will remain in effect for the remainder of the year, net of hedging activities.  We have not included any impact from potential tax or health care reform or any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions other than InnoCare in our guidance. So in closing, we were very pleased with our financial performance in the quarter. We remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash, modest leverage, and a business that generates significant free cash flow. We believe these dynamics position us well to continue to grow the business over the long term. And now I will turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you Mike. It is an exciting time at Biogen. And it is all about execution for the coming period. Our base MS, SMA, Biosimilars business is performing well, demonstrating resilience despite competition.  We have an incredible opportunity together with Eisai, and we are completely focused on operation execution for the global Launch of ADUHELM and hopefully soon lecanemab. We have positive Phase 3 data for the zuranolone in depression, and we are anxiously awaiting data for tofersen in SOD1 ALS.  We believe we have a significant value creation opportunity ahead of us. We stand behind the clinical data for ADUHELM, including the integrity of the approval process. Again, today, our top priority special access, including for the underserved population and those more at risk due to ethnicity, and we are open to innovative approaches to ensure budget sustainability.  In closing, I would like to thank our employees around the world who have demonstrated their dedication to making a positive impact on patients' lives. And all of the physicians, caregivers, and participants in our clinical development programs, our ability to deliver medicines to patients could not be realised without the passion and commitment.  We will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] As a reminder, please limit yourslf to one question. Your first question comes from the line of Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Jay Olson : Thank you for taking the question. It's really been a rough ride for ADUHELM, and we appreciate you're hanging in there. It seems like ever since March of 2019, Biogen has been the target of constant assault from the media and other groups, which obviously intensified on June 7th when ADUHELM was approved. What do you suppose it is about Alzheimer's disease that causes the media to react so negatively to a drug that could actually help patients and their families, and not treat them with the same respect it is rightly shown to victims of other diseases like cancer? Michel Vounatsos : Thank you, Jay, for the great questions. I will get started, and I guess I will add. Again, it's -- and you are absolutely right in your question and your description of what we are exposed to. But we are not the ones suffering the most. It's still the early day in the launch. It's still the beginning. And whatever the motives of the controversy are, the one who are potentially misled, confused, denied health, are the patients. If we look at the past experience, progress has to be made with the first step, and we can look at HIV, oncology, or MS, as Al said. And let me bring you back to early 1990s and HIV. The FDA approved a first product based on CD4 count. And they were tremendous controversy. Then there were progress on viral load and then survival. And then 29 products or so were approved until today. And today, it's managed HIV as a chronic disease. These came with tremendous investment in the field. And the importance of the biomarker is that it's often present prior to the clinical symptoms. And this situation, this scenario, could very well be the same for AD. Where are those today who were fighting at the time, the biomarker-base approval for HIV therapy a few years back? The same applies to oncology. Al? Al Sandrock : Yeah, Jay. Thanks for the question. I do believe that the amyloid hypothesis, even before we got started with aducanumab, was a controversial topic and there were people lined up on both sides of the hypothesis, whether or not it's true. And that's -- an d people dug in their heels even before the aducanumab data were approved. And it's unfortunate. And many of these drugs probably didn't even engage target in the brain and yet we consider ed those negative results as meaningful. But the main thing, Jay, is that somewhere along the way, the patients got lost. And we'd like to bring the conversation back to the patients. And I highlighted the risks associated with the drug, but also the risks associated with not starting aducanumab in a timely fashion in the appropriate patients. Michel Vounatsos : Next question. Operator : We can now take the next question from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. Michael Yee : Thank you. Good morning, and I appreciate the comments and also the open letter from Al. Appreciate that. We had a question on early launch dynamics for ADUHELM. Maybe you can comment about the 325 sites, how those are going? Are they ready to dose patients? But more importantly, reimbursement access, specifically whether there's anything you can do with CMS to strike a deal or anything like that because I think those are the two bottlenecks or dynamics that people are going to get through. Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : Thanks for the question, Mike. I will start and then Alisha will give you much more granularity because she is closer to the operation. The background noise and the controversy are unfortunate and not helpful, mostly for the patients, and they are confusing. Nevertheless, the team is making a lot of progress and I'm very proud about the hard work. Overall, it's a bit slower than what we assumed, but we're making tremendous progress with some positives and some headwinds. Alisha? Alisha Alaimo : Yes. Thank you, Michel. And thank you, Michael, for the question. And though it is very early in our launch, I am happy to share with you a few critical areas that we've been monitoring that will provide some insights into how the landscape is evolving. I do have quite a bit to share, however, so I would ask that you please bear with me as I think I need to make it through some of these key topics that I believe you'll be very interested in. Let me first start with the patients. Physicians have definitely shared that since launch, there has been a significant amount of patient interest across the entire country. Not only from their existing diagnosed patients that they are aware of, but also from new patient referrals from primary care physicians, which is also excellent. On the last call that we held, I did share that the primary focus of our team is to provide access to patients, by supporting sites as they build the capability and infrastructure to treat patients. So sites are just now taking that first step in their internal process, which is to complete their P&T committee reviews. The majority of the Alzheimer's specialists that we have been talking to, have been really extremely, highly engaged, with both our commercial and our medical teams as they operationalize d their sites. We have seen several sites move faster than anticipated, which is also very good news for us. And as Michel mentioned in his opening, we estimate that 35% of the ready sites have completed a P&T review with a positive outcome or they've indicated that they're not requiring the step. As I'm sure you've also seen, a few centers have indicated that they will not provide access to ADUHELM for now. This is not only disappointing for patients, but also for the AD specialists at these centers who had actually plan ned to treat their patients with ADUHELM. Our teams are making every attempt to get in front of the decision makers in order to help them better understand the science and data. The AD specialists and the champions at these sites are also urging their sites to reconsider these decisions. Now remember, though, many of these physicians can still prescribe the drug, and they have asked for support to find alternative sites where they can infuse their patients. We've also experienced during this time that patients and their families are not giving up, and they will seek new sites if necessary, and we're also seeing that in the field. Our field teams share the sense of urgency of course. And as we've also said in a public statement, if any patient is denied access to care, we encourage them to contact our Biogen support services for help, and we will support them. Now, for the sites that have completed a positive P&T committee review or don't require one, there are still several steps to operationalize the complex patient journey. You might have seen recently published several AD specialists recently said, building this infrastructure for the appropriate use of ADUHELM will require time, resources, and some creative planning. In fact, I recently just visited several sites. And what I saw, is consistent with what we're seeing across the entire country. Sites are currently, right now, developing their protocols. They are re-engaging with their patients. They are considering or scheduling amyloid-beta confirmation. They also are ordering baseline MRIs. Then, they are discussing these results of the tests and making the treatment decision with their patients. This has clearly taken quite a bit of time. On our last call with you, we shared a program that we created with Labcorp and Mayo Clinic Labs to help physicians and patients access CSF diagnostic laboratory testing. We are also seeing a very strong interest in this program. In fact, we've already seen the first orders come in for both of our lab partners. Sites are also trying to gain clarity, as you said, on the reimbursement pathway. The decision by CMS to open an NCD analysis will help provide additional clarity to sites and healthcare providers. Now, while this analysis is underway, coverage decisions will be made by regional Medicare Administrative Contractors, as you know is the MACs, and the Medicare Advantage plan. Based on precedent, we expect the MAC s and Medicare Advantage plans will provide coverage for ADUHELM. Now, while NCD for drugs are rare, and the only recent example of a drug NCD analysis, which was CAR-T, both MACs and Medicare Advantage plans continued to cover these -- this product during the NCA process. We can also confirm that some Medicare Advantage plans have already approved prior authorizations for ADUHELM. For the MACs, due to the miscellaneous coding, it does take them a little bit of time to process the claims. But we are also aware that MACs have received claims already. So during the NCD analysis, we are actively working with sites to support patient access and reimbursement. Keep in mind, and as I witnessed across the various sites that I visited, each site will operationalize at different rates, which is why patient infusions will build gradually over the year, as we referenced. Though this process will take time, it was absolutely humbling to see how much effort and passion these physicians are putting into building the infrastructure to treat their patients. And I am really proud of how hard our teams are working to support these sites as they break new ground. Our teams are staying focused though, Michael. We have a job to do on behalf of the AD community and we will not be distracted from that mission no matter what we see. Thank you. Operator : We can now take the next question from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer Raffat : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to focus on Alzheimer's in two parts. First, I know there's a lot of discussion on donanemab early filing, and I'm a bit puzzled why there's lack of any commentary on a potential early filing for BAN2401. And I realize Eisai 's lead on regulatory matters, but I also understand you guys are on the steering committee. Should we expect a BAN2401 filing in 2021? And secondly, Alisha, just to clarify, for the 1.6 million sales for aducanumab in second quarter, how much of that was inventory? Because the sales number implies about 3,000 patients are on drug in June; is that right? Mike McDonnell : Yeah. I'll take the second part of that. It's Mike speaking, Umer. Thanks for the question. Then Al will take the second one. We typically don't get a lot into the channel dynamics, but it's early days. We don't have really clear visibility into patient metrics. For a drug like ADUHELM, it's very early days and obviously, we're pleased to see that we accomplished some shipments and we got the $1.6 million in sales done. But as those roll out to sites and translate into patient treatment, we'll have more to say about how much is in the channel and how much is actually going into patient treatment. Michel Vounatsos : So more to come on that. But you can assume that since we had only 2 weeks, a big chunk of it is basically a channel. Al? Al Sandrock : Yeah. Umer, as you know, we generally don't comment on the content of our regulatory interactions. We do think it's a very positive sign that the Lecanemab was awarded Breakthrough Therapy designation. And I know my colleagues at Eisai and Biogen will do everything we can to expedite the regulatory pathway. Michel Vounatsos : And I would like to add that it's good to see followers with the same mechanism of action and a type of class effect that is so challenged. And as Biogen, we welcome new players and some of them being competition and some being partners. That's good for the clinician, that's good for the patient by definition. Operator : We can now take the next question from the line of Marc Goodman from SVB Leerink. Marc Goodman : Thanks. Good morning. Can you help us understand this NCD process? What are the scenarios of outcomes, and help explain to us what happens if there's a negative scenario? What would be a negative scenario, and what can you do about a negative scenario? Thank you. Alisha Alaimo : All right. Thank you, Marc, for the question. I'll go ahead and answer that. While it's too early in the process to speculate the outcome of this NCD analysis, I will provide some information for people to understand that there are 5 potential scenarios [Indiscernible]. First, there is a no coverage decision. While this is theoretically an outcome, in the last 15 years there are no examples of FDA approved drugs not being covered. I think that that's important to know. Second, there is coverage to indication or basically label. And third, you can have coverage with restrictions. They can maybe give you restriction around specific population of patients, or they can limit prescribing, potentially the specialists, and then they'll define who those specialists are. Fourth, you can have coverage with evidence development. And lastly, it can be left to the MACs discretion. Importantly, once a national coverage decision is made, all of the MACs and Med Advantage plans, must abide by the NCD. Meaning the NCD will overrule any local or Medicare Advantage plan that is in place. That's why we believe NCD will drive some consistency of access and clear reimbursement expectations, which is actually very good for everyone since one of the questions that people have are, \"Is this is going to be reimbursed. \" With that being said, if there were to be a negative outcome, though we can't speculate on it, of course, in Biogen's true form, we would want to obviously have a conversation on that and see what other outcome potentially could happen, depending on additional data they might need. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you Alisha. Operator : We can now take the next question from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could comment a little bit more about the current reimbursement dynamics that you're seeing. And maybe specifically, if you could comment on whether or not you're aware of anyone that's been infused early in June with commercial drug, if they've actually been paid by a MAC or not. Thanks very much. Alisha Alaimo : Thank you, Matthew, for the question. And unfortunately, I would love to give you an answer to that, but because it's early days and because processing claims takes quite a bit of time, unfortunately, I can't give you feedback on that yet because they are in the process. As I said before, I know that the Medicare Advantage plans have approved the prior authorizations, which actually is a good thing that those are in place because it does give sites some reassurance that they will get reimbursed. But as for the MACs, we know that they do have claims, but because it's under miscellaneous coding, it does take some time. I would love to give you that answer, but we just don't have it right now. Operator : We can now take the next question from Phil Nadeau from Cowen & Company. Phil Nadeau : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Alisha, during your remarks, your answer to Michael 's question, you mentioned that a lot of the centers are setting up confirmation for beta amyloid presence in the patients. I'm curious why they're doing that. Are they taking that upon themselves to identify the patients, or confirm the patients, or are the diagnostic requirements being required by Medicare Advantage or the MACs? Alisha Alaimo : Okay. Thank you for that question as well. Since PDUFA, we have continued to hear a high level of interest in our ABC program, which I talked about prior. Which is a CSF testing, which you heard me talk about in my first answer. Now, the reason why there is a high interest, is primarily due to three reasons. First, we're hearing a consistent message from the AD experts and the clinicians, that they will align their patient selection to the patient population studied in our clinical trials. So 100% of patients in our clinical development program were confirmed for amyloid plaques. However, just so you also know, no one's really come out with the policy yet, so I can't actually tell you that there's been a mandate on amyloid-beta confirmatio.But we would expect that, potentially, those will be on the policies. Second, there's currently no reimbursed test to confirm the presence of amyloid, in this program that we offer as a solution to provide access to patients who would otherwise lack the ability to pay for this lab test, let alone the cost of a PET scan. And as you know, for PET scanning 3rd, there are still several areas of the country, in particular the Mountain West, Hawaii, and Alaska, were access to amyloid PET is not available due to the distribution of radio pharmacies and limited half-life of the radioligand. But I also said in our prior call that we do need both PET and CSF and we have seen these orders come in for both of our lab partners. And we're still working diligently with a coalition to see if we can get PET reimbursement through CMS. Operator : We can now take the next question from Paul Matteis from Stifel. Paul Matteis : Hey. Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask, what liability does a physician expose his or herself to if prescribing aducanumab ahead of an NCD? For example, if the drug is prescribed to a patient that ends up not being covered under an NCD or they don't follow certain -- I guess prior [Inaudible] is not the right word, but I now guess to prior [Inaudible] criteria for selecting patients, is there a risk that the treatment center could owe money back to Medicare? And do you think this could have a slowing impact on uptake because of this broader uncertainty surrounding financial exposure? Thanks. Alisha Alaimo : I'll go ahead and take that question. I think that this is really an insightful one because this is where a lot of the fear comes from I think in the centers where they want to know, are we going to be reimbursed? And the answer to that is, you're not going to know until you try. And that's why we're now starting to see centers put through their claims and see how they get processed. However, when an NCD does come out, obviously at that point in time, CMS is also going to have to make a decision as to what they would do with those patients if they did fall outside of the NCD criteria. Unfortunately, we're not going to know until we get to the end of that process. Michel Vounatsos : And if we step back, I would say this type of confusion is something we have seen all the way. When we launched SPINRAZA, there was a same confusion and the controversy is not adding to the clarity and the is making people being more fear, but we start to see things moving in the right direction. It's a beginning of a process, we're still at the early days. Operator : We can now take the next question from Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Cory Kasimov : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on some of the market metrics you discussed. I'm wondering if you can disclose how many P&T review s are outstanding and maybe more so the % that have come back negative? And are the public comments being made by some of the large influential sites like the Cleveland Clinic, having any sort of material influence on smaller community-type clinics that you picked up on, that may impact their early prescribing habits? Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : Alisha? Alisha Alaimo : Yeah. Okay, Cory. Thank you for the question. I think when it comes to the P&T committee, the stat that we gave you, the 35%, is actually the only stat that I can provide at this point in time. And this number changes on a daily basis. P&T committee reviews are happening across the country. We're obviously aware of the really big ones that become public. But some of the smaller ones that are in our targeted sites come in on daily basis, so I can't actually provide that accurate number. However, for the second part of your question, I can't comment on the decision-making process of the specific sites. However, I will say that we are disappointed that sites that have specialized in Alzheimer's disease have indicated they will not provide access to ADUHELM for now. This is not only disappointing for patients, but also for the AD specialists at the sites of course. Each site will have their own specific process and decision-makers, so there's not really a single reason. And even the reasons that you might see publicly are slightly different from what we actually hear directly which, again, causes even more confusion in the marketplace. And just so you know, we're making every attempt to get in front of these decision-makers, to help them better understand the science and data. And also there have been specialists and champions at these sites to see if they can reconsider their current policy. But do remember that many of the physicians can still prescribe the product and have asked for support to find alternative sites so they can infuse their patients. With that being said, there are going to be other sites that look to these accounts to see what kind of policies and procedures that they do put in place depending on their decision-making. However, at the end of the day, these accounts have also said it is just for now. And there may be a potential opportunity to have them reconsider that in the very near future. Michel Vounatsos : Yeah. I just want to reinforce what Alisha just said. And I had the opportunity to engage with many clinicians and scientific leaders, including some from some of the centers that denied. It's the beginning of a process. And I think that we have also the responsibility to provide more data, as Al said. And we are working on that actively. Remember, we have the richest database in AD, in EMBARK. Mike McDonnell : And just to quickly add to that, where we have 35% that have completed a P&T review with a positive outcome or indicated they won't require, you should not assume that the remaining 65% have come back negative. It's very early days, and the majority of those are still outstanding. Mike Hencke : I think we have time for one more question. Operator : We can now take the next question from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. I just wondered, Alisha, if you could expand a little bit on one of the potential NCD scenarios that you mentioned, the coverage with evidence development. Essentially, how that would work if there be a request for additional clinical work and if the drug would be covered during the time, or that additional clinical work would be conducted, or if the drug would not have coverage in that intervening time period. I think there's a little bit of confusion around the CED process. Thank you. Alisha Alaimo : Yes. This is a great question and obviously we've looked into this as well. And unfortunately, an outcome of a CED can have so many different options. You could have something that's as restrictive as we're only going to allow 500 patients to be reimbursed in this clinical trial, to any patient can get reimbursed as long as it meets a certain criteria for us to get evidence. So I would love to be able to answer it directly, but we are so early in the path. We have no idea what the outcome is going to be, but a CED can take on many, many different forms. Mike Hencke : Chirfi would like to add something. Chirfi Guindo : Yeah. Just to add some perspective. There was a CED for the PET process in the first study -- first idea study, which enrolled for about 2 years. They enrolled about 16,000 patients between 2016 and 2018. It was like a clinical trial, very difficult to execute. And one of the challenges with that, as recognized by CMS, is that it only had 4% representation of minorities. So CED really have some challenges. And so as we continue to engage, we're going to be looking forward to making sure that if it is a CED, then it doesn't really restrict access to diverse patient populations. Michel Vounatsos : Okay. For the first time ever we have an FDA approval, accelerated approval product, for Alzheimer's disease based on clear data showing the reduction in amyloid beta plaque, which is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit and in this case, a reduction in clinical decline. Can we now urgently turn our attentions to the patients in need, the way we did for HIV and oncology? Thank you all for your attention today. Operator : This concludes today's call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Third Quarter earnings call and financial update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. If you'd like to ask a question during this time, [Operator Instructions]. Please limit yourself to one question to allow all participants time for questions. If you require any further follow-ups, [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would like to now turn the conference over to Mike Hencke, Investor Relations. Mr. Hencke, you may begin. Mike Hencke : Good morning and welcome to Biogen 's third quarter 2021 earnings call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including our GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financial are provided in Tables 1 and 2 and Table 4 includes the reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. Today, we will be discussing ADUHELM. ADUHELM is indicated for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Treatment with ADUHELM should be initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of disease, the population in which treatment was initiated in clinical trials. There are no safety or effectiveness data on initiating treatment at earlier or later stages of the disease than were studied. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on reduction in amyloid beta plaques observed in patients treated with ADUHELM. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial or trials. ADUHELM can cause serious side effects, including amyloid - related imaging abnormalities or ARIA. ARIA is a common side effect that does not usually cause any symptoms, but can be serious. ADUHELM can cause serious allergic reactions. The most common side effects include ARIA, headache, and fall. Please see full prescribing information and patient medication guide at aduhelm.com. On today's call, I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos, Dr. Al Sandrock, Head of Research & Development, and our CFO, Mike McDonnell. We will also be joined for the Q&A portion of our call by Alisha Alaimo, President of our U.S. organization, and Toby Ferguson, Head of Neuromuscular Development. As a reminder, during the Q&A portion of the call, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question. I will now turn the call over to Michel. Michel Vounatsos : Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. We continue to view 2021 as a transformational year for our Company. We are satisfied with our 2021 pipeline accomplishments and the continued operational performance of the Company. However, we are obviously disappointed. We did delayed UpStake of ADUHELM in the U.S. We had solid financial results for the third quarter with a total revenue of $2.8 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $4.77. Biogen has continued to execute well and demonstrate resilience across MS, SMA, and Biosimilars despite competition. Mike will provide more details on our financial results and I will focus primarily on ADUHELM. We continue to believe in ADUHELM long-term potential and this quarter we continue to progress the launch in the U.S. in anticipation of the reimbursement decision for Medicare patients. We are working through the three near-term challenges we have previously described with a core focus on enabling patient's access. Importantly, we have made steady progress on key metrics, but the healthcare system remains a major bottleneck. In particular, the lack of clarity on reimbursement has delayed patient access to the first treatment to address an underlying pathology of Alzheimer's disease, which is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. We look forward to the upcoming Medicare national coverage determination expected by next April, which would clarify Medicare reimbursement for the entire class of antibodies directed against amyloid. The NCD is a rigorous process involving a number of consultation. And we understand this is required for this new class of drugs for Alzheimer's. However, keep in mind this will delay access for many patients by approximately 300 days from approval. Biogen is acting with urgency across the 3 strategic priorities as we work to support access for patients. First, we are working to improve the communities understanding of our clinical data. As a reminder, the Phase 3 emerged study met its pre -specified primary and secondary endpoints, showing a significant reduction in clinical decline. Patients who receive high-dose ADUHELM experience significant benefits on measure of cognition and function, including activities of daily living. Although, the other Phase 3 study engaged did not meet its primary endpoint analysis for both studies demonstrated that higher exposure to ADUHELM were associated with greater reduction clinical decline. We have submitted these Phase III results to a top tier journal with the manuscript now under peer review, In addition to predication on our data. And we will continue to generate additional data. We launched ICARE AD the first real world observational Phase IV study in Alzheimer's disease designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ADUHELM in clinical practice. We have submitted a draft protocol to the FDA for the required Phase IV confirmatory study. We have fully resource this study with the goal of completing it ahead of schedule. In addition to presenting ADUHELM data at this shows AIC meeting, the embark baseline data have been accepted for presentation at next month's CTAD meeting, which will provide important information regarding the impact of GAAP in treatments. Furthermore, we also plan to present important new plasma phosphorylated data from emergent engage that highlighted the downstream effect of aducanumab as soon as possible. Overall, the approval of ADUHELM was supported by a significant dataset from 8 studies, with more than 3,000 patients. And we look forward to continuing to generate additional data to support the clinical profile of ADUHELM. Our second priority is to approximately ship off development of the necessary infrastructure. At launch, we established a with LabCorp and Mayo Clinic laboratories for amyloid beta CSF testing. Throughout the quarter, we saw a continuous increase in the number of patients utilizing this hum. We also continue to advocate for reimbursement of amyloid PET imaging. Furthermore, we are continuing to see additional sites come online with approximately 120 sites, now treating patients with ADUHELM and many more sites in progress. And third, to clarify reimbursement as we wait to the NCD decision for this class of antibodies, we have obtained the dominant ADUHELM J code becoming active in January of next year and hope this will help simplify the coding process for healthcare providers. Looking forward in addition to presenting and publishing the data that I previously mentioned, the most significant near-term milestones will be the outcome of the NCD for antibodies directed against amyloid. We expect a draft decision in January following by a final decision in April of 2022. In Alzheimer's, more broadly, our partner, Eisai recently initiated the FDA rolling submission for Lecanemab BLA under the accelerated approval pathway following the receipt of breakthrough therapy designation in the use of the anti-amyloid antibodies, that are either approved or in late-stage development. Biogen and Eisai have the opportunity to provide patients with 2 out of the 4 potential options. With the first FDA -approved therapy to address an underlying pathology of Alzheimer's disease, the potential to bring Lecanemab promising pipeline programs such as BIIB080. and with the benefit of digital technologies, we believe Biogen is well-positioned to remain long-term leader in Alzheimer's disease. Moving beyond Alzheimer's disease, together with our partners at Sage, we continue to make progress towards bringing a potential novel therapeutic options to patients suffering from depression. We recently obtained positive data from a Phase 2 study in Japan representing the third positive placebo-controlled study for Zuranolone and MDD. In addition, we announced our plans to initiate a filing in the U.S. Lastly, we recently reported data from the Veloce Phase III study of focusing in ALS. Although the Veloce study did not meet the primary endpoint, signs of reduced disease progression across multiple endpoints were observed. We are encouraged by this study of the evidence and are engage with regulators on next steps, following discussion with investigators Bio ACC, and having the listened to the voice of patient advocacy groups, we intend to expand the early access program and to the broader population of individuals leaving with SOD1 ALS. We believe these recent developments represents a significant step forward in our goal of transforming Biogen from Westworld once NMX Company to one that is built upon the multi-franchises portfolio across a broad spectrum of neuroscience areas. I would now like to turn the call over to Al for a more detailed update on our progress in R&D. Al Sandrock : Thank you, Michelle, and good morning, everyone. As always, I'd like to start by thanking the Biogen team for their hard work as we continue to advance our R&D programs. In addition to key readouts and major depressive disorder and ALS. we hosted an R&D Investor Day to tell you about our pipeline programs, research capabilities, and expertise. I encourage you to take a look at these presentations on our website. Let me now start with Alzheimer's disease, beginning with aducanumab. At the R&D Day presentation earlier this month, I underscored the importance of determining the relationship between drug to biology, as well as biology to disease during the drug development process. In late June, FDA made data from the drug approval package of ADUHELM publicly available. The clinical pharmacology review, included in the approval package, addresses some of these key relationships as shown in the next 2 slides. This first slide shows the relationship between the amyloid plaque burden as measured by the observed SUVR Score versus drug exposure as measured by the predicted cumulative AUC, both at week 78, taking into account all of the data from both Phase 3 trials of aducanumab. The relationship between exposure to aducanumab and amyloid plaque reduction is consistent across the two studies, and shows that amyloid plaque burden decreases as the cumulative drug exposure increases. The next slide shows another figure from the same document, which plots the relationship between the reduction in amyloid plaque burden as measured by SUVR and the preservation of clinical function as measured by the CDR sum of boxes across multiple dose levels of several anti-beta antibodies. Studies 301 and 302 are referred to a study 2 and study 1, respectively, in the ADUHELM label. When viewed together, these data from 6 different anti-amyloid antibodies showed that there is an association between amyloid plaque reduction and the reduction in clinical decline. And that greater degrees of amyloid plaque reduction are needed for a reduction in clinical decline. At the annual AAIC meeting in July, we presented additional data from the EMERGE, ENGAGE, and PRIME trials, which show that aducanumab treatment led to a reduction in amyloid plaques, as well as downstream biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. And that this also led to a slowing of clinical decline. We're looking forward to presenting more data from our aducanumab trials, including the baseline data from the EMBARK study at the upcoming CTAD meeting next month in Boston. We're also looking forward to presenting at the earliest possible opportunity at a scientific venue, new data on plasma P181 towel, reflecting the downstream biological and clinical effects of aducanumab, which I believe will be of great interest to scientists and clinicians. By way of reminder, amyloid plaques containing A Beta protein and neurofibrillary tangles containing phosphorylated towel are the defining pathophysiologic features of Alzheimer's disease. Finally, I'm happy to say that we are on track to soon publish the Phase III aducanumab trial results in a major peer reviewed journal. This quarter we also submitted a draft protocol for the required Phase IV confirmatory trial of aducanumab to the FDA. As I have said before, we have fully resourced to study and aim to complete it ahead of schedule. The key goal of the confirmatory study is to ensure that we have enrolled appropriate numbers of Alzheimer's disease patients from underrepresented populations. It is estimated that by 2030, nearly 40% of all Americans living with Alzheimer's disease will be African American or Latinx. And therefore, having sufficient participation of these communities is especially important to reflect the diversity of the disease in the real world. Through the P hase 4 confirmatory study, as well as ICARE AD, we aim to provide further evidence of the clinical benefits and risks associated with aducanumab treatments. Outside of the United States, we're under regulatory review in multiple geographies, including the EU, where we are actively preparing for a scientific advisory group meeting as part of the CHMP review process. Turning to Lecanemab, we're looking forward to when we can potentially provide two amyloid antibody options for Alzheimer's disease patients. As previously announced, our collaboration partner ESG PSI, recently initiated a rolling submission of Lecanemab data to the FDA for potential accelerated approval. We expect this submission to be complete sometime in 2022. Moving to MS, we presented new data at the Annual ECTRIMS meeting last week, including primary results from the nova phase 3b study evaluating the efficacy of TYSABRI extended interval dose versus the approved every 4 weeks dosing. A real-world claims-based analysis of relapse and hospitalization rates and MS Patients treated with Natalizumab versus ocrelizumab. A new analysis of the evolved MS -2 data focusing on the impact of dose titration on the GI powerability of VUMERITY relative to TECFIDERA and data from the MS paths showing that 100% of people with MS treated with Natalizumab interferon's or fumarates, achieved an antibody response following COVID-19 vaccination as compared to 40% of MS patients treated with anti-CD20 or S1P therapies. With respect to the introduction of VUMERITY in the EU, we were happy to learn of the approval in Switzerland, as well as the positive CHMP opinion and look forward to the final EMA decision. In neuropsychiatry, we were excited to see the results of the Phase II study of Zuranolone in major depressive disorder, recently completed by Shionogi. The Phase II trial was similar in design to the other studies evaluating Zuranolone and MDD, and compared 20 milligram and 30 milligram doses of Zuranolone to placebo in Japanese patients with MDD. The results of this study further support the safety and efficacy profile of Zuranolone in that it demonstrated rapid onset and significant reductions in the Hamby 17 score at Day 3, Day 8, and Day 15. Additionally, while not statistically significant, we see separation from placebo for both the 20 and 30 milligram Zuranolone treatment arms. Out today 57. All adverse events in the study were mild to moderate and consistent with the known safety profile of Zuranolone. The Shionogi study is now the third double-blind placebo-controlled trial evaluating Zuranolone in ran in MDD where the primary endpoint of the change in the Hamdy score at day 15 was met. These results and MDD are in addition to the efficacy of Zuranolone in PPD as observed in the Robbins study. Given the consistent results observed across the Zuranolone trials, Biogen and Sage have announced plans to submit an NDA to the FDA in the second half of 2022. The planned initial submission package will be used to seek approval of Zuranolone for the treatment of major depressive disorder, and an additional filing for postpartum depression is anticipated in the first half of 2023. Additionally, the CORAL study designed to evaluate Zuranolone as an acute rapid response therapy when co-initiated standard antidepressants therapy, is now fully enrolled with top line data expected in early 2022. Moving to neuro -muscular disorders. Earlier this week, we announced results from the pivotal Phase III study evaluating to a person and people with SOD1 mediated ALS. The Phase III, or valor study, utilized the study in Richmond approach to stratify participants into faster and slower progressing cohorts. We were disappointed when we learned that the study did not meet the primary endpoint of a statistically significant change from baseline to week 28 in the ALS functional rating scale in the faster progressing population. Nevertheless, we did observe encouraging trends favoring to first and across multiple secondary and exploratory measures of biological and clinical activity, including assessments of motor function, respiratory function, muscle strength, and quality of life. More over, a pre -specified integration of data from the Phase 3 study and its ongoing open-label extension study reinforced these findings and showed that early to first initiation lead to a slower decline across these measures. Beyond the clinical measures, we observed reductions in CSF SOD1 as compared to placebo, suggesting target engagement was achieved. Moreover, on the key secondary endpoint of a change in plasma neurofilament light, a potential marker of neuron will be generation. We observed reductions of 67% in the faster progressing patients, and 40% -- 48% in the slower progressing patients with the first in treatment relative to placebo. To our knowledge, this represents the greatest reductions in plasma neurofilament levels ever observed in an ALS clinical trial. Most adverse events in the Phase III study were mild-to-moderate in severity, and many were consistent with ALS disease progression, or lumbar puncture related events. Serious adverse events, including transverse myelitis we're seeing in some patients receiving to person. Based on the results of the Phase III study, we are actively engaging regulators, the medical community, patient advocacy groups, and other key stakeholders around the world to determine next steps for the person. Additionally, following discussions with key medical experts and emphasis, we plan to provide early access after first and to all eligible SOD1 ALS patients through an expanded access program. Given the possible importance of early treatment of SOD1 ALS, we continue to enroll patients in the outlet study. A Phase 3 trial of the first initiated in clinically pre -symptomatic SOD1 mutation carriers. Our hope is that treating patients earlier in the disease may provide the best opportunity to slow or even delay the onset of this terrible disease. Also in neuromuscular disorders, this quarter we announced our plans to initiate acsend of Phase 3b study, which aims to evaluate whether treatment with an investigational higher dose of nusinersen has the potential to improve clinical outcomes in patients previously treated with risdiplam. Our SPINRAZA data indicate that exposure remains similar as patients age and grow. We're also advancing the ongoing devote study, evaluating the safety and efficacy of higher exposures of SPINRAZA, as our pre-clinical studies indicate that we ought to be able to safely increase its dose. With the devout and ascend studies we helped to be able to further inform SMA treatment and address the remaining unmet needs of patients. In summary, as I described during our recent R&D Investor Day, we believe the science is breaking and that this is exactly the right time to be pioneers in neuroscience. By leveraging a deep understanding of human genetics and disease biology, we are working to usher in the future of neurotherapeutics, where we identify the right patients and treat early, perhaps even before the onset of symptoms to meaningfully delay or even prevent disease progression. I will now turn the call over to Mike. Mike McDonnell : Thank you, Al. We're very pleased with our third quarter results as we continue to execute well. As we move forward, we remain fully focused on our core business, including the launch of ADUHELM in the United States. Total revenue for the third quarter of $2.8 billion declined 18% versus the prior year at both actual and constant currency and reflects the impact of TECFIDERA generics. Total MIS revenue for the third quarter was $1.8 billion inclusive of Opiamas royalties. Looking at some of the individual products within MS Global TECFIDERA revenue for the third quarter was $499 million. In the U.S. third quarter revenue of $179 million was flat versus the prior quarter with lower volume offset by a decrease in discounts and allowances. We expect TECFIDERA revenue in the U.S. to decline going forward. Outside of the U.S., third quarter TECFIDERA revenue of $319 million increased by 13% versus the prior year was 7% underlying patient growth. We were pleased with the continued ramp in VUMERITY revenue from $91 million in the second quarter to $121 million in the third quarter. We are also pleased that VUMERITY received a positive CHMP opinion in the EU, as well as full regulatory approval in Switzerland. TYSABRI, third quarter global revenue of $523 million increased 1% versus the prior year, notwithstanding some negative channel dynamics in the United States. We were pleased to see 7% growth in global TYSABRI patients. And we believe TYSABRI remains well-positioned to play an increasingly important role in the treatment of MS with initiatives including subcutaneous administration and extended interval dosing. We are also encouraged by the new data on COVID vaccinations that Al mentioned. Moving to SMA, global third quarter SPINRAZA revenue of $444 million decreased by 10% versus the prior year. In the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue of $140 million decreased by 23% versus the prior year as we see continued impact from competition. However, we were encouraged to see that this continuation decreased versus the second quarter of this year. Outside the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue decreased 2% versus the prior year due to competition and pricing pressure in Europe, partially offset by growth in regions outside of Europe. As a reminder, Q1 and Q2 2021 SPINRAZA revenue outside the U.S. benefited from accelerated shipments. With overall market growth, continued data generation, the efficacy and safety profile in all age groups, and further geographic expansion. We continue to believe that's been can return to growth over the medium to long term. Total ADUHELM revenue for the third quarter, it was $300,000 as we saw, wholesalers gradually draw down inventory purchased in Q2 for the 3 main reasons Michel discussed, UpStake has been delayed. I would refer you to this slide as well as slides in the appendix for details on the accounting with Eisai and Neurimmune, which differs depending on geography. Moving on to our Biosimilars business, third quarter revenue of $203 million decreased by 2% versus the prior year as we continued to be negatively impacted by pricing pressure as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. We're excited that Bioviz was approved in the U.S., EU, and UK, and believe that we have the opportunity to continue to grow our Biosimilars business by commercializing new products and entering new geographies such as the U.S. Total anti-CD20 revenue in the third quarter of $415 million decreased 26% versus the prior year. This decline was primarily driven by the decline in RITUXAN revenue, as we see continued impact from Biosimilars, a trend that we expect going forward. Total other revenue in the third quarter of $158 million increased 26% versus the prior year. Other revenue in the quarter benefited from the timing of shipments related to contract manufacturing. Third quarter gross margin was 82% of revenue down slightly from 83% in the prior quarter, and down from 87% in Q3 of 2020. The reduction in gross margin versus the prior year was primarily due to the declines in TECFIDERA and RITUXAN, both of which are high-margin products. We expect continued downward pressure on gross margins going forward. Moving now to expenses in the balance sheet, third quarter, non-GAAP, R&D expense was $702 million, which included a $125 million upfront payment related to our collaboration with InnoCare. Non-GAAP SG &A was $651 million, including approximately $135 million related to ADUHELM. Note that beginning in the second quarter, Eisai's reimbursement of US SG &A costs is reflected in the collaboration profit sharing line. Third quarter collaboration profit sharing was a net expense of $21 million, which includes the reimbursement of $51 million from Eisai related to the commercialization of ADUHELM in the U.S. Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was approximately 14% versus approximately 19% in the third quarter of last year. Third Quarter, non-GAAP loss attributable to non-controlling interest was $11 million. As a reminder, ADUHELM royalties and commercial launch milestones paid to Neurimmune will be reflected in this line. Eisai 's reimbursement for these items will be reflected in collaboration profit sharing. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of the Company's common stock for $750 million. As of September 30, 2021, there was $2.8 billion remaining under the share repurchase program authorized in October of 2020, our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 149 million shares for the quarter. non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the third quarter was $4.77. In the third quarter, we generated approximately $805 million in cash flow from operations. Capex was $42 million and free cash flow was approximately $763 million dollars. We ended the quarter was $7.3 billion in debt, $3.9 billion in cash and marketable securities, and $3.3 billion in net debt. In addition, our $1 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn as of the end of Q3. Overall, we remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial capacity to grow the business over the long term. Let me now turn to our updated full year guidance for 2021. We are increasing our full-year 2021 revenue guidance from our previous range of 10.65 billion to $10.85 billion to a new range of 10.8 billion to $10.9 billion primarily as a result of stronger MS Performance. We are increasing our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance from our previous range of $17.50 to $19 to a new range of $18.85 to $19.35 primarily driven by the revenue upside I just mentioned. We are lowering our capital expenditure guidance from a previous range of $375 million to $425 million to a new range of $250 million to $300 million primarily as a result of delayed spend on certain projects, including some which have been impacted by COVID-19. Our guidance assumes minimal ADUHELM revenue in 2021. We continue to expect revenue to start ramping in 2022 and beyond, particularly after the NCD decision in April, assuming a positive outcome. We expect continued declines in both TECFIDERA and RITUXAN in the U.S. and that the decrease revenue from these high-margin products will put pressure on our gross margin percentage. Full-year non-GAAP, R&D expenses are expected to be between $2.45 billion and $2.55 billion, this range is consistent with our previous guidance. Full-year non-GAAP SG &A expenses are expected to be between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. This range is consistent with our previous guidance and includes an approximate $500 million ADUHELM investment. Of this amount, approximately $150 million would be reimbursable by Eisai as reflected as collaboration, profit sharing effective April 1st and not part of SG&A this ADUHELM investments are slightly less than our previous estimates. We will continue to actively manage the pace of this spend. This annual SG&A range also assumes a seasonally higher spending Q4, consistent with previous years. I would refer you to our press release for other important guidance assumptions. In closing, we're very pleased with our financial performance and are very focused on the ADUHELM launch. We remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash, modest leverage, and a business that generates significant free cash flow. We believe these dynamics position us well to continue to grow the business over the long term. I will now turn the call back over to Michelle for his closing comments. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you, Mike. Biogen continue to demonstrate resilience and strong execution in the third quarter of the year, providing a solid foundation for the Company as we make progress on the ADUHELM launch ahead of the important data releases and publications in addition to the NCD decision for the class of anti-amyloid antibodies anticipated next April. We believe ADUHELM will have present a significant step in the fight against Alzheimer's disease, as the first FDA -approved treatment to adverse defined pathology of the disease, which is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. We know that patients suffering right now from the disease, and it is those patients we keep in mind as we work to support access. In fact, at the CTAD meeting next month, we'll be presenting an analysis showing that without access, everyday that passes we estimate that over a thousand Americans move from mild to moderate Alzheimer's dementia, and therefore may no longer be appropriate for initiation of treatment with ADUHELM. As many have observed, our current sytem so far falls short in diagnosing and intervening in the disease. In addition, Alzheimer's disease is a particularly acute issue of inequality as African Americans are up to 3 times more likely and Latin X individuals are 1.5 times more likely to have Alzheimer's disease when compared to others. We understand the seriousness of the issue and that inclusion of under-represented population in drug development is often low, including in our Alzheimer's clinical trial. We also know that we have work to do and a role to play in correcting this. For that reasons the design of ICARE AD, our real-world Phase IV observational study of ADUHELM, aims to include at least 16% of the trial's expected enrollment from Black, African American, and Latin X patients. In closing, I would like to thank our employees around the world who have demonstrated a dedication to making a positive impact on patient's lives and all of the physicians, caregivers, and participants in our clinical development programs. Our ability to deliver medicines to patients could not be realized without the passion and commitment. We will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas. Robyn Karnauskas : Thanks for taking for taking my question. I think a lot of us have struggled with some of the headlines coming from doctors about how they do not want to give the drug. And I understand that you are highlighting, you know, the NCD, decision as the core crops for a lack of reimbursement. If you talk a little bit about how are you going to convince doctors even if you have a positive NCD decision to give the drug to patients and is that something that we're seeing it in the headlines? Is that something that you're dealing with? Is that a core block for uptake of the drug? Michel Vounatsos : Absolutely, it's running to -- it's -- actually the first priority that we have is to basically educate the community based on additional data on the current data communicated and additional data that we're going to communicate and publish in the near future. They also expect to see a full publication in peer reviewed journal. And sometimes, this is brought forward, but also the worry is the financial release dividends or the lack of. So those issues are interrelated. I will ask Alisha to say a bit more. Alisha Alaimo : Thank you, Michel, and thank you, Robyn, for the question. This is actually not an exact science and what we believe in what we're hearing is that the majority of prescribers actually fall into a combination of two categories. The first is going to be around the benefit risk profile, which of course you are reading about and the question refers to in the second is also what we referred to, which is the hesitancy due to the NCD analysis. However, there are a meaningful portion of prescribers that are still undecided. So those are some of the headlines. We do have a very large bucket that haven't made a decision one way or another. And this is why we have multiple teams working every single day and working very hard to help educate sites in HCP in our clinical data, and on the reimbursement pathways, which you know are very complex. And Michel references also in his opening statements, but we're working with urgency because the cost of doing nothing is also well understood. And Michel mentioned that we estimate that a thousand patients a day advanced in their Alzheimer's journey, from mild to moderate AD, and they may no longer be appropriate for ADUHELM. So we are really committed to being a part of the solution. And that's what motivates us each and every day. And as soon as we get more data, we will be sure to share it because we understand where the question is coming from. So thank you. Michel Vounatsos : We believe, Robyn, that evidence not only coming from ADU but also potentially from all the anti-amyloid products will represent a significant body of evidence for those who are initiating and challenging the amyloid. And we are also very encouraged by the data on ADUHELM. We continue to spend very strong behind our data. That's why it was really in dispute 2 or 3 times. So more to come. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our question from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Michael Yee : Good morning and thank you for the update. Appreciating that you commented that the NCD, of course, is an important milestone. Can you comment around your view around what the scenarios would be and what you believe a positive NCD outcome is, and how important pet reimbursement would be as a part of that positive outcome. Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you, Mike and Michael. And as you know, we are advocating for PET reimbursement since many months and Alisha, will provide more color on the different options. Alisha, in terms of NCD, Alisha Alaimo : Yeah.Thank you, Michel and thank you Michael for your question. So it's important to remember as we've stated that then NCD is not only for ADUHELM, right. It's going to be for the entire class of monoclonal antibodies that target amyloid for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Now, we can't actually speculate on the outcome of the NCD analysis. But as you know, we do believe it will be a major milestone and this will alleviate a lot of the confusion that we're seeing with physicians. However, there are 5 potential outcomes and I think the 3 that people mostly talked about, are most interested in, are one being a new coverage decision. The second is going to be coverage with evidence, which we call CED, and the other will be coverage with restrictions. And if you look at history and you look in the past over the last past 20 years, there's only been 12 that have gone through this process. One was a non-coverage, one was an off-label for CED, and the other ten were basically covered indication. So even though we can't really comment on it, we are in this rigorous process, we are replying to them anytime that they need additional data. But just remember that all manufacturers are in this process together. Michel Vounatsos : Next question. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Cory Kasimov : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I guess that we're all waiting for the NCD. But at this stage of the launch, is there any consideration at all being given to changing the gross price of ADUHELM, given how difficult initial traction has been, or do you think that's not a key impediment in all of this? Michel Vounatsos : I think that NCD is critical, data dissemination is even more, and one is interrelated to the other. And when we look at the metrics -- strategic metrics, market research, the price doesn't come up as the first worry. We have strong rationale. We clearly disagree with the underlying assumption of Eisai's assessment inappropriate putting up data, this mystic assumptions on long-term efficacy, and many more. And I don't think we are the only one in the industry. Okay. So obviously, we have always the opportunity to fine tune our pricing and we keep that as an option. But first is data and data is interrelated obviously with the decision for NCD and infrastructure is also in the meantime progressing. Alisha, do you want to say a feedback on the issue of price? Alisha Alaimo : Yes. Thank you, Michel. And thank you Cory, for the question. And Michel 's absolutely right. While price is always an important factor for sites and for patients, what I can share with you is that we have not heard that price is the primary driver for any decision not to treat patients. In fact, the headwind that we're facing are the ones Michel has mentioned and that you clearly also read in the press every day and you probably see when you are reporting with your analysts reports. But as with other therapies, if patients think they might face difficulty affording ADUHELM, we do have financial assistance programs that are available that can help these patients. So if reimbursement or affordability or potential concerns, we hope that our programs can provide really a potential pathway for them because we do believe that a lack of financial means should not be a barrier for patients to access ADUHELM. Michel Vounatsos : And importantly, Cory, you'll remember that at launch, day 1, we did give the hand to decision-makers for innovative contract, for price falling but limited to on a voluntary basis in order to secure sustainability. And remember, it's not 6 million patients, even not one to choose, it's a portion of those that will be gradually treated. So we did offer that and decision-makers and TMS are aware, but now it's the NCD process. So we stepped back and we respect this process. But the offer is out there. Next question. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Marc Goodman with SVB Leerink. Marc Goodman : Good morning. My question's on Zuranolone. Moving forward with this product is a 2-week treatment course implies a pretty significant kind of cost per pill. And basically it would be really an all-in strategy on a paradigm shift in depression treatment, which seems a little bit risky. I'm just curious about the market research that you've done, and the the conversations you've had with psychiatrist to know that they have a buy-in and this is a good strategy and this is going to really be successful. Obviously, the product works pretty quickly, which is an opinion of itself important, but the two-week treatment course would be very, very different. Thanks. Michel Vounatsos : What is important is that eventually we will be in a position to transform the management of major depressive disorders and postpartum depression. And for the time being, we're driven by science, readouts and the addition date that we get, I must admit that we didn't have yet a discussion on price while I know that the team starts to build data and market research, evidence to be ready should the data confirm. But we are pleased with the 3 placebo control results going into the same direction. Al Sandrock : Yes. Thanks, Mark. It is a paradigm shift in a different way of thinking for psychiatrists. So there will be a lot of education necessary, assuming we do get approval. I think that though that the current standard of care is to use SSRIs or SNRIs that takes weeks, if not more than a month for them to work and in patients stay on them chronically, often with side effects. And that's not a great situation. And the reason why people stay on them chronically is because there's slow onset of action. So having a two-week treatment course where you can then take the drug as needed is a very different way of thinking. And I think would be attractive to many treating physicians. And the fact that its rapid onset allows people to give the two-week treatment and wait for the next as-needed treatment because they know, they can be reassured that within three days of starting they see efficacy -- they will see efficacy in their patients. It is a different way of thinking, but I think it's very, very exciting. Michel Vounatsos : Next question. Operator : Well, take our next question from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Al, I was wondering if you could comment and just remind us around the differences in the BAN2401 Phase III study versus the ADUHELM studies. And the context here is, how important do you think a successful Phase III study is for BAN2401 next year, especially in terms of changing physician perception around ADUHELM and anti - amyloid drugs. Thank you. Al Sandrock : I think it's very important, Matthew, because as has already been stated, doctors are uncertain about the benefit risk. And as Michel said, the data that comes not only from aducanumab, but from all of these anti-A beta antibodies that share the characteristic of being able to greatly reduce amyloid burden. That'll be very important. The difference -- there are more similarities and differences between aducanumab and Lecanemab both bind to aggregated forms of A beta, both reduce amyloid plaque burden quite substantially. The differences are that there's no titration needed for Lecanemab. And the rates of ARIA up at the at the present time do seem to be low. We'll find out in the Phase III study, but they seem to be lower than the rates of ARIA with Mike McDonnell : Aducanumab and it's given every two weeks. And look, the design of the Phase 3 trial to your question is very similar to the design of the aducanumab Phase 3 trials. For example, the primary endpoint is CDR sum of boxes, which is the established clinical efficacy measure for this disease. Michel Vounatsos : Next question. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : Morning guys. It's Jeff, thanks for the question. Just had another one on ADUHELM. Prior to approval, you guys have talked about expansion of manufacturing capacity and investing pretty heavily in the commercial aspect for the launch. I guess the question is : Has a strategy change just given the pace of the roll out? I am just trying to get a sense for whether it's more of a holding pattern before the April NCD or are you guys going to remain aggressive on the investments that you're making in the ADUHELM launch. Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : Thanks for the great question. We stay the course as a Company clearly, because it's as if we were in a delayed pre -launch -- in an extended pre -launch period before the launch. And we stayed the course. Obviously we are staging the spent very closely. Mike and I and the team are scrutinizing the investments request coming from all around the world. So we want to be extremely vigilant and we are but we stay the course because we do believe in our data, we do believe in additional data coming up, and we do believe that the system will adjust and it's a matter of maybe of time. You saw on the slide presented that maybe it's a clear process. We are not far from being there and so we stay the course. Mike McDonnell : Yes, Jeff, it's a great question. And I would describe it as a gating process. We continue to believe in the long-term potential of ADUHELM. And at the same time because of the delays, we're going to gate the spend. So we're still making a meaningful investment to the tune of an estimate of $500 million of SG&A call it 350 net of reimbursement in 2021. The Capex, some of that does tie to facilities to support ADUHELM and we're gaining that. Most of the reduction in our Capex guidance ties to timing and we're also managing a challenge global supply chain right now a little bit. So we're going to be prudent and we're going to gate, but we're going to continue to be ready at the moment in time and invest aggressively. But at the same time being prudent in gating, as we go. Michel Vounatsos : And it's a pre -launch somehow -- extended pre -launch but we're encouraged by the progress, 120 centers that are enhancing ADUHELM and this is more than double than months ago, Alisha. So there is a lot of progress and if there are some large institutions that deny it, they want more data and we'll be there in a few weeks. So it's a process that's unfortunately taking longer than we expected but we have to be resilient and the signal we want to send that we believe because we know the data and we see the progress. So that's our perfect time. Mike McDonnell : Next question, please. Operator : We'll take our next question from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Umer Raffat : Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. I have two parts if I may. So first, Mike and Michel at very helpful commentary on helping us model out ADUHELM for the balance of 2021 but streets still carrying a billion dollars in U.S. ADUHELM for 2022, which basically implies north of 75,000 new starts on ADUHELM next year in U.S. Most would argue 75,000 new starts for next year is probably too high. But I guess since we're trying to level set today, is 25,000 new starts for next year too high an expectation and then also Michel, I feel like as we're heading into the BAN2401 PDUFA, it feels like there wasn't enough street discourse between Biogen Management in the street ahead of ADUHELM pricing. I wonder, is it, is it reasonable for street to expect a ban 24 one price point which is more consistent with our Alzheimer's met. Thank you very much. Mike McDonnell : So I will take the first part of the question, Umer. We're not guiding today for 2022, but I would say a couple of things. We did say that we expect minimal revenue throughout the rest of 2021. We are expecting still our revenue ramp in 2022 post - NCD assuming it is successful and that would be in April. So that should give you some sense for the first quarter. We're in a bit of a delay until that happens. We don't have great visibility to patient counts, which is why we don't comment on the publicly, but we did give you -- what we can say that the sites are continuing to progress. We're at approximately 120 sites now that have infused at least one patient, which is more than double what it was about six weeks ago. And we're going to continue to monitor those metrics and we'll ramp it as quickly as we can. But because of all the pieces, that does cause a bit of a delay and then the other important thing to remember is titration. So to the extent that we get through a successful NCD, there is still patient titration and dosing levels that need to ramp up. And so the revenue ramp is going to be gradual. But the important takeaway is that over the long-term we continue to leave that as a very meaningful multi-billion opportunity. Michel Vounatsos : So we do believe that the uptake will certainly accelerate once the system has indication of potential coverage in January and then the final decision in April. But I don't expect that this uptake to be explosive at the same time. I don't expect this to be linear. We believe there will be an acceleration non-linear of the uptake because the patient journey is still long. And while we make tremendous progress and beyond the 120 centers, hundreds are progressing towards listing the product. It's a very gradual process. But we won't say more at this stage about the number of patients, but we'll have the opportunity to come back. Mike McDonnell : And then on the band pricing that's something obviously we'll determine at the appropriate time and something that we'll be thoughtful about on. I'm not sure there's a whole lot more we can say about it at this stage, but we continue to progress the process there and we are pleased with the initiation of the rolling submission there. Michel Vounatsos : Next question. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Ronny Gal : Good morning. A question about the ADUHELM versus Lecanemab dynamics. If you got to look at slide 10 in your presentation, it does look like Lecanemab has at least the same benefit as ADUHELM does. And given this drug will have full people though, positive there presumably positive in third quarter of next year. It's a safer product and it isn't it the product you're taking into pre -symptomatic Alzheimers. I kind of wonder when you talk about ADUHELM being your growth driver longer-term, are we really saying it's either I'll do how are more Ban due for Align? Can you talk a little bit about the competitive dynamics of the two products. And could Ben to four. Elon end up being the major Alzheimer products that Biogen markets in the future years. Michel Vounatsos : So we are delighted to see Lecanemab coming along strong with the -- it reached data base after ADUHELM and more than 600 patients, but it's only a Phase 2. So we need to see the Phase III. But it's certainly very positive and reinforcing and the line model faction and signals will have the opportunity and the luxury to have two assets. Importantly, I want to reiterate that we stand by the data for ADUHELM because we know the data, we see the data, we see the new data, and we have every confidence in the profile and the benefit in products for the long run. Now, with Leca, it's even a stronger position, but we need to wait for additional data. Al. Al Sandrock : Yeah, I agree. In my experienced things look really, really good after Phase II sometimes. But then Phase III, it's a larger study, more sites, more countries, and so I think, time will tell. And then of course we will get the label, so I agree with Michel. Mike Hencke : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Salim Zad with Missou. Salim Zad : Great. Good morning, guys, and thanks so much for the color and detail. I had one on ADUHELM. So when we look at peak sales for ADUHELM, the street seems, like, the sell-side seems to be carrying around $9 billion in peak sales for this drug pill. And when I run the math here, it seems like that's more based on our chronic administration and usage of the product. But when we consider things like coverage with evidence and this product may not be, I think you guys have mentioned as well, in moderate patients it's no longer appropriate to use the product and that this is a significant portion or could be a significant portion of the Medicare Part B wallet. Should people be really looking at this more you think as an incidence-based model, in a duration of coverage cap coming out of the NCD, potentially? Michel Vounatsos : I'm not sure people will look solely at the incident as if we're doing that for SMA or for HIV. I think Al will comment on that. We continue to stand behind the data and we believe the long-term prospects are significant in terms of value creation. We believe the competition will enlarge the market and the being so large that there is room for four actors and out of the four we have two and two global play also. And we're not panicking because -- it's not because the there is delaying in the U.S. because there is a process. The system is not ready. Evidently we can see that, but it's a long way to go. Al. Al Sandrock : I think underlying your question is the possibility I think that you've proposed, that you could stop treatment after a certain period of time. And I refer you to the beautiful data generated by my colleagues today shown at the AAIC, where they took their Phase 2 trial patients and there was a treatment GAAP and they looked at them in there in the follow-on study. And during that treatment gap even though the amyloid plaque burden remained low in those in which amyloid plaque had been removed by Lecanemab, that during that treatment gap, A-beta 42 to 40 ratio changed slowly over that period, suggesting that there are changes going on biologically, related to the amyloid pathway during that gap period. So I think the jury is still out on whether or not chronic treatment is needed. And I think that remains to be studied and we look forward to providing more data on that. Mike Hencke : We have time for I think one more question. Operator : We'll take our last question from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen & Company. Phil Nadeau : Morning. Thanks for fitting me in. A question on the sites that are activated. You mentioned that 120 sites are currently activated. We're curious to know how many you think you could have activate by the NCD decision in April? And also could you talk a little bit more about the challenges in opening those sites. Are the challenges the exact same as you see with the physicians or are there additional issues like the logistics around monitoring for area or giving the infusions? Thanks. Michel Vounatsos : Alisha. Alisha Alaimo : Yes. So thank you for the question, Phil. And I think when you take a step back and you look at the activated sites, that you know were right around 120 or more, and we do have several 100 that are in queue on this journey, right? So we're giving you a number that talks about the activated site, which means one patient's been infused. But it doesn't capture all the sites that are going to these multiple steps. The operational challenges are still the same. and when you really look at this, I mean being first and being a pioneer in this space has been overwhelming for the system and for these sites. They've never had a drug like this, ever for their patients. And writing their protocols, having to go through all the steps of finding where will they do an MRI, where -- how will they do the lumbar puncture and where they do their infusions has been taking them some time. I was talking to a couple of sites just last week and they've been trying to do this since June. So it's been taking them several months to get up and running. But when you think about our original strategy, which was focusing on the sites where the majority of our patient population have already been diagnosed, you do remember that over 900 sites were ready. So we believe that once we of course, get our additional data out, we share our data and the NCD outcome is finalized, those are going to be the majority of the sites that we will continue to focus on to get them up and running, and get patients through the system. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you so much for attending the call today, Biogen delivered a very strong quarter again, the base business is solid. We're making some progress for as you can imagine, for ADUHELM, despite the short-term challenges we face. So what the key is the outlook and the mid-to-longer-term. We have a path forward for Zuranolone and we're getting prepared to launch Biosimilars of recently you see in the US in a few months from now. Thank you very much for attending the call exciting at Biogen. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Madison and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Fourth Quarter Earnings Call and Financial Update. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Hencke, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Hencke, you may begin your conference. Michael Hencke : Good morning and welcome to Biogen\u2019s fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including our GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2 and Table 4 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. Today, we will be discussing ADUHELM. ADUHELM is indicated for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Treatment with ADUHELM should be initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of disease, the population in which treatment was initiated in clinical trials. There are no safety or effectiveness data on initiating treatment at earlier or later stages of the disease that were studied. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on reduction in amyloid beta plaques observed in patients treated with ADUHELM. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial or trials. ADUHELM can cause serious side effects, including amyloid-related imaging abnormalities or ARIA. ARIA is a common side effect that does not usually cause any symptoms, but can be serious. ADUHELM can cause serious allergic reactions. The most common side effects include ARIA, headache and fall. Please see full prescribing information and patient medication guide at aduhelm.com. On today\u2019s call, I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Priya Singhal, Interim Head of Research and Development; and our CFO, Mike McDonnell. We will also be joined for the Q&A portion of our call by Alisha Alaimo, President of our U.S. organization. As a reminder, during the Q&A portion of the call, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question. I will now turn the call over to Michel. Michel Vounatsos : Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I will start by briefly reviewing our financial performance and Mike will provide more details. For the fourth quarter, Biogen generated approximately $2.7 billion in revenue, representing a decrease of 4% year-over-year as we continued to experience the erosion of TECFIDERA revenue in the U.S. due to the impact of generic entry. Fourth quarter 2021 non-GAAP earnings were $3.39 a share. We believe this performance reinforces Biogen\u2019s ability to execute well. However, given a number of challenges we have faced recently, we announced that we will implement cost reduction measures, which are expected to yield approximately $500 million in annualized savings and Mike will provide additional details. Let me now say a few words regarding the proposed National Coverage Determination, or NCD, for the class of monoclonal antibodies directed against amyloid for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. As currently written, the proposed NCD calls for coverage with evidence development or CED, which will provide reimbursement only for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in an approved randomized controlled trial. In reaching this proposed recommendation, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, highlighted three key areas of focus for this class of therapies, all of which have implications for ADUHELM. First, CMS believes there are gaps in the data on the clinical benefit of these therapies. Second, CMS believes more information is needed about the potential risks of removing amyloid principally ARIA. And third, CMS would like additional data to be generated on the underrepresented communities in which Alzheimer\u2019s disease is more prevalent. These are also areas of focus for Biogen with many important initiatives already underway. We have committed to constructive engagement with CMS to address their concerns and we agree with CMS that additional data maybe helpful to continue to characterize the benefit risk profile for this class of therapies. Now that ADUHELM is approved by the FDA, we believe the most helpful data generation can really only be generated from greater drug utilization in real world practice. We also agree with CMS that the final NCD decision should not lead to a duplication of ongoing activities. As currently postured, however, we believe the proposed CED requirements will be prohibitive for patients, overly burdensome, costly to companies and duplicative of the data that will be generated from ongoing trials and the FDA\u2019s existing required post-marketing requirements. We believe the best way to address the concerns of CMS is to supplement the data from the ADUHELM Phase 3 studies. We generated data over 3,000 patients by taking a multi-pronged approach, leveraging the Phase 4 inflammatory study and vision, our EMBARK redosing study, which has enrolled approximately 1,700 patients; the ongoing ICARE AD registry; the ongoing Phase 3 studies of other antibodies in the class; and other ongoing and anticipated real world data generation efforts. We believe this extensive data generation opportunity will adequately address any open question regarding the clinical efficacy and safety of amyloid beta luring therapies. On this note, we expect to begin patient screening for the ENVISION study in May of this year, with the primary completion date anticipated approximately 4 years later. This is expected to be a global placebo-controlled trial aiming to enroll 1,500 patients with MCI due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease or mild Alzheimer\u2019s disease with confirmation of amyloid beta pathology. The planned endpoint will be CDR sum of boxes at 18 months, with a planned long-term extension for up to 48 months. We believe this study, combined with the other studies I mentioned, should address the questions raised by CMS. Therefore, we will continue to advocate for an NCD that provides rapid and equitable patient access by providing coverage only for the patients identified as most appropriate for treatment in our FDA-approved label, which generally aligns to our Phase 3 clinical trial population. We also believe this multi-pronged approach will allow for more equal access in all communities. We have concerns that the restrictions of the proposed CED would unfairly exclude access for patients in other self communities and geographically remote areas. In contrast, we expect both ENVISION and our ICARE AD registry, which seeks to enroll up to 6,000 participants to obtain more representative data from those communities by aiming to enroll 16% to 18% of U.S. participants from Black and Hispanic population. In summary, we will advocate for a final CD that tracks a better balance between patient access for an FDA-approved therapy today and the desire for additional data that can only be gathered over time and with higher levels of drug utilization in the real world. We look forward to discussing this consideration with CMS and working towards a final decision that is in the best interest of patients. Beyond the NCD last quarter, we presented additional data from the ADUHELM Phase 3 clinical trial showing the effect on downstream Alzheimer\u2019s biology and the correlation between plasma P-cell reduction and less cognitive and functional decline. In addition, we published the Phase 3 ARIA findings in JAMA Neurology. As we look forward, we aim to expand both within and beyond neuroscience with a focus on four pillars to drive growth and value creation. First, we intend as a company to build on our strong foundation in neuroscience, where we currently have 26 programs in clinical development. Second, we have what we believe to be two compelling Phase 3 programs in lupus. This is a therapeutic area with a different risk profile and we are continuing to evaluate additional opportunities in specialized immunology. Third, over the last several years, we have also built a very successful new business with our biosimilars. We recently announced an agreement to sell our stake in the Samsung Bioepis joint venture to Samsung Biologics, with Biogen remaining in our current role as the commercialization partner for the Samsung Bioepis anti-TNF portfolio and ophthalmology programs. We currently anticipate that this transaction will close in mid-2022. Once closed, going forward, we will have an expanded ability to pursue the biosimilars business on our own as we aim to bring more biosimilar products to more patients in more geographies. Mike will provide more details. And lastly, we are also focused on accelerating our efforts in digital health to support our commercial and pipeline programs, while also creating opportunities for potential digital therapeutics. To this point, we have built a dedicated digital health portfolio, which includes the recently announced new collaboration with TheraPanacea with the aim of leveraging our significant database, but also machine learning, artificial intelligence to develop digital health solution that may improve patient care, accelerate drug development and further the understanding of underlying pathologies. Our progress across these four pillars provides us with the potential for two future waves of growth as we launch in new therapeutic areas and build new franchises. First, over the next few years, we believe we have a significant potential in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and depression, two large therapeutic areas with significant and unmet needs. In Alzheimer\u2019s disease, we have a deep pipeline of clinical and preclinical assets, leveraging multiple modalities and targets, including both amyloid and tau, with ADUHELM and Lecanemab, Biogen and Eisai have 2 out of the 4 potential anti-amyloid antibody therapies that are either approved or in late-stage development. In depression, we are collaborating with Sage Therapeutics on Zuranolone, which we believe has the potential to provide a valuable new option for patients suffering from major depressive disorder and postpartum depression. We believe our second future waves of growth anticipated in the mid to late 2020s will be driven by a number of diverse therapeutic areas, including stroke, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and lupus with some of these programs already in Phase 3. These anticipated future waves of growth will be supported by our diversified pipeline, which today includes 32 clinical programs, 10 of which are in Phase 3 or filed. Additionally, outside of our core business, we are pleased to have recently exercised an option for mosunetuzumab, a late-stage investigational bispecific antibody targeting CD20 and CD3 in development by Genentech for oncology and potentially other indications. Exercise of this option will provide Biogen with a profit share, while Genentech will lead strategy and implementation with an expected FDA filing in the near future. This builds on Biogen and Genentech\u2019s long history of productive collaboration, which began with rituximab. Our focus in 2022 will remain on execution and agility as we expect a number of important milestones. This includes the continued launch of ADUHELM in the U.S., the launch of VUMERITY in the EU and our expected entry into the U.S. biosimilars market with BYOOVIZ. We expect 5 data readouts, 3 of which are in Phase 3 and the completion of three regulatory filings in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, depression and biosimilars. Before I turn the call over to Priya for an update on our progress in R&D, I want to first say how impressed I am by what I have seen from Priya, both as the Head of Safety and Regulatory Science and most recently as our Acting Head of R&D. Her ability to lead, her strategic thinking and her subject matter expertise gives me the utmost confidence in her ability to advance our pipeline, while we work to name a permanent successor. Please go ahead, Priya. Priya Singhal : Thank you, Michel and good morning everyone. First, I want to say what an honor it is to serve as Acting Head of R&D at Biogen. Biogen has a track record in developing life-changing therapies in MS and SMA. With a deep and diverse R&D pipeline, Biogen aims to bring impactful medicines to patients suffering from neurological and immunological diseases characterized by significant unmet need. As this is my first earnings call within this role, I would like to review a few areas that I am especially excited about. First, we believe that Biogen has a unique opportunity to lead in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, not only because we are advancing an industry leading Alzheimer\u2019s pipeline, but also because of the proactive focus we have placed on continued data generation for aducanumab. This includes ENVISION, the planned post-marketing Phase 4 study, the ongoing EMBARK redosing study, and obtaining real-world data through the ICARE AD registry. We believe data from patients treated with aducanumab in the real-world settings with greater drug utilization is the best way to complement the extensive clinical data generated on aducanumab to-date in addition to the ongoing and planned clinical trials. We also continue to gain potential insights from the aducanumab Phase 3 clinical data regarding Alzheimer\u2019s disease biology and the treatment effect of aducanumab. On this particular point, Biogen recently presented additional data from the ENGAGE and EMERGE Phase 3 trials at the Annual CTAD Meeting last November. The important analysis of this data showed that in addition to reducing amyloid plaques in the brain, aducanumab treatment also resulted in changes in downstream tau Alzheimer\u2019s disease biology, specifically soluble phosphate tau or p-tau, as seen in both CSF and plasma. In this analysis, we evaluated over 7,000 plasma samples from more than 1,800 subjects from the EMERGE and ENGAGE Phase 3 trials to investigate the effect of aducanumab treatment on plasma p-Tau181. The results showed a time and dose-dependent reduction in p-Tau181 over 78 weeks with aducanumab treatment in both Phase 3 trials. The reduction in plasma p-Tau181 from baseline to week 78 in this analysis was significantly correlated with change in amyloid PET over the same time period and was also significantly associated with less clinical decline across all primary and secondary outcome measures, assessing cognition and function in both studies. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that aggregated forms of amyloid may mediate soluble tau phosphorylation. With regard to our AD pipeline, we are excited about lucanumab, our other anti-amyloid antibody in Alzheimer\u2019s disease that is being developed in collaboration with Eisai. In Phase 2, lucanumab did not utilize a titration period, demonstrated rapid and robust reduction of amyloid plaques and showed an ARIA incidence of around 10%. We look forward to the Phase 3 readout expected in the second half of this year. Beyond our programs targeting amyloid, we are also pursuing a multimodality approach focused on other targets in Alzheimer\u2019s. First, we have BIIB080, which is an ASO that we believe facilitates tau mRNA degradation and has demonstrated both a time and dose-dependent reduction of CSF phospho and total tau in Phase 1. We anticipate starting the Phase 2 study of BIIB080 by midyear. Second, we are also planning for the near-term initiation of a Phase 1 study for BIIB113, a small molecule inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase or OGA, an enzyme believed to catalyze the removal of O-GlcNAc post-translational modification of tau protein. Evidence suggests that O-GlcNAcylation of tau attenuates aggregation. By inhibiting OGA, we aim to increase the O-GlcNAcylation of tau to potentially inhibit tau aggregation and thereby slow clinical decline. Having developed the first FDA approved therapy to address a defining pathology of Alzheimer\u2019s we believe that Biogen is uniquely positioned with the right expertise, experience and access to modalities to lead in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This is a complex disease requiring a multifaceted approach and continued investment as we work to build on the scientific learnings of ADUHELM and develop the next wave of potential Alzheimer\u2019s therapies. I would now like to talk about depression. I believe that Zuranolone with a novel mechanism of action may provide an important new treatment option for patients suffering from major depressive disorder and postpartum depression. The reported clinical data generated to date from multiple clinical trials showed the following : first, in earlier studies, an improvement in depressive symptoms has been observed as early as day 3. Second, Zuranolone has displayed a consistent safety and tolerability profile with no observed evidence of weight gain, sexual dysfunction, euphoria or increased suicidal ideation. Third, the SHORELINE Phase 3 open-label study showed that approximately 80% of patients who responded to the initial course of 50 milligrams of Zuranolone needed at most one additional treatment total during their time in the 1-year study. Fourth, in the WATERFALL Phase 3 study, Zuranalone reduced depressive symptoms in patients suffering from MDD both with and without elevated anxiety. Fifth, Zuranolone has shown improvements in depressive symptoms in postpartum depression. For Zuranolone, we look forward to two Phase 3 readouts this year, the CORAL study in MDD and the SKYLARK study in PPD. The next area I would like to highlight is stroke. Last year, we were excited by the results from the Phase 2 study of BIIB131, formerly known as TMS-007 in acute ischemic stroke. Administration of the current standard of care, pharmacological thrombolytic TPA, is limited to a short therapeutic window within 4.5 hours following the acute onset of stroke symptoms. This short time window is meant to mitigate the risk of intracranial hemorrhage, which is the most concerning adverse event associated with PPA. In the Phase 2a study of BIIB131, acute stroke patients were randomized to receive BIIB131 or placebo out to 12 hours from their last known normal. The primary objective of the study was safety. And of the 52 patients who received BIIB131, non-experienced symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage compared to one out of the 38 patients who received placebo. This was despite an extended treatment window where patients, on average, received BIIB131 at 9.5 hours after the onset of acute stroke symptoms. Additionally, BIIB131 showed a statistically significant improvement versus placebo on the modified Rankin Scale, or MRS, a registrational endpoint of functional independence. Furthermore, the rate of recanalization or improvement of vessel blood flow in patients who had a visible vessel occlusion was approximately 58% at 24 hours, in those who had received BIIB131 as compared to 27% of patients who received placebo. We believe BIIB131 may have the potential to be a best-in-class thrombolytic for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke by extending the time treatment time window out to 24 hours with an appropriate efficacy and safety profile. We are currently evaluating the next steps in the development for BIIB131. In addition to BIIB131, we also continue to advance a Phase 3 study for BIIB093 in large hemispheric infection based upon the effects observed on mortality and cerebral edema in the Phase 2 study. I would now like to turn my attention to specialized immunology. We currently have two Phase 3 assets in SLE, including dapirolizumab pegol in collaboration with UCB and BIIB059, our anti-BDCA2 antibody developed in-house at Biogen. These two assets represent potential first-in-class molecules in SLE. BIIB059 also has the potential to be a first-in-class biologic in cutaneous lupus erythematosus or CLE. CLE is a skin-based autoimmune disease that can be associated with severe scarring and dyspigmentation. In the Phase 2 LILAC study, the CLE part of the study also met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a dose response of BIIB059 on the percent change from baseline in the CLASI-A Score, its standardized scale measuring CLE disease activity at week 16 in individuals with CLE. Furthermore, a higher CLASI-50 response rate or number of individuals with a 50% or greater improvement from baseline in the CLASI-A score was observed in patients who received BIIB059 at week 16. Based upon these results, we are currently planning to also initiate a pivotal study for BIIB059 in CLE this year. Next, I will touch upon ALS. ALS has been a very key focus area for Biogen for many years. And we remain encouraged by the data from the Phase 3 VALOR study of tofersen, where despite missing the primary endpoint of a statistically significant change from baseline to week 28 in the ALSFRS we believe there are trends tabling tofersen across multiple secondary and exploratory measures of biological and clinical activity. We are continuing to collect data in the VALOR open-label extension, and we are actively recruiting for the ATLAS presymptomatic study. Many SOD1 ALS patients have received access to tofersen through the global expanded access program, which is available in countries where local regulations permit it and where we hope to secure long-term access. Further, we are engaged with regulators to determine the next steps for the program. Aside from the areas I\u2019ve highlighted, Biogen continues to grow and diversify the R&D pipeline, which now includes 32 clinical programs. New additions include the exercise of the option with Ionis on BIIB115, an investigational ASO with the potential for extended dosing intervals in SME as well as the recent initiation of a Phase 1 study in Angelman syndrome, a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder that affects the nervous system and causes severe physical and learning disabilities with symptoms beginning in infancy. Importantly, I believe that 2022 will be a significant year for Biogen\u2019s pipeline given the number of important readouts expected, including the aducanumab Phase 3 in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, key readouts in neuropsychiatry for both Zuranolone in depression and BIIB104 in schizophrenia and BIIB078 in ALS. In closing, I believe Biogen has assembled an extensive pipeline of programs informed by generics, a deep understanding of disease biology, specialized modality expertise and digitalization. Therefore, I believe Biogen is uniquely positioned to shape the future of therapeutics in neurology and specialized immunology and make a difference in patients and their caregivers\u2019 lives. I will now pass the call over to Mike. Mike McDonnell : Thank you, Priya, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I\u2019ll focus my commentary on fourth quarter results along with some discussion regarding the full year 2021. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of $2.7 billion declined 4% versus the prior year at both actual and constant currency. Total revenue for the full year of $11 billion declined 18% versus the prior year at actual currency and 19% at constant currency. This decline was mostly driven by TECFIDERA generic entry in the United States. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter, was $3.39. Full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, was $19.22. Total MS revenue inclusive of OCREVUS royalties in the fourth quarter was $1.8 billion. Global TECFIDERA revenue in the fourth quarter was $486 million. U.S. revenue was $161 million. Outside of the U.S., TECFIDERA revenue of $326 million increased by 13% versus the prior year with 7% growth in underlying patients. VUMERITY fourth quarter global revenue was $125 million as compared to $39 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. We expect VUMERITY to continue to grow both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. TYSABRI fourth quarter global revenue of $513 million increased 8% versus the prior year, benefiting from positive channel dynamics in the U.S., and we were pleased to see continued global patient growth. Moving to SMA, global fourth quarter SPINRAZA revenue of $441 million decreased 12% versus the prior year. In the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue of $150 million decreased by 6% versus the prior year, as we saw continued impact from competition. However, we were encouraged to see that discontinuations moderated somewhat versus Q3 of this year. U.S. SPINRAZA revenue increased 7% versus the prior quarter, inclusive of some favorable pricing and channel dynamics. Outside the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue of $291 million decreased 14% versus the prior year due to competition and pricing pressure. We continue to believe that SPINRAZA can return to growth over the medium to long-term. Total ADUHELM revenue for the fourth quarter was $1 million. Moving to our biosimilars business, fourth quarter revenue of $221 million increased 12% versus the prior year, with increased volume partially offset by pricing pressure. Our Q4 biosimilars revenue benefited from a one-time price adjustment of approximately $10 million. Last week, we announced that we have entered into an agreement to sell our equity stake in our biosimilar joint venture, Samsung Bioepis to Samsung Biologics or aggregate consideration of up to $2.3 billion. We believe this represents an attractive financial return given that our cumulative investment in the joint venture was $727 million. It\u2019s important to note that we will continue to record revenue and costs associated with the commercialization of BENEPALI, IMRALDI and FLIXABI with economics that will be substantially unchanged from what you have seen previously. So we are pleased with this transaction because we not only maintain the commercialization rights that we have, but we will also have an expanded ability to pursue additional biosimilars products on our own going forward. Closing of this transaction is currently anticipated in mid-2022, contingent on the effectiveness of a securities registration statement filed by Samsung Biologics and satisfaction of certain regulatory and other customary closing conditions. Total anti-CD20 revenue in the fourth quarter of $414 million decreased 1% versus the prior year. RITUXAN revenue of $153 million decreased 29% versus the prior year due to the impacts of COVID-19 and continued erosion from biosimilar competition. OCREVUS royalty revenue of $261 million increased 29% versus the prior year. As a reminder, the effective royalty rate for OCREVUS royalties resets each calendar year. Fourth quarter gross margin was 76% of revenue, down from 83% in Q4 of 2020. And the reduction in gross margin versus prior year was primarily due to a $164 million charge for ADUHELM inventory and purchase commitments in excess of forecasted demand. Moving now to expenses on the balance sheet, Q4 non-GAAP R&D expense was $700 million, which includes a $60 million opt-in payment to Ionis for BIIB115 and a cost of approximately $50 million for the exercise of our option with Genentech for the bispecific antibody mentioned earlier. We will share any operating profits and losses for this program in the low to mid-30% range in the United States. Non-GAAP SG&A was $785 million, including approximately $155 million related to ADUHELM. Eisai\u2019s reimbursement of U.S. SG&A costs of approximately $45 million is reflected in the collaboration profit sharing line. Fourth quarter collaboration profit sharing reduced our net operating expense by $67 million, which includes reimbursement of approximately $140 million from Eisai related to ADUHELM commercialization, partially offset by $75 million of net profit sharing expense related to our collaboration with Samsung Bioepis. During Q4 of this year, our effective non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 17%. During 2021, we repurchased approximately 6 million shares of our common stock for a total value of $1.8 billion. No shares were repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2021. As of December 31, 2021, there was $2.8 billion remaining under the share repurchase program which was authorized in October of 2020. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 147 million shares for the fourth quarter. In 2021, we generated approximately $3.6 billion in cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures were $258 million, and free cash flow was approximately $3.4 billion. We ended the year with $7.3 billion in debt, $4.7 billion in cash and marketable securities and $2.6 billion in net debt. In addition, our $1 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn as of the end of the year. Overall, we remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial capacity to grow the business over the long-term. Let me now turn to our full year guidance for 2022. We expect full year 2022 revenue to be between $9.7 billion and $10 billion. This financial guidance assumes minimal ADUHELM revenue in 2022, continued declines in RITUXAN revenue due to biosimilar competition as well as continued erosion of TECFIDERA revenue in the U.S. due to generic entry. This guidance also assumes the potential entry of TECFIDERA generics in the EU as early as the first half of 2022 as the outcome of the ongoing challenges to TECFIDERA market protection is difficult to predict. We expect the decreased revenue from these high-margin products to reduce our gross margin percentage as compared to 2021. We expect full year 2022 non-GAAP diluted EPS between $14.25 and $16. Our guidance assumptions are highly dependent on the final national coverage determination, which is currently uncertain. If the final NCD, which is expected in April, is not broader than the draft NCD, our anticipated results and guidance may be impacted. This guidance assumes that we will not have any write-offs of ADUHELM inventory in 2022 which is valued at approximately $225 million as of the end of 2021. This guidance also assumes reasonable levels of utilization of our manufacturing capacity dedicated to our Alzheimer\u2019s disease programs. If our manufacturing capacity is underutilized, we will incur incremental period costs, which are not reflected in our guidance. We expect non-GAAP R&D expense to be between $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion, and our non-GAAP SG&A expense to be between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion. This non-GAAP SG&A expense estimate includes approximately $400 million in support of the launch of ADUHELM, of which approximately $145 million would be reimbursable by Eisai and reflected in the collaboration profit sharing line. These R&D and SG&A expense estimates reflect the implementation of previously disclosed cost reduction measures, which are expected to yield approximately $500 million in annualized savings, of which approximately $350 million is expected to be realized in 2022. These savings are expected to be achieved through various initiatives, which may include downsizing of our global Alzheimer\u2019s infrastructure the savings from which would be shared with Eisai and operating efficiency gains across SG&A and R&D. These savings are expected to be offset by approximately $200 million in additional investments in our pipeline and strategic initiatives. In the event of a final NCD that is not broader than the draft NCD, we anticipate taking further cost reduction measures, which are not reflected in our guidance to further align our cost base with our revenue base. Some of the savings from these further cost reduction measures would be shared with Eisai. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate for 2022 to be between 15.5% and 16.5%, and we assume that we will utilize a portion of the remaining share repurchase authorization of $2.8 billion throughout the year, although this will depend on a variety of factors, including our business development activities. Foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2021, are assumed to remain in effect for the year, net of hedging activities, we have not included any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions as both are hard to predict or any impact of potential tax or healthcare reform. I will now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing remarks. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you, Mike. In summary, 2021 was an eventful year for Biogen. ADUHELM is now the first FDA-approved treatment targeting a defining pathology of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. But as we all know, this is a complex disease, which will require continued investment in research over the years to come. ADUHELM is an important first step, and we remain focused on advancing our leading portfolio with the goal of further addressing the remaining unmet needs for patients. We hope that over time, we will be able to bring additional impactful treatment options, which will build on the scientific learnings from ADUHELM similar to the waves of innovation we have seen in oncology. Before I conclude, let me touch on Biogen\u2019s strong commitment to corporate responsibility, climate, health and equity are deeply integrated challenges that demand bold action, and that\u2019s why we are working to advance a healthier, more sustainable and equitable world. Through our Signature initiative, Healthy Climate, Healthy Lives and other efforts, our goal is to create new ways of doing business that positively impact the way we live and the way we deliver for patients. We are proud that our leadership actions and transparency in this area has been recognized recently by the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, Corporate Knights Global 100 and Just 100. Through this work, we aim to create shareholder value by meeting the needs of our patients, employees, the environment and the communities we serve. In closing, I would like to reiterate that we are committed to engaging with CMS and other stakeholders with the hope of finding an appropriate path forward for the patients in excess of ADUHELM.  We will now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities. Robyn Karnauskas : Given the recent deal that you did with Samsung, you now \u2013 Samsung, you now have more cash. Could you just talk a little bit about your thoughts on how you might want to utilize that cash? And is that \u2013 was there a near-term acquisition or things that you\u2019re looking at or is this just something that gives you optionality? Thanks. Michel Vounatsos : Thanks for the question. As you know, we have a strong balance sheet, and we are continuously looking at how we can deliver long-term shareholder value. So, we are actively working on some business development opportunities to enrich our pipeline, complement our portfolio in line with our strategy. And we will look at the deals based on their own merits, and we are working on that. Mike McDonnell : And I will just add to that, Robyn. I mean as we have said in our prepared remarks, we are pleased with the transaction. It represents a very attractive return relative to the capital that we invested. And the first priority will be to get the transaction closed, as you saw in the release around the deal. The proceeds will come in gradually over time. And so the first priority would be to get the transaction closed and we will continue to explore all of our options around BD deals of all sizes and we will continue our share buyback program as well. And the pipeline remains robust. We look at a lot of opportunities, and we have an extremely healthy balance sheet, as Michel said, and this will only make it healthier. Michel Vounatsos : And Robyn, if I may, an important consideration is now that we can create more value with our biosimilars portfolio, more products, more geographies. Operator : Okay. We will go ahead and take our next question from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Michael Yee : Thank you. Good morning. I guess my question is in regards to ADUHELM, what you are actively doing to try and change the NCD decision. And again, to reiterate, if it\u2019s not changed dramatically, you guys would look to cut \u2013 further cut expenses. So, can you talk about what that would entail? And under what scenario that might change, for example, of BAM with positive. Maybe just outline the thoughts and the roadmap for ADUHELM in 2022? Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you, Mike. I will get started and then my colleagues will come in. First of all, we take into account with a lot of caution, all the areas of focus that CMS has communicated. And based on those, we look at all the initiatives underway in order to scientifically fulfill the question they have being on the benefits risk being on area being on disparity. And we have a lot going on from international studies, EMBARK in ENVISION on top of the Phase 3. And now the time together with CMS to engage into a broad real-world evidence set of initiatives already underway like ICARE AD, but we are contemplating even more that could be disease registry and more. So, we are engaging with CMS constructively, demonstrating empathy to try to find the path forward that will be the best for patients. Alisha? Alisha Alaimo : Yes. Thank you, Michel, and hello, Michael. Thank you for the question. In regards to what we have been doing as an organization, during the past three weeks, we have met with CMS to share our perspective and answer any of the questions that they have. And you will see that we will be submitting our in-depth comments in the coming days, obviously, during this comment period. In parallel, we have also been educating physicians and policymakers and advocates about what this would actually mean for patients. I think a lot of people, as you have seen, have been quite confused by the draft NCD and what a CED actually means to them. And as you have likely seen, many stakeholders have had similar concerns. So, we have seen patients, patient advocates, HCPs, other manufacturers and industry groups like bio and pharma also sharing their perspectives quite publicly. And there is one week remaining for the open comment period, and we are very much looking forward to this final decision in April, so the community has more clarity. And that brings me now to the comment period. You may have seen over and I think as of today, it\u2019s around 2,600, 2,700 public comments submitted to CMS. And again, with still one week remaining, I think it\u2019s important for everyone to remember and to keep in mind that CMS indicates on their website that the most helpful comments are ones that site published clinical evidence. And when you actually separate the comments out from the dementia specialist, you will see that many of them are against this draft NCD. With prior comment periods, we have seen that in the final days, you tend to see more letters that are heavily researched and referenced. And as I have said before, you will see ours being posted in the coming days. So, we do remain engaged actively with all stakeholders. We do remain engaged, obviously, still with CMS, and we are looking forward to the final decision in April. Michel Vounatsos : And so Mike, in your question on the cost measures, as we said in our prepared remarks, our guidance does assume that the final NCD would allow for meaningful patient access over time that does not translate into material revenue in, but it would create a more open access than what we saw in the draft. Should that not be the case, we are doing scenario planning now. On the cost measures, we mentioned our plan of a $500 million cost measure, of which we estimate we will get $350 million in 2022, which is assumed in our guidance, and we will invest about $200 million of that in a variety of different initiatives, including product launches. And in the event that we have a much more restrictive NCD, we will need to look at the elements of that. We certainly will be flexible in looking at allocating resources between ADUHELM and lecanemab. We mentioned in our SG&A, it\u2019s assumed that we have a $400 million ADUHELM support estimate, and we obviously would take a hard look at that as well other costs we could take out in order to offset any potential impacts on inventory potential write-downs and excess capacity charges, which are not reflected in our guidance. Mike McDonnell : And Mike as a closing comment, if I may. As a company, we are fully committed to deliver on this data being the international study being the real world ones. And we believe that this extensive data generation will adequately address any open question raised by CMS. Operator : And we will go ahead and take our next question from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was hoping you could just clarify on the TECFIDERA EU contribution to guidance and what we are going to learn this year, which may either help us understand if that revenue is at risk this year, or if you could continue to expect to see it and that could be potential upside to your current guidance? Thanks. Michel Vounatsos : Sure, Matthew. Thanks for the question. And there is a \u2013 we believe there is the potential for generic entry at some point in the first half of 2022. We do believe that we are entitled to market protection, and we are certainly going to do all we can to assert that. But we did reflect in our guidance, as we mentioned, in our opening remarks and in our press release that we do assume that there could be some generic entry somewhere in the first half of 2022. Mike McDonnell : So, this is assumption driven at the same time for \u2013 at the same time, as already communicated, we are launching VUMERITY in 20 markets within the EU. Operator : And we will go ahead and take our next question from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to focus on BAN2401 for a second and really just two questions there. One, can you help us understand the magnitude of missed doses in the Phase 3, because I recall you increased the sample size by 200 patients. And I wonder if that percentage increased versus the original sample size reflects the amount of missed doses. And secondly, the primary analysis, is that ITT, or will that screen out the rapid progressors or certain subsets of patients based on some of the learnings from ADUHELM? Thank you very much. Michel Vounatsos : Priya? Priya Singhal : Thank you for the question. So, just stepping back, I just want to reiterate that Clarity AD will read out in Q3 this year, and we remain very excited about that outcome. I cannot really comment on the details of the statistical analysis plan. But what I can tell you is that any learnings that can be incorporated have been incorporated and that the primary endpoint remains the CDR sum of boxes. So, we look forward to the readout. Thank you. Operator : And we will go ahead and take our next question from Marc Goodman with SVB Leerink. Marc Goodman : Yes. Good morning. So look, there is two key events, right. We have the CMS decision that we are waiting on. And then obviously, we have the lecanemab data in the third quarter. So, just kind of wondering your thought process of if the first one goes disappointing, do you make the changes, or are you waiting for the lecanemab data because we are kind of wondering whether you are going to break down the Alzheimer\u2019s infrastructure before you get that data? And how much business development is being impacted by those two decisions? I mean are you looking at these BD opportunities right now regardless of what happens with those events? Thanks. Michel Vounatsos : Thanks for the very fair question. As I have communicated, we will remain as a team, agile and flexible. And obviously, we will do everything we can to preserve our operating results while delivering on the strategy. We do believe in leca, but we will take some aggressive steps should the NCD remain on the current form. Mike McDonnell : And I think, Marc, I would just add that the \u2013 how much of our infrastructure we would allocate to lecanemab versus not, etcetera, that really depends on what the final NCD says. It\u2019s across the entire class, and that would really depend on the specifics of how the final NCD reads. I would say on BD, we will continue our BD efforts regardless. Those are ongoing, and they are always ongoing. Operator : And we will go ahead and take our next question from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Salveen Richter : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. In light of the recent opt-in for the Roche compound, does this signal a greater structural move into oncology? And are there any other areas you are looking at as you pursue BD? Michel Vounatsos : No. I mean it\u2019s a continuation of the very good partnership that we have with Genentech since rituximab, and we have benefited from a remarkable cash flow contribution that we all appreciate and even now, even with our biosimilars. So, it\u2019s a continuation. It\u2019s not a shift of strategy. I communicated the four pillars of growth, and we remain focused on those. And we believe that we are set for long-term shareholder value generation by sticking \u2013 by staying the course and delivering on those. Operator : And we will go ahead and take our next question from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Cory Kasimov : Hi. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow-up on the Phase 3 lecanemab study and can you comment on the enrolled patient population in terms of adequate representation for underrepresented communities that may address the CMS concerns you spoke to? And just with regards to Mike\u2019s comment you just made on NCD and waiting for this data. Wouldn\u2019t it be your expectation that a final NCD could be changed if we have robust positive Phase 3 results from other Alzheimer\u2019s programs later on in the year? Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : Priya. Priya Singhal : Yes. Thank you for the question. I think that Eisai will comment on the underrepresented population percentage, but it is actually very robust, and we are very encouraged by the efforts made to include this population in the Clarity AD. With regards to the outcome of the NCD and how it might impact lecanemab, I think that, that remains to be seen currently. It is a class \u2013 the NCD is addressing the entire class, but we believe that there is hope at the end of the road here. So, we look forward to seeing the final outcome in April. Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : So, I think that we all have to do a better job, including diverse population, unfortunately affected with a high level of incidence for the disease in interventional studies and real-world studies. And this is what we are doing. And I think \u2013 I hope that this will be well received by CMS. And we did communicate that for the ENVISION study, we aim to reach from 16% to 18% of diverse population, the same in real world with ICARE AD. So moving forward, we will gather much more data, and the same for the other real world evidence opportunities that we are sharing with CMS. Operator : And we will go ahead and take our next question from Jay Olson with Oppenheimer. Jay Olson : Hey. Thanks for the updates and for taking the question. Since self-administered subcu formulation of ADUHELM could fall under the purview of Medicare Part D and therefore, lie outside the scope of a potential CED if it\u2019s finalized, could you comment on where Biogen stands with regard to the development of subcu ADUHELM? I think you did a bioequivalent study a few years ago. So, is subcu something that could be a relatively near-term option? Michel Vounatsos : So, we will comment certainly on the life cycle management opportunity. Priya will say a few words. But I just want to outline and come back to the first area of concern communicated in the draft NCD, which is basically benefit risk and questioning the hypothesis and the class in terms of mode of action and positive impact on the patients. And this obviously is independent from any formulation. Priya? Priya Singhal : Thank you for the question, and thanks, Michel, for those comments. We will definitely be building on our prior learnings in ADUHELM subcutaneous formulation development. And we are currently engaging with regulators on having a robust plan forward for this development. So, that is ongoing. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning everyone. This is Jason on for Geoff. Thanks so much for taking our questions and the color. I wanted to connect the dots a little bit on your earlier comments about capital allocation. Specifically, what are the priorities here? And what is going to be the deciding factor? Is it candidly going to be the final NCD decision in terms of how things are meted out, or are activities ongoing? Thank you. Mike McDonnell : Yes, Jason, thanks for the question. It\u2019s Mike speaking. And just reiterating a bit of what we said before. We are constantly looking at options around deals of all sizes, different opportunities, early stage, late stage across. It runs the gamut, primarily focused on neuroscience, which is our focus. And we will continue to do that, and we will continue to invest in our pipeline, and that is regardless of the outcome on the NCD and it\u2019s regardless of the fact that we have now incremental cash if we get the \u2013 once the Samsung transaction closes. So, I think we have a healthy balance sheet. That\u2019s unchanged, $4.7 billion of cash and marketable securities at the end of the year, a modest amount of net debt less than one turn, and we have a $1 billion revolver that\u2019s undrawn. So, we will continue to actively pursue BD. That strategy is unchanged, and I don\u2019t see a significant shift in strategy in terms of NCD outcome or Samsung transaction or anything else. We will continue to explore all of our options around BD actively, and we are doing that. Operator : And we will take our next question from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Brian Abrahams : Hi guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. On lecanemab, just a couple of quick follow-ups on that, just can you give us a sense of any COVID impact to data collection in that study. Are your plans for accelerated filing for accelerated approval still intact in light of the NCD? And any modifications that you might need to make to infrastructure upon success to accommodate for the more frequent dosing versus ADUHELM? Thanks. Michel Vounatsos : Priya? Priya Singhal : Thank you for the question. So, I can say that lecanemab is on track to read out. As previously communicated, this will be in Q3 of 2022. So, at this point, we don\u2019t expect any changes to that along with Eisai. So, that\u2019s number one. And second, I think that there are no real other changes to communicate on the outcomes or on the measures that have been included in the study. So, is there another question that I am missing here? Brian Abrahams : Patient follow-ups due to the pandemic. I know it\u2019s a global study with a lot of sites. Priya Singhal : Yes. And I think that it\u2019s been managed really well. So, I don\u2019t expect any delays in terms of the readouts. And I think your second question was about accelerated approval. As you know, they have breakthrough \u2013 we have breakthrough designation on this product. And there will be a filing. We are intent on filing. The filing many components have already been filed. And once the filing is complete, that will be communicated I think that the most important thing to remember here is that while it might go in as an accelerated filing, the confirmatory study for lecanemab is the Clarity AD, which will read out this year. So, I do expect the Clarity AD conformatory study to read out during the review period for this program. I hope that clarifies. Michel Vounatsos : I just want to outline once more that we are working very closely with Eisai at finding synergies in terms of capabilities of both organizations and how we can optimize the value for both compounds. Michael Hencke : I think we have time for one more question. Operator : And we will take our last question from Salim Syed from Mizuho. Salim Syed : Great. Thanks so much for the question guys. Michel, I wanted to address a bit of an elephant in the room. And I asked this question constructively, and I hope you can appreciate that. So obviously, people talk about misalignment between management and the Board at Biogen, and business development is obviously a key focus for you guys, and I appreciate all the commentary that you guys are looking at deals of all sizes, early late stage. But in your view, is there a misalignment here that would make meaningful BD something difficult in 2022, or has something changed that we can now expect that to occur? Thanks so much. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you, Salim, for giving me the opportunity to answer this question. I will invite you to look at all the BD deals that were performed during the past 5 years versus the previous 5 years. And I think this will give you an idea about the alignment, but it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s an easy road. It means that we have challenges management. We really need to have open discussion between the Board and management to secure that we are in the best position to allocate capital, but we were able and we continue to be able to work together in order to move forward the organization in the best strategic position the way we believe we are today compared with the period before. Look at the four pillars of growth, look what we are doing with biosimilars, we are enriching the cash flow generation opportunity. And even if we are in the unfortunate situation of losing rituximab and TECFIDERA and a delay launch by almost a year eventually, if NCD is positive for ADUHELM, we are still in a multibillion cash flow generation opportunity. We work together very closely. So, thank you all for this good engagement. And I would like really to reiterate that we are committed to engaging with CMS and all the other stakeholders with the hope of finding an appropriate path for immediate patient access to ADUHELM. Thank you all for your attention today. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Cecilia and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call and Business Update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hencke, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Hencke, you may begin your conference. Michael Hencke : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Biogen's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including our GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2 and Table 4 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflects how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Priya Singhal, Interim Head of Research and Development; and our CFO, Mike McDonnell. As a reminder, during the Q&A portion of the call, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question.  I will now turn the call over to Michel. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We continue to execute on our core business objectives in the first quarter. Mike and Priya will review our quarterly performance and recent progress in R&D, while I focus on our strategy and near-term operational priorities. Let me start with a few comments on the recent national coverage determination by CMS for amyloid beta targeted therapies for Alzheimer's disease. This decision effectively denies all Medicare beneficiaries access to ADUHELM. We are very disappointed by the final NCD. And as a result, we will substantially eliminate our commercial infrastructure for ADUHELM. We will retain minimal resources to manage patients access programs, including a continued free drug program for patients currently on treatment in the U.S. We expect to continue funding certain regulatory and R&D activities for ADUHELM, including the continuation of our EMBARK redosing study and the initiation of our Phase IV post-marketing requirement study ENVISION. Additional actions regarding ADUHELM may be informed by upcoming data readouts expected for this class of antibodies as well as further engagement with the FDA and CMS. In parallel, we are committed to working closely with Eisai on the potential launch of lecanemab. We are now looking forward as we work to advance our broader pipeline, including lecanemab and zuranolone, execute on our base business and deploy our capital in the best interest of shareholders. We recognize that Biogen is facing a number of near-term challenges. These challenges, including generic erosion of TECFIDERA, competition for SPINRAZA in biosimilars and DTNF [ph] and a declining profit share from RITUXAN in the U.S. These challenges are all part of the biopharmaceutical business life cycle, and we believe that potential new product launches such as lecanemab, zuranolone and additional biosimilars can help return the company to grow over time. Further, we see the potential for additional growth driver in the mid-to-late 2020s in other areas such as stroke, lupus and Parkinson's disease and, of course, we will be pursuing new business development opportunities as well. However, given that we are in a long product cycle business and in light of the CMS decision, we recognize there is more we must do today to provide better clarity and visibility into the company's future. Let me share the priority actions we are implementing now. First, we are increasing our focus on R&D prioritization with the goal of maximizing the probability of success, which Priya will further discuss. This prioritization process will be informed in part by key data readouts expected in 2022. In Alzheimer's disease, together with Eisai, we plan to complete the rolling submission for lecanemab under the Accelerated Approval Pathway in the U.S. during the second quarter of this year. In addition, we expect a readout of the Phase III CLARITY AD, complementary trial for lecanemab this fall.  Based on the results of this study, we plan to submit for full FDA approval by the first quarter of 2023 with the opportunity for lecanemab to become the first anti-amyloid antibody to obtain full approval for Alzheimer's disease in the U.S. In neuropsychiatry, we are working with Sage to advance zuranolone as an important new potential option for MDD and PPD. We recently initiated the rolling submission of the zuranolone in MDD and expect to complete the filing in the second half of 2022. We also look forward to the Phase III SKYLARK study readout in PPD, expected mid this year with an associated filing for PPD anticipated early next year. Also in neuropsychiatry, we expect the Phase II readout for BIIB104 in cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia in mid-2022. Second, we will implement additional cost reduction and productivity measures above and beyond our previously communicated initiatives to further align our costs with our revenue base. These measures will include the substantial elimination of our commercial infrastructure supporting ADUHELM as well as other cost reduction while we continue to fund promising pipeline and commercial opportunities. Third, we are executing on international growth opportunities with a focus on key emerging markets, such as China and certain markets in both Latin America and the Middle East. This includes the continued launch of SPINRAZA and may also include pursuing local business development opportunities. Both -- we plan to drive renewed growth in our biosimilars business, although our portfolio of NTMS products slightly past the peak of its life cycle. We currently have four more programs in development, and in the near term, we are preparing to launch Bioepis, referencing LUCENTIS in the U.S. in the coming half. Our fifth near-term priority is capital allocation. Biogen is fortunate to have a strong balance sheet with $4.8 billion in cash as of the end of the quarter and modest net debt, as well as strong cash flow generation. Going forward, we plan to continue to focus the deployment of cash towards initiatives designed to create incremental revenue growth opportunities while continuing to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases. In summary, the challenges faced by the company over the last -- the past 12 months have been significant. We are committed to taking advantage of all the strengths we have, including our talent, our commercial portfolio, our manufacturing capabilities, our pipeline, which includes 10 programs in Phase III filed and, of course, our strong balance sheet to deliver on the performance that is expected from us. Let me conclude by saying that it has been an honor to lead this outstanding company during such a challenging period of time and to work closely with so many dedicated and talented colleagues. I am very proud of all that we have achieved. I want to thank the Board of Directors and my colleagues for their support during this period. I will be leaving at a time of promise for Biogen with noteworthy potential for value creation, and I look forward working with my successor through a smooth transition. I will now turn the call over to Priya for an update on our recent progress in R&D. Priya Singhal : Thank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone. As Michel mentioned, we are enhancing our focus on dynamic R&D prioritization with the goal of ensuring a sustainable pipeline that can deliver on Biogen's vision of a multi-franchise portfolio. We will continue to invest in R&D in a disciplined manner, including pursuing new and external opportunities with a potentially different risk/reward profile encompassing those within our core neuroscience therapeutic areas as well as select investments in therapeutic adjacencies. This approach will be informed by emerging scientific data, as well as internal and external readouts. As part of our overall prioritization strategy, we may choose to accelerate, terminate, divest or partner certain programs. In addition, we will continue to advance key capabilities such as functional genomics, patient identification, novel modalities, biomarkers and clinical outcome measures. The goal being to reduce risk, accelerate clinical development and increase the probability of success in achieving positive proof of concept. I will now share the R&D highlights of the quarter. Starting with Alzheimer's disease. In addition to continuing the progress with lecanemab U.S. filing and the Phase 3 study, Eisai presented data at the annual ADPD meeting this past March showing that lecanemab treatment in the core Phase 2b study resulted in a dose and time-dependent reduction of brain amyloid as measured by PET SUVR and that the reduction of brain amyloid was co-related with changes in two important peripheral biomarkers of amyloid and tau pathology, specifically an increase in plasma ABN42 to 40 ratio and a decrease in plasma phospho-tau 181, respectively. Furthermore, these biomarker changes were correlated with clinical benefit as assessed by the change from baseline in the clinical dementia rating scale, Sum of Boxes. Notably, however, these peripheral biomarkers gradually began to reverse upon discontinuation of lecanemab treatment at the end of the core study, suggesting that stopping dosing prematurely may allow re-accumulation of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Eisai also presented additional information on ARIA from the lecanemab Phase IIb study. This included the incidence of ARIA-E [ph] in the open-label extension where ARIA-E was observed in less than 10% of participants receiving 10-milligram per kg lecanemab biweekly and a symptomatic ARIA rate of less than 2%, consistent with the core study. We look forward to further defining the safety and efficacy of lecanemab through the larger Phase 3 CLARITY AD study. Biogen and Eisai are currently evaluating subcutaneous dosing in a sub-study of the CLARITY AD open-label extension, which will evaluate subcutaneous injections compared to IV infusions. This is in addition to the ongoing AHEAD 345 study evaluating lecanemab in people with preclinical Alzheimer's disease or prior to cognitive impairment, which was initiated back in 2020. Beyond lecanemab, Biogen continues to pursue new treatments across molecular targets in Alzheimer's disease. This includes actively planning for the Phase II study of BIIB080, our tau ASO, and initiation of dosing in the Phase I study of BIIB113. BIIB113 is a small molecule inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase or OGA, an enzyme believed to catalyze the removal of O-GlcNAc post-translational modification of the tau protein. By inhibiting OGA, we aim to increase the oglicmulation of tau to potentially inhibit tau aggregation and thereby slow clinical decline. As Michel mentioned, with aducanumab, we are also continuing to collect data in our EMBARK redosing study and working towards the initiation of ADUHELM Phase IV post-marketing requirement study ENVISION. Moving to neuropsychiatry. Biogen and Sage recently announced that we initiated the rolling submission of a new drug application to the FDA for zuranolone in MDD. We expect to complete the filing in the second half of this year. We were also excited to announce that the zuranolone Phase III CORAL study in major depressive disorder met the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint. The CORAL study was a randomized blinded trial designed to assess rapidity of response when zuranolone 50 milligrams is co-initiated with an open-label standard of care antidepressant or ADT versus placebo who initiated with ADT, as measured by the change from baseline on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Top line results showed that zuranolone co-initiated with ADT resulted in a statistically significant reduction in depressive symptoms at day 3, the primary endpoint and the earliest time point measured, as well as over the full 2-week treatment period as compared to placebo co-initiated with ADT. Zuranolone was generally well tolerated with most treatment-emergent adverse events reported as mild to moderate.  In MDD, zuranalone has now delivered four positive randomized controlled trials in total, as well as important insights on repeat treatment from the SHORELINE study, a large prospective naturalistic study in MDD. While these trials were designed to address different questions, we see a consistent profile of zuranolone that includes rapid reduction in depressive symptoms compared to the standard of care antidepressants, a consistent tolerability profile with a low discontinuation rate due to adverse events and without observed weight gain, sexual dysfunction or suicidal ideation; a short course of treatment that can be potentially taken as needed; and a flexible treatment approach that may provide optionality to HCPs and patients. This is in addition to positive data from the Phase III ROBIN study of zuranolone in postpartum depression. We look forward to the Phase III SKYLARK study readout in PPD expected by midyear with an associated filing for PPD anticipated early next year. We look forward to potentially bringing a rapid onset, well-tolerated oral antidepressant with sustained effects and a new mechanism of action to patients suffering from depression. Moving to ALS. We previously reported that while the Phase III VALOR study for tofersen in SOD1 ALS, a rare genetic form of ALS, did not achieve the primary endpoint of a statistically significant change on the ALSFRS-R at week 28 versus placebo. We did observe signs of reduced disease progression across multiple secondary and exploratory endpoints. We plan to present integrated data from the Phase III VALOR study and a new interim analysis of its ongoing open-label extension at the upcoming ENCALS meeting in June. This interim analysis includes data from participants with SOD1-ALS who had the opportunity for at least one year of follow-up from the start of VALOR. Long-term data on measures of function, strength, quality of life and survival will be presented. We also continue to recruit for ATLAS, a study evaluating tofersen in presymptomatic participants with a confirmed SOD1 mutation, while also supporting the global Toferson Expanded Access Program, which includes approximately 120 people with SOD1-ALS to date from more than a dozen countries. We also remain engaged with regulators on potential next steps for tofersen. As you can see, 2022 is an important year for Biogen R&D with several important milestones expected as we continue to advance a diversified pipeline that contains a total of 32 clinical programs with 10 programs in either Phase III or being filed. These milestones include key regulatory filings, mid- to late-stage readouts in both Alzheimer's disease and neuropsychiatry, initiation of late-stage studies in Parkinson's disease, and starting a pivotal study in cutaneous lupus erythematosus, in addition to ongoing recruitment for 2 Phase III lupus programs in SLE, as well as planning next steps for the BIB131 stroke program. In summary, we are taking actions that we believe will enable delivery of a number of potential first-in-class and best-in-class molecules to patients suffering from diseases with significant unmet need.  I will now pass the call over to Mike. Mike McDonnell : Thank you, Priya, and good morning, everyone. I will provide some key highlights around the financial performance for the quarter and review our full year 2022 guidance. Please note that all financial comparisons are versus the prior year, unless otherwise noted.  Total revenue for the first quarter was $2.5 billion. Our MS business inclusive of OCREVUS royalties delivered $1.6 billion in revenue. TECFIDERA continues to be impacted by generic entry in the U.S. and was negatively impacted by pricing pressure outside of the U.S. VUMERITY first quarter global revenue was $128 million. We are pleased with VUMERITY's trajectory in the U.S. and are making good progress towards launching in up to 20 markets outside the U.S. this year. TYSABRI global revenue increased 3%. In the U.S., TYSABRI revenue benefited from favorable pricing that more than offset modest volume declines. Outside the U.S., we were pleased to see continued patient growth. Interferon global revenue declined by 23% due to the continued shift from the injectable platforms to oral or high efficacy therapies. Moving now to SMA. SPINRAZA global revenue declined 9%. In the U.S., although revenue growth of 10% was driven by positive channel dynamics, we were encouraged to see new patient starts at the highest levels in over 2 years and a continued slowdown of discontinuations versus the prior quarter. Outside the U.S., the revenue decline was driven primarily by the timing of shipments in certain markets, competition and negative currency impacts, partially offset by strong initial uptake in China as this was the first full quarter since receiving national reimbursement in China. Global SPINRAZA revenue grew 7% versus Q4 of 2021, driven by solid sequential performance outside the U.S. as well as some seasonality dynamics in the U.S. Moving to our biosimilars business, revenue declined 5%. While volume increased, this was more than offset by pricing pressure and negative currency impacts. In April, we completed the transaction to sell our equity stake in our biosimilar joint venture. As a reminder, the economics for anti-TNF and ophthalmology programs will be substantially unchanged. In addition, we are preparing to launch Bioepis the U.S. in the coming months. We expect a gradual launch with more meaningful revenue contribution starting in 2023. Overall, we expect full year biosimilars revenue to decrease versus the prior year due to pricing pressure in Europe. Total anti-CD20 revenue grew 3% with increased OCREVUS royalties being partially offset by a continued decline in RITUXAN revenues due to biosimilar competition. First quarter gross margin was negatively impacted by a $275 million charge for ADUHELM inventory write-offs, as well as approximately $45 million of idle capacity charges. Note that Eisai's share of these charges is reflected in the collaboration profit sharing line. Moving now to expenses and the balance sheet. Q1 non-GAAP R&D expense was $552 million. Non-GAAP SG&A was $635 million, including approximately $80 million related to ADUHELM. Eisai's share of these costs are also reflected in the collaboration profit sharing line. First quarter collaboration profit sharing reduced our net operating expense by $117 million, which includes reimbursement of approximately $182 million from Eisai, partially offset by $64 million of net profit sharing expense related to our collaboration with Samsung Bioepis. In the first quarter, we generated approximately $162 million in cash flow from operations, which was negatively impacted by the timing of certain payments. Capital expenditures were $58 million and free cash flow was approximately $104 million. We ended the quarter with $7.3 billion in debt, $4.8 billion in cash and marketable securities, and $2.5 billion in net debt. We subsequently also received approximately $1 billion from the sale of our JV equity to Samsung Biologics. Additionally, our $1 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn as of the end of the quarter. Overall, we remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial capacity to invest in growing the business over the long term.  Let me now turn to our updated full year guidance for 2022. We are reaffirming our full year revenue guidance of $9.7 billion to $10 billion. This revenue guidance reflects the strengthening of the U.S. dollar from January 1 through April 29, resulting in an estimated currency headwind of approximately $120 million, net of hedging activities. We are also reaffirming our full year non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance of $14.25 to $16, despite the $0.76 impact of ADUHELM inventory write-off as well an impact of approximately $0.35 related to the strengthening of the dollar that I just mentioned.  Although our prior guidance did not assume either the inventory write-offs or the currency headwinds, we believe the additional cost measures announced today as well as better performance in our base business can largely offset these impacts. This financial guidance assumes continued declines in RITUXAN revenue due to biosimilar competition as well as continued erosion of TECFIDERA revenue in the U.S. due to generic entry. This guidance also continues to assume the potential entry of TECFIDERA generics in the EU in the second quarter of 2022. We expect to decrease revenue from these high-margin products as well as the ADUHELM inventory charges to reduce our gross margin percentage when compared with 2021. This guidance reflects the initial implementation of the additional cost reduction and productivity measures, which Michel discussed. These additional measures are expected to yield approximately $500 million in annualized savings in addition to the previously communicated initiatives already targeting approximately $500 million in annualized savings. This brings total expected annualized savings to approximately $1 billion, a portion of which will be reinvested in strategic initiatives over the coming years. We expect non-GAAP R&D expense to be between $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion, which is unchanged from our previous guidance. Non-GAAP SG&A expense is expected to be between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion, which is a decrease from prior guidance of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, which is due to the additional cost reduction measures just mentioned, which we expect to primarily impact the third and fourth quarters. This guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates as of April 29 will remain in effect for the remainder of the year, net of hedging activities and does not contemplate any further strengthening or weakening of the dollar throughout the year. We assume that we will utilize a portion of the remaining share repurchase authorization of $2.8 billion throughout the year. Please see our press release for other important guidance assumptions. So in summary, we continue to execute on our core business objectives this quarter and are now focused on a set of near-term operational priorities, which we believe can drive value creation over time.  We'll now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Matthew Harrison : Great. Good morning, thanks for taking the question. Michel, I was hoping you could comment on the CEO transition here in terms of timing as well as what the Board is looking for in terms of the successor, and wishing you all the best in the transition. Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you, Matthew. 5.5 years is a good term and if you look at my professional history, this was approximately the tenure in every key posting that I've had. I've given a lot, and I will continue to do so as a priority during the transition to support the team so that we can continue to deliver. Today, we reaffirmed our guidance. The business momentum is going as well as it could despite the competition and the life cycle events that we are facing. We are exciting about -- excited about the readouts to come. And the ADU and the anti-amyloid story is still unfolding. So the story will continue. And I'm very excited about the opportunity to have new readouts in that space that will best inform everything we've heard, including decisions. So the CEO transition is a natural event. And is there always an ideal timing? I'm not sure. But I think that after 5.5 years, while we have a strategy that is pretty visible to all of you being a specialized company in neuroscience with some immuno assets that are very important and in Phase III with the biosimilars and the digital health, I think the company is well positioned. It's good to have at one stage somebody else who comes with the support of the Board and basically revisit the assumptions. So I think that this will be good for everyone involved. And my focus again will be on the company. It's not about me. It's about the company, on the team and on a smooth transition. Business continues. I will be meeting all of you in the coming days in person in Boston and New York. I will be traveling with my team in Asia at the end of the week to meet our key partners and potential future partners and support our team and meet with PMDA also. So the business continues, and I will be at the top of it until the last second. Operator : We will now take our next question from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer Raffat : Hi guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. I guess I'll focus on cost for a second. And I guess I'm just trying to get at what is the actual cost savings? I'm partially confused because SG&A guidance was cut, but -- sorry, SG&A was cut, but the overall guidance was unchanged. Or maybe just a simple way to think about it is where are we truly headed on OpEx over the next coming medium term? Because I just think back to when I first started covering Biogen, you were a leader in MS, you had over $4 billion in marketed MS revenues, but the SG&A was only $1 billion.  Now the market MS revenue is $5 billion, meaning a little higher. But the SG&A is $2.5 billion. And of course, you have some biosimilars and SPINRAZA. And I'm not necessarily saying 2.5 goes down to $1 billion, but can we see a substantial SG&A rebasing of the business? Thank you very much. Mike McDonnell : Yes, Umer, it's Mike. Thank you for the question. So the cost savings that we mentioned today, the additional $500 million run rate that will be largely tied to the ADUHELM infrastructure. And we talked about that on our last call that we had initially expected about a $400 million number in 2022. And so obviously, that will be cut substantially. So in the SG&A guide where we took that down by about $200 million, that largely is a significant piece of it. Beyond that, we will obviously look at some of the non-revenue facing pieces in G&A and others in order to achieve that run rate. And as we've said in our prepared remarks, we may invest certain portions of that $500 million in savings into the -- into future growth initiatives with the overall priority being to return to growth. I will say in closing that as it relates to guidance, we were able to reaffirm our guidance, notwithstanding the inventory write-offs and the currency headwinds that we were facing. And that was really a result of two things. One is the cost initiatives, and then the second was that the top line has performed a little bit better than what we had originally expected at the beginning of the year. And I would point to SPINRAZA MS as well as the CD20s being a little bit stronger than expected, and that impact between the cost savings and the revenue. It's about half and half that contribute to our ability to hold the EPS in the same place. So we'll continue to take necessary cost measures to align with the revenue trajectory of the business. And hopefully, that's some helpful color. Michel Vounatsos : And a couple of comments to consider, Umer. The first one is that at that time where you started to cover, it was mostly U.S. business only. And this is not the case today. And the second point is that there were very few DMTs in the class, and now it's extremely crowded and Biogen is still the leader globally in each one of those being SMA, being MS and being NTMS in Europe. So this takes some muscles and, obviously, skills. And we have made tremendous progress in terms of using digitalization and all the means of engaging, but we get the point, and this is compounded by the investment we have made on ADUHELM that we're eliminating. Operator : We will now take our next question from Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Robyn Karnauskas : Hi, thanks for taking the question. So, the first one is just for Priya. You talk about how new data showing lecanemab. When you stop it, it suggests that you could have some decline in cognition. Can you just talk about any more updates as to why you think that is? And if you think there's a difference in the mechanism versus Lilly's drug? Another thing you mentioned, you did mention also about potentially divesting products. I wanted to know if you could elaborate on what you're referring to. Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : Priya? Priya Singhal : Yes. Thank you for that question. So first of all, let me touch upon lecanemab. I think that the data that I referred to is data from the gap period in the open label, which was followed by the open-label extension in the Phase II study. And I think what it shows you is that the science on this aspect of what is the ideal treatment duration is emerging. And that's really the point that we need to kind of take away from this. So the field is evolving. There were two biomarkers AB in [ph] 42 to 40 ratio, as well as plasma phospho-tau 181. And we saw a reversal in both in the wrong direction. So I think that how we are trying to address this is -- Eisai is actually taking a lead on it because they are assessing how maintenance can be applied, and they are doing this in their open-label extension in the Phase II study. So there's more data probably that will read out in the upcoming period as they learn more. And I think with donanemab, you asked me for a comparison, I can only speak to the data that I've seen in the public domain.  And I think that what we haven't seen is the after effects of long-term follow-up. We haven't seen a similar effect of what happens to amyloid plaques, of what happens to phospo-tau once lecanemab is stopped. And I think that, that data would be relevant for us to make a fair comparison. At the moment, I think what we believe, along with Eisai and what we see, is that stopping prematurely can cause a reversal. So hopefully, that answers that part of the question. And then the second part of your question was about divestiture. And I'll just step back and say that we are looking across our entire portfolio, our R&D portfolio, and making integrated decisions on prioritization. What do I mean by this? I mean that we're looking at our disease areas, we're looking at our therapeutic areas, we're looking at where we are leaders, where we have a lot of internal expertise, and we are prioritizing accordingly and being good stewards of resources. So this is also driven in part by internal and external readouts. For example, we've just filed for zuranolone. This is a very exciting step for us in neuropsychiatry and we are expecting an upcoming readout for BIIB104, which is for cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. So we'll see what that readout shows us. But again, we will anchor to areas where we have success, we have expertise and build around those areas. The same goes for lupus. We have three programs in lupus and we will continue to build out those areas as we see readouts and data. We may also consider expansion of indications. So everything is really on the table and we're trying to be very disciplined about an integrated prioritization and methodology. Now within that integrated prioritization, we may have assets where we believe that they may have -- be better utilized by partnering them or by externalizing them. This is what I meant by divest. So hopefully, that addresses it. It's just one part of a much larger, synchronized, integrated R&D strategy. Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question please. We\u2019re having technical difficulties, we\u2019ll try to rejoin the call. [Technical Difficulty] Operator : Thank you, sir. We will now take our next question from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Salveen Richter : Good morning, thanks for taking my question. In terms of your capital allocation strategy to drive growth, how much of a priority is business development? Mike McDonnell : Salveen, hi, Mike McDonnell, and thank you very much for the question. Business development has been and continues to be our priority. And we have a pipeline that we feel good about, and we will continue to look to supplement that through business development transactions as we have done in the past. And at the same time, we will continue to return capital to shareholders. So it will continue to be a balance and business development has been and will continue to be a priority. Operator : We will now take our next question from Michael Yee from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Michael Yee : Thank you. Following up on Michel and Priya's comments around R&D portfolio prioritization. Is it safe to say that you would consider anything on the table in terms of divesting, partnering, out-licensing, bringing in stuff, but just the concept that anything is on the table with regards to even including product lines or franchises at the whole portfolio and always is all on the table? Can you clarify that? Thank you so much. Priya Singhal : Thank you, Michael. Yes, I would say that across the board, we are going to be driven by science and integration and maximizing the value that we bring to patients with diseases of high unmet need. So I think we would evaluate all options. But I think the science has to be the driver, and that's how we would do the evaluations. So yes, exactly as you said. Michael Yee : Would you include commercialization businesses and franchises as well? Michel Vounatsos : Potentially for some, but not for all. I think that Biogen will remain on the upper hand on a few priorities, but we'll be open to look for partnering on others. But it's for Priya and the team to determine with the support of the governance of the company. Operator : We will now take our next question from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Cory Kasimov : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I'm curious, what is significantly scaling back ADUHELM's commercial infrastructure, say, if anything, about your expectations for the Phase III lecanemab data? Or is it simply too long to wait until you get full approval even if lecanemab is successful in CLARITY AD? And along those lines, can you remind us of how your responsibilities for commercialization on that front might be any different than with ADUHELM? Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : So we do expect the Phase III readout in the fall of this year. And we are discussing in full alignment with a partner the operational details beyond lecanemab. But based on the timing it will make no sense to carry such a long team, such a large team for such a long time. So I think it's the right decision. The preparation that was made on the infrastructure is there, and there is certainly a big benefit for the entire class moving forward. But we could not afford to keep the team, unfortunately, for that many months. So I think it's the right decision. Our sentiment for lecanemab does not change, just to be clear. Operator : We will now take our next question from Marc Goodman from SVB. Please go ahead. Marc Goodman : Yes, good morning. Just to continue on with the R&D topic. I think the view from the outside world has been that the pipeline has always been a little bit high risk, high reward, and that's probably not that surprising just because this is CNS. But now that you're going to take a look at the pipeline and really kind of change the way you're viewing things, how much does that change, factor into whether you start to diversify more away from CNS?  And if you're going to stay within CNS mostly, how do you change the probability of success projects to lower risk projects? And how do you do all of this change, given that there's also a management change going on? And how much board is supportive and I think you understand the context of the question. Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : Yes, absolutely. And I think it's a very important question. It's all about having the right priorities and somehow rebalancing the risk profile of the portfolio. And we know that. And this goes with neuroscience. That Priya will say more. Priya Singhal : Yes. Thank you, Marc. It's a really pertinent question here. So I think two -- it's a 2-pronged approach. Number one, we're going to be driven by the science, we're going to stay within neuroscience. So I think at this point, I want to be very clear that we stay within neuroscience. It's a very important part of our expertise, our talent pool, and we are continuing to build on our strengths there. But we are definitely open to adjacencies. We've already demonstrated -- for example, as I mentioned with the zuranolone filing and with the 104 readout coming on its heels. In addition, I think that we are working in lupus. So that's a specialized immunology field. And we may consider other indications, we may consider other potential opportunities in the space. So that's one way in which we would diversify and rebalance our risk. Because as you know, the probability of technical and regulatory success changes as you move out of neuroscience. But given our core expertise of neuroscience and all the learnings we've had, we believe we have a lot of asymmetrical knowledge in the space. And in that space, we are continuing to enhance our probability of success, maximize it, in fact, by building on our strengths in biomarkers, clinical development, functional genomics, human validation. So we believe that these are the methodologies, which will help us sort of increase our probability of success and give us the ability to deliver on proof of concepts. So it's a two-pronged strategy. And add to that our four pillars, which you already know about, biosimilars and digital health. We're also looking at integration, right, with digital options. So this really goes beyond a very narrow focus. It looks at the portfolio in totality and the value that the portfolio brings in totality. And it's -- we have the expertise in terms of modalities. We have all modalities available to us. So we're looking at targets, and we're looking at the best modality. We're not looking at modalities and how do we kind of exploit those. We're looking at it in the reverse way. We're looking at disease target and then what's the best modality to go forward with. I hope that gives you a bit of a glimpse of how we're approaching this. Thank you. Can I just address the last part? I meant to add that you asked about how we would do this in a Board setting, in a management setting. I want to say that I have a lot of authority currently, and I am making decisions on prioritization. So that, I hope, will go forward. Operator : We will now take our next question from Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Brian Abrahams : Good morning. Thanks so much, for taking my questions. And best wishes to Michel with the transition. What's your latest sense of the FDA stance on accelerated approval for beta amyloid antibodies, just with some of the changes in leadership and initiatives at the agency? And then I know the FDA has agreed that CLARITY AD could serve as a confirmatory study following accelerated approval of lecanemab. But can you clarify, if you don't receive accelerated approval, whether that Phase III could stand on its own to support full approval or whether you need an additional study? Michel Vounatsos : Thank you for the comments. Priya? Priya Singhal : Thank you. So I'll just step back, Brian, and say that accelerated approval pathway is a very, very highly rigorous and scientific regulatory pathway. It's existed for several years now. And several products have come through the pathway and many patients around the United States have benefited from this access. So I know that there's a lot of dialogue, and I'm reading the same as you are. But I don't believe that at any point right now, there is going to be a potential major shift.  There could be enhancements, there could be sort of refinements. I'm sure that could happen to any regulatory pathway as more learnings are obtained. But I don't believe that our confidence has been shaken in the accelerated approval pathway. It remains a critical way in which you can bring products to patients who really need them today. So that's number one. Number two, I'll say that with CLARITY AD, the strategy has been -- and I think this has been publicly communicated by Eisai and us, so I'm just quoting that, that they have filed -- they've initiated the filing based on the Phase II study, as you know. And that is via the Accelerated Approval Pathway. There is agreement from the FDA. And Eisai have commented on this publicly as well, that CLARITY AD could serve as a confirmatory study. Now to your question that what if the CLARITY AD is unclear or ambiguous, could they still get approval, could we still get approval? I think that would be very speculative for me to comment on. What I think would be a reasonable way forward, depending on the data, would be to have that discussion with the FDA. Because the science here is complex, as we've seen. And I think the most important thing is to continue to evaluate the science and the data as it emerges and assess what is the strength of evidence. And I think that is really what is going to make the difference in this case. Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham : Thanks for the question. I just wanted to jump on to other questions on lecanemab and just wanted to know, strategically, how important is having a robust Alzheimer's pipeline to you guys? I mean, when you look at the infrastructure that you have from an R&D perspective, clearly, there are lessons to be learned from adu. But I wanted to ask you, is there an opportunity or is there a potential to bring in other assets behind lecanemab to kind of further expand the Alzheimer's piece? Priya Singhal : Thank you. I think that, first of all, we remain committed to Alzheimer's disease. And lecanemab is -- we are very privileged and honored to have 2 Abeta removal agents. Aducanumab, we still continue to invest in EMBARK and ENVISION. We think that these will have potentially very critical scientific data that can impact not only the product but also the field. So that remains very important. We continue to invest in early Alzheimer's disease programs. As I mentioned, we have a BIIB080, which is our anti-tau ASO, and then we have BIB113, which is an OGA inhibitor. Very different sort of approaches to tau pathology. So this remains very important. We have other assets which have yet unnamed pathways and targets, which I can't speak about, but there are many, many others as well. So we remain committed to Alzheimer's disease. We are definitely taking all our learnings from the scientific approach, but also on how we would approach clinical development. So we are continuing to strengthen our clinical development expertise in the area. Would we be open to other assets? Yes, we continue to look and scour the external opportunities. At any given time, we are looking at many assets. And again, as I've said, the science will drive the way. The science and the value will continue to drive the way. So that's -- I would say, yes, we are absolutely interested and we continue to remain highly, highly committed to Alzheimer's disease. Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Jay Olson : Thanks for taking the question. And thanks to Michel for his constant dedication to patients. My question is about the balance sheet. And if you were to pursue a larger business development transaction, how much debt would you be willing to take on? Thank you. Mike McDonnell : Jay, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. And I think that when you look at our balance sheet, we're in a very good place. We ended the quarter with $4.8 billion of cash. We received another $1 billion from Samsung in April. So we've got the better part of $6 billion of cash on hand. And when you look at our current debt levels, we're at two turns of EBITDA and gross debt and less than 1 turn net debt. So if you hypothetically added a turn of debt, not saying we wouldn't, but it's a hypothetical, that's about $8 billion worth of capacity that we have. And I think that our goal is to deploy that as accretively as we can with the number 1 goal being to bring ourselves back to growth over time. We've done about 30 deals and deployed about $6.5 billion in business development over the last 5.5 years. We will continue to prioritize business development along with returning capital to shareholders. It will be a balance. And I would say that we do have capacity for some incremental debt, but we've got so much cash on hand right now that adding debt is not something that we would obviously be needing or looking to do in the near term. So hopefully, that's helpful. Operator : We will now take our next question from Phil Nadeau from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Philip Nadeau : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I want to follow-on to Brian's on the CLARITY AD study. Could you talk in a bit more detail about the design of the trial, in particular, what's the powering on the primary endpoint of CDR Sum of the Boxes? What is a clinically meaningful difference between drug and placebo and CDR-SB? And then in terms of the p-value, if this is a single Phase III study, what p-value is necessary for success? Is 0.05 sufficient or do you need 0.01? Priya Singhal : Thank you. So first of all, CLARITY AD, we haven't spoken externally about the powering of the study, but Eisai has commented on it. In the Phase II study, we had several arms and the outcome was empowered for CDR Sum of Boxes. That is actually very different. Phase II has informed how Phase III has been designed and it is powered to detect a statistically significant difference on CDR Sum of Boxes. So that's one aspect I wanted to cover. The second is that CDR sum of boxes, we believe, is the right primary endpoint for this patient population and for the MCI in early Alzheimer's disease.  This has cognitive and functional elements. We believe that it is the most relevant primary endpoint. And we feel that we are fairly confident in the design of the study to kind of give us the outcome. Now what kind of p-value is very hard, I would be speculating, so I won't speculate here. But we feel that the study is designed appropriately and that the results would be important to review.  I think in terms of clinical meaningfulness, we have done a lot of work ourselves. There's a lot of external dialogue. And we do believe that, honestly, the EMERGE data that we had with the 22% difference is highly clinically relevant and clinically meaningful to KMEs and to patients. So we've done a lot of work around this. And I'm sure you've seen that in the public domain. Beyond that, I don't think I can comment on it. Thank you. Michael Hencke : Operator, I think we have time for one final question. Operator : We will now take our final question from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mohit Bansal : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Maybe a question for Mike. So just -- just trying to understand your comments on share repurchases. So given that the cash flow of the company is not as good as it used to be a couple of years back, and maybe a need for diversification or buying more assets, why share repurchases at this point are a priority in your list? Mike McDonnell : Yes. So thank you for the question, Mohit. And obviously, we did not buy any shares back during the quarter, and you shouldn't be looking quarter-to-quarter because that can vary depending on what we have in the way of business development activity, timing of windows, other considerations, et cetera. But we do expect to utilize a portion of the $2.8 billion that remains throughout the remainder of 2022, and we continue to believe that our stock is a good investment. But at the same time, you obviously will not see us repurchasing shares at the pace that you saw back 2, 3, 4 years ago because of the situation with TECFIDERA and RITUXAN, but we do continue to see it as a good investment and it will be a balance between BD and share repurchase as we go. But we'll be smart and balanced about it. And our capital allocation, as we mentioned, is one of our key operational priorities as we look forward throughout the rest of 2022. Michael Hencke : And that concludes our call for today. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Second Quarter Earnings Call and Financial Update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hencke, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Hencke, you may begin your conference. Michael Hencke : Good morning, and welcome to Biogen's second quarter 2022 earnings call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including our GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2, and Table 4 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I\u2019m joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Priya Singhal, Interim Head of Research and Development; and our CFO, Mike McDonnell. As a reminder, during the Q&A portion of the call, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question. I will now turn the call over to Michel. Michel Vounatsos : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Biogen continued to execute well in the second quarter, and we are pleased to be raising our full year financial guidance. We believe our achievements are critical steps on our path to drive renewed value creation for both patients and shareholders over time. First, together with Eisai, we're granted Priority Review for lecanemab, under the accelerated approval pathway in the U.S. for early Alzheimer's disease. We expect an FDA decision by January 6 of next year. And in parallel, we look forward to the upcoming Phase 3 readout expected in the fall. Additionally, together with Sage, we reported positive data in postpartum depression. The SKYLARK Study is now the second positive Phase 3 study supporting the potential of zuranolone in PPD with four additional positive randomized controlled trials in major depressive disorders. We believe there is a substantial body of evidence supports a significant opportunity for zuranolone. Pursuit of innovation, however, does not come without setbacks, and we were disappointed to learn that the BIIB104 Phase 2 study in schizophrenia was not positive. I will now focus on the near-term operational priorities we outlined in our last call, while Priya will review our recent progress in R&D, and Mike will discuss our second quarter performance. First, we are continuing to focus our R&D sources on programs where we see the greatest potential while also aiming to rebalance the risk profile across our pipeline. For example, we intend to accelerate the regulatory filing of zuranolone in postpartum depression following the positive SKYLARK Study. In addition, we have terminated some R&D programs that we believe lower positive success such as BIIB076, an anti-tau antibody in Alzheimer's disease and BIIB100, a small molecule XPO1 inhibitor in ALS. Second, we are on track to implement the cost reduction and productivity measures outlined on our last call in order to further align our costs with our revenue base while maintaining our focus on execution. Third, we are pursuing additional global growth opportunities with a focus on key emerging markets. This includes China, where we are encouraged by the launch of SPINRAZA. Fourth, we are focused on driving renewed growth in our biosimilars business. We just recently launched BYOOVIZ, the first biosimilar referencing LUCENTIS in the U.S. Biogen's first entry into the U.S. biosimilars market, we also expect to begin launching BYOOVIZ outside the U.S. early next year. With the completion of the sales of our joint venture interest in Samsung Bioepis in the second quarter, we now have an expanded ability to pursue the biosimilars business on our own as we aim to bring more biosimilars products to more patients, geographies. We continue to advance our biosimilars pipeline, which includes two Phase 3 programs referencing EYLEA and ACTEMRA. Fifth, we remain focused on capital allocation during the quarter. We entered into new collaborations with MedRhythms in MS and Alectos in Parkinson's disease, and we continue to evaluate both internal and external value creation opportunities. We also returned approximately $500 million to shareholders during the quarter through share repurchases. We are also pleased with the progress in our collaboration with Genentech for mosunetuzumab, a CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody which recently approved in the EU for patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma. The BLA of mosunetuzumab for medication was recently granted Priority Review by the FDA, and we look forward to a potential approval in the U.S. Our progress across these areas in addition to the recent advancements we have made in R&D have potential to help drive growth over time. Of course, not all our programs will deliver the results, we hope, which is why we are continuing to advance and build a diversified and appropriately balanced pipeline as we work to create and sustain a multi-franchise portfolio over time. This includes near-term opportunities in Alzheimer's disease and depression followed by other areas such as Parkinson's disease, lupus and stroke in the mid- to late 2020s. We remain committed to taking advantage of all the strengths of the company. Our talent, our portfolio, our manufacturing capabilities, our pipeline, which includes 10 programs in Phase 3 or filed and our strong balance sheet to deliver results for both the patients we serve and our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Priya for an update on our recent progress in R&D. Priya Singhal : Thank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by thanking the Biogen team for their focus and dedication as we continued to advance a robust and diversified R&D pipeline. As Michel mentioned, we had several exciting R&D achievements this past quarter that I believe are key steps toward advancing our pursuit of meaningful new therapies for patients. Starting with Alzheimer's disease, as Michel mentioned, the FDA has accepted and granted Priority Review for the BLA for lecanemab in early Alzheimer's disease under the accelerated approval pathway. Eisai is also continuing to progress lecanemab Phase 3 Clarity study with an expected readout this fall. The Clarity AD study was designed to build upon the results of the prior Phase 2 study and utilizes clinically balanced assessments designed to evaluate various aspects of cognition and function. Given the robust trial design, we believe that the totality of the Clarity AD results should allow us to further understand the effect of amyloid removal on different clinical domains of Alzheimer's disease. The FDA has agreed that Clarity AD when completed can serve as a confirmatory study to verify the clinical benefit of lecanemab, pending the results of Clarity AD study, Eisai plans to file for traditional approval of lecanemab in the U.S., EU and Japan by the end of Q1 2023. This timing may allow for lecanemab, if approved, to become the first anti-amyloid antibody for Alzheimer's disease with traditional approval. Last quarter, simulation modeling based on lecanemab Phase 2 results, Eisai also published an analysis estimating potential long-term outcomes of treatment with lecanemab. The results of this analysis suggest that compared to standard of care alone, individuals treated with lecanemab, in addition to standard of care, may potentially experience slower disease progression to mild, moderate and severe Alzheimer's disease from baseline by 2.51, 3.13 and 2.34 years on average, respectively. These preliminary results could possibly translate into additional quality-adjusted life years and reduction in formal and informal cost of this disease. Beyond lecanemab, we continue to advance biosimilars pipeline that is diversified across molecular targets and modalities. This includes BIIB080, our ASO targeting tau, where we expect to initiate a Phase 2 study later this year. Moving to neuropsychiatry, together with Sage, we were very excited to announce positive results from the SKYLARK Phase 3 Study of zuranolone in postpartum depression. The SKYLARK Study met its primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints with a 2-week course of 50 milligrams zuranolone, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in symptoms at day 15 as compared to placebo, the primary endpoint and at day 3, day 28 and 45. This is the second positive Phase 3 study of zuranolone in postpartum depression further reinforces the clinical profile of zuranolone that has been observed to date. Postpartum depression is 1 of the most common medical complications occurring during and after pregnancy, affecting an estimated 1 in 8 mothers or approximately 500,000 women in the United States each year. Depression, sadness, anxiety, thoughts of hurting oneself or one's infant and thoughts of suicide are common signs associated with PPD. This is an area of significant unmet need where new treatment options are desperately needed. With the SKYLARK Study results now in hand, we are working with Sage to advance a single regulatory filing for zuranolone in MDD and PPD in the U.S., which we expect to complete in the second half of this year. Last quarter, Sage also presented the results of the zuranolone Human Abuse Liability potential study at the College on Problems of Drug Dependence annual meeting. The results of this study showed that 30 and 60 milligrams of zuranolone demonstrated lower abuse potential as compared with alprazolam 1.5 milligrams and 3 milligrams in recreational users of CNS depressants. 90 milligrams of zuranolone was comparable to alprazolam, 1.5 milligrams and 3 milligrams. As a reminder, the zuranolone doses studied in the MDD and PPD trials were between 20 to 50 milligrams. Also in neuropsychiatry, we were disappointed that the TALLY Phase 2 study of BIIB104 in cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia or CIAS, did not meet its primary or secondary efficacy endpoints. Most adverse events in the BIIB104 treatment arms were mild to moderate in severity. Given the consistent lack of efficacy observed across the primary and secondary measures of cognition and functioning, while demonstrating expected drug exposure levels during the entire 12-week evaluation period, we have decided to discontinue the BIIB104 program in CIAS. We are continuing to analyze the data and plan to present detailed results at an upcoming scientific forum. Moving to our neuromuscular portfolio. Last month, we presented new 12-month data from the VALOR Phase 3 study and its open-label extension of tofersen in SOD1-ALS, a progressive and rare genetic form of ALS. This analysis was designed to evaluate participants who initiated tofersen during 6 months placebo controlled period in VALOR versus in participants originally on placebo, who had a delayed start of tofersen treatment during the study of open-label extension. The results of the new 12-month analysis showed that initial -- earlier initiation of tofersen slowed decline across measures of clinical and respiratory function, strength and quality of life. Furthermore, tofersen led to robust and sustained reductions in neurofilament, a marker of axonal injury and neurodegeneration. We believe that these results build upon the encouraging trends in reduced disease progression originally observed in the VALOR 6-month randomized study and further support the potential for tofersen to slow disease progression in SOD1-ALS. We continue to engage global regulators with these data, and we will provide updates when appropriate. In movement disorders, we initiated the Phase 2b LUMA Study in Parkinson's disease for BIIB122, a small molecule LRRK2 inhibitor that we are developing in collaboration with Denali Therapeutics. LRRK2 mutations result in hyperactivation of the kinase and are estimated to account for roughly 5% of familial and 2% of sporadic Parkinson's disease. By inhibiting LRRK2, BIIB122 is designed to target an underlying biological pathway implicated in Parkinson's disease, lysosomal function. For this reason, we believe BIIB122 may have therapeutic potential in Parkinson's disease more broadly, both in people with and without pathogenic LRRK2 mutation. The LUMA study is designed to evaluate whether once daily oral BIIB122 administration can slow clinical worsening versus placebo in Parkinson's disease patients without a pathogenic LRRK2 variant. We also anticipate initiating the Phase 3 LIGHTHOUSE Study later this year designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BIIB122 in Parkinson's disease patients with a confirmed LRRK2 pathogenic variant. There are roughly 10 million people suffering from Parkinson's disease worldwide and no approved treatment sets slowed disease progression. By inhibiting LRRK2, we have the potential to deliver a first-in-class therapy that may significantly alter the course of disease. In conclusion, we executed well against our R&D objectives in the quarter and continue to prioritize our efforts across both therapeutic areas and programs. As Michel mentioned, we have already made several decisions resulting from this prioritization effort. And this is an ongoing process that will be driven by both scientific insights and internal inflection points. Moving towards the remainder of 2022, we anticipate several exciting milestones. These include zuranolone regulatory filings for both MDD and PPD in the U.S., the Phase 3 readout of lecanemab in Alzheimer's disease and the initiation of mid- to late-stage studies in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and lupus. These are therapeutic areas characterized by significant unmet need and where Biogen has opportunity to deliver first-in-class, best-in-class therapies to patients. I will now pass the call over to Mike. Michael McDonnell : Thank you, Priya, and good morning, everyone. I will provide some highlights of our financial performance for the second quarter and update to our full year 2022 guidance. Please note that all financial comparisons are versus the second quarter of 2021, unless otherwise noted. Total revenue for the second quarter was $2.6 billion, which was a decrease of 7% at actual currency and 5% at constant currency. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the second quarter was $5.25, a decrease of 6%. Total MS revenue inclusive of OCREVUS royalties was $1.7 billion, a decrease of 4% at actual currency and 3% at constant currency. Global TECFIDERA revenue of $398 million decreased 18% at actual currency and 17% at constant currency. TECFIDERA revenue in the U.S. increased versus the prior quarter. However, this was primarily due to channel dynamics and we do expect TECFIDERA in the U.S. to decline throughout the year of 2022. Outside the U.S., TECFIDERA was modestly impacted by generic competition in markets such as Canada and Germany. At this point, we are aware of several generic applications that have approved in Europe, and we will be monitoring the situation closely. Importantly, we were pleased to be granted a new patent in the EU and reserve all rights to assert the patent against infringing but it's possible that it may still be at risk. Global VUMERITY revenue of $137 million increased 51% at actual currency and 52% at constant currency. VUMERITY continued to grow in the U.S. We are pleased with the trajectory. Outside the U.S., VUMERITY is now launched in 14 markets. We are currently working with our contract manufacturing suppliers potential supply constraints and have therefore delayed any additional country launches. Global TYSABRI revenue of $516 million decreased 2% at actual currency and was flat at constant currency. In the United States, TYSABRI revenue was negatively impacted by modest volume declines, partially offset by favorable pricing. Outside the U.S., we were pleased to see continued patient growth. We are aware that regulatory filings for a biosimilar referencing TYSABRI have been submitted to both the FDA and the EMA. We will continue to enforce our IP, but a biosimilar could launch upon approval in the U.S. and EU, which could occur next year. Global Interferon revenue of $350 million decreased 13% at actual currency and 11% at constant and was impacted by the continued shift from the injectable platform to oral or high efficacy therapies. Versus the prior quarter, Interferon revenue increased 13% at actual currency and 14% at constant currency, primarily due to seasonality in channel dynamics in the U.S. Moving to SMA. Global SPINRAZA revenue of $431 million, declined 14% at actual currency and 11% at constant currency. In the U.S., we're encouraged to see fewer SPINRAZA discontinuations during the quarter. Outside the U.S., the revenue decline was primarily driven by competition and with the timing of shipments in certain markets, pricing dynamics and negative currency impacts. Global SPINRAZA revenue decreased 9% versus the first quarter of 2022 at actual currency and 8% at constant currency, driven by competition and negative currency impacts outside the U.S. as well as some seasonality dynamics in the U.S. Moving to our biosimilars business. Revenue of $194 million declined 4% at actual currency, increased 3% at constant currency. Biosimilars volume increases were more than offset by negative currency impact and pricing pressure. We continue to expect full year biosimilars revenue to decrease versus 2021. We are pleased to have launched BYOOVIZ this quarter in the U.S., and we recorded some modest initial revenue due to channel stocking. As a reminder, we expect a gradual launch of BYOOVIZ with more meaningful revenue contribution starting in 2023. Total anti-CD20 revenue of $436 million decreased 1%. Revenue from OCREVUS royalties increased 14%, which was more than offset by continued RITUXAN declines due to biosimilar competition. Now moving on to expenses and the balance sheet. Second quarter non-GAAP R&D expense was $529 million, including $18 million in upfront payments related to operations with MedRhythms and Alectos Therapeutics. This is compared to $585 million in the second quarter of 2021, which included approximately $50 million in upfront payments. Non-GAAP SG&A was $570 million, including approximately $29 million related to ADUHELM. This is compared to $635 million in the second quarter of 2021. Second quarter collaboration profit sharing was a net expense of $29 million, which includes $58 million of profit sharing expense related to the collaboration with Samsung Bioepis, partially offset by reimbursement of $29 million from Eisai related to commercialization of ADUHELM in the U.S. Non-GAAP other expense was $79 million, primarily driven by interest expense. GAAP other income was $429 million, which included two items of note. First, we recorded an approximately $1.5 billion gain on the sale of our equity stake in the Samsung Bioepis joint venture. In addition, we recorded $900 million, plus estimated fees and expenses, related to an agreement in principle to resolve a previously disclosed qui tam litigation relating to conduct prior to 2015. This agreement in principle does not include any admission of liability and is subject to the negotiation of final settlement agreements and documents. We expect to make the payment shortly after the agreements are finalized, which we expect to be as soon as possible and within the next 12 months. In the second quarter, we generated $737 million in cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures were $37 million. Free cash flow was $700 million. We repurchased 2.4 million shares of the company's common stock during the quarter for $500 million. As of June 30, we ended the quarter with $7.3 billion in debt, $5.9 billion in cash and marketable securities and $1.4 billion in net debt. In July, we repaid our senior notes due September 2022, with an aggregate principal amount of $1 billion. Of note, as of June 30, we utilized approximately $71 million of work in-process inventory related to lecanemab. We plan to continue building inventory over the coming months and we are also procuring raw materials associated with this production. If the lecanemab Phase 3 study is negative or lecanemab does not receive regulatory approval, we would expect to expense inventory on hand at that time as research and development expense subject to cost sharing with Eisai. Overall, we remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial capacity, including a $1 billion undrawn revolving credit facility to invest in growing the business over the long term. Let me now turn to our updated full year 2022 guidance. We are increasing our full year revenue guidance from our previous range of $9.7 billion to $10 billion to a range of $9.9 billion to $10.1 billion and increasing our full year non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance from our previous range of $14.25 to $16 to a new range of $15.25 to $16.75. This guidance increase is primarily a result of better-than-expected topline performance and continued cost management. This guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates, as of July 15, will remain in effect for the remainder of the year, net of hedging activities. Importantly, we are raising our revenue and EPS guidance ranges despite some meaningful currency headwinds which were not included in our guidance at the beginning of the year. Specifically, subsequent to issuing our most recent guidance on May 3, we have experienced a headwind of approximately $55 million to revenue and $0.20 to EPS due to currency fluctuations from April 29 through July 15. This is in addition to a headwind of approximately $120 million to revenue and $0.35 to EPS due to currency fluctuations between January 1 and April 29. These currency headwinds are primarily due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which we transact. This financial guidance assumes continued declines in RITUXAN revenue due to biosimilar competition as well as continued erosion of TECFIDERA revenue in the U.S. due to generic entry. Further, this guidance reflects a range of scenarios for the impact of TECFIDERA generics in the EU, which is difficult to predict. We are aware of a small number of generics that have launched to date, and we are monitoring the situation. We assume we will utilize a portion of the remaining share repurchase authorization of $2.3 billion throughout the remainder of the year. Please see our press release for important guidance assumptions. In summary, we continue to execute well across our core business and are pleased to be raising our financial guidance for the year. We remain focused on delivering results and are optimistic about the potential opportunities ahead of us that we believe can create long-term value for shareholders. We will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital. Brian Abrahams : So we noticed that -- and you discussed this a bit that you have been discontinuing pipeline programs, maybe a little bit earlier on, including 104, 100 and 076. Just wondering if you could maybe comment on that, whether this reflects any change in your philosophy on risk assumption and go no-go decision with respect to pipeline prioritization and maybe how -- if that might imply anything for your bar to pursue approval of lecanemab if the Phase 3 study misses on its primary endpoint? Michel Vounatsos : Priya will give some color. Priya Singhal : Thank you, Brian, for that question. So as we've mentioned last quarter, we've embarked upon a very focused and disciplined prioritization of the R&D portfolio. But it is dependent on internal inflection points as well as external scientific insights. So I want to specifically pick up on the points that you made about BIIB104. We just shared that we will be discontinuing development of BIIB104, which is an amp up potentiator in CIAS, which is cognitive impairment with -- associated with schizophrenia. And that is because we had a readout from TALLY where we saw expected pharmacological exposure, but we did not meet the primary or secondary endpoints. So we believe that we have tested the hypothesis really well here and that it's time to reconsider the data, look at it very carefully, think about other applications, but ensure that we allocate resources to the programs with higher probability of success. So that addresses that question. With BIIB076 that you also mentioned, it's an anti-tau antibody with our partnership with Neurimmune. And we did announce that we are closing down development at Biogen for it. So I would ask that you direct further questions of next steps on BIIB076 to new immune. But from our perspective, we are focusing, for example, on BIIB080, which is our antisense oligonucleotide that affects all post-translational forms of tau. And we will be starting a Phase 2 late-stage, mid-stage trial later this year. So that's how we're thinking about our prioritization. And finally, to address what it does for our bar on Alzheimer's, I'll just say that we look forward to the results of Clarity AD for lecanemab. It is a well-powered, well-designed trial. It has, we believe, the right primary endpoint in CDR Sum of Boxes, and we think that a statistically significant difference versus placebo would be clinically meaningful because of the instrument that's being utilized as a primary endpoint and also all the secondary endpoints. And in addition, we have a whole comprehensive program around lecanemab, which addresses presymptomatic patients as well as we're looking at maintenance along with Eisai and Phase 2 open-label extension and subcutaneous. So I think we will just wait for the data. As we have said, we expect to complete the filing along with Clarity AD, should it be positive by Q1 2023. So I hope that answers the question. Michel Vounatsos : And if I may add, we are delighted to be progressing with the filing of zuranolone and leca and waiting more data also for ADUHELM. For the earlier pipeline, we have expanded materially our pipeline. It's natural that -- first of all, there is inherent risk with neuroscience, and it's natural that we always try to increase probability of success and select based on trigger point and science inside. And this is what Priya is doing. Operator : We'll take our next question from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison : I just wanted to follow up on lecanemab. So I guess the key question that I've been getting a lot is, in the discussions with the FDA around using a single confirmatory study here, do you have explicit feedback from the regulators on the p-value necessary here? Or is that going to be a review issue? Michel Vounatsos : Priya? Priya Singhal : Thank you, Matthew. So just to step back, lecanemab has completed -- is in the filing for accelerated approval pathway using the Phase 2 study, which is the 201 study, and we are expecting results for Clarity AD, which is the Phase 3 study. This is a study with 1,795 subjects. It's a global study. We believe it's well powered. There is no interim or futility analysis. It will be just a primary readout sometime in the fall of this year, 2022. And currently, this has an underrepresented population also, quite similar to the CMS population of about 25% included. Now with regards to whether it can be a confirmatory study for traditional approval? Yes. We do believe we have this agreement that should it read out positive, it can be the confirmatory study. So I do believe that, that is exactly what we believe. In addition, I'll just remind us that in the aducanumab briefing document, the FDA had stated that they would accept a statistically significant change on an inherently meaningful instrument such as the CDR Sum of Boxes as evidence of a clinically meaningful effect. So this is really important. And we feel quite confident that CDR Sum of Boxes is the right primary endpoint. It is clinically validated, and it combines both cognition and function and is widely accepted as a registrational endpoint. So we are at that point, we feel quite good about the fact that it's well powered. Of course, we have to wait to see the results. I hope that answers the question. Operator : We'll take our next question from Colin Bristow with UBS. Colin Bristow : Congrats on the quarter. So just on the CEO search, could you give us an update on where you are in this process? And if you're able to now provide a time line? And just within that question, given how important lecanemab is to the company and the trajectory, is it reasonable to expect that a new CEO would not be in place until after the outcome of the trial is known? Michel Vounatsos : Thanks for the question. From my discussion earlier this week with the Board members and our Chairman, I hear that the search is progressing as planned. But at this stage, there is nothing yet to be reported. And obviously, we'll not speculate on lecanemab, but it's a very important event. But at this stage, nothing more to report. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Michael Yee : I had a question around -- thoughts around investment into SG&A and how that works for lecanemab, and whether there is a decision point as to your commitment to have to reimburse 50-50 and how that works if the drug actually gets to market? And then secondly, as that relates to zuranolone, same thing. Is that a proposed net investment spend for 2023? How do we think about that? Michael McDonnell : Yes. So both of those arrangements are 50-50. So you would expect that we certainly will be building infrastructure to support, hopefully, the successful launch of both of those products, and we share costs in both cases, 50-50. So we're very focused on managing our OpEx. Currently, the 2022 guidance implies a midpoint of about $4.6 billion versus $5.2 billion last year, progressing well on the cost measures that we've committed to. And then, of course, the commercial infrastructure around those two products are key items that we're working very closely with both Sage and Eisai on, particularly as it relates to planning for 2023 and beyond. Operator : We'll take our next question from Umer Raffat with Evercore. Umer Raffat : How do you intend to approach the lecanemab Phase 3 data set if the primary endpoint does not work, but a secondary like ADCOMS or ADAS-Cog or perhaps a subgroup like APOE \u025b4 carriers is active? And how would that impact your FDA submission? Priya Singhal : Thank you, Umer. So maybe I can step back to say that we -- obviously, there are several scenarios of the data readout. And I think at one end, we have potentially a positive primary endpoint outcome with secondary endpoints as well. And we believe that the totality of the data will be really important. And as I said already, we do have -- we have discussed this, and we have agreement with the FDA that a positive readout could serve for a confirmatory study. And on the other end of the spectrum, it's possible that the study is negative. And in that scenario, we would be looking at also the other readouts because there are two -- these are, obviously, Biogen Eisai readout, but I will also draw attention to that that we have two other anti-amyloid agents readout in the near term. One is gantenerumab and the other is donanemab, as everyone knows. So really, this is a bigger question about these readouts and what they mean for the anti-amyloid hypothesis in Alzheimer's -- early Alzheimer's disease. There could be several mixed scenarios, some like you mentioned, and I think it will be very difficult to speculate exactly how that might be perceived. So I would say that the mix scenario, there could be several permutation combinations, but I think that the totality of the data is going to be important. So at this point, it would be tough for me to speculate on what mix scenario and what outcome it could lead to. But we are considering all of this. And I think currently, our focus is on ensuring that we collect the data, close the study, have a very clear readout and then we will be engaging, of course, with the FDA because this product also has breakthrough and fast track designation, which allows us to consult the FDA for the guidance. So we will be in close contact, and that's what I can tell you. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Marc Goodman with SVB Securities. Marc Goodman : You keep referring to the growth opportunity in emerging markets. Can you just help us size how big is the business? How has it been growing? What are the key products that are growing there? What are some products that have yet to launch there that's in the pipeline that can we look forward to growth there? Just give us a sense of where this business is going to be in 3, 4 years? Michel Vounatsos : So before Mike gives -- provides more color, the important element is that the epidemiology is pretty similar in this in the West, in emerging mature markets. So our portfolio is very relevant to this part of the world. The second point is that we see a very strongly emerging middle class that is able to afford, able to co-pay and is willing to access best education and health care. And the experience we have so far, with our expanded footprint since a few years in Latin America, in Asia Pac, in the Middle East, is that we see a very good uptake of our MS portfolio even if we thought at the outset that in Asia Pac, it was a bit lower incident. But based on the number of the population, these are very feasible opportunities. We see a very good uptake and also for SPINRAZA. So a good opportunity. We have a professional team. Compliance is very important everywhere, but also in this part of the world. So we secure that we have a very good balance between where Biogen is directly and where Biogen is partnered, but we have a very good performance to date with a strong double-digit momentum. Mike? Michael McDonnell : Yes, not a lot to add, Marc. I would say that we're pleased with a couple of markets that I would call out, one being China, the other being Brazil. In particular, China, we're seeing excellent uptake on SPINRAZA is not a huge revenue contributor due to pricing dynamics there. But I think, overall, the majority of our international growth has been around SMA. But as Michael said, there's opportunity MS as well. And that's something that's gone from a very small revenue base to a respectable number as we sit here in 2022 and growing in the years beyond. So we're hopeful that we can continue to grow it meaningfully for the next several years. Operator : We'll take our next question from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Salveen Richter : Could you provide us any updates on how you're thinking about pricing and branding of zuranolone and thoughts here on how a potential Schedule IV could impact utilization? Michel Vounatsos : So first, we are very encouraged by the data. I'm delighted to see the second study in postpartum, fourth study in major depressive disorders. We had opportunities to meet many constituency and this disease is affecting so many people. So it's so relevant. If I'm not mistaken, in the U.S., more than 19 million, as Priya said, an incident for PPD close to 0.5 million every year. So extremely relevant. We are making a lot of progress on the positioning and understanding the patient journey and the different segments of the market between the naive and the failure to treatment the way we know in this massive market due to side effects or lack of efficacy. I hope that in the near future, we'll be -- we'll have an opportunity together with Sage to have a dedicated session with you to update you on where we stand, and we'll come back to that as soon as we can. Concerning the price, we are not yet there. We are making some -- our homework, but nothing to add yet at this stage. Priya Singhal : I can address the scheduling question. Thank you, Salveen. So I just wanted to say that if you step back, the DEA process is quite robust, and they will -- this typically takes about 3 months at the end of the approval process, and they will designate a schedule. Now Sage has already completed their human abuse liability potential study, as I mentioned in my opening comments. And there could potentially be 5 schedules that you could get. At present, what we do know is the data that we have, and we also have the background of ZULRESSO, which is a Schedule IV drug. So at this point, we do believe that it is possible for zuranolone to get a Schedule IV. And Schedule IV is typically -- what it means is low potential for abuse and low risk for dependence. The other drugs in this category are Ativan, XANAX, Darvocet and others. And we believe that this is currently the expected scheduling. Of course, we have to wait to go through the process to see what the outcome will be, but that's what we expect at the moment with the data we have. I hope that addresses it. Operator : We'll take our next from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities. Robyn Karnauskas : Sorry, I'm losing my voice. So I know you've talked a lot about staying within the current pillars of neurology and maybe also immunology. I was just wondering, if you think about derisking the portfolio and maybe going outside those pillars, what are your current thoughts about that now given you've had 3 months to think about it? And then I guess the question that goes along with that, would you make that decision after you hire the final Head of R&D and CEO? Priya Singhal : I can get started. Thank you for the question. So just stepping back, we have -- at Biogen, we've got a vision towards a multi-franchise portfolio. And R&D, our pipeline, I believe, is quite strong and diversified and robust. We have programs in the clinic, many more in our discovery and exploratory portfolio, where we look at the diseases that we want to be leaders in and we think about the targets and biological pathways that we may want to address with our platform actually of multiple modalities. So that's the other strength we have. We could be agnostic to modality because we have access to biologics, small molecules, antisense oligonucleotides as well as gene therapy. So that's sort of at a high level. That's how we think about our R&D portfolio. Now within that, you spoke about neuroscience. This is an absolute core strength that we have. It's a very hard space I would acknowledge. I think we would all acknowledge it, but we've had a lot of success in this space both with multiple sclerosis as well as with spinal muscular atrophy. And potentially, we could have success with Alzheimer's. And certainly, we have zuranolone in depression. So we are thinking about this as neuroscience potentially increasing our focus in neuropsychiatry where we've got now a product that is in filing for both MDD and PPD with a large high unmet need, and we are looking at other potential indications for the GABAA pathway that zuranolone addresses. So zuranolone could really be much more than just MDD and PPD, and we're looking at that as well in our portfolio prioritization. Shifting over to specialized immunology, we have three Phase 3 trials, and this is really important with two products. So we have our home grown BIIB059, which where we understand the biology and the pathway really well. We think it could be first-in-class, best-in-class for CLE cutaneous lupus erythematosus, but also for SLE. And then we have Dapi with our collaboration with UCB, also in Phase 3. So this is a comprehensive sort of portfolio just in SLE and CLE. There, again, we are thinking about where else do we understand the Type 1 Interferon signature, where else could we have potential indications with BIIB059, for example, in other specialized immunology indications? That's our core focus currently. And then finally, I'll say that within neuroscience, we think we can be leaders in Alzheimer's, depression and retain our leadership in MS and SPINRAZA. SMA, we have already discussed externally are opted for BIIB115, which is a follow-on ASO with potentially a once-a-year dosing. So that could really be very, very important. We are accelerating that as much as we can. And we have MS, where we continue to think of BTK inhibitors. So we have a peripheral BTK inhibitor. We also have a central BTK inhibitor, and we will continue to look at the emerging data and make decisions. Beyond this core R&D portfolio, as Michel mentioned, we also have our biosimilars and our digital therapeutics. We've just made a foray with MedRhythms. And I think that this altogether is a very diversified portfolio. The area that we've increased a lot of focus is as soon as we have -- for example, we had the BIIB104 readout, we're now thinking of what else we would do with that [glutamergic] pathway and the data that we will gather from there. Similarly, with BIIB059 and zuranolone, as I mentioned, how would we allocate resources to that? What would we prioritize? So we are doing this in a very systematic fashion, and it's a call out to the R&D and the entire one Biogen team to really be doing this very well. I hope that gives you a flavor of how we are approaching it. Michel Vounatsos : Thank you, Priya. And to bring that together, what is very important for us to set the strategic direction is to clearly understand the key capabilities that we have within the company throughout the value chain, from the early research, clinical development throughout to commercialization and customer engagement. And as Priya said, today, we believe that we are pretty well diversified compared where we were 6 years ago in neuroscience, in specialized immuno, in biosimilars and emerging digital therapeutics capability. We have now 29 programs and 10 in Phase 3 of file products. The question is how do we derisk in addition? And this is what Priya started to work on. Obviously, a new CEO and a permanent Head of R&D will have an opportunity to revisit the strategy together with the Board. Operator : We'll take our next question from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Cory Kasimov : Going back to Alzheimer's for a minute. So in the face of the recent NCD and with the CLARITY study, obviously, pending, how do you think about the relative importance of the January PDUFA for lecanemab for accelerated approval that's based primarily on Phase 2 data? And has the FDA given any indication if they convene an ADCOM for this initial application? Priya Singhal : Thank you, Cory. So first -- firstly, I think that just to step back, we have filed according to the accelerated approval pathway with the Phase 2 data, as you mentioned, Cory, and the PDUFA date for that is January 6, 2023. Now Clarity AD will readout in the fall of this year. And should it be positive it will be -- the filing for traditional approval will be completed by what Eisai has communicated by the end of the first quarter of 2023. In addition, I think that the totality of the information and the data will matter for the outcome. At the moment, we have -- we do not have an indication that there will be an advisory committee at this moment. We do not have that indication. So that's what I can tell you on -- about that. I hope I addressed all the aspects of your question. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jay Olson with Oppenheimer. Jay Olson : Can you talk about why BIIB104 did not meet the primary or secondary endpoints in the Phase 2 TALLY trial? And would you consider BIIB104 for a study in other indications? Priya Singhal : Thank you, Jay. Great question. So yes, we are very disappointed with the negative readout for BIIB104. And just to step back, the hypothesis that we were testing was that AMPA potentiation can impact NMDA hypofunction -- NMDA receptor hypofunction and thereby, increase synaptic connectivity and increase the working memory domain -- impact the working memory domain positively in cognitive impairment that's associated with schizophrenia. So that was the hypothesis. And we were looking forward to the results. Of course, it has not met primary or secondary endpoints. Now in neuropsychiatry trials, sometimes you don't have the right adherence and compliance during the trial. So we have looked very carefully at the PK exposures and such. And this was a 12-week readout. So we have looked at that, and we have quite -- we feel quite confident that this was a very high -- highly compliant trial where we have expected exposures for BIIB104 through the -- throughout the 12-week duration. So we believe that we have tested the hypothesis of AMPA potentiation leading to NMDA potentiation as well. Having said that, we think that this was an extremely well-run trial, and we have collected a very rich data set that can give us leads on how we might want to pursue the [glutamergic] pathway in other neuropsychiatry indications. So yes, that is something that we are looking at very carefully, and we will be evaluating this very carefully. We did have early Phase I trials, but that data was, unfortunately, not replicated. Now these are very small trials. One was in healthy volunteers and the other 1 was in schizophrenia patients, but there was shorter duration and the subject numbers were 39 and 29, respectively. So very small trials. So yes, to your question, neuropsychiatry remains an area of high focus. We believe we've increased our capabilities and focus in this area, and we'll continue to look at this very high-quality data set, and we'll also be presenting it at upcoming medical meetings. Operator : We'll take our next question from Phil Nadeau with Cowen. Philip Nadeau : A follow up to Cory's question but directed specifically at Mike. Mike, how does Biogen feel about putting resources behind lecanemab launch? What would be the timing of an infrastructure build and true launch of the product? Would it be after accelerated approval, after full approval or it does seem like now there's another step within NCD likely to come at some point. So when would Biogen feel comfortable in really investing in the commercial infrastructure for this program? Michel Vounatsos : So before Mike jumps in, I would like to say that we work in full and close collaboration with our partners at Eisai that we are approaching a global launch, not suddenly a U.S. launch, and we anticipate the filing in Japan and EMA to take place during the first half of 2023. So this will be a global launch. And obviously, as we know, there is a sequential process here between an accelerated approval and a potentially full approval after that. Mike? Michael McDonnell : Yes. I think Michel covered a lot of it in terms of the question, Phil, but I would just say that as a reminder, that we and Eisai expect the Phase III readout for lecanemab in the fall of 2022. The PDUFA date is in early January of '23. As you know -- as currently written, the national coverage determination does significantly limit the market opportunity for antibodies with accelerated approval. And so as Michel said, we will closely align with Eisai to resource appropriately. We'll take learnings from ADUHELM as necessary and as where we can, and we'll resource it at each phase of its commercialization very gradually as lecanemab is launched. I'd say that, obviously, we did make the decision to take down the ADUHELM commercial infrastructure because we felt the time gap was too large to the timing of when we would need it for lecanemab. And I think that, that was the right decision. We feel like we can rebuild the infrastructure in a more gradual fashion and fairly quickly when we're ready. And again, that's something that we'll partner very closely with Eisai on. Michel Vounatsos : I think that it will very much be dependent on the quality of the data. If the data clarifies and confirms without any ambiguity that removing the plaque is correlated with the slowing down of a cognitive decline and reinforces the hypothesis, I think arrows with a line faster than what we believe. Michael McDonnell : Yes. And the other thing to remember here, this is purely from an accounting standpoint, and it ties back a little bit to the question that Mike Yee asked earlier. Just as a reminder, all of the revenue costs, everything will be aggregated and our 50% share will be reflected as a one-line revenue item for lecanemab. Operator : We'll take our next question from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : Just want to follow up on some previous questions on lecanemab. You guys have talked about the U.S. opportunity already, but how much of a discussion have you had with EU or Japanese regulators just on the risk/benefit bar? I wasn't sure if your prior discussions from ADU were able to give you some insight there. Priya Singhal : Thank you, Geoff. So Eisai has communicated that they will be completing the filing in both Europe as well as in Japan by the end of Q1 2023, very similar to the U.S. time line. This is, of course, post Clarity AD readout should be positive. And in line with that communication, all the communications with regulators around the world, they are in line -- they have been in consultation. In Japan, Eisai actually has communicated and we have communicated previously that they have been part of its prior consultation process. Now the prior consultation process in Japan has the ability to really expedite the review process, should the data be positive. So that's also taking place. So all the -- everything is on track to complete the submission. Benefit risk will always drive the discussions, and we believe that the trial is set up well-powered and well designed to give us an answer on a clinically validated instrument. So we believe that it is set up well. We, of course -- the rest will depend on the data. Operator : We'll take our next question from Evan Seigerman with Bank of Montreal. Evan Seigerman : Just looking ahead to the Clarity AD trial, what do you think CMS needs to see from that trial to potentially revise the NCD? I know there's a lot of discussion on the call. But I'm wondering, is that sufficient to essentially open up access in the Medicare population. Priya Singhal : Thank you, Evan. So I think that before we kind of -- before I answer that directly, it would be important for us to kind of reiterate that the final NCD indicated that antibodies with full approval may be covered in CMS approved prospective comparative studies and -- but that this data could be collected in a registry. Now what is left open to interpretation here is there next point that they made, which is that the degree of rigor in these study designs may depend on good part on the strength of evidence of the initial randomized controlled trial that led to FDA approval. This aspect, we feel quite good about because we think that the trial is well designed and well set up and well powered to give us a readout. So we believe that if the trial reads out positive, that is the Clarity AD that there would be a chance that it would meet the high level of evidence bar that NCD has put forward from -- that CMS has put forward in the NCD and that they could potentially reconsider for full coverage. The other aspect to consider here is that there are two other readouts coming in the same sort of time frame, which could also influence how CMS looks at their guidance and what they designate as a high level of evidence. So it's not clear to us at this point, but it will depend on each molecule, Phase 3 data is my personal interpretation on this. Now as Eisai has announced, Clarity has a robust design, and they believe that it could meet the high level of evidence set forth by CMS in the NCD memo. So we do think that it could be reconsidered. And I think the high level of evidence would have to include safety, efficacy under represented population that mirrors the CMS population. In addition, I would say that the population in the Clarity AD also has comorbidities and concomitant medications not very dissimilar from the CMS population. So I think these things set us up well and they bode well. I think final outcome will depend on the data. Michel Vounatsos : And to add to what Priya has said, beyond the solid design, there is an open-label extension that will add some information. There is also a preclinical trial ongoing for the earlier population and life cycle management opportunities with new subcutaneous formulation also underway. Michael Hencke : And that will conclude our call today. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. Operator : That will conclude today's call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hencke, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Hencke, you may begin your conference. Mike Hencke : Good morning, and welcome to Biogen's third quarter 2022 earnings call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including our GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in tables one and two, and table four includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Vounatsos; Dr. Priya Singhal, Interim Head of Research and Development; and our CFO, Mike McDonnell. As a reminder, during the Q&A portion of the call, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question. I will now turn the call over to Michel. Michel Vounatsos : Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. This is an exciting time for Biogen. In addition to key developments across our pipeline, which includes 12 programs in Phase 3 are filed, we continue to execute progress, and we are pleased to be raising our full year financial guidance. I would like to begin by reviewing the important advances we made this quarter and what we believe they mean for Biogen. Priya will then review our recent progress in R&D, and Mike will discuss our third quarter performance. First, together with Eisai, we were excited to announce the positive results from CLARITY AD, the Phase 3 study of lecanemab in early Alzheimer's disease. For over 15 years, Biogen has been working relentlessly to bring forward new therapeutics in Alzheimer's disease, incorporating both new insights in disease biology and clinical trial design. And today, we celebrate the positive CLARITY AD readout as a significant achievement in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The results from Clarity AD illustrated several key aspects of lecanemab's clinical profile, which we believe could provide a meaningful benefit for patients. First, lecanemab administration showed a highly statistically significant reduction in clinical decline as early as six months, which expanded over the 18-month study period on an absolute basis, consistent with the disease-modifying effect. Second, the study was positive on all key secondary endpoints. This includes merger of cognition as well as activities of daily living such as conducting personal finances, performing household tasks, and independently traveling out of home. Third, the rate of area in Clarity AD, was within expectations. With an FDA decision on accelerated approval expected by January 6 of next year, and Eisai's plan to file for traditional approval in the US, EU and Japan by the end of Q1 2023, lecanemab has the potential to be the first globally approved treatment to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. We look forward to working with Eisai as they continue to engage both regulators and CMS with a goal of ensuring that people with Alzheimer's disease have access to important new treatments. We believe that, Clarity AD results underscore the progress we are making in the fight against Alzheimer's. But Biogen will not stop here. We plan to build upon our current learning's as we continue to advance a diversified pipeline of potential Alzheimer's treatment. This includes two clinical-stage assets targeting tau pathology, BIIB080, our Phase 2 ready antisense oligonucleotide and BIB113, a Phase 1 small molecule. The pre-owned Alzheimer's Biogen has important opportunities in other therapeutic areas, where the unmet medical need remains significant. This includes depression where, together with Sage, we are continuing to advance the regulatory filing for zuranolone in both major depressive disorders, and postpartum depression, with a novel mechanism of action, efficacy observed as early as three days, and a consistent safety and tolerability profile across eight clinical studies, we believe that zuranolone, if approved, could be a meaningful new therapy for depression. Second, the FDA has accepted our filing for tofersen in SOD1-ALS under the accelerated approval pathway, and granted priority review. While the study did not meet the primary endpoint at six months, longer follow-up has shown that patients who remain on tofersen experienced a slow rate of decline in key clinical measures, including lung functions, muscle strength and quality of life. We are truly encouraged by these results in such a debilitating and fatal disease, and look forward to an FDA decision expected by April of next year. We believe this near-term opportunities, along with new launches of biosimilars, have the potential to drive renewed growth and position us to have five key franchises by 2025. Furthermore, we see the potential for additional growth drivers in the mid to late 2020s in areas such as Parkinson's disease, lupus and stroke, all with programs currently in Phase 3. Overall, we believe that we had an inflection point in CNS drug discovery and development, and these recent developments embody key advancements that are being made in neuroscience. For years, Biogen has been expanding our expertise and capabilities in this area, and we believe that we are well positioned to remain a leader in neuroscience as we work to usher in the new next wave of CNS therapeutics while also advancing our portfolio in specialized immunology where we have four late-stage studies in lupus. I will now turn the call over to Priya for a more detailed update on our recent progress in R&D. Priya Singhal : Thank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone. As Michel mentioned, we had several exciting R&D achievements this past quarter that meaningfully advance the potential of our pipeline, which includes 30 programs, 12 of which are in Phase 3 are filed in order to deliver new impactful therapies for patients and drive renewed growth for the company. Starting with Alzheimer's disease. Together with Eisai, we were very excited to announce the positive results of the Clarity AD study, evaluating lecanemab in early Alzheimer's disease. The primary endpoint of the study was a change from baseline on CDR Sum of Boxes, a well-established measure of cognition and function in Alzheimer's disease. The study met the primary endpoint and lecanemab reduced clinical decline on the CDR Sum of Boxes compared with placebo at 18 months by 0.45, representing a treatment difference of 27%. We also observed a highly statistically significant reduction in CDR Sum of Boxes versus placebo as early as six months. We believe this demonstrates a rapid onset of efficacy and a significant change in CDR Sum of Boxes versus placebo. Furthermore, the effect on CDR Sum of Boxes expanded over the 18-month study period on an absolute basis, suggesting that lecanumab was exerting a disease modifying effect. The study also met all key secondary endpoints, reinforcing lecanumab's impact on cognition and function. This includes a statistically significant reduction in amyloid blocks in the brain, as well as additional clinical assessments such as the ADCS-MCI-ADL, a caregiver-rated assessment of activities of daily living relative to placebo. We believe that these efficacy results, when combined with an observed overall incidence of ARIA of approximately 21%, highlights the potential for lecanemab to be a leading disease modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease. Eisai will present the Clarity AD study results at CTAD in November and intends to publish the findings in a peer-reviewed medical journal. The lecanemab filing under the accelerated approval pathway is currently under review with a PDUFA date of January 6, 2023. The FDA has also agreed that the Clarity AD could serve as a confirmatory study to verify the clinical benefit of lecanemab. Accordingly, we expect Eisai will file for traditional approval of lecanemab in the US as soon as possible, following a positive FDA decision on accelerated approval. This filing is expected by the end of Q1 2023, along with marketing authorization applications in the EU and Japan expected by the end of Q1 2023 as well. Eisai has also been engaging with the centers of Medicare and Medicaid services as they work to maximize access for patients. Beyond these regulatory and access engagements, together with Eisai, we are also advancing a comprehensive development program for lecanemab, which includes, first, the ongoing AHEAD 3-45 pre-clinical study to evaluate lecanemab when administered earlier in disease, when amyloid pathology is present but before the onset of cognitive impairment. Second, investigating a potential maintenance dosing regimen with the goal of reducing the lecanemab dosing frequency over time. And the development of a subcutaneous formulation of lecanemab. At AAIC earlier this year, Eisai presented bioavailability data from a Phase I study comparing IV versus subcutaneous dosing as well as modeling and simulation data illustrating that a fixed subcutaneous dose of 720 milligrams administered weekly may potentially result in comparable exposure and efficacy to the current IV formulation while potentially lowering the incidence of ARIA. With these results in hand, we are focused now on maintaining our leadership position in Alzheimer's disease over the long-term. We have an industry-leading portfolio addressing both amyloid and tau pathologies, as well as a multi-target multi-modality pre-clinical portfolio targeting a broad range of Alzheimer's disease biology. Now I will turn to neuropsychiatry, where this quarter, Biogen and Sage presented new data that supports zuranolone's potential, if approved, as a novel treatment for both major depressive disorder and postpartum depression. This includes an updated analysis of the open-label ongoing longitudinal SHORELINE Study in MDD, which showed that the medium time to onset first -- I'm sorry, the median time to first repeat treatment for patients who responded to the original 14-day treatment was 135 days for the 30-milligram cohort and 249 days for the 50-milligram cohort. We believe these data further support zuranolone as a potential meaningful new treatment for people suffering from depression, and we are continuing to work with Sage to advance a single US regulatory filing for zuranolone in MDD and PPD expected to be completed by the end of this year. Moving on to our neuromuscular portfolio. The New England Journal of Medicine recently published 12-month data from the Phase III VALOR study and its open-label extension evaluating tofersen in SOD1-ALS, a progressive and rare genetic form of ALS, which currently has no targeted therapy. The published data showed that patients who initiated tofersen in VALOR experienced slower rates of decline across critical measures of function, muscle strength and quality of life versus those who transitioned from placebo to tofersen at the start of the open label extension six months later. Furthermore, tofersen led to a robust and sustained reduction in neurofilament, a marker of neuronal injury and neurodegeneration. In July, the tofersen filing was accepted by the FDA under the accelerated approval pathway with priority review. Subsequently, we submitted responses to information request by the FDA, which the FDA considered a major amendment to the application that will require additional time for review. As a result, the review period has been extended by three months with an FDA decision now expected by April 25, 2023. In movement disorders, together with Denali, we initiated our second late-stage clinical trial for BIIB122, a small molecule LRRK2 inhibitor. The Phase 3 LIGHTHOUSE study will evaluate BIIB122 in individuals with a confirmed pathogenic LRRK2 mutation. Given that LRRK2 activity is believed to regulate lysosomal function and underlying biological pathway implicated in Parkinson's disease, we are also advancing the Phase 2b LUMA study in idiopathic Parkinson's disease, which we initiated earlier this year. Moving on to specialized immunology. We were excited to announce the initiation of the Phase 2/3 study of Litifilimab or BIB059 in cutaneous lupus erythematosus, or CLE. The prior Phase 2 LILAC study of Litifilimab met the primary endpoints in both parts of the study, evaluating safety and efficacy in individuals with CLE and systemic lupus erythematosus or SLE. The detailed Phase 2 results were recently published as two separate manuscripts in the New England Journal of Medicine. The Phase 2/3 study in CLE builds upon our mid to late-stage pipeline in specialized immunology, which also includes three Phase 3 studies in SLE, two for Litifilimab and one for dapirolizumab pegol, which we are developing in collaboration with UCB. Looking ahead, we also have a number of exciting opportunities on the horizon. This includes the potential to deliver new therapies in Alzheimer's, depression, and SOD1-ALS; initiation of mid to late-stage programs in Alzheimer's disease and stroke; and a proof-of-concept study readout in broad ALS.  In conclusion, we believe that our recent progress exemplifies important elements of our broader approach to R&D at Biogen. This includes a focus on genetically validated targets and biology, the use of novel biomarkers to better characterize disease biology and target engagement, as well as our ability to employ the right therapeutic modality for the specific disease area or target. Together, we believe these principles, combined with our ongoing prioritization effort, has the potential to increase the probability of success in disease areas with significant unmet need. I will now pass the call over to Mike. Michael McDonnell : Thank you, Priya and good morning everyone. I will provide some highlights of our financial performance for the third quarter and an update to our full year 2022 guidance. Please note that all financial comparisons are versus the third quarter of 2021. Total revenue for the third quarter was $2.5 billion, a decrease of 10% at actual currency and 8% at constant currency. Non-GAAP diluted EPS in the third quarter was $4.77, which was flat versus the third quarter of 2021. Total MS revenue, inclusive of OCREVUS royalties, was $1.6 billion, which was a decrease of 11% at actual currency and 9% at constant currency. Global TECFIDERA revenue of $339 million decreased 32% at actual currency, and 30% at constant currency. We saw continued erosion of TECFIDERA in the US due to generics and an impact from generics outside of the US, primarily in Germany. We continue to see new generic launches in the EU. Earlier this month, the advocate general of the European Court of Justice issued a non-binding advisory opinion. We would expect TECFIDERA to have statutory market protection until at least February of 2024, if the court adopts the advisory opinion. There is no deadline for the court to issue its final decision, but we understand that approximately three to five months after issuance of the advocate general's opinion is typical. Separately, we are filing actions to enforce our recently granted European TECFIDERA dosing patent, which expires in 2028. We have been successful in obtaining preliminary injunctions in some countries and unsuccessful in others, including Germany and France. Until, we either affirm TECFIDERA's entitlement to statutory market protection in the EU, or successfully asserted our patent, generics can continue to sell in the countries where we do not have preliminary injunctions in place. Global VUMERITY revenue of $138 million increased 14% at actual currency and 15% at constant currency. US VUMERITY revenue increased 6% with higher volumes, partially offset by increased discounts and allowances. VUMERITY is being impacted by both payer pressure and the contraction of the oral segment of the market in the United States. We continue to work with our contract manufacturing supplier to address potential supply constraints for VUMERITY. We have identified the root cause implemented manufacturing changes required to resolve the issue and are now working to secure necessary related regulatory approvals. We do not anticipate a supply shortage in 2022 and are currently focused on rebuilding adequate inventory with the goal of ensuring supply and reinitiating new country launches in 2023. Global TYSABRI revenue of $505 million decreased 3% at actual currency and 1% at constant currency. US TYSABRI revenue was negatively impacted by higher discounts and allowances and lower volume. Outside the US, we were pleased to see continued patient growth as well as good uptake of the subcutaneous formulation in the EU, which has now been launched in over 25 markets with an average conversion rate of approximately 40%. Although, the composition of matter patents for TYSABRI have expired, we have other patents related to the making and using of TYSABRI, including those listed in our 10-K. We'll continue to enforce this IP, including filing suit against Sandoz in the United States. Global interferon revenue of $336 million decreased 13% at actual currency and 12% at constant currency and was impacted by the continued shift from the injectable platforms to oral or high efficacy therapies. Moving to SMA. Global SPINRAZA revenue of $431 million declined 3% at actual currency and increased 2% at constant currency. In the United States, SPINRAZA revenue was flat versus the prior year, and we believe we may be seeing signs of stabilization in the US. Outside the US, excluding negative currency impacts, revenue increased due to volume growth in certain Asian markets as well as some positive pricing dynamics, partially offset by competition and the timing of shipments. Overall, we continue to believe that SPINRAZA has the potential to grow over time. Moving to our Biosimilars business. Revenue of $188 million declined 7% at actual currency and 4% at constant currency. We saw an increase in sales volumes, which was offset by unfavorable pricing as well as negative currency impacts. We continue to expect a gradual launch of BYOOVIZ with more meaningful revenue contribution expected to begin in 2023. Total anti-CD20 revenue of $417 million was flat versus the prior year. Revenue from OCREVUS royalties increased 6%, which was offset by continued RITUXAN declines due to biosimilar competition. Now moving on to expenses on the balance sheet. Third quarter non-GAAP cost of sales was $470 million, which includes $12 million of idle capacity charges. Going forward, we expect further pressure on gross margins due to shifts in product mix and potential idle capacity charges largely resulting from the suspension of drug product manufacturing for ADUHELM. Third quarter non-GAAP R&D expense was $549 million. This is compared to $702 million in the third quarter of 2021, which included approximately $165 million in upfront payments related to business development transactions as well as clinical trial closeout costs. Non-GAAP SG&A was $562 million. This is compared to $651 million in the third quarter of 2021. The decrease in SG&A expense was driven primarily by cost savings initiatives. Third quarter collaboration profit sharing was a net expense of $45 million, primarily driven by our collaboration with Samsung Bioepis. Non-GAAP other expense was $55 million, primarily driven by interest expense. In the third quarter, we generated $661 million in cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures were $59 million and free cash flow was $602 million. We repurchased 1.2 million shares of the company's common stock during the quarter for $250 million at an average price of $214 per share. We ended the quarter with $5.8 billion in cash and marketable securities, $6.3 billion in debt and approximately $500 million in net debt. Of note, in the third quarter, we received net proceeds of $583 million from the sale of one of our buildings in Cambridge as part of our office footprint optimization initiative. Additionally, in October, we paid $900 million plus fees and expenses to resolve the previously disclosed qui tam litigation. As a reminder, we expect to receive an additional $1.25 billion over the next 1.5 years from the sale of our equity stake in Samsung Bioepis, including approximately $813 million due in April of next year. Overall, we remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial capacity, including a $1 billion undrawn revolving credit facility to invest in growing the business over the long-term. Before I turn to our updated guidance, let me say a few words about lecanemab. We are excited to be collaborating with Eisai on this important opportunity under a global 50-50 profit sharing agreement. As a reminder, Biogen has the right to co-commercialize and co-promote lecanemab with Eisai who has final decision-making authority. After approval, our share of profits or losses will be booked as a component of other revenue. The lecanemab component of other revenue may be negative in the initial quarters of the launch. Please see Slide 26 in our earnings presentation for other accounting considerations. Let me now discuss our updated full-year 2022 guidance. We are increasing our full-year revenue guidance from our previous range of $9.9 billion to $10.1 billion to a new range of $10 billion $10.115 billion and increasing our full year non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance from our previous range of $15.25 to $16.75 to a new range of $16.50 to $17.15. This guidance increase is primarily a result of better-than-expected topline performance and continued cost management. Our guidance ranges for non-GAAP R&D expense, non-GAAP SG&A expense, and our non-GAAP tax rate are all unchanged from prior guidance. As a reminder, we typically see a seasonally higher SG&A spend in the fourth quarter. This guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates as of September 30th will remain in effect for the remainder of the year, net of hedging activities. This financial guidance also assumes continued declines in RITUXAN revenue due to biosimilar competition, as well as continued erosion of TECFIDERA revenue due to generic entry. Please see our press release for other important guidance assumptions. In summary, we continue to execute well across our core business and are pleased to be raising our financial guidance for the year. We are excited about the recent lecanemab readout and believe our diversified pipeline across neuroscience, specialized immunology, and biosimilars has the potential to return Biogen to growth over time as we continue to build a multi-franchise portfolio. As always, we remain focused on creating long-term value for our shareholders. And with that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Umer Raffat : Good morning guys. I had a question on the status of your relationship with Eisai. There's a lot of investor questions on it. And I was just really curious if you could speak to sort of the status of the relationship, if you expect Eisai to allow you to commercialize and that there's not been any sort of contractual disputes or anything like that. Thank you very much. Michel Vounatsos : Thanks for the question, Umer. I can tell you that the relationship is very solid since many years. I have the opportunity to meet and to align with our -- my counterpart on a very regular basis. And I will do that once more in the coming days. The team are working together very closely. The co-commercialization co-marketing is being discussed when we speak and is not yet determined. And -- but overall, the relationship is sound and solid. Mike, do you want to add something? Michael McDonnell : No, I think that covers it. I would say that as we work together on the commercialization strategy, obviously, Eisai has final decision-making rights, but it is a 50-50 profit share. And together, we're excited for the upcoming CTAD presentation, where more detailed study results will be shared. Operator : We'll go to our next question from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Brian Abrahams : Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter and on the lecanemab data. I'm curious how you envision reimbursement access for lecanemab with an accelerated versus a full approval? And I guess I'm wondering, based on you and your partner's ongoing CMS discussions, what your latest views are on whether topline results from Clarity AD would satisfy CMS' high-level evidence requirements to support NCD reconsideration in the case of an accelerated approval. Thanks. Michel Vounatsos : Thanks for this important question. I think it all depends to the strength of the evidence. We are very pleased with the top line results on the primary and secondaries. We are all looking forward for CTAD and for a coming publication in order to assess the level of evidence that will be considered by CMS, and that will imply the path forward. Priya? Priya Singhal : Thank you, Michel. That's exactly right. And I'll just add that there is a -- there are a couple of scenarios that are outlined in the NCD. So for the accelerated approval scenario, it's essentially coverage only in the situation of a randomized controlled trial, which is essentially non-overage. But for traditional approval, there is a range of options, I think, that the NCD indicates, which is that, it could be covered in a CMS-approved prospective comparative study, including registries. The strength and rigor of that kind of study will depend on the strength and rigor of the randomized controlled trial that affords the final traditional approval. So in that sense, we feel very confident about the strength of evidence. As you know, we met the primary endpoint with a treatment difference of 0.45, which translated to 27% versus placebo with lecanemab. And also all secondary endpoints were met in a highly statistical significant manner. And in addition, I would add that we had about 25% of an underrepresented population. So we believe that it's very well designed and the results are very encouraging. The rest will remain to be seen, and Eisai is already engaging with CMS to discus this. You specifically asked about reconsideration, so I'll just add a note there, that in the final scenario that NCD -- the final NCD did put out was that CMS would act with urgency and potentially a reconsideration could be considered. That could take nine to 12 months from a historic precedent perspective. But I think in this sense, they have said that they would act with urgency. And that would be a full coverage without the need for prospective comparative studies. So I think we need to wait for the CTAD data and continue the engagement. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Salveen Richter : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On the back of the lecanemab data, can you just walk us through how you're thinking about business development and portfolio prioritization? Michel Vounatsos : I can tell you that we do remain very active on BDs -- in evaluating BD. Obviously, the portfolio is strong. And as we said during the prepared remarks, we have 12 Phase IIIs of filed products and we are getting prepared for AD, ALS, MDD and PPD. So we are all very busy. Nevertheless, BD is on the table because the portfolio can always be improved. And we are evaluating every week prospects, and we are making progress. We've made more than 30 deals in the past few years, but we continue to be very active. Priya and Mike? Priya Singhal : Thank you. So I think that's a great question. And just stepping back, as Michel mentioned during the remarks, we see ourselves as leaders in the Alzheimer's space. We believe that we've done a lot of evaluation of the scientific hypotheses, the biology. And we have set up our portfolio to be able to address both what in terms of the biology and also the when. So I think in terms of the biology, we've now had success with lecanemab. Previously, we've seen the results also with aducanumab, and that's the A-beta hypothesis. In addition, we had our own study with the monoclonal antibody against tau, which did not work. So, we did test that hypothesis with the extracellular tau and now we are positioned to initiate our Phase 2 with BIIB080, which is an antisense oligonucleotide that will address all post-translational forms of tau. So we believe [Technical Difficulty] we believe we have a leading antisense oligonucleotide. Also, we have BIIB113 in Phase 1, which addresses tau aggregation and addresses an enzymatic inhibition of tau aggregation. So, we are really trying to tackle this from all the -- from the amyloid and the tau pathology basis. Behind that, in the preclinical space, we have also several other biologies that we are looking at very carefully in terms of targets and also modalities. So, I think we have a very comprehensive approach. And with regards to when, I'm very pleased that we have lecanemab already being tested in preclinical Alzheimer's disease. So, that's a study that's already ongoing, which will address what happens when you intervene with an anti-amyloid therapy, prior -- when you do have the amyloid aggregation but you don't have symptoms. So, I think it's a very comprehensive approach. We are not going to stop here. We continue to look at very attractive targets. And I think BD and internal development will continue to be important. And finally, with lecanemab, we are testing two very important aspects in our development plan. Eisai is obviously the lead on this. In the Phase 2 open-label extension, we're looking at maintenance dosing. So, what's the right frequency to continue to preserve the clinical decline progression stop. And we are looking at subcutaneous development in the Phase III open-label extension. So I think overall, it's very, very comprehensive. And I think this will be a space that we will continue to invest to win. Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : Mike, do you want to add anything to BD? Michael McDonnell : No, the only thing I would just quickly add is that -- I think you covered it, but I would just quickly add. You did not see BD activity during the quarter in the way of new collaborations or M&A, you should not read anything into that. We continue to have a very robust pipeline and we continue to look at a variety of deals. It does tend to be lumpy and you should fully expect that there will be more transactions in the future. Thanks. Michel Vounatsos : So, as Priya said very eloquently, neurodegeneration takes more prominence in our privatization process, and we are in a position to lead in AD, and we are looking at actively at all the targets and assets we could acquire, but also beyond. Operator : We'll take your next question from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Tim Anderson : I have a question actually on ADUHELM, and it kind of relates to earlier comments about your role with lecanemab still being under contemplation. I think a lot of folks are under the impression you've all but washed your hands and aren't really doing anything with ADUHELM. But from what I hear, that may not be the case. You're still pursuing a subcu version of the product. It sounds like you still may be trying to figure out a path forward to get CMS reimbursement for APOE4 carriers. And I'm wondering if that is true and if that could be a source of tension with Eisai. It's just not intuitive to me why you wouldn't be all-in on lecanemab instead and why you still may be active with ADUHELM. Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : So we'll be all-in on lecanemab [ph], together with the great partners that we have, and we will do everything we can to secure access of the product to the patients after regulatory process. Nevertheless, the Clarity AD reinforces the finding that removing aggregated form of a beta [ph] in the brain can be associated with the slowing down of the cognitive decline. And this is very important, and this is what we have shown with ADU, and we have patients currently being dosed on the EMBARK study. And Priya will say more with that. Priya Singhal : Yes. I'll actually -- I don't have a lot to add. What I'll say is that we are continuing to look at aducanumab, and we haven't made any decisions. For now, we believe that the EMBARK data set is going to be very valuable to the scientific community. These are patients who have been on aducanumab and an anti-amyloid therapy for many years. In addition, we have a post-marketing requirement given that aducanumab was the first product to get accelerated approval, and this is called the ENVISION study. So for now, both ENVISION and EMBARK continue. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Chris Raymond : Hey, thanks. Just maybe a related question to the last one. So with your commercial infrastructure for ADUHELM largely sort of wound down here. How should we think about the ramp maybe in spend on lecanemab infrastructure come January? And maybe talk about the lessons learned from ADUHELM and walk us through how you resource this launch here as you move from a potential accelerated approval to full approval? Thanks. Michel Vounatsos : Thanks for the question. I will start and Mike will add on. It was not reasonable based on the timeline and the gap between the ADU, NCD decision and the lecanumab readout and then regulatory process to keep a large force on board. This will not have been reasonable. So we had no choice than to take the actions that we took. Now there is a new page. And together with the partners, we are assessing, considering the benefits -- the strength, the relative strength of each company in each continent since we intend to file for full approval at the same time approximately in the US, in Europe and Japan should we have the accelerated approval early in the year. We are planning the investment, but we are not yet completely there. So we'll do that in a very paced and controlled manner, and we'll take it from here. Mike? Michael McDonnell : Yes. I would just add to that, that as we continue discussions with Eisai on the commercialization strategy, it's a 50-50 profit share. They have the final decision rights, as we've said. There are learnings from the ADUHELM situation that obviously we \u2013 we all share openly. And I would say that I do feel very highly confident that we will -- you'll see a commercial ramp in spend that will have much better proximity to revenue than you saw on ADUHELM and obviously, there were a number of things on ADUHELM that didn't go the direction that we had anticipated. But I do feel confident that we'll be able to gauge it in a way that -- and Eisai will be able to gauge it in a way that the ramp in spend will have better proximity to revenue than what you saw on ADUHELM. Operator : Your next question-- Michel Vounatsos : And I will say -- and if I may, I will say that we have a new process ahead of us. What we thought a couple of years ago is that an accelerated will mean product launch, and this was not the case. So, here now, we have a new process that was outlined and then we'll be very much controlled in the way we spend the company's resource to scale up. Operator : Your next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to address another question that I think we get a lot from investors, which is about the potential for certain subgroups or populations to outperform and drive a significant part of the lecanemab topline results. So, can you just maybe confirm, if that was the case, if for example a certain subgroup was a major driver of the response that you would have called that out in the topline, or how should we think about that going into CTAD? Thanks. Priya Singhal : I can take that question. Thanks for the question, Matthew. So overall, I'll just say that the Clarity AD met its primary endpoint, which was CDR-Sum of Boxes and this was with a p-value of 0.00005. So, it was very, very highly significant. And this was a large trial. So, it was about 1,800 participants with -- including the underrepresented population and it met all its secondary endpoints, which were independent domains of cognition and function. So, overall, we feel that the results are very, very positive and that they're very encouraging. Now, details of subgroup analyses have not been shared by Eisai, and I think we need to wait for the CTAD to see more details about both the primary and the secondary endpoints. But at this point, I would say that overall, we believe that we just have to wait, and we feel very encouraged by what we've seen on the topline. I won't be able to comment on exactly what you may or may not see. I think we have to wait for CTAD for that. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Skorney with Baird. Brian Skorney : Hey good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could outline any broad timeline that you have for subcu lecanemab. Just wondering what the pathway looks like and maybe you're seeking to get initial and chronic dosing approved, or would this be more like initially a label where you could have patients switching who have initiated IV over a period of time? And just any learnings from your interactions with FDA on subcu to -- that you think might be applied as forward? Priya Singhal : Thank you, Brian. So, overall, what I can tell you is that this is a very important part of the long-term comprehensive clinical development plan for lecanemab. And the subcutaneous formulation development has -- is already being pursued in the Phase 3 open-label extension. We're also -- Eisai is also engaging with FDA. So, there are lots of discussions ongoing. I would just say that the Phase 1 bioavailability data has already been shared publicly. So, I already shared that. And as I mentioned in my remarks, they are currently looking at the 720-milligram weekly fixed dosing, and this is being evaluated. But the timelines and the details of what else the package might need that has not been shared. And so I would say just let's wait for that to be shared, and we will share that when it's appropriate. But it is a very important endeavor, and it is ongoing. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Michael Yee : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Going back to the comments about CMS reimbursement and having to wait for CTAD data, I guess maybe you could talk about what pathways or what types of interactions, if any, or what approach you can have with CMS to push urgency, whether that be patient advocacy groups, whether you guys are working hard to do that or whether they just see that there's clearly a change from ADUHELM situation a year ago and they will act fast. Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : So Eisai has the lead in engaging regulators and payers. And from what we know is that Eisai has already initiated engagement with CMS. So they're responsible for this activity. And at this stage, I will not provide more details. But the engagement is there, which is the most important. Operator : We'll go next to Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities. Robyn Karnauskas : Thank you. My question is two fronts. So we're hearing a lot that Lilly has a very big presence right now and mind share of doctors in this space. And you mentioned, Mike, that you tend to -- that you think that we'll have more -- I'm trying to interpret what you said, is that you're going to ramp up spend in line with revenue. Can you just elaborate a little bit there? Because you will have competitors in the space. And a small question for Priya. We also hear that tau pathology that you may not want to do trials in patients that already have a beta plaque with tau \u2013 a couple of questions there. Michael McDonnell : Yes. I'll just clarify the point that I made before. As Eisai develops the commercialization strategy along with us, the goal there, obviously, the first and primary goal will be to get the launch right and put an infrastructure in place that supports the best launch possible and we'll be in position. And obviously, in the situation that we had with ADUHELM, when we received approval in June of 2021, we had a large infrastructure that was built up and ready to go. And then obviously, we encountered significant delays. And the point that I was making is that we would hope that, that wouldn't be a repeat and that we would have the appropriate infrastructure to support a successful launch. That's priority one. And then hopefully, we wouldn't experience delays like that. And so that you would see a spend that would ramp in front of revenue, but it wouldn't have the gap that it did on ADUHELM. Priya Singhal : And I can add to that, Robyn. Thanks, Mike. I can add to that. In terms of doctors and mind share, I think that, obviously, this is a very highly rapidly evolving space from a scientific perspective. And I think lecanemab has demonstrated that removal of the plaques can result in a clinical impact. And this is really going to be important. I'd also like to add that the safety profile is going to be really, really important here. For example, with lecanemab, we've got rates of ARIA that are about 21%. We've seen this to be within expectations. And I think that this, together with the efficacy results, are going to be important for doctors to consider. So overall, while I think the question was a little bit more maybe about the launch, I would say that the mind share will depend on the data and I think the data needs to be seen from the other anti-amyloid therapies before we decide what is going to be meaningful. The other piece I think here is we see ourselves as pioneers. We've got this very encouraging data. We think that this is a very broad and complex patient population and the need and unmet need is very, very high. So, we think it's a very important place where we [Technical Difficulty] difference to patients. And then Robyn, on the second question, can you please clarify that? I didn't quite catch it. You broke up towards the end. Robyn Karnauskas : Yes, sorry. So, for tau pathology, some scientists believe that you want to clear plaque before you give the tau. In other words, tau may not work alone. You may need to actually combine it with lecanemab, now that we understand the biology. The thought on all these trials that are ongoing, including 080, like how -- do you think that there is a chance that they may not work because you actually need to actually clear plaque with an A-beta drug like lecanemab? Priya Singhal : Got it. So, I think I'll just step back to say that obviously, amyloid pathology is very key. We also believe that it's potentially upstream of tau pathology. And with aducanumab with -- our data with aducanumab, we did show the impact on phospho-related tau and such. So, we think that this cascade overall is going to be very important. Having said that, I think that you're right, that maybe the future of Alzheimer's disease is going to be about the timing of intervention, which I already spoke to, and that's a very different matter. But it could also be that one type of approach may not be adequate. The question here is that we're trying to be very systematic and methodical in how we approach it. So, we've now demonstrated with lecanemab that really there is the removal of aggregated plaque, which results in clinical impact. And I think Eisai has also shared earlier this year that this could result, based on data from Phase 2b and modeling, that this could result in a preservation of about two to three years before patients progress to significantly more severe stages of Alzheimer's. This is based on modeling and data from Phase 2, and I know that they have said publicly that they will also do this type of analysis with the Phase 3 data. So, I think that we are making significant progress. And then separately, we are tackling the BIIB080, which we had very encouraging results from our Phase 1b trial where we showed a dose and time-dependent reduction of tau. And we believe it addresses all forms of tau. So, now we're in the process of initiating a Phase 2. But you're absolutely right. We will be looking at many different approaches in how we can benefit patients in the best way that we can. So, yes, all biologies need to be considered, but we need to go step wise, and we need to be systematic about this. Michel Vounatsos : And if I may add on the mind share, the epidemiology is so large. There is so much to be built in terms of infrastructure that I -- we all welcome the efforts of other companies. Specifically, about lecanemab, and I know that you have engaged with scientific leaders, some of you. We have engaged with [Technical Difficulty] and clinicians. I think the feedback is very positive from what we hear. And at the end of the day, it will be the efficacy at six months and expanded over a period of 18-month study and the safety that will make the difference between the compounds. But at this stage, we welcome every effort to prepare the market for the patients in need. Operator : Your next question comes from Jay Olson with Oppenheimer. Jay Olson : Hey, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the Clarity AD results. I'm curious about the potential for your collaboration with Denali and how you plan to leverage their TV platform for A Beta antibodies, including lecanemab and ADUHELM. Now that we have positive clear DAD results, do you think better brain penetration could improve the therapeutic profile of A Beta antibodies? And what is the timeline to nominate a candidate from the TV program? Thank you. Priya Singhal : Thank you, Jay. It's a very good question. What I can share with you is that we are looking across our portfolio, and we're looking at several of our existing partnerships to see how we can actually move and build on the strength of these data and the strength of the biological hypothesis that we've seen. I can't comment more specifically on the Denali TV platform. But yes, everything is on the table. We'll be looking at everything very carefully, and we'll make announcements as they become relevant and as it's appropriate. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company. Phil Nadeau : Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. A follow-up question on the learnings from the aducanumab launch. What are Biogen's recent thoughts on lecanemab's price? Would you expect to price at a premium to ADUHELM because of better data, a discount because of the pushback? And appreciating that Eisai has final say on all commercialization decisions, what role will Biogen play in setting the price of lecanemab? Thank you. Michel Vounatsos : As you can anticipate, we cannot comment. It's Eisai's decision, and we will not interfere with this process. Operator : We'll go next to Marc Goodman with SVB Securities. Marc Goodman : Yes. Could you give us a little more color on OUS SPINRAZA, just what the dynamics were? Something about price increases or positive pricing dynamics there? And then just, Priya, can you just confirm, is the subcu dose 720 weekly, is that the one that we're going to be we're still working on the dosing regimen? Michel Vounatsos : I think your question was about ex US SPINRAZA? Marc Goodman : Yes. Michel Vounatsos : Yes, so we see two types of dynamic. We see a European momentum that is being slowed down by the launch of risdiplam. But we are sharing data on the switch from patients, patients from the U.S. from plan back to SPINRAZA for efficacy reasons. So I think -- and we are learning from the US. So it's a matter of time. We are learning from the US. We're delighted by the US results. And we believe that this becomes a model for what other continents should learn from. And ex core Europe, we see a very rapid growth in terms of volume, but the price is not the same. So this is the momentum ex US. Overall, we are delighted by the US results where we can see SPINRAZA coming back, and we believe the product will resume its momentum to grow gradually. Mike, do you want to add? Michael McDonnell : Yes. I would just add, and in the spirit of your question, Mark, was directed more at OUS. We mentioned the US was flat. And OUS overall, there was a modest decline, but if you strip out FX on a constant currency basis, there was actually growth and that growth to the points that we made in our prepared remarks, there was a modest volume decline primarily due to competition in places like Germany and Canada and Japan, and we had some timing items, Russia, Brazil, a few others, which was partially offset by volume growth in China. But we did have price increases in a few of our markets throughout Europe that more than offset the volume. So to kind of unpack it, you had modest volume declines slightly more than offset by price increases and then you had the FX going against you OUS. Priya Singhal : And I'll just wrap up really quickly on the second point. I think that your -- second question you had, Eisai has communicated that the 720-milligram weekly fixed dose is the dose that show the equivalents to intravenous dosing, 10-milligram per kg biweekly. And it's also actually now listed for the auto-injector study that was recently announced. I think that was the question. Please correct me if you had a different point in there. Marc Goodman : No, that\u2019s it. Thank you. Priya Singhal : Thank you. Marc Goodman : Yes, thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much for the questions. Can you just talk a little bit more around the dynamics about the two-week IV therapy for lecanemab as we wait for the subcu and maintenance programs? I guess, reimbursement aside, how challenging do you think this is going to be from a commercial and infrastructure standpoint? And I know you're not talking about timing, but is this a relatively short window that you envision that will be using this current dosing paradigm or could be dealing with this for an extended period of time? Thank you. Priya Singhal : Okay. So, I think overall, we've seen very good data with the 10-milligram per kg biweekly dose. I think the important point that is very, very, I think, relevant here is that the separation is seen at six months -- as early as six months, there's no titration and that expands on an absolute basis until the 18-month primary endpoint readout in Clarity AD. So, this is very encouraging data. I would say that as the infrastructure around Alzheimer's disease and all of this has been built out, it will actually be quite important for patients to be seen by physicians. So, we don't see it necessarily as a disadvantage, if that was the question. We don't see it as a disadvantage. But having said that, we are doing everything. Eisai is leading this effort, and we're trying to make sure that we are keeping patient convenience in mind, which is the premise of the subcutaneous development. So, I can't comment beyond that on how long it will be intravenous and when would it transition to subcutaneous. But we're looking at all these aspects very carefully at a high level and also at a granular level as we build out the clinical development program with all these topics in mind. So, overall, we believe in the early stages, it will actually be really important for patients to be seen in the clinic every two weeks. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Matteis with Stifel. Paul Matteis : Great. Thanks so much. I was wondering, based on your experience in the field with ADUHELM, how would you characterize infusion capacity today in neurology clinics ahead of the lecanemab launch? Where is it today? And how much ramp up do you think needs to happen for there to be materially broader access over time? Michel Vounatsos : So what we saw for ADUHELM is that the system has shown some adaptability by shifting some of the existing infusion center to potentially ADUHELM at that time should there be reimbursement. We never got reimbursement, so this never happened. And overall, I believe there is a need to upscale and the capacity has to be much larger. But from our learning, we could see that the system was flexible and adaptable based on the current capacity. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : Good morning, guys. Thanks so much for the questions. Just a follow-up on lecanemab launch spending. Post the restructuring that you guys had earlier this year, can you talk a little bit about the manufacturing assets that you can redeploy or maybe some of the commercial investments that you made for ADUHELM that can be reallocated for the lecanemab launch? I'm just trying to get a sense for kind of the magnitude of \u2013 of the spend versus the adoption over the course of next year. Michel Vounatsos : Mike? Michael McDonnell : Yes. So a couple of comments, Geoff. Thanks for the question. I would say first on manufacturing, we have a significant facility in Raleigh, North Carolina and then we have a relatively new facility in Solothurn Switzerland. And the Solothurn Switzerland facility will be largely dedicated to our Alzheimer's disease products, which for now involves a ramp-up of getting inventory ready for launch for lecanemab. I think we had a little over $100 million of inventory on hand as of the end of the quarter. And the -- that facility, it's efficiency, so to speak, is heavily tied to the lecanemab launch. And then to the extent that ADUHELM becomes more marketable, we could utilize that facility as well. So that's the state of play there. There will be some idle capacity. You saw about $12 million this quarter. There'll be some idle capacity charges that we'll have to incur over time as that product ramps. I would say on the commercial infrastructure, there's not a lot that cane [ph] will be repurposed from ADUHELM. We did make the decision, as we've said before, to take that infrastructure down. It was just too long of a time gap from the time that we received the NCD in April of 2022 to when lecanemab would become fully commercialized to maintain that infrastructure. So most of that's been eliminated as part of our $1 billion cost savings that we've committed. And so for the most part, the lecanemab, commercialization will be a new ramp and a new infrastructure that will be built. End of Q&A: Mike Hencke : That concludes our call for this morning.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Call and Business Update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there\u2019ll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hencke, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Hencke, you may begin your conference. Mike Hencke : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Biogen's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including our GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today.  Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables one and two, and Table four includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I'd like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our expectations. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I'm joined by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Christopher Viehbacher, Dr. Priya Singhal, Head of Development; and our CFO, Mike McDonnell. [Operator Instructions]. I'll now turn the call over to Chris. Christopher Viehbacher : Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. It's a pleasure to welcome you here today. This is my first earnings call since joining Biogen. Now, clearly, Biogen has a strong legacy as one of the pioneers in biotechnology, and there's clearly a strong foundation to build upon. Equally, there's an urgent need to restore growth to the company. We have a great opportunity ahead with a potential launch of two important near-term launches with Alzheimer's and depression, and we have several pipeline programs. We'll be covering a lot more about how we intend to return to growth. But first, I'd like to turn this over to Mike and invite Mike to provide an overview of the fourth quarter and full year financial results. Michael McDonnell : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. So I will provide some highlights of the financial performance for the fourth quarter and any financial comparisons that you hear me make will be versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Our total revenue for the fourth quarter was $2.5 billion, and that's a decrease of 7% at actual currency and 4% at constant currency. Non-GAAP diluted EPS in the fourth quarter was $4.05, and that's an increase of 19% versus the fourth quarter of 2021. MS product revenue was $1.3 billion, and that's a decrease of 17% at actual currency and 14% at constant currency. And this decline was primarily due to the impact of TECFIDERA generics as well as continued declines in the Interferons and some pricing pressure. We have continued to see a number of the TECFIDERA generics launch across multiple European countries, and we expect a decision from the European Court of Justice related to our market protection by March 16 of this year. Separately, we do continue to enforce our recently granted European TECFIDERA dosing patent, which expires in 2028.  We also continue to enforce our IP for TYSABRI. We have sued Polpharma and Sandoz to enforce those rights that have moved for a preliminary injunction against the launch of Sandoz and Polpharmas biosimilar in the United States. Regarding potential supply constraints for VUMERITY, we believe that we have resolved previously reported manufacturing issues at our contract manufacturer. We're currently in the process of securing regulatory approvals for a secondary source of supply, and we do not anticipate a supply shortage in 2023. Moving now to SMA. Global SPINRAZA revenue was $459 million, and that's a 4% increase in actual currency and 10% at constant currency. In the United States, SPINRAZA revenue increased by 5% versus the prior year, and we continue to believe that we may be seeing signs of stabilization. Outside of the U.S., revenue increased 4% at actual currency and 12% at constant currency, with continued growth primarily in our Asian markets, and that was partially offset by competition in Europe. Biosimilars revenue was $175 million, and that's a 21% decline in actual currency and 15% at constant currency. And that's due to continued pricing pressure and some net pricing adjustments during the quarter. Total anti-CD20 revenue of $448 million was up 8% versus the prior year. Revenue from OCREVUS royalties increased 19%, which was partially offset by a revenue decline of 14% related to our profit share on RITUXAN. The RITUXAN decline was due to biosimilar competition. Regarding expenses, for the fourth quarter, non-GAAP cost of sales was $571 million, which is 22% of revenue and that includes $36 million of idle capacity charges. Eisai's share of these charges is reflected as part of the collaboration profit sharing line, and that is not part of cost of sales. Fourth quarter non-GAAP R&D expense was $602 million, and this compared to $700 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the fourth quarter of 2021 included approximately $110 million in payments related to some business development transactions. Non-GAAP SG&A was $632 million, and this compared to $785 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, and this decrease in SG&A expense was driven primarily by our previously announced cost savings initiatives. We remain on track to achieve our previously announced $1 billion in cost savings initiatives, and I'll comment on this a bit further when I discuss our guidance for 2023. As for our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $5.6 billion in cash and marketable securities. We had $6.3 billion in debt and roughly $700 million in net debt. And as a reminder, we expect to receive an additional $1.25 billion over the next 15 months from the sale of our equity stake in Samsung Bioepis and that includes approximately $813 million, which is due in April of this year. So overall, we remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial capacity to invest in growing the business over time. Later in the call, I will discuss our guidance assumptions as well as some important accounting considerations for 2023. But for now, I will turn the call back to Chris. Christopher Viehbacher : Thank you, Mike. Biogen has recently celebrated its 45th anniversary, and this is a company that has really been built on multiple sclerosis. It had some hemophilia products until it was spun-off as Bioverativ, some of you may recall that in the past, and we have SPINRAZA. So now we really need to think about how do we transform the business? I know firsthand from talking to a number of neurologists that our products in MS are still considered to be the top products. But obviously, this is becoming a much more competitive environment. And therefore, we really need to think about how do we grow the business in the future. Now we have an amazing opportunity with two new products. And as many of you know, I've been in this business a long time, and it's pretty rare that you have this opportunity to launch not one but two major products and not just any products, but products that are really quite transformative in their respective therapeutic areas, and that's obviously the LEQEMBI and zuranolone. We also have existing products. We can still grow VUMERITY. We can still grow SPINRAZA. And I think we need to take a fresh approach to those and try to reinvigorate the growth of those two brands. As many of you will point out to me, Biogen has a cost base that is probably higher than most of its peers. And we need to think about that much more systematically. And some of that may require a reduction in cost. Some of it is actually a realignment with the new growth alternatives. And then we also need to look at the R&D pipeline. Now we don't get very much credit for what we have in R&D, and Priya is going to talk to you about a number of different products that we think have an awful lot of potential. Equally, the neurology franchise is [technical difficulty] slowly progressing diseases. That means you're automatically into long-term and costly clinical studies. And in addition, we have some projects in there where our Phase III studies are essentially proof-of-concept studies. And so that makes them also inherently riskier. And I think we need to think about how do we balance the pipeline in R&D going forward. And finally, I think we should always be -- any company should always be open to thinking about external growth opportunities. This hasn't always been a major thrust of the company in the past. But I do think that as we expand into other areas such as immunology, rare diseases, psychiatry, that there may be opportunities to bolster those franchises through external growth. So as you know, LEQEMBI has received accelerated approval in the United States in early January. We have, on the same day, filed for a full or traditional approval. And I have to also give credit to our partner, Eisai because within a very short period of time, not only did they file for traditional approval on the same day as receiving accelerated approval but also within weeks, they have filed in, in Europe, in Japan and initiated a rolling submission in China. And obviously, in the short term, the launch in the U.S. is really going to be constricted until we get reimbursement, and that's expected to occur once we have a traditional approval. When we get to confirmation of filing from the FDA, at that point, we'll know whether we have a priority review or not. Under the terms of the agreement, Eisai is principally responsible and leads all of the discussions with CMS. As many of you probably have heard, Eisai has said that they are hoping to receive a broader reimbursement once they get traditional approval and that could be as early as this summer. But as you know, this is not a round like pill that we're launching here. You need to have a PET scan or a lumbar puncture to confirm diagnosis. We're going to have infusion capacity restrictions. Neurologists have already been busy treating patients with other conditions. So there will be a question about do we have enough neurologists to expand the patient population? And so there's an awful lot to be done in the near term. In terms of the -- one of the questions that comes up is -- and that will be the main discussion for CMS. To me, the sum of boxes, the CDR-sum of boxes is not really how we look at patient benefit here. As I talk to physicians treating Alzheimer's patients, most of them are really asking, can I still drive a car? Can I feed myself? Can I dress myself? Can I enjoy life with my family? And how can I not be a burden to others? And when you actually look at the activities of daily life, we actually saw a 37% improvement versus placebo. And to me, that's where the real benefit of this product is. Now as we look at Alzheimer's, the other message I think I would really like to drive home today is that this is not just a product launch, there is it today and there is a tomorrow. And certainly, today, everybody is going to be focused on the initial sales of LEQEMBI and that's going to be a question of overcoming some of the infrastructure challenges that we just talked about. There's going to be an awful lot of education of physicians around safety, around the diagnosis and the infrastructure has to expand to be able to provide the PET scans or the CSF testing. But this is really opening up a whole new field. This is a whole new vista, both for patients and physicians. I can remember 10 years ago, where we've had a lot of failures of medicines in development to reduce amyloid. People had given up hope that this was going to be effective. Actually, it was Biogen's PRIME study that was initiated about 10 years ago that actually showed that there was still hope for this. And of course, it's really the CLARITY study that has really demonstrated the importance of removal of plaque and the potential to impact the decline in cognition. And what I think this is going to do is unleash a whole wave of research and development, but there's going to be other things. I mean just even things that we're doing. Obviously, there's amyloid, but there are going to be other modalities such as tau, and Priya will talk about our own potential solution in terms of tau. But we're also looking at this -- the trial really focused on this 18 months of treatment. What happens at the end of the 18 months? And there are actually already data that indicate staying on drug has a continued benefit. And so in fact, Eisai will be filing before the end of Q4 of this year, an indication for the treatment on a maintenance basis. But one of the other most interesting things I learned, and I've been obviously trying to get up to speed on Alzheimer's over the last 90 days, but it turns out that plaque burden is at its maximum just before symptoms arise. So imagine the benefit if we could actually go earlier and in fact, there is a study called ahead that is looking at a preclinical or presymptomatic patients that could be quite interesting. But to do that, of course, other things like blood-based biomarkers or another biomarkers are going to be important. We're going to have to make this a lot more convenient as a treatment and there's subcutaneous treatment formulations in progress. And so what I think you're going to see is just a flood of information over the next three to five years, as new modalities and new ways of treating Alzheimer's patients come up. So here, you see the AHEAD study that was launched in 2020 and looking at presymptomatic. One of the physicians who treat Alzheimer has told me, we used to think about Alzheimer's as a 7- to 8-year timeframe, which was really from the onset of symptoms until sadly death. Now they're looking at this on a 25-year frame because we know that plaque builds up over time. And in fact, what we call early-stage Alzheimer's today or with this mild cognitive improvement, it's really not. It's actually already pretty advanced by the time you have MCI. We already talked about the potential for maintenance dosing and different modalities. So this is going to be quite an exciting area, as we go along. Now the other exciting areas in major depressive disorder. And there are 21 million people who suffer from this. And every day, you're reading about the major concerns around mental health and society. In fact, STEP [ph] just had an article yesterday about the number of younger people who are suffering from depression and feeling sad and even suicidal. And so there is a clear need for new treatments. There are over 400 million prescriptions written every year for MDD and other medical health. But what we see is an awful lot of switching between therapies. There's a lot of concern around side effects. It takes a long time for these new medicine -- these existing medicines to work. And so my personal view is there's an awful lot of unmet need. I was at GlaxoSmithKline when we had Paxil and we had So I'm pretty familiar with what the existing treatments can and cannot do. Postpartum depression, another significant area of unmet need, one in eight mothers, we just had a tragic case, as many of us in the Boston area following, and it just demonstrates that there is a real need for a new approach and new treatment here. And this is not necessarily where a big commercial opportunity is, but there is a major societal need and I think that zuranolone can make a big change here. So we have had a priority review granted, and we have now a PDUFA date in August. As you know, we can't launch immediately because it will have to be a DAA review of the scheduling of the drug before we can launch. So we're looking to launch more towards the end of the year. One of the interesting things is I see this every now and then in the media about the controversial data of zuranolone because six out of seven trials were positive. Folks, when we were developing Paxil years ago, we had to do six Phase III studies to get to that worked. There's an incredible placebo effect here, which is why so many companies actually abandon mental health. So when I saw six out of seven, I said, \"Well, this is absolutely terrific. And so I think there is quite an exciting opportunity here.\" We're not going to early go after every type of patient, and we're doing a lot of mid-market research. Today, we're finishing the SHORELINE study and that will inform us about who's the right patient for this. And obviously, the label will inform who we are interested. But there's a lot of unresolved symptoms of depression out there. MDD patients with elevated anxiety, we won't clearly have an anxiety indication, but that is an area of MDD patients that we're going to be focusing on and those who are adherence-challenged. Going back to existing drugs. I'll just say, obviously, Biogen had enormous success with SPINRAZA. But when you look at it, there are still a lot of potential patients that have been treated adult patients as well as pediatric patients. And we're going to have a fresh look at how we can improve the coverage of this product. Obviously, it's an intrathecal product, which is not necessarily the most convenient. You may have seen we've just done a collaboration with Alcyone to have a new device that would make this more convened for patients who are not wanting to go through the numerous lumbar punctures. We are looking at costs, that's looking at the profitability of our MS franchise. Can we shift some of these costs to supporting our new product launches. We have a biosimilars business, an important business. This is part of the way that we create the economies for the health care system for new businesses, but we are looking at whether we can do more with that business or maybe whether others could on this business. We're prioritizing the near-term opportunities and really looking at our cost base on a systematic basis. Priya is going to talk about the risk profile and productivity of the R&D pipeline. As I mentioned earlier, we have appointed Priya as Head of Development, I'd like to take the opportunity to congratulate her on that. We're also looking for a new Head of Research. While we have a lot going on, continue to evaluate external growth opportunities. And so I think with that, Priya, why don't we talk about R&D? Priya Singhal : Thank you, Chris. We are advancing LEQEMBI with Eisai as a foothold in Alzheimer's disease, as you heard from Chris, and zuranolone with Sage, both as key late-stage assets, but also as growth drivers. With Sage, we also announced the FDA acceptance of zuranolone in MDD and PPD as priority review. The PDUFA date is August 5. The priority review is granted by FDA to applications for medicines that, if approved, would provide significant improvements in the effectiveness or safety of the treatment diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. Beyond these developments, we're also making progress across R&D reprioritization, and today, I will share a few highlights from some of our pipeline programs in Alzheimer's disease, lupus and ALS. We are advancing a broader Alzheimer's disease pipeline, as you heard from Chris, and we have initiated the Phase II CELIA study of BIIB080 in early Alzheimer's disease. Prior clinical results, including those from our own Phase II Gosuranemab suggests that targeting extracellular tau alone is insufficient to affect intracellular tau tangle. BIIB080 is targeting tau mRNA to reduce all forms of the tau protein post translation. In preclinical studies, we've seen that ASO knockdown of the tau in the transgenic mouse model of neurodegenerative tauopathy, reversed tau pathology, prevented hippocampal volume loss and neuronal death. This year illustrates the Phase Ib study results of BIIB080 in mild AD. BIIB080 was generally well tolerated, and we observed a time and dose-dependent reduction in CSF total and p-tau. Total tau continued to decline 16 weeks following the last dose with a 50% reduction from baseline. We were encouraged by this early data, and we look forward to sharing data details from this Ib study at ADPD next month. As I mentioned, we have initiated our Phase II CELIA study in 2022. It includes several dosing paradigms : 3 doses and every 12 or 24 weeks dosing. And assessments will evaluate multiple aspects of Alzheimer's disease, cognition, function and biomarkers. We believe that CELIA has the potential to generate important learnings regarding the role of tau in Alzheimer's disease. Moving on. Biogen has leveraged a very strong scientific expertise in immunology, and this is how the MS franchise was born. I'd like to discuss our two Phase III lupus programs next. First is Dapirolizumab Pegol, which we have in collaboration with UCB currently in Phase III. We also have Litifilimab or BIIB059, our wholly owned anti-BDCA2 monoclonal antibody. Both are potential first-in-class molecules in SLE. SLE is an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs and can lead to severe organ damage and morbidity, especially amongst the non-Caucasian patients. Litifilimab also has the potential to be a first-in-class treatment for CLE. CLE or cutaneous lupus erythematosus is a skin-based autoimmune disease and can exist in the absence of systemic manifestations. Chronic CLE is associated with severe skin damage and impaired quality of life. No new treatment approved specifically for CLE in almost 17 years. The CLE part of the Phase II LILAC study met its primary endpoint, and the results were published last summer in the New England Journal of Medicine. Based upon these encouraging results, we initiated the Phase II/III AMETHYST study of litifilimab in CLE.  Lupus disproportionately impacts underrepresented populations, and we have set enrollment targets in litifilimab studies to reflect this high prevalence in African-American and Hispanic or Latino community. Next, I will discuss ALS. ALS is a devastating progressive neurodegenerative disease. SOD1-ALS is an ultra-rare genetic form that affects approximately 330 individuals in the U.S. While the VALOR Phase III study of tofersen in SOD1-ALS did not hit the primary endpoint, we have published our 12-month data from both VALOR and its open-label extension in the New England Journal of Medicine last year. In these results, we observed a sustained reduction in neurofilament, which is a marker of axonal injury and neurodegeneration in individuals who initiated to person earlier. We also observed a slower decline in measures of clinical and respiratory function as well as strength and quality of life. With the PDUFA action date of April 25, 2023, Biogen has the potential to deliver rapidly targeted therapy to people suffering from SOD1-ALS. FDA recently announced the March 22, 2023, date for the advisory community meeting for tofersen. EMA has accepted the marketing authorization application for tofersen for review in the European Union. Moving on. At a higher level, as Chris mentioned, our goal is to rebalance the R&D pipeline. In this context, we have developed a framework to guide our decision-making and the focus is on the pre-proof-of-concept programs. For example, we are investing to win in programs where we have a high degree of biological confidence, such as BIIB080, while we continue to apply a systemic, systematic data-driven approach in this program to learn and derisk. We may also choose to discontinue development for some programs based on their regulatory development or commercialization challenges. Examples of recently discontinuous programs include vixotrigine in neuropathic pain and oral ibrutinib in MS. In parallel, we have several focus areas to help increase the productivity of our pipeline and decrease the risk. First is to derisk and improve probability of success in the pre-proof-of-concept portfolio. Second is to enhance the roll-off and capabilities for translational science and importantly, our overall focus on value generation versus achievement of operational milestones alone. In conclusion, with key assets in Alzheimer's disease, the precious and lupus, we believe the Biogen pipeline has potential to deliver significant growth over the medium and long term.  I will now pass the call over back to Mike. Michael McDonnell : So thank you, Priya. I will now go through our 2023 guidance ranges and talk about some of the key assumptions and then we'll open it up for questions. We expect a full year 2023 revenue decline in the mid-single-digit percentage range as compared to 2022 reported results and full year 2023 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of between $15 and $16. There are several dynamics that we expect in 2023 that I'd like to highlight. First, our guidance assumes a favorable decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union relating to regulatory data protection for TECFIDERA. And that's currently expected to be on March 16, as I mentioned earlier of this year, although we obviously cannot predict the outcome of that.  This guidance also assumes modest in-market revenue for LEQEMBI in 2023, with commercial expenses -- commercialization expenses exceeding revenue, and Biogen will record its share of net commercial profits and losses for LEQEMBI in the U.S. as a component of total revenue, and we do expect this to be a headwind to our revenue in 2023. Just as a reminder, in 2022, we amended our collaboration agreement with Eisai for ADUHELM and as a result, we will have sole decision-making and commercialization rights, along with a substantial majority of the economics beginning in 2023. Eisai will receive a tiered royalty and will no longer share in expenses related to ADUHELM, and this does result in two important considerations for 2023. First, we expect to incur approximately $150 million to $200 million of excess capacity charges in 2023, and all of that will be borne by Biogen. In 2022, we incurred $119 million of idle capacity. And of that amount, $55 million was reimbursed by Eisai. Our cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be higher in 2023 than the 22.4% that we saw in 2022, and that's as a result of product mix as well as the dynamic that I just described. We expect this pressure on cost of goods sold to be particularly pronounced earlier in the year. The second result of the amended agreement with Eisai is that we will no longer be sharing ADUHELM R&D costs, and this is expected to create an increase of approximately $100 million in R&D expense in 2023 as compared to 2022. Full year operating expenses, which are comprised of both SG&A and R&D expense will reflect our previously disclosed $1 billion of cost reduction measures, and we expect that approximately $300 million of these cost savings will be reinvested to support the launch of zuranolone and other new products. So we expect that this will result in $700 million of net operating expense savings relative to full year 2021 operating expenses, which were approximately $5.2 billion. We are continuing to monitor potential supply constraints for IMRALDI, and our guidance does not assume any stock outs, but this does remain a risk. There are also some key seasonality dynamics that we'd like to note. As a reminder, Q1 tends to be seasonally weaker quarter as compared to Q4 for our MS business in the U.S., and that's due to channel dynamics and the higher discounts and allowances. SPINRAZA benefited in Q4 of 2022 in part due to the timing of some shipments. And additionally, as a reminder, the royalty rate for OCREVUS resets at the beginning of each year in this rate increases as sales levels increased throughout the year. We also expect that our operating expenses will be higher earlier in the year given that some of our cost savings initiatives will take time to materialize over the course of 2023. And of course, as always, we assume that foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2022, will remain in effect for the year, net of our hedging activities. And I would refer you to our press release for other important guidance assumptions. Before concluding, I want to highlight a few of the key accounting considerations for LEQEMBI and zuranolone. And now that LEQEMBI has received accelerated approval in the United States, Biogen's 50% share of net commercial profits and losses, which includes in-market revenue less cost of goods, royalties and SG&A will be reflected as a component of total revenue. As I mentioned, we expect this to be negative in 2023 as we expect that commercial expenses will exceed revenue. Outside the U.S., our 50% share of commercial expenses will continue to be recorded within SG&A expense until LEQEMBI is approved on a region-by-region basis. Separately, Biogen's 50% share of global LEQEMBI R&D expenditures will continue to be reflected within R&D expense, and this is both before and after approval. And finally, on LEQEMBI, Biogen is manufacturing the LEQEMBI drug substance in our Switzerland facility, we capitalized inventory until it is sold to Eisai at which point we will recognize contract manufacturing revenue and contract manufacturing cost of goods sold, and that will be at a minimal gross margin. Zuranolone is also a 50-50 profit share in the U.S. with our partner Sage Therapeutics. Prior to regulatory approval, we will record our share of R&D and SG&A expense in their respective line items net of reimbursement to or from Sage. After U.S. approval, Biogen will record 100% of zuranolone product revenue, cost of goods and SG&A., and then we will share Sage's 50% of profits or losses as a component of Biogen's collaboration profit-sharing line.  So in closing, our number one goal is to return Biogen to sustainable growth. We believe that the potential launches of LEQEMBI and zuranolone, along with the rest of our pipeline and our strong balance sheet, provide us with the necessary elements to achieve this goal. And we are also working very hard to improve our operating efficiency and remain committed to creating long-term value for our shareholders. And with that, we'll open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Salveen Richter of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Salveen Richter : Good morning. And thank you for taking my question here. Maybe a question of whether you can lay out potential timelines for the NCD reconsideration for LEQEMBI? Historical precedent suggests this could take about nine months. But when is the soonest this process could start? Could it start approval? And when will we know when the process has been initiated? Thank you. Christopher Viehbacher : Yes, thanks for the question. Look, I'm not so sure, first of all, that precedent is going to really matter here. I think this is an unusual set of circumstances. And -- so there are negotiations and discussions ongoing between Eisai and CMS today. CMS could decide whatever, but the feeling is, is that they're going to wait until there is a traditional approval and then we'll see. Will there be a registry, won't there be a registry, we just don't know at this stage? What I would say is that I think you're seeing a much different tone in the broader community than we had with ADUHELM. You've seen the American Association of Neurologists write to CMS to support reimbursement. You've seen members of Congress, I can tell you that the neurology community look at -- broadly look at the CLARITY data as being very compelling in terms of the impact. Obviously, CMS makes its own decisions. But I think there's a growing consensus that this is a medicine that is very much needed by a broad population, and Eisai has guided to their hope that there would be this broader reimbursement once they have traditional approval. Operator : Our next question comes from the line comes from the line of Mohit Bansal of Wells Fargo. Mohit Bansal : Great. Thank you for picking my question. Maybe a question on expense cuts. So I know earlier this year, you talked about expense cuts. And I mean, if you do the math, it's very clear that for the product portfolio, the expense base is very high. Can you talk about -- I mean have you thought about your target operating margin profile long term? And how much more cuts can you do? And any timelines when we could hear about this? Because you also talked about almost $200 million of spend here. You said that you will probably prioritize and figure out whether you want to keep spending that money or not. So can you talk a little bit about the timelines of that now that you are in the business review more? Thank you. Christopher Viehbacher : In OpEx, you've got two big buckets, right? You've got R&D and you've got SG&A. In R&D, we are looking at this whole prioritization exercise. And that means if you want to save money to a degree you have to -- you may have to cut some programs. And that's not something that you want to do quickly. You need to go and look at each program thoroughly, determine probabilities of success, cost to complete a whole bunch of other things. There is an infrastructure element to R&D that we will be looking at as a matter of priority. And then you have SG&A and within the sales and marketing, obviously, most of that spend is really going to the MS franchise. Now the MS franchise still supports most of our revenue in the business. And so one has to be careful about how much we want to reduce that spend by, but clearly, that's a declining revenue base. And so I think what you're really going to see is a shift from some of those resources to supporting the launch. Now there's hundreds of millions of dollars going between Eisai, Sage and Biogen behind the prelaunch activities this year for LEQEMBI and zuranolone. And those are obviously strategic products for all of the companies, and we really need to support the launches. But we have to be find the right balance and not seeing a decline in MS sales beyond what we already see. And then there is G&A, and we will be taking a close look at that this year. So you're going to see some reductions in cost, but there's also going to be some new investments. And so it's a little hard to say at this point where we're going to end up on margins. But if you strip out the royalty and collaboration income and do the OpEx to sales ratios, we're clearly higher than most of our peer companies. And considering that we have a fairly mature product profile of high volume -- of high-value, low-volume products, we should be more profitable. But the company has already taken $1 billion out. So that means more cost savings have to be done thoughtfully. So we'll be giving you updates throughout the year on that. But we are conscious that the cost base needs to be more productive than it is. On ADUHELM, ADUHELM will see -- we will be looking at the EMBARK data, which is long term, that will give some information about not just for ADUHELM, but also how we think about the longer-term treatment of amyloid-reducing antibodies. There, we also need to see exactly what the landscape is. What I can tell you is, there is no commercial effort behind ADUHELM. Our focus is on LEQEMBI. We believe that is the product that is most appropriate for patients. We do have a commitment to the FDA to do this confirmatory study, so we have to think through that carefully. But I just want to be clear that from a strategic point of view LEQEMBI is our absolute priority and ADUHELM is not being actively commercialized anywhere. Operator : Our next question comes from Colin Bristow of UBS. Please go ahead. Colin Bristow : Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. One for Chris. In terms of your ongoing review of the business and the pipeline, how should we be thinking about timelines just in terms of the potential for strategic actions with ADUHELM? And then just more broadly in terms of business development, when you're sort of clearly identified the targets that would be potentially willing to move forward? And then just within this question, could you just characterize your ongoing interest in biosimilars? Thank you. Christopher Viehbacher : So, on R&D, again, you have a number of projects that have been ongoing for a number of years. We have a number of products actually in Phase III that are actually proof-of-concept studies. There are at least -- not even including ADUHELM, we have three products in development where we did not have safety or efficacy data out of a positive Phase II. So, I think we need to think carefully about each of those programs. It does take some time, and there is always a question of, well, how much do we have to spend to the next milestone? And is that really worth it? Can we think about different ways of doing the study? Can we derisk these? So that will probably take us through to the summer before I think we can really make too many decisions on that front. Biosimilars, it's an extremely strong team, and they've built a successful business, but I look at Biogen as a company with innovative medicines. We're not a huge company by any means, and there needs to be a focus. So, we are looking at what's the right business model for it. It is a successful business. It's an important business for society. But we need to think about where we put our resources. When you look at the cost base, it's not just a question I found in the company about how much we spend, but how we spend it. And there have been a number of pet projects around and other areas where we're spending money. And I think one of the things I'm really trying to drive is focus in the company. What really matters, what's going to grow the business and how do we align our resources behind that? And whatever is not one of the major growth drivers, I think we have to look carefully at and whether we continue to either to support that business with resources or we think about other options for some of those businesses. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat of Evercore. Umer Raffat : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch up on the infusion capacity a little bit in a little more detail. I feel like we've talked about it several times that infrastructure needs to be built out, but could we quantify, for example, of the 100,000 patients number mentioned in some of the prior press releases for year three, how much of that exists today?  And could you take an interim look in your ongoing early AD study where you have a monthly arm to perhaps update the label towards monthly. Could that happen in cans? Christopher Viehbacher : So, on the capacity, obviously, Biogen had worked quite -- made quite a bit of progress on that for the launch of ADUHELM. And so, I would say we're probably in better shape today than when we were at the launch of ADUHELM. Nonetheless, it's not like there are a lot of empty infusion centers waiting for Alzheimer's patients today. So, there is going to have to be continued investment, and it will take time. And I think one of the reasons that we have guided to 100,000 patients is that it's just going to -- they're going to be constraints to the system. There's not a lot of point talking about what's the potential, how many Alzheimer's patients out there and how many are eligible, there are natural constraints to this. There's also going to have to be a careful selection of patients as to who's really the best patient to benefit from this treatment and physicians will take their time to understand this new therapy and get experience with the drug. So, it's going to be slow, steady progress. I can't give you -- I wouldn't want to comment today on how many sites, but it is something that is obviously a major part of this launch. That's why I say it's not really a round white tablet as the launch. Mike Hencke : And I think the other question was around potentially less frequent maintenance dosing the timeline for that. Priya, do you want to comment? Priya Singhal : Sure. So yes, exactly right, Chris. I think we've also -- we also think that some of this infusion capacity could be elastic, and we'll have early learnings. So, I think as you said, we'll learn as we go. Two points here. One is that Eisai is already leading on developing a maintenance therapy. And this could be either a four week or a 12-week dosing paradigm. They have said publicly that they will file for this by Q1 2024. That's important. The other aspect, I think, that is also in development is a subcutaneous formulation. And I think we are -- Eisai and Biogen are thinking about what burden it would -- a product like LEQEMBI have and how do we solve that for patients as well as providers, and that is really the strategy behind the subcutaneous development. It's being studied currently in a Phase III sub-study, and it will also be filed by Q1 2024 as Eisai has communicated. So, I think we're trying to work from multiple perspectives here, and we'll share more updates as they become relevant. Operator : Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman of BMO. Please go ahead. Evan Seigerman : Okay. Thanks for taking my question. So, Chris, in your remarks, you highlighted a shift in business development, whereas in the past, Biogen may have been more hesitant to acquire, where would you like to focus BD? And what size deals would you be comfortable with? Thank you. Christopher Viehbacher : From a management point of view, you have to think about what is your -- what's your team good at? And what's interesting about Biogen is it's been a very narrowly focused company. They've been very good on what has been done in multiple sclerosis, for example, but you have to think carefully about how broadly you go because we are extremely good at selling high-value, low-volume products. And even as we contemplate the zuranolone launch, we are going to be going to a much broader population. We're probably going to have a lot more patient outreach. I think Biogen has done exactly on television commercial in its history. And that's something we're going to have to get good at. So, as you think about business development, you have to think about, okay, you can potentially look at things on paper, but can you execute well on them? Now when I look at it, I say, I'd like to be a little bit broader than the traditional neurodegenerative diseases because I don't want to abandon them by any means, but if your only business is that, you are really destined to do these long-term studies that are highly costly and often the Phase III becomes the proof of concept because you can't really test these things adequately in Phase II. And so, if I sort of say, \"Well, where could we legitimately go? Where do we have some experience?\" Well, we can certainly be because I would argue that things like lupus, where we already are, even multiple sclerosis is really an autoimmune disease. So, I can see us branching out more into immunology. Psychiatry will have one product in the bag with zuranolone. Would it make sense to expand more into psychiatry? And obviously, with SPINRAZA, when we look at how do we get more out of SPINRAZA? When you're in the rare disease business, it's different than most other businesses. Most other therapeutic areas, you go see a physician because the patients go to the physician. In rare diseases, you have to go find the patient. I remember at Genzyme, someone the marketing teaching me very early on that the marketing strategy is looking for needles in haystack. And that actually becomes a core competency. And that's one of the areas that we have to go after. We've done an awful lot of easier-to-find patients who are more serious and are naturally visiting physicians. But there are, for instance, adult patients who are difficult to diagnose. And so, looking at increasing the patient numbers means that we're going to have to be good at rare diseases. And once you have that core competency in my view, you can be in rare disease and you can be therapy or indication-agnostic in that area. So that's where we're starting because I think we can execute in those areas. Could that be acquisition, could be late stage in licensing. We could look at all of the above. And I -- look, Biogen hasn't necessarily looked at acquisitions as part of its growth strategy. Equally, I tell people, there wasn't a lot of point hiring me if you don't want to go do deals. So not to say we are, but I think there is now an openness within the company to at least look at it. Now as we all know; M&A is hard to execute on and get something that is truly accretive and generates a return on investment. And that's why we are really focused, first and foremost, on driving the most that we can out of organic growth. But I would say that we are open to anything in those four areas that I mentioned before. Michael McDonnell : And I'll just quickly add, Evan, to your question on size of deals, without commenting on how large a deal we might do or a series of deals just in terms of aggregate capacity. As we mentioned up front, we ended year with $5.6 billion in cash, we have more coming in from Samsung in the early second quarter of this year, and we have a modest amount of debt. So, you can pretty quickly get to a close to better part of $10 billion of capacity number that we can utilize in a variety of ways. Christopher Viehbacher : [indiscernible] point out the amount of money we're getting still from Samsung on the yet to come in? Michael McDonnell : Yes, $800 million that's coming in April and then another $400 million-plus that will come in next year. Christopher Viehbacher : Firepower is not necessarily the main constraint finding something that's worthwhile doing is the really hard part of this. Operator : We will now move to Tim Anderson of Wolfe Research. Tim Anderson : Thank you. A couple of questions on LEQEMBI and the subcu. Can you just confirm what the minimum regulatory requirements are for approval of a subcu in terms of what you need to show in the data you're currently capturing? And do you think there's any meaningful risk in gathering that necessary data? To me, the long-term commercial future of the brand really hinges on having a subcu, and I'm trying to gauge whether there's any meaningful risk that we should be cognizant of? Thank you. Priya Singhal : I can take that. Thanks for that question. I think overall, I just want to reiterate that Eisai is starting subcutaneous in the Phase III open-label extension. And actually, details of that sub study are public. You can take a look at that. Eisai has also communicated that they believe that they have had the regulatory discussions to EMBARK upon this pathway. But beyond that, it would be speculative to say what are the minimum requirements. I think we do have regulatory discussions ongoing and a lot, as you know, is always dependent on the data as it gets generated. Overall, Eisai has communicated that they will -- they expect to file by Q1 2024. And then stepping back to what is the true potential. We -- I'll just draw us back to the data that we saw from the Clarity AD study, which was, of course, utilizing the intravenous bimonthly dosing regimen. I think the most important part there was that we saw the amyloid reduction at six months expanding over the 18-month period, we had a positive primary endpoint with a highly statistically significant p-value as well as all the secondary end points.  So, we believe that really Clarity AD is quite clear in its outcome, and we believe that the data are meaningful and can have an impact on the patient population. The subcutaneous formulation is really our approach to kind of thinking about this more comprehensively. So, we believe as is it has a lot of potential and then, of course, we'll continue to build on what is the dosing, maintenance dosing as well as subcutaneous. And as Chris mentioned, what is the application of an anti-amyloid therapy in presymptomatic or preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Christopher Viehbacher : Tim, the way I look at this is, I think what we're going to see over time is that you're going to have a plaque removal phase of treatment and then a maintenance. And in the short term, we can talk about potential for subcu, but really, I would say for the next two to three years, the demand for the product is probably more limited by capacity of the system to actually diagnose and treat patients. So, an IV will be a port for the convenience of patients, but I'm not sure that short-term, it's really going to have that much impact on demand. One game-changer, I think, to me is blood biomarkers. If we can eliminate the PET scans and in particular or the lumbar puncture, this will make it a whole lot easier for the whole medical community to at least get the diagnosis, and we can probably reduce the overall treatment cost of a patient. Those blood biomarkers have been around for some time, but until there was a treatment, there wasn't a commercial market for those diagnostics. So, to me, the biggest game-changer that could occur is if we can get some of these blood diagnostics to market sooner. It's -- they're probably still a couple of years away. But there is important, in my mind, commercially as a subcu. Operator : We will now take your question from Brian Abrahams of RBC Capital Markets. Brian Abrahams : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On LEQEMBI, as you consider the maintenance therapy, what's the right way we should be thinking about the potential balance of annual per patient price declines versus the potential for market expansion and greater durability for chronic use? Thanks. Christopher Viehbacher : You mean the price decline related to maintenance, is that what you're saying? Brian Abrahams : Like, I guess, how are you thinking about pricing strategically for a maintenance therapy on an annualized basis relative to every two weeks, and how should we think about the overall balance? Christopher Viehbacher : Again, I think as -- obviously, we have to wait now and see the data and get approval for these things. But I think you're probably going to be in this plaque removal process, and that's every two weeks.  As you get into maintenance, as Priya said, the dosing regimen could change. And obviously, if you were to go from two weeks to one month, that has an overall per patient cost on an annualized basis that would be lower. So, I think you'll see potentially a lower patient cost just because of the different dosing regimen over time. Shorter term, again, I think we probably have more patients out there than the system can manage. And so, I don't think there's going to be that much price pressure. Once the system adapts, there may be over time, but I don't really see prices being the main aspect of this. And remember, when you look at this -- I mean, we're talking about $26,500 for the drug cost. But there's a lot more cost to the system for the treatment of the patients. A PET scan, for instance, costs around $7,000 as an example, and you have the MRIs and you have the treatment. And that's why, to me, blood diagnostics could play a bigger role in actually reducing the overall cost. And I think those types of things, and as we move into maintenance dosing regimen, we may find that the average annual cost of a patient goes down, although we're not necessarily touching the price of the drug. Operator : We will now take a question from Michael Yee of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Michael Yee : Hi. Thanks for the question. You mentioned in the slides that you would like to improve the risk profile and productivity, R&D pipeline, particularly profile. And I recall, in January, you talked about lower-risk-type projects and perhaps Biogen is too high risk, high reward, particularly for this market cap? And then going back to your prior days, you did, I think, the Genzyme on the Regeneron deal. So, can you just comment about the philosophy of bringing in products that are perhaps lower risk, more derisked and how you think about bringing those in and acting on those accordingly and with the speed? Thank you. Christopher Viehbacher : Sure. To me, risk management is something that is part of the day job in a pharma company. You obviously, can't do anything unless you take risk. We develop products in early stage. If you're talking about Phase I, you've got 10% probability of success. I think there's a couple of areas that we would look at. The first thing is, obviously, if you can do a Phase II study where you get a lot of confidence out of safety and efficacy before you go into a Phase III study, you have essentially, at every stage of development, from Phase I to Phase II, Phase II to Phase III derisk that. We sometimes can't do it. If you look at Alzheimer's and the development of either lecanemab or ADUHELM, you can start to see, for instance, that you're reducing plaque, but one of the problems we -- a lot of companies had is that they didn't reduce the plaque enough, and you're not going to know whether you have reduced the plaque enough until you see a benefit in cognitive function. But you really can't do that until you go into large studies and take a long time because these diseases progress so slowly. So, to me, one of the areas is that we can -- if you go into autoimmune diseases or you're into psychiatry, you can have a more classical drug development where you can derisk more in Phase II, you can get a proof of concept. As I said earlier, we are sometimes doing proof of concept in Phase III, which is an expensive way to do proof of concept. So just even thinking about moving into some of these other areas allows us to do more classical drug development. The other is, of course, that we can start to license in products and that are a lot closer to market, and you're not taking quite as much risk on those. But it's really a function of when you look at it, how much are precedented versus unprecedented mechanism of action? How much are small molecules versus large molecules? Can we do more collaborative-type approaches? But this notion of always doing proof of concept in Phase III is a highly expensive, highly risky approach. And I think having a few of those projects in our pipeline is good, having 100% of our pipeline and projects like that is challenging. And if you look at it, we don't really have an approval coming in our pipeline for several years yet here because we're waiting on these long-term studies. So, having things that read out on a little bit more frequent basis would be helpful to looking at sustainable growth of the company. Mike Hencke : Operator, I think we have time for one final question. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Thanks so much. Just another one on BD. Is this something you're going to be looking to do in parallel with your strategic review and cost resizing efforts? Or is this a bit of a longer-term priority once you make whatever changes are necessary for the core business? And maybe just a second part of that same question. Given your prior comments of the narrow focus of Biogen, does that point more towards BD is skewed towards either company acquisitions versus partnerships or earlier-stage deals because it seems like you might want to be bringing both products as well as kind of expertise in-house? Just help me a little bit in terms of like the -- how you think about that dynamic? Thank you. Chris Viehbacher : I think certainly for the first half of this year, we're focused on really reorienting the company towards these growth opportunities, looking at the cost base -- we should have a new Head of Research in that timeframe. We're also in the process of recruiting a Head of BD. So, to me, this is sort of something that we start to look at in the second half of the year. As you know, it takes a while to go find things. You've got to look at a lot of things before you do something. So even if you decide you want to do something next year, you really have to start looking now. In terms of what we're looking at? Look, it could be all of the above. To the degree that we get comfortable with the launch trajectory of LEQEMBI and zuranolone, you could argue that the bankers like to refer to this desperation factor. I would argue that we don't have a high desperation factor. We actually have a lot that we can do within the company. I think it's healthy to be looking outside and to always have options because in this business, nothing ever goes completely to plan.  But we have the time to look and make sure that whatever we do is going to be value-added, and I think it could be all of the things that you've mentioned. Mike Hencke : Okay. With that, I think we're going to conclude the call for today. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Bettina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Business Update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Triano, you may begin your conference. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Bettina. Good morning and welcome to Biogen's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the investors section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including our GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today on the call. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2 and Table 4 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I am joined by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Viehbacher; Dr. Priya Singhal, Head of Development; and our CFO, Mike McDonnell. Chris, Priya and Mike will each make opening comments and then we'll move to the Q&A session. To allow us to get through as many questions as possible, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question. I'll now turn the call over to Chris. Christopher Viehbacher : Thank you, Chuck. Good morning, everybody. I'll start by first welcoming Chuck Triano as our new Head of Investor Relations. Great to have you on the team, Chuck. On our last call, we described five priorities for the business that you see on the first slide here. And during the first quarter, I think we made a lot of good progress against those five priorities. We are continuing to work toward the potential launches of LEQEMBI in Alzheimer's disease and Zuranolone in both MDD and PPD. And I'm going to cover that on the next slide because it's really in some ways a super priority. On the next point on improving the risk profile and productivity of R&D, Priya will review the steps to take -- taking to improve the risk profile of the productivity of R&D and you'll see that in greater detail. So I'm going to cover a little bit more on the cost base. The first thing I'd like to say is that we've made good progress on the previous program that had announced a billion dollars of cost savings. That -- those billion dollars have been secured and have been -- that program is complete. But over the last several months, I have been getting a better understanding of how the company operates, working with our senior leaders and thinking about how we operate at all levels of the company. We kicked in early at a global regional and affiliate level. And as we said before, we do have a higher cost base than the average company in our category. And so we've initiated an additional program to align our operations and cost base with the expected revenue while leaving enough money for the upcoming launches. And we internally refer to this program as fit-for-growth. And really what we're trying to do is balance the opportunity for profitable growth by investing in our product launches and the R&D projects that we deem priority with an attempt to try to reduce that cost base and get that back to something that looks a little bit more in line with our competitors. Now that's not just a simple job of taking out costs. What we're really trying to do is redesign the company. We have these two launches. They're going to have different geographic points of focus at the start. We won't have Zuranolone for few years outside of the US. Zuranolone is clearly a top priority in the short-term in the US. And outside the US, we're going to be certainly focused on the LEQEMBI launch in the first instance. So one of the things we want to do is make sure that we don't lose what is good in the company and what has been working. We also have to remember that we are still a leader in multiple sclerosis. There are lot of patients who depend upon our products and we have to make sure that the physicians who treat those patients have adequate information. So there is a balancing act as we tried to shift our resources behind the growth opportunities while still supporting our historic MS business. And so we're taking a -- essentially a bottoms-up and a methodical approach to this. This could have a much different approach to our operating model. We've been 45 years in multiple sclerosis with a limited product profile. Yes, we had at one point some products in hemophilia and obviously we have SPINRAZA. And as a result, we had an awful lot of centralized cost. Right now, we're looking at how do we get a lot more of our resource and our attention closer to the customer. So it's a redesign effort and it's meant to be durable. So, we do recognize that there is an opportunity to reduce cost, but we really are looking at something more transformational that really sets the company up for growth. We'll be able to say more about that in Q2. Another priority is really managing the base business. There's two dynamics in the company. We are a leader in MS, but that business is increasingly affected by competition. And we have growth opportunities with LEQEMBI and Zuranolone. So on the base business, the idea is how do we manage that business as profitably as we can. We did receive a favourable decision from the Court of Justice of the European Union related to TECFIDERA regulatory data and marketing protection, which was an important reinforcement of intellectual property and exclusivity rights. We believe this provides us marketing protection until at least February of next year. And we are looking to enforce that protection, but it will take a little time for the market to settle. And separately, we also continue to enforce our 2028 patent for TECFIDERA in the EU. We're also looking to aim to -- we're looking to maximize the profitability of the MS franchise. Up until now, the goal has been to defend revenue at all cost. I think now we want to take a little bit more of a nuanced approach of looking at where the opportunities in MS, where do we have intellectual property, where do we have still sales promotion sensitivity and tried to align our resources with that and perhaps look at other means of promoting products that are a little less expensive. We do believe that SPINRAZA can return to growth and we are seeing stabilization up there in the marketplace, gene therapy has not for everyone. And the oral therapy has its limits and there are still quite a few patients that suffer from SMA that don't benefit from any treatment. And as we announced at the previous quarter, we do have a formal process underway to evaluate strategic options for our biosimilars business. This is a very good business and I think especially with the launch of biosimilars for Humira, we are seeing an opportunity for the healthcare system to make important economies that help fund innovation and we need to think about who is the -- and how is the best way to manage this business and who might be the best owner of that business. On external growth, we're looking at external growth really from two perspectives. One is how do we balance the company a little bit more on its pipeline. It has been very neuroscience focused. But as I've argued in the past, I think with MS, which is basically an autoimmune disease, I think we could migrate into immunology. With SPINRAZA, I think, we have an experience in rare diseases and that will be reinforced with Tofersen. And, of course, we're in neuropsychiatry with Zuranolone. So these offer opportunities to think about how do we build out some of those franchises. Yeah, there is, no, I did describe this dynamic of the MS franchise declining slightly and new growth coming and we may look at external growth as a way of making sure that that transition is as smooth as possible from a results point of view. And I'm pleased to say that we have appointed Adam Keeney as our Head of Corporate Development. Adam has over 20 years of experience, not just in business development, but also in R&D and strategy across both large pharma and he was the CEO of a Biotech. So I think he's got some entrepreneurial spirit that will be very welcomed at Biogen. We do see LEQEMBI and Zuranolone as major contributors to revenue, but we want to continue to think about business development to support the growth trajectory and diversified as I said. So if I could have the next slide please. So we really got an unprecedented opportunity. We have today a PDUFA date for Tofersen. We have a PDUFA date on July for LEQEMBI and a PDUFA date in August for Zuranolone. I can't think of another major biopharmaceutical company that has that many new significant products to launch. That's a huge opportunity. But as I said earlier, we have to think about capabilities on that. These are going to be different areas. Obviously, LEQEMBI is little closer to home, since it's still in neurologist, but there's an awful lot of market building we will have to be done there. And, of course, Zuranolone takes us into a much different area and a much different position franchise. But we're making our milestones. We received accelerated approval in the US back in January. We filed for traditional approval in the US on the same day and within the EU, Japan and Eisai initiated regulatory filing in China. Filing all of those dossiers in that kind of timeframe is really quite significant and I have to congratulate our colleagues at Eisai for this effort. These filings have received priority review in the US, Japan and China. And, of course, a major milestone in that Veterans Health Administration has decided to reimburse LEQEMBI. Now, LEQEMBI is going to be the first anti-amyloid antibody to receive traditional approval globally hopefully in July. As we said, this is not a straightforward launch, it's a complex diagnosis involving PET scans, lumbar puncture for amyloid confirmation, specialists who are already busy, MRI imaging, bi-weekly infusion. And we know that capacity could be an issue initially. CMS reimbursement will be the next major milestone, which we expect to have an answer on once the product has received full approval as expected following the PDUFA date in July. More importantly though, we are looking at how do we right now alleviate those bottlenecks. Yes, CMS is there, but both companies are already thinking about what we can do to make this easier for patients and actually reduce cost. Eisai and Biogen are pursuing maintenance dosing in the subcu formulation. Blood-based diagnostics, as I've said in the past, are really going to be a game-changer in this space. And we believe that over time, capacity is going to expand to meet the need. For reimbursement, this is a big question, the Veterans' Association is certainly helpful. I would just point out that compared to the situation that ADUHELM faced, we are getting a lot more support from Congress. The American Association of Neurologist has written in support. And I know that a number of patient advocacy groups are active and ensuring that patients have access to this important therapy. So Eisai is responsible under the contract for engaging with CMS and we would hope to see broad coverage coming out of the CMS decision. Now I'd like to talk about Zuranolone just for a few minutes. I mean, Zuranolone is still I think an underestimated asset in our portfolio. Unfortunately, a lot of people suffered from depression, so it is a large market. There are clearly a number of older medicines that are available. The main problem with those are the side effects of those medicines and the length of time it takes for them to work. And Zuranolone works potentially in three days and it's going to be a different type of launch because we're talking about a treatment that works in two weeks. The only analogue I can find that is in a way similar was Zithromax. So we do know that there is going to be some need for education, physicians are used to treating on a chronic basis. As we launch even, we're going to have to think about different metrics. One of the things in the launch that you look for is when the NRxs switched to TRxs. Well, we're not going to see that. They are not going to be TRxs with the product. So I think there are these changes in physician behaviour. This is a paradigm shift and paradigm shift is not always a good thing in pharmaceutical marketing as we know. However, what really drives us, this is a product that really makes a difference for patients. This is a product that, well, it's efficacious, it works fast. And think about the freedom of knowing that after two weeks that you can stop taking Zuranolone. So I think that is going to be an enormous opportunity. And I'll just finish with Tofersen on this, it is not a big product obviously, about 300 patients. But it's classic Biogen. There is a -- we have a long history in ALS, lot of setbacks. But the organization has an ability to learn and adapt and Biogen was able to partner with the scientific community to help characterize neurofilament as a biomarker in neuromuscular disorders. This is a huge deal because neurofilament will be relevant to a lot of researchers who are looking at ALS. So I think we've got some ground-breaking science here. And this is where Biogen has had the resilience to go after a lot of significant unmet need that -- has resolved things in a way that not everybody has been able to do. Next slide, if I could. We've got a number of milestones coming, as you can see here on the slide. By our Q2 call, we would expect to be in a different place with LEQEMBI. We should hopefully have the PDUFA date behind us successfully. Hopefully, we've received a traditional approval and broader CMS coverage in the US. And, of course, we'll be communicating more about our fit-for-growth cost optimization program. By the end of this year, hopefully we've got the first ex-US approval of LEQEMBI in Japan and hopefully we'll have received the approval for Zuranolone in both MDD and PPD as well as having completed a three-month DEA scheduling period and initiated the launch. And if I look further ahead by the end of -- by the time -- this time next year, I think we have an opportunity to build a global footprint of LEQEMBI with approvals in Europe and China. And, of course, we'll take the next steps on evolving the treatment paradigm with Alzheimer's disease with an expected regulatory filing of LEQEMBI maintenance dosing. We would also expect regulatory filings for subcutaneous dosing, which could facilitate at-home administration. So in conclusion, through a combination of ground breaking of sign, high-potential near-term commercial opportunities and diligent capital allocation. I think Biogen is going to be well-positioned for the sustainable long-term growth. I'd like to now turn it over to Priya for an update on our progress in R&D. Priya Singhal : Thank you, Chris. Last quarter, we made important progress advancing key pipeline programs. As Chris just pointed out, we now have the opportunity to deliver three potential new drug launches across four indications this year, all in areas of high unmet need, including Alzheimer's disease, major depressive disorder, postpartum depression and SOD1-ALS. We also continue to evaluate potential opportunities for geographic and indication expansion for Zuranolone as we work with our collaborator Sage to prepare for a potential US launch later this year. I will share key highlights from the quarter across broader efforts in Alzheimer's disease, the Tofersen program in SOD1-ALS and the progress that we're making to rebalance the risk profile and improved productivity of the R&D pipeline. I will now share highlights of additional analysis Eisai recently presented or published, consistent with both companies' commitment to transparency. First, regarding activities of daily living. New analysis of ADCS-MCI-ADL presented at AD/PD last month, showed that all individual items of this scale favoured LEQEMBI at 18 months as compared to placebo. This includes items like ability to make a meal or keeping appointment. This result also measures Clarity AD study outcome on the CDR sum of boxes where LEQEMBI treatment slowed decline across all six individual domains at 18 months versus placebo. Additionally, results from Clarity AD showed that at 18 months, LEQEMBI treatment resulted in a 50% less decline from baseline on scales designed to assess quality-of-life and reduced care partner burden as compared to placebo. In addition was also presented an updated analysis of ARIA from the CLARITY AD study to evaluate ARIA incidents in LEQEMBI-treated participants on antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs as compared to LEQEMBI-treated participants that were not on either. The results were encouraging and showed that ARIA incidents were similar in the two groups. In addition to the data presented at AD/PD, newly published analysis from LEQEMBI Phase II study reinforce the finding that while plaques level begin to return slowly after treatment discontinuation, other biomarkers of AD biology such as Plasma Abeta42/40 ratio re-accumulate quickly. We believe these findings further support the potential benefit of continued treatment with LEQEMBI after plaques have been removed. Building on their prior work, Eisai published a new analysis of the long-term health outcomes associated with LEQEMBI treatment. Updated analysis incorporated data from the Phase III CLARITY AD study, replacing the prior modeling that used Phase IIb study results. The analysis of the Phase III data, consistent with the analysis of the prior Phase IIb study results, showed that LEQEMBI resulted in a delay of approximately two to three years in meantime to progression to mild, moderate and severe AD dementia versus standard of care alone. We believe these results build upon and reinforce the significant body of evidence that has been generated on LEQEMBI. Biogen is committed to building on a deep expertise and experience in Alzheimer's disease by advancing an industry-leading Alzheimer's pipeline that is diversified across therapeutic modalities and molecular targets. This includes focusing on tau. Intracellular neurofibrillary tangle, which represent a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's are composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Unlike amyloid plaques, which are observed to build up in the brain years before the onset of cognitive symptoms, tau tangles are more closely related to the neuronal cell loss and onset of clinical symptoms. To address our pathology, we are advancing BIIB080, an antisense oligonucleotide targeting tau mRNA aiming to reduce all forms of tau protein. Importantly, this is a very different approach than utilizing a tau-directed antibody which is hypothesized to target only extracellular tau. We were encouraged by the early results of this ASO-based approach as evidenced by the BIIB080 Phase Ib data in Alzheimer's disease which were presented last month at AD/PD and also published in Nature Medicine, which went live online yesterday. Phase Ib data shown here on the slide. BIIB080 was generally well tolerated. Majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Of which the most common were headache, back pain and post-lumbar puncture syndrome. We observed a time and dose-dependent reduction in CSF total and phospho-tau across the multiple ascending dose and long-term extension periods. Total tau continued to decline 16 weeks following the last dose in the MAD portion of the study, both in the high dose Q4 weekly and the Q12 weekly dose and we saw a 50% reduction from base lines. We observed an effect on neurofibrillary tangle, as visualized, via tau PET as early as 25 weeks across all brain regions assessed. Reduction in tau burden in all treatment groups at the end of the open-label extension at 100 weeks. The BIIB080 study is the first to demonstrate this magnitude of tau PET reduction across brain regions. Encouraged by these early results, we continue to enroll the Phase II CELIA study of BIIB080 in early Alzheimer's disease, where we are exploring different dosing regimens, including every 12 weeks and every 24 week dosing. Last month, an advisory committee by the FDA met to review the Tofersen data in SOD1-ALS. The advisory committee unanimously agreed that reduction in plasma neurofilament light is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit of Tofersen for the treatment of SOD1-ALS. And they also reached a consensus that the benefit-risk profile was favourable. As Chris mentioned, Biogen has spent years collaborating with the scientific community to characterize neurofilament as a marker of axonal injury and neurodegeneration and we view the outcome of the advisory committee as a significant advancement for the field. We believe these developments also inform our other programs in ALS, including BIIB105, an antisense oligonucleotide targeting ataxin-2 which may have therapeutic potential in the broader ALS population. BIIB105 aims to reduce ataxin-2 protein levels, which we hypothesized will reduce toxic TDP-43 clusters that are observed in nearly all people living with ALS. Preclinical experiments confirm that reduction of ataxin-2 levels modified survival and function in a mouse model of TDP-43 ALS. The Phase I/II study of BIIB105 in ALS is expected to read out early next year. We continue to advance our R&D prioritization efforts with the goals of optimizing the value that our pipeline can deliver. This includes investing in areas where we have a strong conviction in the disease biology. We continue to invest in further data generation for LEQEMBI and Zuranolone and remain focused on executing key clinical studies, including BIIB080 and BIIB105 as well as for litifilimab in lupus. We also made the decision to opt in to Denali Antibody Transport Vehicle A-beta program. With the ATV A-beta, we aim to safely increase exposure of A-beta antibody in the brain. This may enable improved plaque clearance and/or lower incidence of ARIA. We are also deprioritizing programs based upon our integrated view of development, regulatory and on commercialization challenges. Recent updates include that we decided to terminate involvement in the development of BIIB093 programs in large hemispheric infarction and brain contusion due to operational challenges and strategic considerations. We decided to pause initiation of the Phase IIb study of BIIB131 in acute ischemic stroke as we reassess whether we need to initiate the study. We discontinued BIIB132 in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. We previously announced that we had refocused our investment in gene therapy and we will continue to look to advance technology associated with the safe delivery of these therapies to the right targets in the body which we believe is one of the most critical scientific and technical challenges that is currently associated with this modality. We also had previously announced that we exited ophthalmology research with goals of reallocating resources to areas where we believe there is a greater probability of success. This will be an ongoing process, involving dynamic scientific prioritization and investment based on an ongoing assessment of probability of success, but we expect to complete our initial substantial review by midyear. In conclusion, Biogen has had a significant number of accomplishments this past quarter, which we believe highlights the ability of our R&D organization to capitalize and deliver on ground-breaking science in the pursuit of new medicines for patients. With key assets in areas like Alzheimer's disease, depression, ALS and lupus, we believe the Biogen pipeline has the potential to deliver significant growth over the medium and long term. I will now pass the call over to Mike for the financial results. Michael McDonnell : Thank you, Priya. Good morning, everyone. So I'll provide some highlights of our financial performance for the first quarter and please note that all financial comparisons that you will hear are versus the first quarter of 2022. Total revenue for the first quarter was $2.5 billion and that's a decrease of 3% at actual currency and flat at constant currency. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the first quarter was $3.40, a decrease of 6%. Total MS product revenue was $1.1 billion, a decrease of 19% at actual currency and 17% at constant currency. I'd like to provide a few points here regarding MS during the quarter. In the U.S., we continue to see the impact of TECFIDERA generics declines in the interferons and competition for TYSABRI. As we noted in our last call, Q1 is typically a seasonally weaker quarter for our MS business in the U.S., and that's driven by higher discounts and allowances and some channel dynamics. And as it relates to channel dynamics, we did see a greater-than-expected decrease in channel inventory which added a few percentage points to the overall global decline. And we believe this is likely related to tighter working capital management in wholesalers and specialty pharmacies, due to the rising interest rate environment. In addition, VUMERITY is being impacted by both pricing pressure and a contraction of the oral segment of the market in the U.S. And as a reminder, in Q1 of last year, VUMERITY did benefit from a favourable Medicaid-related sales adjustment which also impacts the year-over-year comparison. As far as Europe, as you know, we received a favourable decision relating to the TECFIDERA regulatory data and marketing protection in the EU and that was assumed in our guidance. So we believe that TECFIDERA is entitled to regulatory marketing protection in EU until at least February of 2024 and we are working to enforce this protection. I would add that we did expect it would take some time following the decision for all generic products to be off the market and we are assuming that this exit will accelerate in the near term. Separately, we continue to enforce our patent which expires in 2028. So as we look toward the remainder of the year, we do expect to see a slower rate of decline on a year-over-year basis versus what we saw in Q1. We've taken some actions which aim to improve the underlying revenue trajectory for our MS portfolio in the second half, including for VUMERITY in the U.S., and we're continuing to closely monitor the underlying market dynamics in MS closely. Moving to SMA. Global SPINRAZA revenue of $443 million was a decrease of 6% in actual currency and 2% at constant currency. In the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue decreased 10% due to fewer new patient starts and some channel dynamics as compared to the first quarter of last year. However, we do continue to see what we believe are signs of stabilization in our patient base. Outside the U.S., revenue for SPINRAZA decreased 4% at actual currency and increased 2% at constant currency with competition more than offset by the timing of shipments in certain markets. Biosimilars revenue was $192 million, and that's a decline of 1% at actual currency and an increase of 4% at constant currency and that's due to volume growth driven by the launch of our BYOOVIZ product partially offset by continued pricing pressure for our anti-TNF products in Europe. Alzheimer's disease revenue, which includes revenue from ADUHELM and the LEQEMBI collaboration equated to a headwind of $18 million to revenue. As a reminder, beginning this quarter, our share of LEQEMBI commercial expenses in the U.S. is recorded as a component of revenue, thus the negative number this quarter. And for this line item, we expect this to continue to be negative in 2023 as ramping LEQEMBI commercialization expenses throughout the year are expected to exceed initial revenue. Total anti-CD20 revenue of $399 million was flat. Revenue from OCREVUS royalties increased 12%, which was partially offset by a 25% decline in revenue from our profit share on RITUXAN, and that was driven by biosimilar competition. The anti-CD20 revenue line also included a $10 million operating loss related to LUNSUMIO. I'd note that our R&D expense for LUNSUMIO is also recorded as a component of the anti-CD20 revenue line. Important to note that starting in the second quarter, our pre-tax profit share percentage on RITUXAN, GAZYVA and LUNSUMIO will decrease from 37.5% to 35% and that [Technical Difficulty] sales targets for GAZYVA as part of our contractual agreement with Genentech. Contract manufacturing royalty and other revenue of $319 million benefited from the timing of production of some contract manufacturing batches which includes LEQEMBI. While this line tends to vary from quarter-to-quarter, we do not expect this level of contract manufacturing revenue to continue throughout the remainder of 2023. A couple of details regarding Q1 expenses. For the first quarter, non-GAAP cost of sales was $663 million or 27% of revenue. This includes $45 million of idle capacity charges which Eisai no longer shares. During Q1, we did see pressure on cost of sales associated with product mix. We saw increased contract manufacturing revenue which has a higher cost of sales including manufacturing revenue for LEQEMBI which is at minimal gross margin. We continue to expect our cost of sales as a percentage of revenue for the remainder of the year to be higher than the 22.4% that we saw for full year of 2022 and that's primarily as a result of product mix and idle capacity charges. First quarter non-GAAP R&D expense was $571 million and that compares to $552 million in the first quarter of last year. Non-GAAP SG&A was $603 million and this compares to $635 million in the first quarter of 2022. The decrease in non-GAAP SG&A expense was driven primarily by cost savings initiatives which importantly were partially offset by investments to support new product launches and $31 million related to the termination of the co-promotion agreement with Eisai to Biogen's MS products in Japan. We continue to expect operating expenses to be lower in the second half of 2023 than in the first half. And as Chris mentioned, separate from the previously announced $1 billion cost savings initiative, we have initiated our fit-for-growth program in order to align our cost base with expected revenue while also investing in our growth opportunities. And we expect this program to have a modest impact on 2023 expenses and a more meaningful impact in 2024 and beyond and we'll have more to say about this on our second quarter earnings call. As for our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $6 billion in cash and marketable securities, $6.3 billion in debt and roughly $300 million in net debt. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we received approximately $813 million related to the sale of our equity stake in Samsung Bioepis, which is not included in these cash figures. And this payment is the second payment related to this transaction which closed around this time last year and we're expecting a third payment of approximately $438 million in April of 2024. In the first quarter, we generated $455 million in cash flow from operations. CapEx was $67 million. Free cash flow was $389 million. So overall, we remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial capacity to invest in growing the business over time. Let me now turn to financial guidance for full year 2023. We are reaffirming our full year guidance of a full year 2023 revenue decline in the mid-single-digit percentage range as compared to 2022 reported results and full year 2023 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of between $15 and $16 and I would refer you to our press release for other important guidance assumptions. So in closing, Biogen continued to make strong progress against our business priorities in the first quarter. We remain focused on three potential launches in 2023 while continuing to be diligent in prioritizing our R&D pipeline, optimizing our operating model and also evaluating external opportunities. We expect that execution of these priorities will position us well for returning Biogen to sustainable growth and creating long-term value for our shareholders. And with that we will now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Phil Nadeau of TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Phil Nadeau : Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Our question is on LEQEMBI reimbursement. What is Biogen's expectation for reimbursement post full approval? Do you expect coverage with evidence development or some other form? And second, when do you think that will be clear? CMS has suggested that the coverage will be revised on the day of approval. Is that going to be the final determination or will there be subsequent revisions after that? Thank you. Michael McDonnell : Chris, do we have you? Do you want to start? Christopher Viehbacher : Yes. I hope if I got off mute. Yes, thanks, Phil. Nothing really new to report there, at least as far as CMS. CMS has said that following full approval that they will be making sure that the product is broadly available. I think there will be a question of existing registry, what type of registry, is there a cap on the registry that hasn't been defined at the moment. I think what really is encouraging is that we're seeing an awful lot of support being mustered and encouragement of CMS to reimburse. As I noted earlier, the American Association of neurologists has come out strongly in favour. As a reminder, they sided more with CMS at the time of ADUHELM. So this is a change in position. Over twice as many members of Congress have written to CMS and did for ADUHELM. And some of you may have been following the budget discussions in Washington and Congress with also an encouragement for CMS to make the product available. So we continue to believe that the product will be made available. We would hope that it's not with a registry. There's no real need for a registry. And we don't really see why this product wouldn't be reimbursed like any other product for Medicare. But we're probably not going to see anything until after the PDUFA date. Operator : We will now take a question from Paul Matteis of Stifel. Please go ahead. Paul Matteis : Thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to follow up a little bit more on external investments as it relates to reshaping your pipeline. Chris, you've outlined rare disease, psychiatry and immunology historically. It would seem like if you're going to decrease the risk profile of your R&D strategy that immunology and rare would be more on the developmental side, whereas for a psychiatry asset you want something that was either clinically de-risked or commercial. Is that the right way to think about it? And what's your appetite today for transacting before shoring up everything in-house? Thank you. Christopher Viehbacher : Thanks, Paul. No, I think, you've got that correct. I mean, you could certainly look at some tuck-in acquisitions on the rare side. We have, as I noted earlier, appointed Adam as Head of Corporate Development and Business Development. I think another key figure will be the appointment of a new Head of Research and I would hope to have that person in place at least by the end of the summer. And that person, along with Priya and Adam, are really going to be the three that I'll be working with to think about certainly from a licensing point of view. In terms of more transactions, I think we would be more inclined to find something that is revenue generating in the near term. If you look at Biogen, really from 2025 onwards, I think the company has an ability to grow pretty significantly. But in the next couple of years, that's where we're in this -- the tide going out on MS and the tide coming in on new products. We obviously have a lever with cost that we can use, but external growth could also help us to manage that transition period. Operator : We will now take a question from Geoff Meacham of Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : Good morning, guys. Thanks so much for the question. Chris or Priya on BIIB080, we've seen a lot of tau assets underwhelmed in trials as a monotherapy and you guys are in a unique position to assess tau along with LEQEMBI. So the question is, what do you need to see in Phase II to advance a combo? And strategically, how much of a priority do you think this would be? Thank you. Christopher Viehbacher : Priya? Priya Singhal : Yes. Thanks, Geoff. Great question. So I'll just step back and say, obviously, Alzheimer's disease is a very complex disease with multiple biologies and complex pathophysiology. We do see ourselves as pioneers in this space and we have been successful with demonstrating the A-beta plaques as being central. And now we've kind of shifted gears to looking at tau. As you know, we had a lot of experience with extracellular tau and this was actually not successful because BIIB092 didn't work which was gosuranemab. And we have really focused now on knocking down all post-translational isoforms of tau. So that's what BIIB080 is aiming to do. As we've shared, I mean, obviously, these numbers are small in the Phase Ib study that went online in a publication yesterday in major medicine. But very encouraging because we have seen close to 50% reduction of total tau and the sustained reduction post dosing. So this is very encouraging. As we kind of think about Alzheimer's leadership and we think about multiple therapies, we have to first assess how tau knockdown kind of translates into clinical outcomes, how much is fired. Because when you look at the mouse models, transgenic mouse models for tau, you do see that about 50% actually can rescue neuronal cell loss and memory. So it's encouraging, but we need to see more data from Phase III. That's exactly how we're approaching it. Eventually, I think we do believe strongly that this is going to be a multimodality space and patients will probably need more than one therapy. Now whether it will be combination or which way you have to determine whether it's synergistic or whether it could be additive that remains to be seen. And I think we're going to let the data drive us on many of these questions. But we're looking at all of this very, very carefully. Right now, we're focusing on tau knockdown, all isoforms, as well as our Phase I asset, which has been 113 which is looking at preventing tau aggregation. So that's how we're focusing our efforts. Christopher Viehbacher : If I could just follow up on that though, I think, Priya, I mean this is -- Priya noted that we've been through the pipeline and we have deprioritized some programs. But that's not just in an effort to reduce cost, it's really to be able to focus resources on those assets that we think are most promising. I can tell you, following the announcement of these results in Sweden and then also publication of the article in Nature. There's been a lot of attention on BIIB080 particularly from neurology community. And I think this is one of those assets that we really want to focus on. We've actually already allocated more resources to accelerate this program. And as Priya said, this is really one of the first manifestations of what it means to build a leadership position in Alzheimer's as opposed to just launching one product in this space. So most complex diseases do end up being combination therapies and there is some likelihood that will be the case in Alzheimer's. And to your point, I think Biogen is pretty well placed in that regard. And we're certainly getting even external interest in this program. Operator : We will now take a question from Salveen Richter of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Salveen Richter : Good morning. Thanks for taking question. On LEQEMBI, could you discuss your strategy here with respect to infrastructure, particularly infusion centers and testing post a potential full approval and assuming broad coverage by CMS? Christopher Viehbacher : Sure. Thanks for the question. One of the most interesting things is that the companies actually went through a launch planning process with ADUHELM and actually commissioned a study to actually have a look and understand what the learnings of that are. And there's an awful lot of chicken and egg syndrome going on here. Until there's been an approved therapy and reimbursement, there often isn't enough investment in other areas. We see this with blood based diagnostic for example. They've been around, but there's no market for a blood based diagnostic until you actually have an approved drug and a treatment. And the same is true really for the investment in infusion capacity and PET scans and lumbar punctures and even the neurology capacity. So what we certainly are seeing is that there is a lot more interest. There are a lot of parties who are looking to invest in some of this infrastructure. But right now, the world is almost in a point of, well, the starting gate is really CMS approval. One of the things that we also learned was, you want to flex your commercial investment with the ability of the system to actually meet patients. I think one of the things that we would do differently and are doing differently is that, at the time Biogen ramped up a huge commercial machine in advance of reimbursement and in advance of some of that expansion. As we work with Eisai, we're being a lot more prudent in looking at, okay, let's make sure we're out there, we're educating physicians, we're thinking about who's the right patient for this and working with the different centers to make sure we know which centers are -- have the ability to see patients and process the patients with this complex treatment paradigm. So it will expand. And I think some of that expanded already at the time of ADUHELM. But I but do think that we'll see -- we'll get a better sense of where that's going once we have the confirmation of CMS's reimbursement. Operator : We will now take a question from Umer Raffat of Evercore. Umer Raffat : Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I thought I would get some clarity on the minus $19 million in collaboration profit share on lecanemab. And specifically, is there any color we can get on what the end user revenues could look like from this minus $38 million for the franchise for 1Q, even if it's a fraction of $1 million. It would just be very helpful. And also has Eisai indicated to you on where they are or what percentage of the commercial build out has already been baked into this 1Q number or not? Because you can imagine there's a lot of investor concern around how much SG&A they could possibly build into this collaboration, especially in light of some of the concerns around the strained relationship from the past, et cetera. Thank you very much. Christopher Viehbacher : Thanks, Umer. Mike, do you want to take the first part of the question, and I'll talk about the commercial infrastructure statement. Michael McDonnell : Sure. No, happy to. So Umer, as you know, the line item that you're referring to is the net of any revenue and commercial expense divided by two, basically, as you noted. And we are -- we don't have a number that we're going to disclose on the revenue. What I can say is there was revenue during the quarter. It was minimal. The majority of patients on drug are cash pay. There's not reimbursement yet, as you know. And I think the real game, so to speak, starts when we have reimbursement should we get approval and get to that point. So, yes, revenue was minimal. The majority of it was cost divided by two. And I'll let Chris speak to the ramp from here. Christopher Viehbacher : Yes. Thanks, Mike. Just in terms of relationship, I was in Japan last week and the CEO of Eisai and I had dinner. And I think our view is that the relationship and the partnership is actually working pretty effectively around the world. And as I said earlier, and I've said on a number of occasions, this is not a reach and frequency launch. So let's not think about the fact that we're just sending reps out and then that's going to have some impact directly on sales. There's an awful lot of certainly education that's being done. We actually -- Eisai has already reps out there in the field in the U.S. We, as Biogen, will likely -- will add reps in the -- at some point in the future, perhaps as early as next year, once reimbursement situation is known and the capacity increases. As I say, one of the lessons that we have to learn is that you don't want to get ahead of that. This is -- the initial launch period is going to be really one that's constrained by the capacity. And so there's an awful lot of work working with the neurology community, educate how you diagnose the patient, the whole process in a practice of -- when do you get the PET scan or the lumbar puncture, when are the -- how do you schedule the MRIs, getting the reimbursement, understanding where the infusion centers are. So it's a pretty high touch sell and customer relations at the start. I would say there's an initial investment, there'll be a second wave of investment once the CMS decision is known and then probably a third wave of investment as the capacity builds and the patient numbers increase. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Anderson of Wolfe Research. Alice Nettleton : Hi. Thank you for taking our question. This is Alice Nettleton on for Tim Anderson. Just on Alzheimer's, so we're wondering what is Biogen's working assumption on how the profile of Lilly's Donanemab will look relative to LEQEMBI. Past data would suggest it would be less safe with efficacy about the same. Is that how Biogen views the most likely outcome? Thank you. Christopher Viehbacher : Yes. Thanks for the question. I don't think we really look at it that way. When -- I think the world changed with the CLARITY study. If we went back two years ago, three years ago, a lot of still doubt amongst the neurology community, does the amyloid beta hypothesis really hold water. There's been a huge debate within the community about whether that's a valid target or not. CLARITY, I think, really starts to put that debate to rest. And but the studies were done over -- in the case of CLARITY in an 18-month time frame. But actually, what we're seeing is that the world has moved on. Those 18 months, yes, we would dramatically reduce plaque and we actually see that there is a benefit in terms of slower cognitive decline. But that's not where it's going to end. In all likelihood, the way this is shaping up is that you're going to have at some point a plaque clearing phase. Then what happens after you've cleared the plaque? If you don't continue treating, the plaque is going to come back. So there's going to be, in all likelihood, a maintenance phase, that's where also the subcu formulation will be important. And then as we all know, MCI is not really early stage Alzheimer's. By the time you have MCI, by the time you have symptoms, you probably already have a maximum load of plaque. There are probably people on this call who are accumulating plaque in their brains as we speak and they don't know it. And by the time a certain amount of plaque has risen, then you've already had a certain amount of neuronal death. And right now, we don't know how to restore neurons. So there's also going to be, with the advance of blood diagnostics, but also even Eisai Biogen study ahead and looking at earlier patients, as one neurologist said, we're not looking at this any longer as a four to eight year disease, but we're looking at this over the time frame of a 25-year period. So if I look at donanemab finite, in some ways, it will be good if their data are positive, that it further reinforces the amyloid -- the beta amyloid hypothesis. And also there's -- we've always seen in new markets if there's more players that those markets develop faster. But this donanemab thought process of I'm just treating to a certain amount of plaque reduction. Most neurologists I talked to don't believe that fits anymore with the way we're thinking about the treatment of Alzheimer's. So I think it will be there, but I think it's going to be -- it's not really going to be adopted in the same way that people thought when that study was conceived. So let's say, I think, it will be good if there's other players in the market. But I don't think we are too concerned about competing with donanemab. Operator : We will now take a question from Michael Yee of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Michael Yee : Hi. Thank you. Good morning. We had a question around your expectations post reimbursement around the LEQEMBI launch. Appreciating you can't give too many specifics, but how should we think about that in the context of consensus modeling $40 million to $45 million, $400 million for next year? Maybe you could help right-size how things start off, whether there's a bolus or a number of patients already in the queue and in the context of how we should be modeling the next four to six quarters? Thank you. Christopher Viehbacher : Yes, I wish I could give you some more guidance on that. As I'd like to say, I'm pretty confident in the three to five year outlook. The next 18 months are a little more difficult to model even for us. There is an awful lot of interest. There probably will be some queuing. There is going to be a question around the -- how quickly can the system flex. The way I would think about it is and the way I look at Biogen is I think Zuranolone actually is a product that can actually contribute faster to our sales growth in 2024. And I do think that one, yes, it's a paradigm shift, but there's a clear patient benefit and we don't have all of the infrastructure challenges to overcome. So to me, I look to more to the impact of Zuranolone next year. And the -- we'll be able to give a lot better idea by the end of this year once we see what's the initial take-off in the first six months once CMS issues its reimbursement. Operator : Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Truist Securities. Robyn Karnauskas : Hi. Thanks for taking my question and all the colors has been very helpful. So just on if there is a registry, can you just talk to if you would foresee a registry being how much of a bottleneck it might create? How might it be paid for? And so help us, when we see that decision, understand what the challenges would be or it may not be as cumbersome as some might think? Thanks. Christopher Viehbacher : Well, there are certainly versions of a registry that are not particularly cumbersome and the devil is going to be in the detail. That's why, again, we would hope that actually CMS reimburses this product just like any other product. When you think that diverse and underserved patients in the health care system suffer disproportionately more in Alzheimer's, it would seem that increasing the barriers for those patients by the need for navigating a registry would be highly unfair to those patients. But we'll wait and see. Our belief is that the data from CLARITY are extremely clear. The benefits are by no means limited to what you see in the CDR Sum of Boxes. As Priya said, when you look at those activities of daily life, which are evaluated by people who are with these patients every single day and you have half a dozen measures and each one of them individually is statistically significant that says to me that -- and versus placebo, this says to me that the people who see these patients every day understand the benefit of this new medicine and treatment. And so I think the data are compelling and we would hope that there isn't a registry. And if there is a registry that it is minimally cumbersome for patients to act and their caregivers to navigate. Operator : We will now take a question from Marc Goodman of SVB Securities. Marc Goodman : Good morning. Priya, maybe you could just help us with what's similar about these programs that were stopped? I mean, obviously, there's a few in stroke and a few others. But what is similar there? And it was interesting, strokes in Phase III, so does that mean that we could see some other late-stage assets that get cold from the pipeline? Just philosophically, just big picture, how you've thought about these decisions? Thanks. Priya Singhal : Sure. So the way we've thought about these decisions is really we're looking at every program in great depth and several times over and thinking about what are the options, what are the operational and strategic and regulatory challenges, but also opportunities. And so really, it's an integrated view of where we believe that our resources would be better applied to other programs in our portfolio currently. That is, I would say, the common denominator across all the divisions that you're hearing from us today. We believe that we should be spending time elsewhere. Now having said that, you said the BIIB093 is in Phase III. I can't really comment on what might be the outcome. But for now, we are really discontinuing development. Operator : We will now take a question from Terence Flynn of Morgan Stanley. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe a follow-up for Chris on Zuranolone. I think during your prepared remarks, you noted that this asset is underestimated. And based on your answer to the prior question, it sounds like potentially you think there could be some upside to numbers. So should we read that as -- is that the takeaway, that you think there's upside out of your consensus estimates here for that asset? And then just any update on the commercial footprint in terms of the build and what that might ultimately look like over time? Thank you. Christopher Viehbacher : Yes. Thanks, Marc. It is interesting, and I look at it, and I take what analysts and investors say very seriously. And -- but I definitely see that, as a company, we see a much higher potential for Zuranolone than what the street has. And I'm trying to figure out why there is that gap, I haven't really come up with a good answer other than I think the investment community has been so focused on things like rare diseases and oncology where you've got some very clear biomarkers, you've got some very precise medicine. Precision medicine is a big thing in both of those fields. And we're back into primary care. We're back into a disease state that is -- has a lot more challenge in actually diagnosing, even as you look at different indications. For instance, we take something like bipolar depression and major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder and these things are often seen in the same patient. And indeed when you actually talk to psychiatrists, they'll tell you that this is a -- this is truly personalized medicine. Psychiatrist tends to be less swayed by guidelines, by what KOLs say and more about understanding the individual patient needs. So this is not what people have been used to looking at. It's all clinical data and everything else. And so I think from a commercial model point of view, the market is having a little bit more difficulty understanding how does the physician make a decision about their patient. I can tell you is that we've talked to a lot of patients. We've had patients into our global executive committee. We had physicians talk to our global executive committee. It is a much different approach than certainly what our company has been used to in terms of dealing with neurologists. But what is also really clear is that there is a significant unmet need. Patients cycle through therapy. They're not adequately satisfied by those therapies. There's an awful lot of stigma here and staying on medicine only reinforces that stigma. I've talked to physicians who say, we have people coming into the emergency room and we can't help them. There are no beds. We give them an SSRI or something like that and hope that someone is going to watch them for six weeks. So the fact that you can have a medicine that responds quickly. If you're in a depressed phase, this is a very dark part of people's lives. And when you hear the patient stories about how suddenly their life has changed. We had a patient who've been suffering on and off for almost 20 years, a mother of three children, grandmother of five children. And within days, she felt better. She's gotten her qualification as a fitness instructor. She's going now for a pilot license. I mean this is really transformational for so many patients. And that's what I really go by in. Another way I look at it, Marc, is I look at when you're recruiting salespeople. We have 27 roles. The first line manager roles in our field force that we're looking at. We had over 4,000 applications for those roles. And these are people who are working for great companies and supporting great products. And I remember when we were launching Aubagio and there weren't high expectations of Aubagio. But when we built that field force, we were able to recruit a great team. And salespeople do their own diligence. They tend to want to be a part of medicines that they see as important. And I see a lot of signs where I think this is going to resonate with the patient. It is certainly resonating with the sales folks that we are recruiting. And I certainly hear it from a lot of key opinion leaders. So it's hard to -- the only thing that I see where there's a note of caution is that it is clearly a paradigm shift and I'd like to say it's easier to change your spouse of 20 years than it is sometimes a physician's prescribing habits, but because physicians do rely on their experience. But I do think there is a major unmet need here and I actually think there's an awful lot of potential. I'm very excited about this product. I think if I just listen to patients, I always like to say if there is an unmet need and I can see a differentiation versus existing therapy, the drug will be a success. Operator : Our next question comes from Jay Olson of Oppenheimer. Jay Olson : Thank you for the update and congrats on all the progress. Could you talk about the ideal capital structure for Biogen? And how much incremental debt could you take on for the purpose of business development? Thanks for taking the question. Christopher Viehbacher : Mike, do you want to take that one? Michael McDonnell : Yes, I'll take that one. Thank you for the question, Jay. So we ended the quarter with about $6 billion in cash. And as we mentioned, we received the payment from Samsung for roughly $830 million subsequent to the end of the quarter. So we're approaching $7 billion of cash on hand. Our EBITDA level is roughly $3 billion. And on a gross debt basis, we've got roughly two turns. Obviously, net debt is close to zero, it's actually negative if you pro forma for the Samsung payment. So there is incremental room. I think that just illustratively if you added a turn of leverage, you'd be at three times growth, you'd still be very modest net. And you add that to the cash, that puts you kind of north of or in the ZIP code of about $10 billion that you've got of kind of dry powder so to speak. I wouldn't suggest that we would add incremental debt just to add it, but for the right opportunity, the right BD opportunity, et cetera, I think we've got a lot of flexibility in our capital structure. Christopher Viehbacher : We know you all have other calls to get to, so operator, can we please take one more question. Operator : We now take a question from Colin Bristow of UBS. Colin Bristow : Hey, good morning, and thanks for squeezing me in. And also welcome, Chuck. We're excited to be working with you again. On subcut LEQEMBI, what does FDA specifically said is required for approval? And then can you just speak to how important the subcut formulation is to the commercial story? What proportion of patients would it allow you access to the infusion or not? And then just a sort of a subpart on the commercial part. The VHA is excluding APOE4 homozygous. Can you just speak to the risk that you see either as a labeling or commercial risk on full approval as access broadens? Thank you. Priya Singhal : Okay. Thanks, Colin. I can start -- yes, I can start with the subcutaneous formulation. So the plan is on track and Eisai has said that they would be filing by Q1 2024. Just to backup, the evaluation is being conducted in the Phase III open-label extension by a subcutaneous sub-study. And Eisai has also stated that they have discussed the requirements for proceeding with this filing and generating the data and then subsequent filing with FDA and other regulators. And they believe that the strategy currently does allow for an evaluation of PK, PD and safety, which would be required. I'll move to the next aspect. I think that you asked was about the APOE4 homozygous. So Eisai presented some of these data at AD/PD and also made comments on this topic. And they believe that really the data set was rather small. The number of APOE4 homozygous was quite small. They don't believe that the overall conclusions are different in terms of CLARITY AD and confidence in the data. The other aspect here to keep in mind is that actually many of the secondary endpoints favoured LEQEMBI. So there could be a component of placebo not declining as much in this comparator group and that was one of the points that they made as well. Now with regards to the commercial view on subcutaneous, I'm going to turn it to either Chris or Mike. Michael McDonnell : Yes. I mean I think on -- go ahead, Chris. Christopher Viehbacher : Go ahead, Mike. Michael McDonnell : Yes. No, I was going to say on the commercial view of subcutaneous, this will be kind of ground-breaking and then we'll have to see how that plays out over time as patients with Alzheimer's along with their caretakers are maybe moving to more of a maintenance mode for their treatment. This could be something that could be very valuable and particularly for patients who have a distance to travel to get to an infusion center to be able to self-administer at home and something that we think could have a lot of potential. So more to come on that over time. We'll expect to hear more about it over the next nine or so months and we think it could be an important differentiator if it comes together. Chuck Triano : Thanks, everybody. Christopher Viehbacher : I was just going to add, Chuck, we don't really see that the biweekly infusion as being a limiter right now for that [indiscernible] infusion. But it does, as Mike said, as we think about if we are able to get a maintenance indication and we are able to get blood diagnostics, the length of time that a patient will be on drug potentially will change in future and then therefore the subcu would certainly make a difference in that scenario. Back to you, Chuck. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Chris. So thank you all for your attention this morning. You can always follow up with the Investor Relations team and this will conclude our call. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Ruth and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Business Update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Triano, you may begin your conference. Chuck Triano : Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to Biogen's second quarter 2023 earnings call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including our GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in tables 1 and 2, and table 4 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that will follow the discussion related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our expectation. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I'm joined by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Viehbacher; Dr. Priya Singhal, Head of Development; and our CFO, Mike McDonnell. Chris, Priya, and Mike will each make some opening comments, and then we'll move to the Q&A session. Allow -- to allow us to get through as many questions as possible, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question. I will now turn the call over to Chris. Christopher Viehbacher : Thank you, Chuck. Good morning, everybody. I'd like to start off with LEQEMBI. And I think before we really get into all the interesting details of commercialization and competitiveness, I just like to pause for a moment. This is an historic moment in healthcare history. We're talking about the very first disease-modifying treatment that's been approved full -- has received full approval from the FDA and reimbursement from CMS. And there have been literally dozens of medicines that have failed before this drug ever got to market. And that's important for a couple of reasons, the first is that there is an awful lot we still don't know. We are really at the beginning of a journey to really understand Alzheimer's disease and how we can affect this disease. But it's also going to have a big impact on the practice of medicine. Physicians haven't been able to really help patients very much beyond perhaps prescribing Donepezil or products like that. And the treatment that we are proposing here really is going to change an awful lot of how physicians practice and treat these patients. So as we start thinking about intent to prescribe and how physicians are looking at things, we're actually not going to know that until we actually get out there on the marketplace and see how patients respond. ADUHELM did get approved. But as you all know, it never really got out of the blocks, and never really got launched. So this is really a first. And whenever you're first, you're going be discovering an awful lot and a lot of this is just not that predictable. I would, again just call out to, kudos to our colleagues at Eisai. Within a very short period of time, they were able to get the regulatory filings in the EU, Japan, China, Canada, Great Britain, and South Korea. So this is going to be truly a global launch. Now, we just had the AAIC last week, and Priya will cover off a little bit more about that. But one of the things have -- has become obvious is when we start looking at Donanemab and Lecanemab, these are two very different products. And I don't think most people have actually really looked at that. Most people are looking at, okay, we've got an A-beta antibody and we're moving plaques, but there's a whole lot more to this story, and this is going to evolve over the next months and years. This is a -- these are different products. They have different mechanisms because they have different binding. They've been studied in different populations. They've been studied in -- with different clinical study design process -- design approaches. And of course they have a very different safety profile. And all of these differences are going to play out in the marketplace over the coming months and years. And it'll be interesting to see how that is, but I would just caution everybody, as we get into this and you see all of the data, there is an awful lot of subtlety to this, and it's going to be quite interesting from a commercial point of view. The launch is underway in the US. We did get full approval earlier this month and the CMS approval that has significance also for others. This is going to encourage a lot of other companies to be investing and research in blood diagnostics. It's also, as you know, going to be an unusual launch. There's is an awful lot that has to be done. We're going to have patient navigators to help navigate the process to understand how treatment will occur, getting reimbursement. We will be working with physician offices. An awful lot of change will have to occur in the practice. New practices on a day-to-day basis. There's an awful lot of education around safety and making sure that the right patients are in place. We have reached out to about 700 centers to date. We're also getting reimbursement beyond CMS. We have Medicaid, for example, in 48 out of the 50 states so far, and we have -- had a very good response from commercial insurers. So, I think the launch of the LEQEMBI is off to a very good start and we'll, of course, keep you up to date as we get further patients. Now, move on to another slide here. One of the things that we've been doing an awful lot in the past months is really making sure that we are well-positioned for growth. And as we looked at the company, there's where we were. As you know, today, we have a relatively mature product profile. Generally, when you have a mature product profile, you would expect the level of investment to go down. But we have actually relatively high operating expenses when we benchmark versus other companies. Part of that is an over-investment in legacy products. But we also have an extremely centralized governance. We've got many organizational levels. We have a low span of control. On average, we have a span of control of three. And then as we look at the R&D pipeline, we've had five different heads of R&D in 10 years, and that's not good for an R&D organization. And as a result, we ended up with some products that I think were relatively high-risk and high-cost and not necessarily of the highest value. So we've been through an extensive project to really review those R&D programs. And as we looked at where do we want to be, well, we want to be making more value-based decisions for existing products. We don't want to just remove the promotional effort entirely. Biogen has still 25% market share in multiple sclerosis. We have the highest market share by a considerable margin. And so there is -- there are an awful lot of patients who depend on Biogen products. I think we can do that smarter. There is a need obviously to have strong investment in our new product launches. It's important clearly to manage cost, but shareholder value, most optimized, if we can really make a success of these launches. We need to get decision-making closer to the customers, we want greater agility in the organization, and we want to focus on high-value projects in R&D. External growth will really give us the opportunity to diversify away from rare diseases -- diversify into rare diseases, immunology, and neuropsychiatry. So we did this redesign effort. What we did was a bottom-up exercise to look at where do we need to be as a company you know successfully launched new products. What kind of internal governance mechanisms do we want? What kind of metrics do we want? What kind of accountability? And so there's been, I'd say, a complete redesign of Biogen and that will lead to some cost savings. There are gross cost-savings which will be about $1 billion in annualized savings per year. Of that, we expect to invest at least $300 billion in growth opportunities going forward. So this is an opportunity really to make sure in this year, before we get into the product launches, that we were truly fit for growth. And with that, I will turn it over to Priya. Priya Singhal : Thank you, Chris. We believe that the traditional approval of LEQEMBI is a significant milestone for the Alzheimer's field. We also recognize that the pursuit of effective therapies for Alzheimer's is far from over. Biogen and Eisai are continuing to generate data on LEQEMBI across the Alzheimer's disease continual. Amyloid pathology can begin years before the onset of symptoms. There is the potential to maximize therapeutic effect of LEQEMBI by treating earlier to delay or even prevent the onset of Alzheimer's. Eisai and Biogen initiated the AHEAD 3-45 trial in 2020 to evaluate this approach. This consists of two sister trials in cognitively unimpaired individuals aged 55 to 80 with intermediate or elevated levels of amyloid on PET screening, and they will be evaluated over 48 months. With the approval of LEQEMBI in the US, we also modified our protocol for the AHEAD trial to allow for open-label LEQEMBI rescue should patients progress to early AD while being enrolled in the trial. We believe the clinical profile of LEQEMBI is uniquely suited for the early intervention approach, with robust plaque clearance, low incidence of ARIA, and optionality of longer-duration treatment to potentially maximize clinical benefit. We are working to improve and simplify the patient journey for LEQEMBI in early AD. We have two areas of focus, a subcutaneous formulation where the auto-injector to potentially enable at-home administration is underway. Eisai recently presented modeling data at AAIC, suggesting that subcutaneous lecanemab provides similar exposure and amyloid plaque reduction as bi-weekly IV formulation but with the potential for lower incidence of ARIA. Regulatory filing is expected by the end of Q1 2024. Second is maintenance dosing. Evaluating less-frequent maintenance dosing in the Phase 2 open-label extension. Regulatory filing also expected by the end of Q1 2024. We are also continuing to analyze the Clarity AD data where we have observed consistent reductions in both amyloid and tau PET and improved clinical outcomes as we aim to better inform treatment decisions for patients. Clarity AD study did not use baseline tau PET as an exclusion criteria and enrolled a broad population of early AD patients with varying degrees of tau pathology at baseline. This important aspect of the Clarity AD study allowed the generation of data on individuals with low tau burdens that has not been collected in other Phase 3 programs. At AAIC, Eisai presented baseline characteristics and a new analysis containing the initial results from the tau PET sub-study of Clarity AD. In this analysis, individuals enrolled in the tau PET sub-study were categorized into high, medium, and low groups based upon tau burden measured at baseline. Lecanemab administration showed a clinical effect in the overall population of the tau PET sub-study, and notably, a large effect size was also observed in the low tau population defined in this analysis, which does represent the early phase of AD. We believe this data further support the clinical benefit observed with LEQEMBI in the broad early AD population. And again, emphasizes the importance of treating patients early. Biogen plans to build upon our industry-leading position in therapeutics for A beta clearance and tau knockdowns by advancing a multi-target multi-modality portfolio inclusive of also other emerging targets in the Alzheimer's disease pathway. This is inclusive of programs targeting tau. BIIB080, a Phase 2 targeting antisense oligonucleotide, and BIIB113, a Phase 1 small-molecule aiming to prevent tau activation. Tuning to SMA, the interim results from the response study were presented at the Cure SMA Conference recently and highlight that most participants, an investigator, and caregivers reported sub-optimal clinical status across multiple domains at baseline, following zolgensma treatment. This included motor function, swallowing or feeding ability, and respiratory function. Potentially, we believe this is due to lightly incomplete transduction of motor neurons following gene therapy administration. The internal results at six months show improvements in motor function in most participants as measured by the increased total HINE-2 score from baseline with no new emerging safety concerns identified. Overall, we believe these results suggest that there may be potential for additional benefit with SPINRAZA treatment following zolgensma treat administration. The R&D organization, as Chris mentioned, has spent significant time and energy over the last several months in conducting a comprehensive review of Biogen's R&D programs as we aim to improve the risk profile and productivity of the pipeline. We made a number of significant decisions and identified the programs we want to prioritize. And others, where we assess, the challenges resulted in a low probability adjusted return on investment and thus were promptly modified or discontinued. We believe that this has resulted in a leaner pipeline with an overall greater probability of success and a sharper focus on key programs. The example shown here all have data readouts expected over the next few years. BIIB080, a Phase 2 targeting tau targeting ASO which has 1b -- Phase 1b data showing a time and dose-dependent reduction in CSF total tau and phospho-tau as well as tau tangle visualized via tau PET. Litifilimab, a subcutaneous anti-BDCA2 antibody, currently being evaluated in two Phase 3 studies in systemic lupus erythematosus and a Phase 2/3 study in cutaneous lupus erythematosus. BIIB105, an ATXN2 ASO being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 study in broad sporadic ALS, we expect a readout mid-year 2024. BIIB122, a LRRK2 ASO being developed in partnership with Denali Therapeutics currently in a Phase 2b study for idiopathic Parkinson's disease. And BIIB121, an ASO aiming to increase the expression of paternal UBE3A in Angelman syndrome, and we expect the Phase 1 to readout mid-year 2024. In summary, this past quarter, we continued to make significant advancements across our pipeline, most notably, with the traditional approval of LEQEMBI in early AD. While our initial substantial review of the pipeline is complete, we will continue to evaluate both current and potential new R&D programs using a data-driven approach with a keen eye toward risk-balanced and value-creation. I will now pass the call over to Mike. Michael McDonnell : Thank you, Priya, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some highlights and color regarding our financial performance for the second quarter and all of the financial comparisons that you will hear are versus the second quarter of 2022. Total revenue for the second quarter was $2.5 billion, that's a decrease of 5% at actual currency and 3% at constant currency. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the second quarter was $4.02. Total MS Products revenue was $1.2 billion, that's a decrease of 15% at actual currency and 14% at constant currency. So a few recent updates to the MS business this quarter. First, the decline in MS in the second quarter was attributable to generic entrants for TECFIDERA and broad competition in the MS market. We did not see much in the way of channel dynamics during the second quarter. Second, as we did announce previously, TECFIDERA's regulatory market protection in the EU was extended by one additional year until February 2nd of 2025. Some of the TECFIDERA generics have not yet fully exited some of the EU markets, and some generic products remain in the channel. The pace of generic withdrawal has been slower than we expected and we're closely monitoring the situation and working to enforce our legal right-to-market protection. Regarding TYSABRI, we have previously said that there may be a TYSABRI biosimilar launch in the US and EU sometime later in 2023. We are aware of the positive CHMP opinion for the TYSABRI biosimilar in the EU last week. And while we have not seen any biosimilar launches so far, we could see an approval and launch in the coming months. Moving on now to SMA. Global SPINRAZA revenue of $437 million increased 1% at actual currency and 5% at constant currency. SPINRAZA growth in the US was 12% and that was driven by patient growth. We were encouraged by the performance this past quarter and believe we are making good progress against our goal of returning SPINRAZA to consistent growth. Also as Priya mentioned, we are continuing to generate data to support the efficacy profile of SPINRAZA. And we believe that this along with the expected overall market expansion should help enable continued improved performance for SPINRAZA. Biosimilars revenue of $195 million was flat at actual currency and increased 4% at constant currency. We are continuing to manage supply constraints for IMRALDI and BENEPALI, and are monitoring this situation very closely. We've referenced previously that we are evaluating whether this business could create more value outside of Biogen and we are engaged with multiple interested parties and we'll provide further updates on that process as appropriate. Alzheimer's disease revenue, which includes revenue from ADUHELM and the LEQEMBI collaboration equated to a headwind of $20 million to revenue during the second quarter. As a reminder, LEQEMBI revenue represents our 50% of end-market revenue less 50% of commercialization expenses. We expect this line to continue to be negative in 2023 as the ramping of LEQEMBI commercialization expenses will exceed initial revenue. Total anti-CD20 revenue of $433 million was down 1% and included a $12 million operating loss related to LUNSUMIO. As a reminder, starting this quarter, our pre-tax profit share on RITUXAN, GAZYVA, and LUNSUMIO decreased from 37.5% to 35%. And that's due to the achievement of certain sales targets for GAZYVA as part of our contractual agreement with Genentech. Contract manufacturing, royalty, and other revenue of $198 million was notably higher year-over-year, and that was driven mainly by the timing of batches. A couple of details regarding Q2 expenses. For the second quarter, non-GAAP cost of sales was 24% of total revenue and that includes $34 million of idle capacity charges. We continue to see higher-cost of sales as a percentage of revenue as a result of product mix and idle capacity charges, and in particular, the increases that we're seeing in contract manufacturing revenue increases our overall cost of sales as a percentage of revenue. So in terms of modeling for the remainder of 2023, I'd offer that we believe contract manufacturing revenue will remain strong and will contribute to a higher cost of sales as a percentage of revenue for the remainder of this year as compared to the 24.1% that we saw in the second quarter. Second quarter non-GAAP R&D expense includes roughly $13 million in estimated study closeout costs related to BIIB093. As Priya mentioned, we are now substantially complete with our R&D prioritization. We estimate that this will result in gross savings of approximately $250 million next year. So this will be partially offset by natural increases in R&D due to portfolio progression. The decrease in second quarter SG&A expense was attributed to roughly $70 million of savings initiatives and that was partially offset by approximately $35 million of reinvestments mostly related to launch costs. We continue to expect our operating expenses to be lower in the second half of the year than in the first half as we complete the run-rate savings from our previously announced cost initiatives as well as a modest impact from our new fit-for-growth initiative. So now I'd like to take a minute to provide a little bit of additional detail on our new fit-for-growth program. This program will include changes to our operating model with a significant reduction of certain centralized functions. A substantial portion of the $700 million of net annual OpEx savings are expected to come from a net headcount reduction of approximately 1,000, which we expect to right-size the company with our business plan and enable us to return to sustainable growth. I would reiterate that the OpEx savings shown here are on an annualized basis. We believe that this is an efficient program with 70% of our expected gross OpEx savings to be realized as net savings. All-in, we expect a very modest impact on 2023 expenses and believe the net OpEx savings will be split roughly equally between 2024 and 2025. And all of these savings are incremental to any previously announced cost reduction programs. A few quick comments on our balance sheet, including the approximately $813 million that we received during the quarter related to the sale of our equity stake in Samsung Bioepis. We ended the quarter with $7.3 billion in cash and marketable securities. On June 30th, we had $6.3 billion in debt and that puts us in a net cash position of roughly $1 billion. We continue to generate steady, positive cash flow from operations with free cash flow of $416 million during the second quarter. And finally, now let me turn to our financial guidance for full year 2023. The business remains on track with our forecast for the full year. And today, we are reaffirming our full-year guidance of a full-year 2023 revenue decline in the mid-single-digit percentage range as compared to 2022 reported results and full-year 2023 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of between $15 and $16. And you can refer to our press release for other important guidance assumptions. So now I'll turn it back over to Chris for a few closing comments. Christopher Viehbacher : Thank you, Mike. Well, in addition to re-engineering our cost base, we're actually also re-engineering the marketed portfolio of products. We've already had two approvals this year, QALSODY and LEQEMBI in the United States. As we look forward for the rest of the year and into early next year, we have a number of other important milestones for our portfolio. We are expecting a decision by the PMDA in Japan in the third quarter. By the EMA in Europe in the first quarter of next year. And in the first quarter of next year also in China. We also are expecting a decision by the FDA on zuranolone actually next week, potentially. And then, we also are continuing to evolve LEQEMBI. As Priya said, we are expecting to be able to submit the regulatory dossiers for LEQEMBI subcu in Q1 of next year and also a regulatory file for maintenance dosing next year. So in addition to that, with the new product approvals that are expected, we're going to continue obviously to look through our external growth opportunities. As I have said before, this is an opportunity to expand the portfolio more into rare diseases, and to immunology, and neuropsychiatry. So with that Chuck will turn it back and invite questions. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Chris. Operator, can we please poll for questions? Operator : Yes, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Brian Abrahams : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking my question and congrats on all the developments. So we recently saw some competitor data at a medical conference. And I guess I'm curious, as you've seen things evolve here, what are the most important learnings that you've been taking away on the overall beta-amyloid class efficacy and safety profiles? And can you maybe expand a little bit more on your latest views on how you expect the competitive dynamics to play out in this space and the impact to your overall launch strategy? Thanks. Christopher Viehbacher : Thanks for the question, Brian. This is going to be super interesting from a commercial point of view. Because there are an awful lot of different factors at play here. I think as I said, the markets are sort of thinking there's two A beta antibodies here and they remove plaque and that's it. And the story is actually a whole lot more complex. First, I would say, these are two products with -- that really go after the problem in a different way. And I think one of the most interesting things that's going to come out of this are the soluble protofibrils. These are the most neurotoxic forms of A beta. And Lecanemab goes after those, whereas Donanemab doesn't. And these are the soluble forms. And I think that will actually play a factor in our view, which is that this is going to be more of a chronic disease that you can remove the plaque, but these soluble forms, and this is judged by what we're seeing in some of the biomarkers, could actually still continue to play a role, which is why our belief is that we will need a maintenance therapy over time. But there's also a difference in how these patients were studied. First, much different patient populations. Lecanemab was studied actually in an earlier patient population, roughly two-thirds were in MCI and one-third in mild, and Donanemab was the reverse. And this is important because there's different rates of progression amongst these patients. And so, actually, and when Priya talked about these low tau, which have no overlap with the low tau -- low-to medium tau that Donanemab studied, these are patients that would really progress quite slowly. So to actually see an effect like that I think really speaks to the efficacy of this product. Then there is also all the different endpoints. Lilly measured their primary endpoint on a Lilly-designed endpoint. Lecanemab use the gold standard, which is the CDR sum of boxes. But when you start looking at activities of daily life, you start to see differences and there are some other markers where we think we can demonstrate where efficacy is going to be. And then of course, safety will be a big issue. When most neurologists -- if they've seen ARIA before, it's been pretty rare. I mean we do know that ARIA can occur even in the placebo group, but it's not something that'll have seen very often. And so this is going to be a different thing for them first to -- to think about monitoring for safety with the MRIs. But it's one thing to be at a conference and look at safety from a data point of view. It's another thing I think to actually be looking at MRIs and seeing ARIA. And I think the safety benefit of lecanemab will be quite important to physicians as we go forward. So there are a number of dimensions here that I think will be developed over time. There's going to be all the different blood diagnostics that come along. Personally, my belief is that we're going to be seeing treatment progressively over the years in earlier patients before too much neuronal death has occurred. And of course, that's where LEQEMBI's benefit will arise where they have already studied much more of these patients. Generally, I would say, Lilly has been focused on looking at subpopulations and trying to say, okay, in this subpopulation, we've got this result, in that subpopulation. When physicians are dealing with patients in their practice, they don't want to deal with the subpopulation. They want to have a medicine that actually has broad coverage. And I think that's where LEQEMBI will also demonstrate its benefits. So it's going to be quite interesting. There's lots of data here to pour over that's come out of the AIC and a lot of that will just become much more tangible over the coming months and years. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Chris. All right, can we poll for next question, please? Operator : Yes. Our next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with Leerink Partners. Marc Goodman : Yes, good morning. Mike just to make sure we're aligned here with the numbers in the cost savings. So OpEx, $4.5 billion for 2023. So we should be thinking $3.8 billion in 2025. And then how do we get there with respect to SG&A and R&D? Is this -- are they about even. I mean is R&D going to move below the $2 billion line? Just help us give us a sense of that? And maybe just as you talk about the P&L, just comment on, do you expect gross margins to be higher or lower in kind of those years, just to help us think about how the P&L is going to look. Thanks. Michael McDonnell : Yeah. Mark, thanks for the question. So, your math is correct. Our goal would be to achieve a full run rate of the $700 million net savings in 2025. So on an OpEx base of $4.5 million, that would take it to the neighbourhood of about $3.8 billion. The savings will be both in SG&A and R&D. We've already done quite a bit in R&D as we talked about, that will yield a lot of savings with our prioritization program. But we'll also be looking at ways of conducting our clinical trials, our existing trials more efficiently. So the overall savings will be a mix. We're not providing full granularity on whether R&D will be plus or minus the $2 billion number that you threw out. But I would estimate that the savings from here would be probably a little more weighted to the SG&A line and a little less to R&D. But ultimately, the savings will come from both sides. The gross margin, that's a trend that we expect will continue at least for the near term. And when you look at the product mix, we obviously have the continuing declines in some of the MS Products which are on the higher-margin side, and then you have contract manufacturing that's really growing quite a bit year-on-year. So we do expect to see our cost-of-sales as a percentage of revenue, at least for the near-term, to be a bit lower than what we've heard or I should say the cost-of-sales percentage would be higher, the gross margin would be lower than what we've seen in the past. And then over time, as LEQEMBI becomes profitable and ramps up, we should hopefully see some recovery up on the gross margin line. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Mike. Can we go to our next question, please? Operator : Yes. Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Truist. Robyn Karnauskas : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, I would just be curious initially as you're talking to doctors about if there is a difference between the academic community -- and the community setting and interest in using the drug and coordinating that. Can you give us more details as to how laborious and how easy the CMS registry, now that it's up and running, is there more questions they're asking? Thanks. Christopher Viehbacher : I think, first on the registry, all the feedback is, this is manageable. I think everybody would prefer not to have a registry, but personally been on it, there's dropdown menus, most of the data are available from the medical records, so we think that part should be okay. There is some bumpiness around the PET scan reimbursement that should be clarified in the next 90 days. But I think where we are now, the one PET scan that is included should not be a barrier. I think there's just the mechanics actually of -- I've seen patients that will change. There's going to be a need to do more of the cognitive testing, getting the PET scanner, the lumbar puncture, figuring out where to go with the MRI infusion centers, and then getting the three MRIs. There will be a routine that will develop in offices, but to start with, nobody is doing that right now, really. I mean, we obviously have some centers that have been able to start infusing LEQEMBI during the period before traditional approval. But if we look at the masses, everybody is having to gear up for this. I think one of the other things that I would say is, there's been so much disappointment in this field over the years. A lot of hope but a lot of these medicines didn't play out. And so, I think there has been an awful lot of wait-and-see amongst the some of the medical community. Are we really going to get full approval? Are we really going to get CMS approval? So I think now that is in place, which is, as I've said before, I think is a really seminal moment in healthcare, we'll see the practicalities of this. And we've always said that this is going to be a relatively measured uptake on revenue. I will say that the whole field organization is geared up for this. This is a much more complex field organization than what you would have with a typical launch with the care navigators, with MSOs, with field reps, with regional thought leaders, professionals. So they're going to be a lot of people actually holding hands with patients, with physician practices, trying to help make sure that this is as seamless as possible. And but it is not clearly as simple as just prescribing a pill and going down to your local pharmacy. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Chris. Next question please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Mohit Bansal : Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. And maybe a question for Priya. So when you think about subcutaneous LEQEMBI and you'll see the data later this year. But how do you think about positioning it? Is it -- do you think it is more of a maintenance treatment after the IV LEQEMBI versus an induction kind of treatment? And how important is Cmax to get an induction approval here? Super helpful. Thank you. Priya Singhal : Thank you, Mohit. So it's a great question. I think maybe before I answer that, I'll just say that Biogen and Eisai are really looking to simplify and improve the patient journey, and this is a multipronged effort. One is subcutaneous formulation, which can address the infusion capacity and other issues this potential for an auto-injector and self-administration at-home. And then the second is really thinking about how LEQEMBI can be positioned to really address the long-term duration question that is still out there. The good news here is that LEQEMBI does have the opportunity to be treated -- to be used with a long duration. And the question is, what is the right maintenance duration for this therapy? And with regards to subcutaneous, the data that we just presented at AAIC was modeling data to show that really the subcutaneous formulation would be about 720 milligrams administered weekly instead of the intravenous biweekly therapy. Now the important thing here to understand is that really, it is the hope and the data kind of point to the fact that safety could actually be better with the subcutaneous formulation. So we might have lower rates for ARIA. And the filing is expected to be complete by Q1 2024. I also expect that more data, Eisai has communicated this, will be released at CTAD this year. So I think let's wait for more of that data, which is, I think, forthcoming. And we look forward to the -- hopefully, simplifying the patient journey. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Priya. Next question, please. Operator : We'll go next to Umer Raffat with Evercore. Umer Raffat : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I feel like there's an elephant in the room and I do think we should speak to it. And Chris, this one is for you specifically. And the question really is, investors are very curious, what was your thought process on two specific occasions in the last few weeks? First, when you were first told about the proposed changes to the Board, what was your thought process? And second, what was your thought process in deciding whether or not you needed to put out any disclosures? Christopher Viehbacher : So I think if we just step back, I mean there's -- clearly, a lot of people got focused on some of the gossip here. But I think more fundamentally, there's been a significant change with our Board. And anybody who knows anything about Boards is that you only make significant changes at a Board is through a consensus of the Board. The Board is a college of peers with equal power. And there had been a lot of significant investor outreach. The company is doing an awful lot of change internally at a management level, addressing a lot of the concerns that investors, I think, have been raising for quite a number of years and certainly concerns that I have heard. And the Board actually said, well, we need to think about the governance and are we changing as well. And I can tell you that all of the discussions to which I was a party, all concerned one thing, and that is, what is right for Biogen. And I found that very encouraging. But we have a new chair and I have to say I couldn't be happier working with Caroline. She's someone of unimpeachable integrity, extremely smart, analytical, but really has a real passion for the mission of the company. And I think the Board is clearly four-square behind all of the changes that we're making. So I think all of that is good. In terms of disclosure, we look at people. We don't look at their personal relationships. And I would just say that Glass Lewis and ISS recommended Susan Langer, and investors voted her onto the Board, and I don't think there's really anything more to be -- that needs to be said about that. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Chris. Can we move to our next question, please? Operator : Yes, sir. We have a question from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Salveen Richter : Thank you, good morning. How is the fit-for-growth and your cost alignment work influenced your thoughts on M&A and BD? And you've noted the three disease areas, but can you just provide some thoughts on the value proposition across the areas? Any limits with regard to size of the deal and the use of equity? Thank you. Christopher Viehbacher : Fit-for-growth, remember, is really reflecting the transition of the company. We have been very focused on multiple sclerosis over 45 years. We had some very prosperous times in the more recent history of the company. And as we have seen a reversal of fortunes in some of those products, I don't think we, as a company, have really made the changes in our organizational structure and our cost base to really reflect that transition. One of the things I'd like to tell our management teams is that the hardest word in management is and. You have to think about the short-term and the long-term. But one of the things is you have to be cost efficient and you have to invest for growth. And that's been a very tricky exercise. If we didn't have all the product launches, just cost reduction would be fairly easy. What we've had to do is be a lot more thoughtful about what is the best way to position Biogen going forward? And that's why we didn't start with where we were, but we started with where we want to be. What is that organization? How many people? We benchmarked the organization. We've looked at the -- making sure we have enough investment in the product launches, have enough investment in those exciting R&D projects that we would want to focus on, and then work backwards from there. So I think the company is well positioned now to be oriented towards growth while also managing our historic portfolio. And again, I come back by and saying we are still the market leader in MS, and we have an obligation to both physicians and their patients on that. And so we will be changing the way we -- the promotional mix, but we're not going to just walk away from that either. And I think in terms of M&A and external growth, is really what do we do to build on that? And that starts with BD at an earlier stage of the pipeline. Are there things that we want to build on to that? And in particular, as I've said in the past, I think we're proud of our position in neuroscience. But neurological conditions are slow-progressing diseases and really require very expensive long trials. And they are ones where you can't really derisk them with a Phase 2 asset. So, we're not going to walk away by any means, but we do need to get into portfolio decisions where we can actually get a better read on efficacy and safety in Phase 2. And I think we can do that with the rare diseases with more of a focus on immunology. As you know, we've never been far from immunology in the history of the company. And of course, with -- we already are into neuropsychiatry and can we build that portfolio? But I think we have now a much more nimble structure, a more empowered organization. One of the things that comes out of our culture surveys is that we can take quite a long time to make a decision. So in all of those things, when you're dealing with partners and you're dealing with business development, if you want to have that nimbleness, that ability to be agile. And so I think fit-for-growth will actually facilitate that. But really the approach to external growth is more strategic in how we shape the portfolio of the company. Chuck Triano : And that limits the size or use of equity. It's part of the question, Chris. Christopher Viehbacher : I think we're really looking at what really makes sense for the company. I don't think we've seen anything that would require use of equity. And Mike, we've got, I think, about $7.3 billion in cash. So as far as I'm concerned, we don't -- everything that we think, we can manage with what we've got. The most important thing is to really -- one of the major things we try to do with fit-for-growth is really get a lot more rigorous about how we allocate capital. We've had this very good fortune over the last few years. And when there's a lot of money in the company, don't have the same rigor about how you allocate capital. That is a real focus for us. We really want to make sure that we're putting our investments in the things that make the best returns for the company and our shareholders. And so that part is a cultural shift that's coming out of that and I think that will affect how we think about business development as well. Chuck Triano : Great. Next question, please. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Yee with Jefferies. Michael Yee : Hey, guys. Thank you. Just wanted to ask on the zuranolone program. Obviously, you have PDUFA date coming up. But Chris, you've made some pretty bullish comments on this before. Maybe right-size your expectations about how to think about that opportunity and whether there could be a split label? And importantly, since you're talking about cost cutting, how a positive approval or maybe some various form of two different indications could impact expenses going forward? So just talk a little bit about zuranolone. Thank you. Christopher Viehbacher : Yeah. Well, we have a PDUFA date on August 5th. So we'll be able to give you a full update once we've had the FDA decision. So I don't really want to talk about that process right now. I'll just say there is an enormous unmet need in full health. And that only seems to be rising. You can't look at the news without reading about reports of the rise of mental health conditions. I think that partly got exacerbated by the pandemic. And one of the things is that, that affects -- that the pandemic did was I think really bring this more out into the open where it belongs. Certainly, PPD is a huge unmet need, massive taboo around that. And that will be quite a heavy lift actually because it's not really -- there isn't really a clarity around who really is responsible for diagnosing and treating mothers at that point. And so we look forward to being able to hopefully contribute to that. But there is a significant unmet need also in the way it's treated. I think something that -- that could act much faster than current treatments, something that's perhaps episodic, could be of great value to patients. So I do think there is an opportunity. But again, we need to wait for the FDA decision and we'll fully update everybody at that point. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Chris. Can we move to our next question, please? Operator : Yes. Our next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Tim Anderson : Thank you. I know that Biogen and Eisai continue to talk up the need to dose Alzheimer's drugs or LEQEMBI specifically, chronically and not just for a finite period. And you're talking about protofibril and how they're the most neurotoxic species and that sort of thing. From what I understand, the science is really thin that says you need to dose chronically in less soluble forms of A beta to really make a difference in terms of continued disease progression. And empirically, if we just look at what came out of AAIC, we see a similar level of reduction and improvement in cognition with finite dosing with Donanemab and we see continued curve separation with Lilly's product and your product. So doesn't that potentially call into question the need for chronic dosing? And isn't that possibly a risk with LEQEMBI, that docs actually only use it until plaque is cleared and then they stop, which would lead to a very different revenue opportunity for LEQEMBI? Thank you. Christopher Viehbacher : Dr. Singhal? Priya Singhal : Thank you for the question. Yes. So this is a very important area of query and scientific hypothesis. So maybe before I really talk about LEQEMBI or Donanemab, we can agree that Alzheimer's disease is really a progressive and eventually fatal condition with obviously neurodegeneration involved along the way. And what we've seen with LEQEMBI and actually multiple lines of evidence outside of LEQEMBI, also with aducanumab in the past, is that when you clear plaque, it does not re-accumulate that easily. But what you do see is progression of disease and you see an impact on the fluid biomarkers. So with LEQEMBI and with the gap period that we had in Phase 2, we saw an increase -- a reversion of the A beta 42 :40 ratio, implying the disease continued to progress. We saw very similar evidence with aducanumab. And I think what we see now with the plasma p-Tau levels, in the past, we saw with aducanumab sort of decreasing with the EMERGE data set. And with LEQEMBI, what we've seen with p-Tau181 is a stabilization. And actually, if you saw the Donanemab data on p-217, which was the plasma tau biomarker they used, and these track really quite closely is that you see a slight increase. So I think we still need to understand with more data transparency, the Donanemab data of what really happens to patients who stopped at six months or stopped at one year. And we hope we'll see more of that data from their open-label extension and be able to draw conclusions. But when you look at the substrate for Donanemab, it really does not make sense to continue to dose. One, because of substrate exhaustion and two, because of the presence of antidrug antibodies, close to about 84% to 87%. Whereas with LEQEMBI, you have the opportunity to have an individualized treatment duration discussion between the patient and the doctor because actually, it continues to impact soluble substrate, as Chris mentioned, and we are going to be generating data to actually look at this in a very systematic way with the Phase 1 open-label extension. So I think that the jury is out but the multiple lines of evidence do not seem to indicate that you can stop and reverse Alzheimer's disease. So that's where I'll leave it. Thank you. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Priya. Next question please, operator. Operator : Yes, sir. We'll go next to Evan Seigerman with BMO. Evan Seigerman : Hi, guys. Thank you for -- thank you so much for taking my question. So now that you've talked through some of the right-size that you plan on doing and now you're focusing on BD on the back half of the year. Can you talk about how you think about the value that still exists for BD in the market today? And are you focused on really near-term revenue opportunities to grow the business or earlier-stage development items? Thank you. Christopher Viehbacher : Well, it's quite interesting. You see today, when I talk to bankers, it's interesting. I think if you've got something that has really good data that, there tends to be a price for that, and that price is more or less constant. I was asking bankers, do you think Merck would have had to pay even more for Prometheus, for instance two, three -- two years ago when that's kind of the go-go days of biotech, and their view is no. And so, I think if you find quality assets out there and that really doesn't vary that much. What does vary is all the other stuff, right? We got a little bit more interest in more speculative things and that's what really sort of says, well, are things relatively expensive or not? And as a company, I think I always like to say, our investors (Technical Difficulty) to make them rich and not someone else's shareholders. So if you're going to do a deal, you have to make sure that there is value creation for Biogen and its shareholders. And that's a hard thing. And we all know that a lot of BD doesn't do that. The way I look at Biogen, we've got -- had now the decision on LEQEMBI. We have a pending decision at the FDA for zuranolone, we've got pending decisions for LEQEMBI around the world. If you look at Biogen over the next two, three years, there's an opportunity for a return to growth over that time frame. I think we are making some bold moves here to address our cost base and really reposition our resources in the company. And we have, I think, some super interesting products in our research and development pipeline that Priya mentioned. So if you look at it, we already have a value-creation story. So anything that we're going to do has to be accretive to that picture. And you do have to go look, and you're going to have to go look at hundred things before you find something that really works, and that's what our teams are doing. The worst thing you can do is fall in love with something because then you lose the -- you lose your objectivity. I can tell you that we are laser-focused on changing the trajectory of our share price, as I've heard from so many investors, our share price hasn't really moved in 10 years. So that's where we are focused on really driving -- being much more focused on shareholder value and that means allocating capital in a way that's commensurate with that. Chuck Triano : Thanks for the views, Chris. Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Ami Fadia with Needham. Ami Fadia : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe a bit of a follow-up on the last topic. It sounds like in the context of the fit-for-growth initiative, does it mean that from a BD perspective, you're unlikely to do a deal that's a significant lift from an R&D perspective over the next couple of years? And also if you could provide some color on how you anticipate gross margin to evolve between 2023 and 2025? That would be helpful. Thank you. Christopher Viehbacher : I missed part of that sentence about -- does that mean on the BD that we would not do something and I couldn't -- I didn't. Could you repeat the question? Ami Fadia : Sure. Does it mean that you would not do a deal -- yeah that you would not do a deal that is a significant heavy lift from an R&D perspective over the next couple of years? Christopher Viehbacher : Well, I think we have enough heavy lifting in R&D, to be honest. So I'm certainly looking at things that I think -- to me, it's less around the expenditure as how much risk you're taking. What I find hard is when we have a multiyear, five-year type Phase 3 study that's essentially a proof-of-concept. That's, I think, what we're really trying to move away from. Now what I would say though is, we are clearly benchmarking. And I really want us to be rigorous on G&A. I want us to be competitive on the sales and marketing. On R&D, I want us to be super disciplined on capital. But I would say all the benchmarking we've done is that Biogen has actually been better than average on productivity. And I do believe greatly in a lot of the capability within Biogen. And so, I do think if there are things that really make sense, I actually have a higher degree of trust in our R&D organization that I think that we should continue to invest in R&D. The really important thing is that you really -- the think secret about R&D is you have to design a killer experiment, define what the criteria are for moving into the next stage and don't allocate capital unless you really meet those data. The problem in a lot of organizations is we fall in love with something. The data aren't quite clear, but we'll go and keep going because we have it. And I think the discipline to kill stuff that doesn't meet its milestones is something that is probably more important than anything else to managing R&D investments. And that's why I'm grateful to have Priya because I think Priya is extremely objective on this. We all are. But again, I do think that we are an innovative company. And I wouldn't want to restrict too much Biogen's ability to invest in R&D over time, but we're going to be extremely tough on what it is that we're going to choose to develop. Michael McDonnell : And then maybe, Ami, on the gross margin line in terms of how we expect that to evolve. We said in our prepared remarks that we do expect to see our cost of sales as a percentage of revenue to continue to increase throughout the rest of 2023, and that's pretty heavily tied to the outsized contract manufacturing revenue that we're seeing this year. And without guiding beyond 2023, I can just say, trend-wise, when you look at some of our bigger ticket items, we've got the anti-CD20s, which are highly profitable. They're kind of flat to somewhat declining, has kind of been the trend there. You've got TECFIDERA, where you've got generic competition in the US. Obviously, we do have legal protection through the early part of 2025, but that's a high-margin product as you know. And so when you look at the growth trajectory of those products versus the contract manufacturing and we will continue to be aggressive in pursuing contract manufacturing opportunities if we can utilize them to fill space that we otherwise wouldn't use. You would expect that we would continue to see some pressure on the gross margin percentage. That's something that we'll manage. We are seeing, we did have $34 million of idle capacity charges during the quarter. That is something that we hope will abate over time as LEQEMBI ramps up and we're able to fully utilize our facility in Solothurn. So that would be potentially an offset. But we don't see real material increases in our gross margin percentage, that's something we're going to have to manage. And that's part of the reason why we put such a keen focus on our operating expenses and introduce such a meaningful cost reduction program. Chuck Triano : Great. Thanks, Mike. Next question, please? Operator : We'll go next to Brian Skorney with Baird. Brian Skorney : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Really just had one, you guys had a role in developing both LEQEMBI and ADUHELM. And one of the things that seems to be jumping out as sort of the differential profile of these drugs in terms of ARIA rates. But seeing as those differences despite very similar platform. So I guess there's a lot of speculation and maybe remains a lot of uncertainty as for the underlying mechanism. But any -- anything you can say in terms of sort of your thought process about how much of this may be is sort of subspecies target driven? How much of it may just be sort of a matter of PK? I mean, it seems like the comments on subcu indicate at least some of it may be Cmax driven. But just how are you guys currently thinking about the mechanism underpinning ARIA? Priya Singhal : Yes. Thank you, Brian. So overall, I think we don't fully understand the mechanism of ARIA, but the data have been replicated for LEQEMBI in terms of a low incidence of ARIA in the sense that when you compare it with some of the other anti-amyloid -- anti-beta amyloid antibodies, it is significantly lower and replicated twice. So, for example, in the Clarity AD study, we had an ARIA-E rate of about 12.6%. But with Donanemab, we see an ARIA-E rate of 24% and very similar sort of proportions with ARIA-H. So I think that it also depends on the population that has been recruited. And as Chris mentioned, these populations have been slightly different with MCI being in the early population because we really believe that patients need to be treated earlier. So that could be playing a role. But I think overall, it's very hard to assess exactly what may be driving the differential there. What I think we can say is that the observation that the incidence is significantly different. And therefore I believe that the benefit-risk is also different. And that, I think, is what doctors should be looking at. Couple that with the efforts that -- we do have a very clear window of susceptibility with ARIA and LEQEMBI that we see. We know that it's really pretty much circumscribed to the first six months. There's no titration, so we see the rates that we do. And then it really teeters off completely and recurrence is very, very low. This helps us because we can help physicians really get on board, stay on the monitoring plan, and that is really the focus of Eisai with their understanding ARIA program. So I think overall, we have to look at the benefit-risk. We've got the broad AD population that did not recruit via tau substratification for LEQEMBI and we have the results right up to tau PET because everybody , as you know, amyloid kind of progresses into the neurofibrillary tangles. And so, it's really helpful to understand that there is a broad application with LEQEMBI and then there's a risk profile that's also in the broader population. I think with -- we do have a box warning, as you know, with the ApoE4 patients who do have a higher rate of ARIA. And this, again, is really what we see across the different molecules. Christopher Viehbacher : One of the things, Priya and I had was -- so Robin Kramer and Priya over the weekend after this super interesting paper about all that happened at AAIC and the differences. And the thing that struck me is just really how complex this is and how -- how much there is to really analyze and understand. But one of the things that struck me was that there is a difference in safety not just in the broad population but we see that in every subgroup too. Priya Singhal : Yeah. Every subgroup. Christopher Viehbacher : I mean looking at the ApoE group, heterozygous, homozygous is a difference. And if these drugs were similar, you wouldn't expect such a dramatic difference. I mean we're talking about in some subgroups, it can be as much as 3 :1 ratio on the safety. And that's why I think we're going to spend an awful lot more time analyzing what's really going on here. And that's what I said at the outset. We're really just at the start of this. There's still so much we don't know, but this is going to generate an awful lot of research and we're going to start digging into this and understanding all of these different subtleties that are there. But I think these differences are going to be quite important. As Priya said, the jury is still out on that, but we have an awful lot of signs about what's really going on here. And that's why as a company, as Biogen, we don't see the launch of LEQEMBI as the end to our commitment to Alzheimer's. As Priya pointed out, we have other programs in Alzheimer's and we're going to be continuing to do research because it is really our ambition to be along with our partners, Eisai, the absolute leader in what we think is going to be an extremely significant market. Chuck Triano : Great. Thank you for the insights. Next question, please. Operator : Next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks very much for the question. I just wanted to appreciate all the color on the call. But I just want to come back to the LEQEMBI and kind of the ramp from here. I know you've talked about this being kind of a gradual process. But based on the early feedback you've had from the market with the launch, I guess any incremental color of that? Is this at going faster or slower than you might have anticipated? And maybe just as part of that, what have been the biggest kind of positives or negatives on the rollout so far as we just try to kind of better assess how to think about the next few quarters and years from here? Thanks so much. Christopher Viehbacher : Well, as to what you anticipate it's kind of hard, as I say, this is only the second time in my career where I've actually seen a brand-new therapeutic area actually open up. And so, when you think about Alzheimer's patients and visiting neurologists, beyond cognitive tests and as I say, perhaps prescribing the anti-cholinergic like donepezil, hasn't really been much to do. And now we do have a treatment. And this is going to upend a lot of the processes within neurology practices. It's extremely exciting. But really, the uptake is geared on how prepared are the sites. And this is variable around the country. You've had some sites. Obviously, they've been involved in clinical trials. Some of them have different patient populations and we see that some sites are quite advanced and are ready to go. Some sites have been more in a wait-and-see mode, but I think are all ramping up. One of the things that we have been doing is -- is really trying to figure out where are the sites that are really ready and actually deploying our resources to those sites with -- then a secondary type of approach to sites that aren't quite ready and helping them. So -- so it all depends on really how advanced the sites are, how ready they are that it's really going to define the uptake. And that's why we have to target our resources to that and really assess the site activation if you like. But so far, we're getting a lot of positive feedback. Physicians are getting a lot of inquiries from patients. I think they will have to figure out exactly what's the right patient for this and that's where we have to do a lot of education. And we have these online programs and other programs to help educate physicians. There's a significant amount. I mean you just talk about what we've been talking about in terms of these protofibrils, about the different patient populations, all of those things are going to engage the whole neurology community here. But so far, everything is -- as far as we're concerned, the launch is going to plan. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Chris. And if we can just take our last question, operator. Operator : Yes. Our last question comes from Paul Matteis with Stifel. Paul Matteis : Hey. Thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to just briefly come back to zuranolone. I've been really surprised by the lack of discussion on the call in the prepared remarks compared to prior calls. And can you just -- am I overly reading into this? I guess you're gearing up for potentially a new antidepressant approval. And Chris, at one point, you called this our most undervalued asset. So are you as bullish on this drug as you were before? And I guess if you didn't get the MDD approval, but that only got PPD, how would Biogen execute on that opportunity? Thank you. Christopher Viehbacher : Look, we're in late-stage review. So I think it's pretty normal that we don't want to disturb that process. And we obviously don't want to say anything that affects the FDA. I have to confess to a little bit of superstitiousness on my side. And I just -- I'd like to see the FDA decision and then we'll be happy to talk lots about it. But the opportunity is huge out there, Paul. Chuck Triano : Okay. Thanks, Chris, and thanks to everybody today for joining. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Business Update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Triano, you may begin your conference. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Ally. Good morning and welcome to Biogen's third quarter 2023 earnings call. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the earnings released and related financial tables including our GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today are located in the Investors section of biogen.com.. Our GAAP financials are provided in tables 1 and 2, and table 4 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally.  We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussion related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our expectations. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. So, on today's call, I'm joined by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Viehbacher; Dr. Priya Singhal, Head of Development; and our CFO, Mike McDonnell. Chris, Priya, and Mike will each make some opening comments and then we'll move to the Q&A session. And to allow us to get through as many questions as possible, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question. I will now turn the call over to Chris. Christopher Viehbacher : Thank you very much, Chuck. Good morning, all. I think we released a very good set of results this morning ahead of expectations. But of course, we're all too consciously aware that really what most of you are interested in is where's Biogen going. To that end, we outlined five priorities that we believed we needed to achieve to put Biogen in a position to be able to grow again sustainably. I think in the first nine months of the year, we've made an awful lot of progress. And indeed, I would say, the third quarter was a particularly busy quarter.  To remind you all what those priorities were really was to focus our teams and our resources on new product launches. And that is a little easier said than done. We're a company that has a long heritage in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. And teams get very passionate about patient outcomes and working with physicians and to move them to new areas does require a concerted effort.  The other thing we wanted to do is to stabilize and grow again, those existing products that still have market exclusivity for a significant period of time, notably VUMERITY and SPINRAZA.  The third thing was to really look at our cost base. Although we had a relatively mature product portfolio, we had one of the higher OpEx to sales ratios among our peer group. And we needed to address that. But more than that, we needed to really reallocate our resources.  Fourth was to really look at our research and development pipeline, particularly for the longer term growth outlook. We have really taken a deep dive into research and development, looked at those products, projects that perhaps no longer fulfil their original target product profile, where the practice of medicine had changed, where the probability of success had changed. And we have terminated those programs, so that we can focus on those assets that we think have the most promise. And I think we have a number of those, any one of which could actually meaningfully add to our longer term growth.  And the final thing was, we said right at the outset, we were interested in external growth. We always knew that the LEQEMBI launch was going to be a gradual launch. We always knew that. Also, even the zuranolone launch was an unconventional launch. And to derisk that profile, we wanted to look at external growth. And of course, we've been able to do that.  So as I look at where we are, in the third quarter, we actually had \u2013 LEQEMBI was the first anti-amyloid antibody to receive traditional approval for early Alzheimer's disease.  ZURZUVAE was a mixed bag. We got an important indication with postpartum depression. But of course, we missed on the major depressive disorder. As expected, we've received Schedule IV listing from the DEA.  And we also had QALSODY approved for treating a genetic cause of ALS. This is not necessarily a product that is going to be of interest to many of you from the revenue potential. But scientifically, this is a major milestone and validating the biomarker neurofilament, I think, will enable so many researchers to find further treatments for ALS and perhaps other diseases. As I noted, we closed the acquisition of Reata Pharmaceuticals, and that gives us a whole new growth opportunity. SKYCLARYS is off to a very strong launch, and we'll talk about that in a minute. But it also builds out our rare disease portfolio. As you know, we are trying to move into some adjacencies just given the risk of the neurological conditions that we have tended to focus on. And rare diseases has been a logical place for us to go. Biogen has been very successful with the launch of SPINRAZA and we think we can do the same with SKYCLARYS.  And as I mentioned earlier, we had the Fit for Growth program, and this wasn't just about cost reduction because we do want to reinvest some of that, but we really needed to simplify the organizational structure, to empower the organization more, and move more of the decision making closer to markets and customers. We have ended up taking an entire layer enterprise-wide out of the organization and, in some parts of the organization, even two layers of that.  So we do think those cost savings will add meaningfully to our earnings per share as we look forward. But I'm also looking forward to a significant change culturally and how we allocate capital and the agility and the ability to take decisions in the organization. Can I move to the next slide, please? So let's talk about LEQEMBI, a subject I'm sure all of you are very interested in. We have always guided that this was going to be a gradual launch. And we know that partly from the ADUHELM experience, but also just from the fundamentals of what we're doing.  This is a product that needs to be administered within a treatment process or care network. And those care networks did not exist at the time of the launch. So they have to be built. And doing that requires actually quite a significant change to the work patterns within clinics. And whilst IDMs and clinics are working really hard to put these in place, it, of course, takes time.  And I think a terrific example of that is the announcement recently by the Cleveland Clinic. We all know that the Cleveland Clinic is one of the most widely respected medical centers anywhere in the world. And they recently announced that they had just infused their first patient with LEQEMBI months after the approval. And I think that just speaks to the complexity that we're dealing with. And in a lot of ways, we not only are pioneering science, we're pioneering this this commercial approach.  So, of course, we have an aim of getting to 10,000 patients by the end of March. We're at 800 now. What gives us the confidence that we think we can get there? I think we have a number of greenshoots here, signs of progress.  The first is, as we look at our internal metrics of intent to treat and patient demand, we are seeing all of those things progress extremely nicely. The FDA not only provided traditional approval, but CMS actually moved very quickly, the day of traditional approval, as they promised. They actually have provided reimbursement and the patient registry has so far from what we hear from the market and been relatively easy to use.  We had some confusion around the reimbursement of amyloid PET. And CMS has clarified that. Now, of course, it's going to take a little time for that to flow down through to the max. But I think that will also relieve some of the confusion out there.  I think one of the most interesting things is we've got 60% of the top 100 targeted IDMs now having P&T approval. And one of the things that really gives me a lot of inspiration is usually these P&T committees meet twice a year, but a number of them actually have organized special meetings just for LEQEMBI and not wait until the next meeting. And that says to me that there's a recognition of the importance of this treatment and being able to get patients on treatment.  So where do we also go from here? Remember, a year ago from here, there was still skepticism about whether reducing amyloid plaque would really have a benefit. And it wasn't really till the CLARITY study was finally presented at CTAD last year that we really had, for the first time, clear compelling evidence of the benefit of removing these amyloid plaques.  And now of course, we can go and say, all right, that's tremendous. But why is that so tremendous? Well, for years, we've been trying to develop antibodies, and those antibodies failed. And that's what gave rise to the skepticism. Which were the right patients? Which was the right antibody that was going to get the right amount of drug into the brain? And LEQEMBI is really the first one to show that clear, compelling evidence that that has occurred.  Now, of course, we all want to get fancy. And that's where we're going. And we just had CTAD this year and think about what we've just done. We are generating more data to really demonstrate the benefit of this treatment. We've seen, for instance, that the subcutaneous treatment is going to work, that we have comparability with the infusion, and this means so much for the convenience of patients.  But this is no mean task either. Others have tried to do this. How do you get enough drug through the muscle tissue and into the brain? That has been achieved and is a major milestone. We've been looking at maintenance dosing. What happens when you've cleared the plaque? Does the plaque come back? Well, we have 24 months data now that shows a lot of benefit of staying on treatment. Then the question is still who's the right patient. And data were shown with early stage patients with low levels of tau. And those are fascinating data. We had 76% of those patients stable over the course of measurement.  And very intriguing and very interesting. We actually saw with 60% of those patients that we actually saw some clinical benefit, as measured by the CDR sum of boxes, completely unexpected. That generated an awful lot of discussion at CTAD.  So now, of course, we're also looking at executing on geographic expansion. We've had the recent approval of Japan and I'm traveling to Japan early in the new year to be with my friend and colleague, the CEO of Eisai to launch LEQEMBI in Japan. And of course, we've got global filings under review in the EU, China and 10 other markets.  So this is one where we're going to have to be patient, but all the signs are green at this moment. And for us, internally, we see a launch that is on track. But as we've always said, there's no real analogues. And every month, we learn something new. If I could move to the next slide, please, Chuck. Now, let's talk about SKYCLARYS, something that is much different. And as you know, we now have 1,180 start forms to date, with about 860 patients actually on drug. When we look at all of the known analogues, we're actually exceeding all of those, including SPINRAZA at the same point in time. Now, we have to be a little cautious because we all know that there would likely have been a number of patients ready and waiting by physicians. And I think that was even more of the case because, you may recall, that the product was actually approved in the spring, but then delayed for a couple of months due to a technical and temporary challenge on supply. And so, I think there was an anticipation.  Nonetheless, there's a very strong desire to see this product come. And we're actually seeing a lot of requests from countries around the world to make SKYCLARYS available. And that just speaks to I think the understanding that this is the very first treatment that has ever been approved for Friedrich's ataxia. This is an incredibly debilitating disease that affects so many young people right in the prime of their life. And so, it's extremely important that they benefit from that.  We had about $43 million of sales in the third quarter. One of the things that we are now working on and I think this is where Biogen can really add value is why is there 1,180 on start forms and 860 on drugs?  Well, there are a number of things. Trying to get reimbursement, you need genetic tests, we need to measure your liver enzymes before you go on the product. And one of the differences from SPINRAZA is that they're not all incentives. They could be out there in in primary care, physician care. And Biogen is well equipped to do that. We are used to providing genetic tests. We don't worry about the reimbursement. We provide those. We have mobile labs, so that we can help patients who are not there to major medical centers to get, for instance, the lab enzymes done. And also, we know how to pull through these start forms and navigate the difficult reimbursement situation.  So I think not only is there an advantage for Biogen in getting this important medicine to patients around the world, but I think even in the United States, we can actually make this more rapidly available to patients. So with that, I'll turn it over to Priya. Priya Singhal : Thank you, Chris. This was an exciting quarter for Biogen's development organization with the approval of ZURZUVAE in postpartum depression, as well as important new data presented for LEQEMBI and our tau-targeting ASO, BIIB080, two programs we believe that are critical to expanding Biogen's leadership in Alzheimer's disease.  Starting with LEQEMBI, at CTAD last month, Eisai presented new data on a subcutaneous formulation of LEQEMBI. We believe the interim results at six months showed that subcutaneous LEQEMBI was comparable to the IV formulation on the basis of drug exposure as assessed by area [Technical Difficulty] as well as amyloid plaque removal. In terms of safety, we believe the timing, frequency and severity of ARIA-E was similar across IV and subcutaneous formulations. Additionally, overall the incidence rate of systemic reactions with subcutaneous LEQEMBI was also lower with mild symptoms, as compared to first time LEQEMBI IV treated patients from the CLARITY AD core study.  We believe these results further support the intent to develop subcutaneous formulation of LEQEMBI and, if approved, may allow for greater patient access, improved compliance and convenience.  We've made significant progress in our understanding of the potential clinical benefit that is associated with amyloid removal in Alzheimer's disease. However, there are still very many key questions remaining on how to maximize the clinical benefit with these agents, including when to begin treatment. We believe the differentiated and straightforward design of the CLARITY AD study allowing entry of Alzheimer's patients with confirmed amyloid pathology, but low tau burden allows us to gain additional insights into the clinical profile of LEQEMBI across various stages of Alzheimer's disease.  The data show that in the low tau sub population, which represents the earliest stages of early AD, 76% of patients showed no decline and 60% showed clinical improvement at 18 months, as assessed by CDR sum of boxes compared to 55% and 28% for placebo, respectively. We are very encouraged by these results.  A second key question for the field is what happens when you continue treating after amyloid plaques have been removed? And why would this be beneficial? We believe that dual-acting LEQEMBI continues to support brain neuron function by also removing soluble, highly toxic protofibrils that can cause neuronal injury and death even after plaque removal. Therefore, with LEQEMBI, we believe there is a potential for longer term treatment to sustain or further the clinical benefit observed within the initial plaque removal phase. In terms of data supporting this potential benefit, when examining the 24-month data from the CLARITY AD core study and the open label extension, we see a potential clinical benefit from continuing to treat with LEQEMBI. Specifically, the separation in CDR sum of boxes between the group that continue to receive LEQEMBI or the early start group and the group who switched from placebo to LEQEMBI, the delayed start group, was maintained during the six month open label extension following the core study, suggesting a disease modifying effect.  The clinical benefit observed in the early start group at 24 months is further supported by the comparison against participants from the ADNI observational natural history cohort that was selected to match the baseline demographics and clinical characteristics of the CLARITY AD population.  Additionally, while the delayed start LEQEMBI cohort does not catch up to the early start group, we do believe a potential slowing of decline with six months of LEQEMBI treatment as compared to the ADNI cohort at the 24 month time point.  We believe the totality of these data support both the importance of initiating treatment early as well as the durability of effect observed with continued LEQEMBI treatment. As we aim to provide options for patients, Eisai is currently evaluating maintenance dosing or every four-week LEQEMBI dosing after the removal of plaque and plans to submit a regulatory filing by the end of Q1 2024.  Also, at CTAD, Biogen presented new data from the Phase 1b study of our antisense oligonucleotide targeting tau. In the new results in the small study for patients treated with the two highest doses of BIIB080, we observed favorable trends on multiple exploratory endpoints of cognition and function as assessed by the CDR sum of boxes, MMSE and functional activities questionnaire when compared to the baseline matched external controls at week 100. These findings build upon previously reported results from the BIIB080 Phase 1b showing strong target engagement in the CSF and a reduction in the brain tau pathology as measured by tau PET.  Biomarker data from the placebo control period and long term extension phase of this study were just recently published in JAMA Neurology. Viewed as an underlying pathology of Alzheimer's disease, tau has long been an area of focus in Alzheimer's drug development. While many prior attempts using monoclonal antibodies have failed, we now see from the Phase 1b study of an [Technical Difficulty] a convergence of evidence across soluble biomarkers, tau PET, and exploratory clinical measures suggesting a link between the reduction in tau pathology and potential clinical benefit.  As a reminder, our tau targeting ASO is a completely new mechanism, which unlike the antibodies is designed to reduce production of all forms of tau, including both intracellular and extracellular species. One clear challenge that we saw with antibodies was their inability to target intracellular species.  We believe these results, while early, are encouraging and we are excited to be enrolling the Phase 2 CELIA study of BIIB080 in early AD. Over the last few months, I have spoken about our efforts to reprioritize Biogen's development pipeline in an effort to optimize R&D value and productivity. This presented us with an opportunity to take a fresh look at our pipeline, and identify areas where we believe we have both sufficient expertise and confidence in the science as well as our ability to deliver meaningful new treatments to patients, while prioritizing resources accordingly. This starts with Alzheimer's where we believe we have demonstrated scientific leadership and are taking steps to build long term impact.  This includes first working with Eisai on several initiatives aimed at differentiating LEQEMBI and providing options to patients. Second, continuing to advance our ASO targeting tau as well as preclinical programs that span different molecular targets and approaches across the Alzheimer's disease biology. Lastly, continuing to deliver new insights on Alzheimer's disease biology and long term treatment with anti-amyloid antibodies. On this point, at CTAD, we also presented new data from aducanumab, including new data from the EMERGE long term extension and the EMBARK redosing study. We believe these findings can help support the field's understanding of the potential long term treatment benefits associated with anti-amyloid antibodies.  Beyond Alzheimer's disease, we have multiple near-term inflection points across various programs and therapeutic areas over the next year. This includes regulatory outcomes for LEQEMBI in several geographies, as well as regulatory outcomes for other products. In addition, we have important readouts for BIIB105 in ALS, BIIB121 in Angelman syndrome, and dapirolizumab pegol in SLE, all expected mid-year 2024.  Combined with the long term potential of programs like litifilimab, our homegrown asset currently being evaluated in two Phase 3 studies for SLE and a Phase 2/3 study for CLE, we believe our pipeline has the potential to support Biogen's return to sustainable growth. And with our partners on the research and business development teams, we continue to evaluate external opportunities.  I will now pass the call over to Mike. Michael McDonnell : Thank you, Priya. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to provide some highlights and color regarding our financial performance for the third quarter of 2023. And all the financial comparisons that you'll hear are versus the third quarter of 2022.  Total revenue for the third quarter was $2.5 billion. That's an increase of 1% at actual currency and 3% at constant currency. Non-GAAP diluted EPS in the third quarter was $4.36.  Total MS product revenue was $1.2 billion. That's a decrease of 14% at actual currency and 12% at constant currency. And that decline is primarily attributable to generic entrants for TECFIDERA, as well as broad competition in the MS market.  I would like to provide a few updates to the MS business this quarter. First, in Europe, we continue to see that some generics have not yet fully exited some of the EU markets, and we do believe that there may still be some generic product remaining in the channel. The pace of generic withdrawal has been slower than we expected, but we continue to closely monitor the situation and are working to enforce our legal rights to market protection.  TYSABRI biosimilar was approved in the US and EU which we had previously assumed. At this point, we are not expecting a launch this year, but we are aware that there are plans to launch a biosimilar in the first half of 2024. Biogen still has patents relating to TYSABRI and we will continue to enforce our IP. VUMERITY was a bright spot in the third quarter. We did see revenue increase 20%. That was driven primarily by global patient growth. However, we are seeing continued effects from both pricing pressure and an overall contraction of the oral segment of the market in the United States.  Next, global SPINRAZA revenue of $448 million increased 4% at actual currency and 7% at constant currency. The 7% growth that we saw included 7% growth in the US as well. And that was driven by patient growth. While outside the US, SPINRAZA benefited from the timing of shipments in certain markets. We continue to be encouraged by the performance of SPINRAZA the past few quarters and continue to believe that we're making good progress against our goal of returning SPINRAZA to consistent growth over time.  Biosimilars with a third quarter revenue of $194 million increased 4% at actual currency and 7% at constant currency. During the third quarter, we updated how we present commercialization expenses incurred within the LEQEMBI collaboration. Our 50% portion of LEQEMBI net product revenue and cost of sales, which includes royalties, will continue to be classified as a component of revenue.  Now, Biogen's 50% share of all global commercialization sales and marketing expenses for the LEQEMBI collaboration will be presented in the SG&A expense line and will no longer be presented as a reduction to revenue.  During the third quarter of 2023, we reclassified approximately $39 million of commercial collaboration costs from the first and second quarters of 2023 to reflect this change in presentation. These costs were moved out of the revenue line and into the SG&A expense line, resulting in a $39 million increase to both revenue and SG&A for the third quarter with no bottom line impact. This change in presentation does not affect any of our agreements with Eisai and we continue to share LEQEMBI collaboration revenue and commercialization expenses 50/50. This change will allow us to be more transparent in our reporting, and it's consistent with how some others in our industry report collaborations. This change will have no impact to Biogen's bottom line.  As Eisai reported in-market product revenue for LEQEMBI in the third quarter was approximately $2 million, our anti-CD20 revenue was $421 million, and that included $11 million operating loss related to Lunsumio.  Contract manufacturing royalty and other revenue of $304 million was notably higher year-over-year and that was driven mainly by the timing of batches and it also includes the reclassified $39 million, which I just mentioned. A couple of things to note regarding the third quarter expenses. Third quarter non-GAAP cost of sales was 26% of total revenue, and that includes $35 million of idle capacity charges.  Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue continues to be impacted by product mix, and in particular this quarter increases in contract manufacturing revenue. Third quarter non-GAAP R&D expense includes approximately $44 million related to our portion of the LEQEMBI collaboration and approximately $37 million in close-out costs related to the EMBARK trial for ADUHELM.  Third quarter non-GAAP SG&A expense includes approximately $82 million related to our portion of the LEQEMBI collaboration and that includes the previously mentioned reclassification of $39 million in collaboration costs from the first and second quarters of 2023 from revenue to SG&A expense. As compared to the prior year, the decrease in third quarter non-GAAP SG&A expense was driven by approximately $100 million in cost savings initiatives, partially offset by an increase in commercialization expense for LEQEMBI and ZURZUVAE as well as the $39 million reclassification that I just mentioned.  Next, a few brief comments on our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash and marketable securities and $7.3 billion in debt. And that puts us in a net debt position of approximately $5 billion.  Even though these figures include the majority of the payments related to the close of the Reata transaction, it is important to note that we expect to utilize an additional approximately $1.3 billion of cash for outstanding payment obligations related to the transaction. And that should occur in the fourth quarter.  We do continue to generate steady positive cash flow from operations and generated $518 million of free cash flow during the third quarter. In the coming quarters, we will be utilizing a portion of our cash flow to pay down some of the newly acquired $1 billion of short term debt that we use to partially fund the Reata transaction.  Next, I'd like to provide an update to our full year 2023 financial guidance which takes into consideration three key recent events. One is the completed acquisition of Reata. Second is the regulatory approval for ZURZUVAE in postpartum depression. And the third is the modification that we made to our presentation of the LEQEMBI expenses.  We're updating our full year 2023 revenue guidance to a low single-digit percentage decline. And that is an improvement from our previous guidance, which was a mid-single-digit decline. And that's of course compared to full year 2022 reported results. This is primarily driven by the update to how we present LEQEMBI commercial expenses which are no longer presented as a reduction to revenue.  We are also updating and narrowing our full year 2023 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance to be between $14.50 and $15. As we have previously noted, the acquisition of Reata will be slightly dilutive to our 2023 non-GAAP EPS with an expected impact of approximately $0.75.  Much of this impact comes from financing the transaction which affects our operating income and expense line, including incremental interest expense [Technical Difficulty] a significant decrease in interest income. Absent this impact from the Reata transaction, our EPS guidance would be narrowed to $15.25 to $15.75. And that's consistent with the midpoint of our previous guidance.  Further for 2023, we expect some incremental OpEx associated with the Reata acquisition. And that will be largely offset by decreased spending for ZURZUVAE as we prepare to launch in the PPD indication. We also expect some savings from our Fit for Growth program in 2023.  Looking forward to 2024, it is very important to note that as a result of the Reata transaction, we will have approximately $6 billion less in cash that was generating interest income at approximately 5% as well as an incremental $1 billion in debt at a blended rate of approximately 6.7%. I'd also note that, for the full year 2023, we've absorbed a headwind of approximately $0.30 to EPS due to currency fluctuations. And this is a dynamic that we're watching very closely for 2024. I'd offer that we estimate every $0.01 change in the euro versus the US dollar has a roughly $18 million impact to our P&L. I'd also refer you to our press release for other important guidance assumptions.  Finally, a brief update on our Fit for Growth cost savings initiative. I'd start by reiterating that the program maintains the target of approximately $1 billion in gross savings by 2025 as compared to full year 2023.  Since we first announced the program, we have not made any changes to our planned level of reinvestment other than the acquisition of Reata and the regulatory approval for ZURZUVAE in PPD only, neither of which were included in our original assumption. The expected impact of Reata and ZURZUVAE to the original program is approximately a net decrease in the expected reinvestment of $100 million. Or said differently, we now expect an additional $100 million in net savings, so the original $700 million in expected net savings increases to approximately $800 million.  I would also just highlight that these figures do not include the impact of the LEQEMBI commercial spend, which will now be reflected in our SG&A line and will of course continue to ramp up as commercial activity and sales increase. And I'd also like to point out that as before, the expense estimates presented today did not contemplate any incremental business development or any transactions related to the biosimilars business and they assume continued R&D spend on ADUHELM through at least 2025.  I'm going to now turn the call back to Chris for some closing remarks. Christopher Viehbacher : Thank you, Mike. So we're already into 2024 in our AOP planning. And as we look to next year, we actually we have a number of milestones, which is nice to see. As I mentioned earlier, we have an EMA decision on LEQEMBI in the EU and in China. We'll have a decision on SKYCLARYS in the EU and QALSODY in the EU, all in the first half of next year. We intend to have two more important regulatory submissions, one for the subcu formulation and also for the IV maintenance dosings, both for LEQEMBI.  And then finally, we're actually starting to see some development readouts in the pipeline. We expect the dapirolizumab Phase 3 in SLE in the new year. We have our ASO for sporadic ALS, reading out on a Phase 1/2. A Phase 1 in Angelman syndrome. And of course with Sage, the SAGE-324 program in essential tremor. So I think we'll have a number of interesting news points for next year.  And with that, Chuck, I think we can turn it over for questions. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Chris. Ally, can we please poll for questions? Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Salveen Richter : Just on the Reata assets here. Now with the acquisition closed and the launch progressing well, could you just give us your thoughts around key near term value drivers including the launch trajectory, the EMA approval outlook for early next year, and then expansion into the pediatric population? Christopher Viehbacher : Actually, when you look at SPINRAZA, SPINRAZA is a good analog. One of the nice things about the rare disease space is that we tend not to be so US centric. So when you look at SPINRAZA sales, it's broadly, not quite, but it's roughly a third, a third, a third between the US, EU and then the international area. And we expect the same really for SKYCLARYS. So we do expect significant value to come out of both EU, but also in Latin America, perhaps some in the Middle East, Turkey, obviously, for genetic reasons. There is none in the Asia region. But we do know that there are quite a few patients, for instance, in Brazil and in Argentina. So we are accelerating our efforts to file for approval in Latin America.  On the EU, you never want to try to predict entirely the regulators. We have to respect their decision \u2013 ability to make a decision till the end. But everything we've seen so far doesn't really change anything in our view of the probability of this being approved in the in the EU. And that represented, as you may remember, at the time of the transaction, we estimate about a third of the value of the transaction.  And then the pediatric study, we are in discussion with regulators. That will be actually quite important because there are a number of patients who start to become diagnosed as early as five or six years old, but certainly in that 8 to 10 year old timeframe. So it's quite important that we get the pediatric study underway. Operator : And our next question comes from Brian Abrams from RBC Capital. We moved on next to Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : Just had one on LEQEMBI maintenance? When we think about the strategy, I guess the question is, do you have regulatory color on a separate maintenance claim, just given the emphasis on plaque reduction initially? And related to that, would there have to be an additional level of evidence when you think about maintenance with respect to CMS reimbursement? Priya Singhal : With regards to maintenance, what I can tell you is that Eisai has communicated that \u2013 as you know, we're getting it every four weeks. This is with the intravenous infusion. And this data is expected to be filed by Q1 2024. I won't be able to comment on what it would lead to in terms of indication and such. But we are preparing the data for a potential filing. Operator : Next we'll go back to Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Brian Abrahams : Congrats on all the progress. So coming out of CTAD on subcu LEQEMBI, I realize FDA discussions are still to be had. But can you maybe help us understand your latest thinking as to what's likely to be required for approval? How much, if any, additional patient data do you think you might need to generate at a dose you might go forward with? Might you expect to be able to file for a lower dose based on PK modeling? And maybe you could confirm whether additional patients who are still seeing \u2013 flow through the trials there are still seeing exposure below the 125% upper bound? Priya Singhal : We are encouraged with the subcutaneous interim data that we shared and Eisai shared at CTAD. Just stepping back, the subcutaneous study was a sub study in the open label extension for CLARITY AD. The patient population that was treatment na\u00efve and where we were really assessing the PK/PD, which was the PK parameters, as well as the PD outcome of amyloid plaque reduction, was a subset of 72 patients. And in addition, the study was set up to gather safety and tolerability in an additional 324 subjects. So the total study population was 394. And what we shared was that we believe that the subcutaneous formulation showed comparability and bioequivalence with the intravenous formulation, and it was between the confidence intervals of 80% and 125% of exposure.  What we also noted was that the overall area under the curve was about 11% higher with subcutaneous. And we also noted that there was a 14% increased plaque reduction at the six-month time point. So these are kind of the observations that we have from the data. We have had prior regulatory discussions. And we're now embarking upon additional meetings with the FDA to share the data with them and discuss next steps.  So at this point, that's where we are. The plan is, as communicated by Eisai, to file for a BLA by Q1 2024. And that's really the update.  Eisai has also commented potentially on a maintenance subcutaneous formulation and filing, but that is much later in the 2025 timeframe. So that's where we are right now. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We're going to take our next question from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. I apologize. We're next going to now go to Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities. Robyn Karnauskas : I just want to get a sense of how you think about duration of therapy given your maintenance data. How should we think about modeling how long people might be on drug at this point with the knowledge that you have for LEQEMBI? Christopher Viehbacher : Why don't you start with that, Priya, and then I can finish maybe from a commercial point of view? Priya Singhal : Just stepping back, as we think about the Alzheimer's disease progression, we know that patients actually have plaque reduction. But we have data from several sources now, LEQEMBI, ADUHELM and others that show that while plaque reaccumulates slowly at a rate of about 3% to 4% based on current understanding annually, the biomarkers actually reflecting disease progression continue to accumulate as soon as patients are off drug, at least with LEQEMBI and ADUHELM. And this is based on the A\u03b2 42 to 40 ratio, but also other pathological biomarkers.  We've also shown most recently at CTAD that actually continuing patients on the 24 month \u2013 and we showed data on that, which I also shared in my prepared remarks, we saw that while patients who were on placebo during CLARITY AD study at 18 months and then transitioned onto drug in the open label extension, they never really caught up with the what we call the early start cohort. However, they maintained their difference with the early start, which we believe is a disease modifying effect.  And then finally, when we superimpose that with the ADNI data and the natural history data, we see that the patients who even start at 18 months actually maintain some level of stabilization on drugs.  So all these areas of evidence point us to the fact that really continuing drugs at this point [Technical Difficulty] is going to be important. You're absolutely right that I think we are still evaluating what is the right frequency and for how long. And that is what the maintenance sub study, which is part of the Phase 2 open label extension is evaluating. And that's the data that we are gathering. But we believe that drug will need to be continued for a certain period of time, and patients will need to be monitored. Christopher Viehbacher : More broadly, I would say \u2013 I've heard many neurologists say we used to think of Alzheimer's disease as a four to eight year disease, largely beginning with the onset of symptoms. With what we know now, a lot of them are saying we're thinking about this in 25 year terms. We know that patients start to accumulate plaques long before they have symptoms. And as Priya just said that even after you remove the plaques, there seems to be some benefit in continuing therapy. And as we think about that commercially, first, we have this AHEAD study that has launched looking at pre-symptomatic patients. It also raises the importance of blood based biomarkers because that's the only way we're going to be able to detect and diagnose, or at least triage patients initially at an earlier stage.  And of course, that's where the subcu formulation also becomes important. Because if we are thinking of people staying on drug for longer, and I'm certainly not suggesting 25 years, but this could be a much longer period, certainly than the 18 months, and therefore the convenience of a subcu formulation is even more important. So we are learning every day. I think we saw that at CTAD. We understand increasingly the importance of early treatment. We're seeing the importance of staying or the benefit of potentially staying on treatment. And so, that has all kinds of commercial implications and how we do more studies and develop different formulations. And it's actually quite exciting. Operator : We're next going to Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer Raffat : I wanted to focus on lecanemab subcu. And, Priya, I think you mentioned two things. One that there's a subcu maintenance filing, which is separate, which could be in 2025. Could you confirm if the dose is lower if it's a single shot instead of two? And also, the FDA interactions on subcu that you mentioned, are they a follow up to previously agreed upon trial design for subcu? Or do you think you need clarity whether plaque reduction alone will suffice for filing? Priya Singhal : First of all, I think on the maintenance subcu, that is really a much later potential evaluation and filing. So I won't be able to comment further on that, specifically with regards to dose because we first need to evaluate IV maintenance and that is really the next milestone that's on the docket here.  And then going back to your other question of what is the purpose of the FDA regulatory meeting, so maybe just stepping back, Eisai has had a number of meetings with FDA prior to the launch of the subcutaneous open label extension sub study that I spoke about and from CLARITY AD.  And so, what we do know is that we do need to show bioequivalence on both PK and then we need to show comparability on plaque reduction. And based on the six month data that we just shared, and Eisai spoke to at CTAD, we believe we have achieved that. And so that's the first part.  The second part is with that \u2013 because we have an 11% increase with overall AUC, area under the curve, exposure and 14% increased plaque removal, at the six month time point, does that result in a different dose? I think that that is really a matter of discussion, and we would have to discuss that with the FDA. So can't really comment more on that. But most importantly, I think the goal here was to show bioequivalence, which we believe we have achieved. Operator : And next we'll go to Michael Yee with Jefferies. Michael Yee : I wanted to come back to a topic on the AHEAD 3-45 study. I believe that your partner, Eisai, commented there could be an interim analysis based on 400 patients and biomarkers. I notice that it's been enrolling for a while, but maybe it just sort of is picking up steam. Can you just maybe talk a little bit about the progress of that study, how you see that study and the status of patients getting in? Priya Singhal : What I can tell you is that it's a very important part \u2013 the AHEAD 3-45 study is a very important part of the overall development plan for LEQEMBI as an anti-amyloid agent. And the reason for that, I think Chris mentioned it as well just a few minutes ago, that we know that plaque builds up \u2013 amyloid plaque builds up for many years. And then there's sort of a shift where tau tangles start appearing. And then you have the appearance of symptoms.  So, over the last several years, there's been a lot of work on clinical staging and such. And we know that the anti-amyloid agents that are currently like \u2013 just like LEQEMBI, which is really the only one with traditional approval, is targeting mild cognitive impairment \u2013 patients with mild cognitive impairment as well as mild dementia. But these patients already have symptoms and potentially a burden of doubt. The purpose of AHEAD 3-45 is to look at different levels of amyloid plaque in patients who do not have symptoms, and see whether the addition of an anti-amyloid agent like LEQEMBI can alter the costs of disease. So that's really the overarching aim of a study like AHEAD 3-45. It's a very large study. As you can imagine, it's hard to find the patients. But we are very pleased with the progress that the study is making. And as Eisai commented very recently, there is the potential to do an interim analysis and think about whether other regulatory pathways are open with interim data. But we haven't really commented beyond that. These remain possibilities, but I think it will depend on how well we do with the recruitment and what the goals of eventual patient access are. Operator : And next, we'll go to Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Terence Flynn : Just a two part for me. Just was wondering if you can provide any more detail on the breadth of prescribing for LEQEMBI? I know you give us the 800 patient number. But if you look at how many centers that's across, that would be helpful.  And then I know you made some comments on some progress on the MAC coverage. Any more details on the timelines there for when we might get broader coverage at the MAC level? I know there's a couple of MACs already covering, but anything there would be helpful. Thank you. Christopher Viehbacher : Terence, I don't have any real update on the MACs. There's, I think, what, a dozen of them and they're at various stages. I think by the time that's more \u2013 that most of them have got there, I think there's an assumption that that takes anywhere from 60 to 90 days to get through. So towards the end of the year. On coverage, it's one of the most interesting things is really just the diversity of situations that we see. I talked to some physicians in some major medical centers. They've got the protocol, they've got the treatments, they're putting patients through on a regular basis. But I've been talking to some major medical centers. You might think they've got this all handled, and they're still thinking about these protocols. And it's protocols around what's the right profile of the patient to put in this. There is a teamwork approach on this. And so, people have to connect on that. For some of the IDMs, they have all of the elements, but they have to connect internally with their MRI centers with the infusion centers.  So it's a little hard to give you a broad brush. I would say, every day, we are finding more and more patients, obviously, getting through the course. We are looking upstream at a number of indicators because really revenue is a lagging indicator between \u2013 even when we start looking at registry results, it's somewhere between four to six weeks before we actually see those patients going on drug. But some of those timelines are changing constantly. So it's a pretty moving process here. It's just \u2013 every day changes.  That's where, at some point, we get enough momentum, we get enough of these barriers cleared. One of the biggest is still the getting an appointment with a neurologist. And that's where I think we're looking at what can we do with blood based biomarkers, which are now available not obviously to replace PET scans or MRIs, but can we use them to triage patients, so that those who actually get into a neurology clinic are the ones who are already eligible.  So there's an awful lot of thinking right on the fly as we learn from this experience. Again, this is really one where there's \u2013 there aren't really great analogs. I know some people try to suggest the CAR T approach. And while that is also a product in a process, the volumes \u2013 the scale of this is much different. And we're not obviously anywhere near as complex as a CAR T approach.  So for us, there's not really any analogues we can do. And so, we're learning on the fly as we go along. But like I say, every day brings progress. And all of the indicators are in green so far, and it is really just getting enough critical mass now of all the centers who've got these care networks and care pathways in place. Operator : And next, we're going to go to Paul Matteis from Stifel. Paul Matteis : Chris, you just mentioned getting an appointment with neurologists. And then earlier in the call, you talked about the registry requirement not being as much of a challenge. I wanted to ask about the other components of the infrastructure here with LEQEMBI, IVs, PET scans and MRIs? How would you rank order these components of the equation as it relates to most and least challenging for centers to navigate? And how do you envision this kind of whole infrastructure network looking by saying next summer? Christopher Viehbacher : The situation is a little heterogeneous. It's not quite the same situation in every center. But I would say, based on what we know today, I do think there's clearly, at the moment, the need to get an appointment with a neurologist. The reality is that there weren't that many patients already in neurology practices. They tend to be in PCP practices. And the neurology practices \u2013 neurologists were already busy. And we have quite a volume of patients now to put through those neurology practices and a lot of them are realizing, I may be have to staff up on here. Do I have enough business to justify staffing up and not necessarily with neurologists, but perhaps with nurse practitioners, others who can take on some of the parts of the care pathway. For some of them, it's going through their internal governance process and determining which patients, I think, appropriately at this stage.  There's clearly an awful lot of caution around ARIA. My personal belief is that, over time, neurologists will become more accustomed to understanding ARIA. Is there a difference between the asymptomatic and the symptomatic? And they'll have a lot more experience but they're looking at making sure that the patients who go through are trying to get to have the least risk of ARIA.  I don't think the infusion center capacity seems to be a big issue for most centers. PET scans, there are enough PET scans as far as we can tell. It's really been around how do I get reimbursement for it? Is it just one? And it was more the confusion around \u2013 so I think the clarity of that will just take one of the factors of discussion and time out of the process.  There is just at each stage \u2013 if you send someone out for the PET scan, the scan has got to come back, it's been interpreted by a PET scan reader there, but sometimes a physician will want to have someone in that practice read that. And it's just connecting \u2013 sending the patient to all these different points, even if you're an integrated delivery network.  So I don't think it's necessarily any one thing, although I would say, if we can do a better job of getting patients triaged even before they can get to the neurologist, that could certainly be helpful.  But I think it really is \u2013 this is changing, the practice paradigm for a lot of clinics. And they're all having to work through it. And these, of course, are super busy people. They've got other needs. And so trying to fit in the time to actually manage all this is actually a challenge.  So I think it's completely natural and expected that this is progressing slowly. But again, you see some who are racing ahead. And that certainly gives me the confidence that others are going to figure this out, too. Operator : We can go to our last question. And that'll be from Phil Nadeau from TD Cowen. Phil Nadeau : I want to ask about the SKYCLARYS EMA review? Could you give a bit more of an update on what the status of that review is? Has there been a need for a whole explanation? And generally, what's Biogen confidence that a positive CHMP opinion will be secured in the first half of 2024? Priya Singhal : Overall, just stepping back during diligence, we reviewed regulatory correspondence. And we had a certain level of understanding of the topics. And subsequent to closing the deal, we have had more regulatory interactions, and nothing has changed our view, as Chris mentioned. We'd still expect to see an outcome in early 2024. So that remains on track.  With regard to whether or not there will be an oral explanation, that is really something we don't comment on because it's under review. And that's part of the review details. So I hope that helps. Chuck Triano : And this will conclude our call. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. And the IR team will be available later on, of course, for any other follow-up questions. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Katie and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2023 Earnings Call and Business Update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Triano, you may begin your conference. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Katie. Good morning and welcome to Biogen's fourth quarter and full-year 2023 earnings call. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the earnings release and related financial tables including our GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today are located in the Investors section of biogen.com. Our GAAP financials are provided in tables 1 and 2, and table 4 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted the slides on our website that will be used during this call. I would like to point out also that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our expectations. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I'm joined by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Viehbacher; Dr. Priya Singhal, Head of Development; and our CFO, Mike McDonnell. Chris, Priya, and Mike will each make some opening comments and then we'll move to the Q&A session. To allow us to get through as many questions as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chris. Chris Viehbacher : Thank you, Chuck. Good morning, everybody. A year ago, I had the -- an opportunity of presenting Biogen's quarterly results for the first time. At that time, we expressed the objective of returning Biogen to sustainable growth. And I think in the intervening year we've made substantial progress and today it is a great amount of pride and pleasure that we can announce earnings guidance, which Mike will go into in greater detail, which says that we will -- we are expecting to see positive earnings per share growth. And as I have said on a number of occasions, once we can get Biogen growing, we really see it Biogen becoming a growth company for the foreseeable future. We have very little, if we have in fact no exposure to Inflation Reduction Act with our current portfolio. We don't have any new patent expiries really coming in anytime soon other than those that are already known. And I think we've undertaken a number of other measures that really reposition Biogen for growth. Now if I just review some of those things, the first is -- was really to refocus the company on growth drivers, in particular our new product launches. Biogen had four new product launches from approvals from the FDA last year. That's the second highest of anyone in our industry. And you know that required quite an awful lot of cultural change. The multiple sclerosis franchise has been the stalwart of our company for since its inception 45-years ago. Our people are passionate about the physicians to treat multiple sclerosis and the patients who have multiple sclerosis. And we are still a market leader in this space. However, that is a franchise that is facing increasing competition and we have to embrace new therapeutic categories and new businesses. And so we have really had a major shift in resources and focus, particularly towards LEQEMBI, ZURZUVAE, SKYCLARYS, and QALSODY. We also though have still some products with patent protection, again, with substantial competition. And if I take a product like SPINRAZA, analyst forecasts had shown forecasts that this product would decline. Particularly proud of our teams in demonstrating that they could bring this product to -- back to actually even modest growth. Obviously, the mode of administration of products can be a competitive advantage. So if you have a pill, you're going to be a lot more preferred than if you have an infusion, for example. But what we see in some of these really devastating diseases is that efficacy is still the most important factor. And that is why SPINRAZA continues to be a leader in its segment. And Biogen is extremely good at being able to develop the medical evidence to support the value proposition of its products. As many of you told me when I first came into the company, you know, you've got a mature product portfolio, but you've got one of the highest cost bases in our industry. And we took steps to address that. We -- but it wasn't just around reducing cost. We wanted to reengineer the business. We were shifting our focus, entering new therapeutic categories, and we needed to think about capabilities, we needed to think about the agility of the organization, the number of layers of management that we have. And so we implemented a fit-for-growth reengineering project. We've already achieved $200 million of savings, and we're on track to realize approximately half of the 800 million of net savings by the end of 2024. That's, of course, a gross savings of $1 billion. And then we had to look at research and development. And Biogen is an extremely interesting company. All of the diseases that Biogen targets are really devastating diseases, and we target -- and there is a lot of pride in the fact that we go and try to find solutions for diseases where nobody else is doing that. But of course, when you do that, you're pioneering. You're pioneering, because we don't really understand often the underlying disease biology of these conditions, and so we end up taking a lot of risk, and these trials can be really quite expensive. And yet we do need a company like Biogen in our world, and so our objective has been to really focus research and development investments on those products that will have the greatest impact. And of course, we have to manage the risk in the portfolio. We have to have Biogen as a sustainably growing company and one which is attractive to investors. We need the capital to go and invest in new projects. And so I think with Priya's help, we've been able to take an extremely disciplined and objective view to the pipeline. We have four data readouts this year, again, on extremely important illnesses, and Priya will talk more about that. And as we go into next year, we're going to be looking at how do we reinforce that pipeline? How do we rethink our research efforts? A lot has changed in science, but we haven't necessarily done that kind of change at Biogen. So I think research and development is extremely important to Biogen and I think continued to be a source of growth for the future. Now, as we look at what does drive growth, clearly we have LEQEMBI. And I'll remind everybody that, again, we are not just pioneering in science, but pioneering in commercial. One of the interesting things about this disease is that if we talk about the efficacy of the product, a lot of cases we're looking at the characteristic of a product, but actually when you talk about efficacy, you're talking about are you in the right patient? And in fact, for decades, our industry invested in drugs which failed to demonstrate a benefit in Alzheimer's disease. And there were two main problems with that. One was we couldn't get enough drug across the blood-brain barrier, and we weren't in the right patient. Clarity was the first study to really convincingly demonstrate the importance of reducing plaque and the impact on cognition. But we know that some data that we showed at CTAD that we believe that the earlier you can go, the more likely it is you're going to show even a greater efficacy, because we're not -- we're really in the business of trying to protect neurons or create an environment where injured neurons can recover. And so we have a huge investment in our AHEAD study to look at presymptomatic patients. We're investing in what happens when you remove the plaque and looking at maintenance. We're trying to make this more convenient for patients by having a subcutaneous formulation. And so this -- the pioneering continues. And the pioneering also is out there in the marketplace. Patients with Alzheimer's are not in the system today and are coming into the system. So we've got approximately 2,000 patients on therapy at the moment. Now, we don't have as companies direct access to the patient registries. You all know about the CMS registry, but there are a few other registries out there like ALZ-NET, for example. And we have seen some analysts have been able to access that data. There was one analyst report of 3,300 patients on the registry. Latest information that we have, and again, this is not perfect information, but we have an indication that there are about 3,800 patients as of last week on the registry. When you look at that, that suggests we're getting about 260, 265 patients per week in the month of January. And as far as we can tell, that's about a 56% increase over what we were seeing in December. So we are clearly seeing that there is demand for the product. We're clearly seeing that IDNs are moving to put in place the care pathways and the treatment protocols to improve access. 70 out of the top 100 IDNs have had positive P&T committee decisions. 80% of those have now actually ordered LEQEMBI. But if we talk to the people who are doing the PET scans, the MRIs, the people who sell the blood diagnostics, everybody is reporting increased activity and volume. And so -- and as you saw with Eisai's results, their belief is that for all the patients on treatment, there are at least three or four-fold of those who are actually in waiting rooms. So we do believe we're making very solid progress. And we believe that we have validated the go-to-market model. And now that we have enough IDNs with reimbursement and care pathways in place, we believe that it's also time now to increase our level of promotion out there. And so as Eisai has announced, we will be expanding total U.S. field force by about 30%. And as was already previously agreed last year, that once we had the go-to-market model really validated, that it's now time for Biogen colleagues to also go and visit physicians. And of course, we've seen the launch in Japan. I was there for the launch meeting, and Biogen's very proud to be working alongside our colleagues from Eisai on the launch in Japan. And we've seen LEQEMBI approved in China, and that launch will be from later this year. So everywhere we look with LEQEMBI, we are making solid progress. This is, as we have said before, a launch that really doesn't have an analog. We have always guided investors to the fact that this would be a progressive ramp, and that's what we're seeing. And we continue to believe in the long-term importance of LEQEMBI, both to patients and to our financial results. Moving on to SKYCLARYS, you've seen the launch numbers for the U.S., we have about 1,000 patients now on therapy. We don't have a pediatric indication yet. So the potential population's about 4,500. So we've got a little over 20% of the patients on therapy within about six months of launch. There\u2019s an awful lot of complexity to launching these rare diseases, and I think this is where Biogen has an awful lot of strength. There's a lot of logistics issues with specialty pharmacy and reimbursement. And so we have already been able to demonstrate that we can reduce the time from the start form to shipment by 45%. We've got about two-thirds coverage out there in terms of reimbursement. And of course, patients and their physicians need an awful lot of support out there. And so we have patient services and family access managers, who are assisting patients and physicians to navigate the care pathways. One of the things that we see with SPINRAZA is that we do about a third of our sales in the U.S. and two-thirds ex-U.S., and we expect that to be a model for SKYCLARYS. Last night, we announced the formal approval by the European Commission for SKYCLARYS. We have expanded access program in a number of European countries, and we are in the process of setting those up in other countries, including those outside of the U.S. We have a global filing strategy that is underway to make sure that all patients with Friedreich's Ataxia can benefit from SKYCLARYS. And of course, we are actively working on doing the studies that would be needed to obtain the indication for children under age 16. ZURZUVAE, postpartum depression, enormous unmet need, tremendous media coverage. We're talking about maternal health and we're also talking about mental health. And those are two key trends in our societies today. It has been difficult often for mothers to seek treatment and get treatment. It is estimated about 80,000 women are diagnosed every year, but the incidence is believed to be way in excess of a half a million. So there's an awful lot of work to do to really get outreach to women, who are suffering from postpartum depression. I have to say the initial indications of launch are well above expectations and very promising, but it's six weeks of data. So I think we want to see more data to really come to any firm conclusions, but everything that we are seeing is extremely positive. We were originally positioning this product for major depressive disorder and we pivoted to postpartum depression that meant we've had to go back and recontract with payers. I have to say I'm highly appreciative of payers, because they have actually been honoring prescriptions even though we haven't got all of our contracting in place, and I think that is actually also helping with demand. So with that, I'll turn it over to Priya because I think increasingly what we'd like to also start to talk about is not only what we're selling, but the new hope for patients that's coming out of our pipeline. So I'll turn that over to you, Priya. Priya Singhal : Thank you, Chris. As we previously discussed, we have focused on reviewing and prioritizing our development pipeline with a keen eye towards maximizing probability of success and increasing potential return on investment, as Chris noted. The intention was always to focus our pipeline to better represent a risk-reward balance, and one that we believe could help Biogen reach the goal of achieving sustainable growth. While this effort resulted in a number of program discontinuations last year, specifically in areas we perceived significant regulatory development or commercialization challenges. We also highlighted areas where we had deep expertise and promising pipeline programs and therefore warranted an invest-to-win approach. One such area is Alzheimer's disease where we have an industry-leading pipeline, and we do expect to continue investing in order to expand our leadership. This starts first with building upon our opportunity with LEQEMBI. Our first priority is to continue working with Eisai to help ensure that LEQEMBI is available globally to patients suffering from early Alzheimer's disease. With approvals now obtained in the U.S., Japan and China, and filings currently under review in 14 additional markets, we believe we are well on our way to achieving this goal. Second is creating additional treatment options for patients. The data presented at CTAD last year on LEQEMBI suggests that there is continued benefit associated with treatment out to 24-months, and that treatment earlier in the disease course had a greater effect on clinical outcome. For this reason, we are working with Eisai to submit a filing for maintenance dosing with IV LEQEMBI or every four-week treatment, as well as evaluating LEQEMBI administration in preclinical AD, as Chris mentioned, in the AHEAD 3-45 trial, which is before the onset of symptoms. Eisai also aims to submit a filing for subcutaneous version of LEQEMBI by the end of March. Beyond LEQEMBI, Biogen is also advancing pipeline programs targeting tau. We believe tau represents the next frontier in Alzheimer's therapeutics, and we are working to support the development of diagnostic tests and pathways. Our ASO targeting tau, BIIB080, represents a new mechanism for targeting tau distinct from prior antibody attempt. In the Phase 1b study, we saw a convergence of target engagement, reduction in tau pathology in the brain, and improvement in exploratory measures of clinical outcome. We are very encouraged by these results and are currently evaluating BIIB080 in the Phase 2 CELIA study. We also have BIIB113 of Phase 1 small molecule aiming to reduce the aggregation of tau. Importantly, Jane and the research organization is also focused on the future of Alzheimer's treatments and is pursuing a multimodality approach to evaluate a number of other potential targets implicated in Alzheimer's disease biology. Looking beyond Alzheimer's disease, Biogen has an opportunity to expand our growing rare disease portfolio. We see rare disease expertise as a core competency at Biogen. I will now address BIIB121 in Angelman's syndrome. Angelman's syndrome is a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder that occurs in approximately one in 15,000 live births worldwide. It is diagnosed in early childhood and is characterized by symptoms such as severe developmental delays, speech impairment, problems with movement and balance, and may involve seizures. While there is no specific treatment approved, individuals with Angelman's syndrome will generally have a near-normal life expectancy. However, they will generally require continuous care and are unable to live independently. Normally, the paternal allele of the UBE3A gene is silenced in neurons, leading to expression of only the maternal allele. In Angelman's syndrome, the maternal allele is either absent or inactivated through genetic mutation, leading to loss of UBE3A gene expression and impairment of synaptic connections and brain network activity. This can be visualized by an increase in low -- slow brainwaves or called delta waves. BIIB121 aims to remove the silencing of the paternal allele in order to restore expression of the UBE3A gene. While the HALOS 1 study is designed as an open-label, multiple ascending dose study across age groups and dose levels to assess safety and tolerability, importantly, the study also utilizes clinical measures that we can use to assess therapeutic potential. This includes objective EEG assessment, as well as clinical assessments evaluating multiple domains of Angelman's syndrome, like cognitive function and gross and fine motor skills. The HALOS Study has completed enrollment for the multiple ascending dose portion of the study, and last year, Ionis presented some encouraging early interim results. Overall, safety and tolerability support continued dosing in the long-term extension with no concerning safety trends having been observed to-date. The EEG data was suggestive of early trends to a reduction of slow delta wave activity as compared to baseline. And clinician-assessed clinical endpoints show a majority of participants demonstrating some level of improvement in overall functioning. Overall, we are encouraged by these early trends and look forward to sharing a more comprehensive topline study readout expected midyear. Following our review of those results, Biogen will be in a position to make its decision whether to opt in to conduct a pivotal study. Moving to lupus, this is another area with significant unmet medical need. We currently have two Phase 3 assets in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus or SLE. First is dapirolizumab pegol, being developed in collaboration with UCB, where we expect a topline readout of the Phase 3 study midyear this year. If positive, we expect to conduct a second Phase 3 study. The second is litifilimab, our anti-BDCA2 antibody developed in-house at Biogen. We currently have two Phase 3 studies of litifilimab in SLE ongoing. These studies are enrolling and utilize a 52-week primary endpoint. Litifilimab also has the potential to be a first-in-class biologic in Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus or CLE, a skin-based autoimmune disease that can be associated with severe scarring and dyspigmentation and can be distinct from SLE. As I've previously discussed, we have focused on reviewing our pipeline to identify and prioritize the areas where we believe we have both sufficient expertise and confidence in the science to deliver meaningful new treatments for patients. While this initial review is complete, this process remains dynamic, and we are committed to holding ourselves accountable to efficiently seeking out scientific insights and continuing to build the pipeline with what we believe is the right risk-reward balance. While we look forward to four important near-term readouts this year, we continue to focus on identifying additional near-term opportunities, as well as continued expansion beyond neuroscience. Through collaboration with Jane and research organization, as well as Adam Keeney, our Head of Corporate Development, we are taking a holistic look across a spectrum of opportunities with both a research and development focus to identify strategic assets that we believe can contribute to Biogen's growth story now and in the long-term. With that, I would now like to pass the call over to Mike. Mike McDonnell : Thank you, Priya. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to provide some highlights and color regarding our financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2023, and I'll follow that with some detail on our 2024 financial guidance assumptions. Please note that all the financial comparisons that you will hear are versus the fourth quarter of 2022. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $2.4 billion. That's a decrease of 6% at actual currency and 5% at constant currency. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $2.95, and that includes a $0.35 negative impact from the recently disclosed closeout costs related to ADUHELM. For the full-year of 2023, total revenue of $9.8 billion represents a decline of 3% at actual currency and 1% at constant currency, and that's consistent with our most recent guidance of a low single-digit decline. Full-year 2023 non-GAAP diluted EPS was $14.72, and that's also consistent with our most recent guidance range of $14.50 to $15. Total MS product revenue was $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter. That's a decrease of 8% at actual currency and 6% at constant currency, and that decline is broadly attributable to competition among the impacts from generic TECFIDERA. I'd like to now provide just a couple of quick updates to the MS business during the fourth quarter. First, for TECFIDERA, in Europe, in December, the European Commission revoked the centralized marketing authorization for generic versions of TECFIDERA, and in reaching this decision, the European Commission affirmed that Biogen is entitled to marketing protection for TECFIDERA until February of 2025, which makes TECFIDERA the only dimethyl fumarate treatment for MS that may be lawfully placed on the market for sale in the EU until that date. Also, a TYSABRI biosimilar is now launched in a small number of countries in Europe. We expect that biosimilars will continue to launch in the first-half of 2024 in other European geographies, as well as in the U.S. Biogen has patents related to TYSABRI, and we will continue to seek to enforce our IP. And although VUMERITY grew modestly in 2023, we are seeing continued effects from pricing pressure and an overall contraction of the oral segment of the market in the U.S., which we expect to continue to see in 2024. Now an update on our rare disease portfolio, which includes SPINRAZA, SKYCLARYS, and QALSODY. In the fourth quarter, we reported revenue $472 million, which is an increase of 3% at actual currency and 6% at constant currency. On our third quarter call, we noted that SPINRAZA outside the U.S. benefited from the timing of shipments in certain markets. This prior period benefit negatively impacted fourth quarter performance. While we expect continued shipment timing impacts for SPINRAZA in 2024, we remain encouraged by its overall performance. SPINRAZA outside the U.S. was also modestly impacted by pricing pressure and competition in Europe in the fourth quarter. As the market leader in SMA, we continue to believe that we can return SPINRAZA to growth over time. SKYCLARYS delivered $56 million of revenue in the first full quarter as a Biogen product, and we are encouraged by the continued patient growth that we've seen. Biosimilars fourth quarter revenue of $188 million increased 8% at actual currency and 10% at constant currency. We continue to explore strategic alternatives for this business and are working to ensure that we maximize its value for our shareholders. Our anti-CD20 revenue of $436 million included a $12 million operating loss related to our economics for LUNSUMIO. Contract manufacturing, royalty and other revenue of $118 million in the fourth quarter was notably lower year-over-year, mainly driven by the timing of batches, and I'll provide some additional detail on this dynamic shortly when I discuss our 2024 guidance. Now, a few things to note regarding fourth quarter expenses. Fourth quarter non-GAAP cost of sales was 25% of total revenue, and that includes $52 million of idle capacity charges. Fourth quarter non-GAAP R&D expense decreased $34 million and that's notwithstanding approximately $45 million related to our portion of the LEQEMBI collaboration and approximately $60 million in closeout costs relating to ADUHELM. Non-GAAP SG&A expense decreased $44 million in the fourth quarter, which was driven by approximately $110 million in cost savings initiatives, and that was partially offset by an increase in commercialization expenses related to the launches of SKYCLARYS and LEQEMBI. Next, a brief update on our balance sheet. We ended the year with $1 billion in cash and marketable securities and $6.9 billion in debt, which puts us in a net debt position of $5.9 billion. In the fourth quarter, we utilized approximately $1.3 billion of cash for final acquisition payment obligations related to the Reata transaction. We also paid down roughly $350 million of the $1 billion term loan that we put in place at the time of this acquisition. It's important to note that, included in the $1.3 billion I just mentioned, $393 million was reflected in cash flow from operations for a one-time payment related to equity-based compensation for the Reata transaction. So absent this, full-year 2023 free cash flow of $1.3 billion would have been approximately $1.7 billion. We expect to continue to generate strong cash flow this year and expect to receive a payment of $437 million from Samsung in early Q2 of this year. So now I'm going to discuss our full-year 2024 guidance ranges and assumptions. We expect full-year 2024 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of between $15 and $16, and that reflects expected EPS growth of approximately 5% at the midpoint of the range, compared to 2023. While total revenue is expected to decline by a low to mid-single-digit percentage, we expect our core pharmaceutical revenue or product revenue plus Biogen's 50% share of LEQEMBI revenue net of cost of sales and royalties to be relatively flat for 2024 as compared to 2023. This assumption is driven by the expected increase in revenue from new product launches over the course of the year, roughly offsetting the declines in our MS product revenue. As has been the case in previous years, we expect Q1 to be seasonally weaker quarter, as compared to Q4 for our MS business in the U.S., and that's driven by higher discounts and allowances and some channel dynamics. We also expect contract manufacturing revenue to be significantly lower throughout 2024, as compared to 2023. This is in part due to completing certain batch commitments in 2023, as part of the 2020 sale of Hillerod, which is located in Denmark. We had manufacturing operations there. And these batch commitments contributed roughly $320 million in 2023, which will not recur in 2024. The increase in revenue from new product launches and decrease in contract manufacturing revenue, along with lower idle capacity charges, are expected to have a favorable impact on cost of sales as a percentage of revenue for 2024. We also believe we can grow our operating income at a low-double-digit percentage and operating margins by a mid-single-digit percentage, as compared to 2023. We expect this to be driven by improved cost of sales as a percentage of revenue, as well as lower expected operating expenses, resulting from our Fit for Growth initiative. On Fit for Growth, we continue to expect to generate approximately $1 billion in gross savings and $800 million in savings net of reinvestments by 2025. We have achieved approximately $200 million of savings in 2023 and are on track to realize another $200 million in 2024, which would put us at $400 million or half of the overall net savings by the end of this year with the remainder in 2025. In 2024, we expect our 50% portion of SG&A spend for LEQEMBI, which, as a reminder, is not included in our Fit for Growth assumptions and the reallocation of resources for ADUHELM to roughly offset. With all of these considerations in mind, we expect our full-year 2024 combined R&D and SG&A spend to total approximately $4.3 billion. We expect our other income and expense line to continue to be a headwind this year, given the reduction in interest income and increase in interest expense as a result of the Reata acquisition. And so in 2024, we expect an improving revenue profile, improved margins, and a return to non-GAAP EPS growth. Our number one goal remains to return to sustainable growth, and we remain committed to this goal and to creating long-term value for our shareholders. And now back to Chris for some closing remarks. Chris Viehbacher : Thanks, Mike. So we have a number of milestones this year that we'll all be watching carefully. You've seen we have a scientific advisory group for LEQEMBI in the first quarter, and assuming a positive result for the CHMP, that should hopefully lead to an approval in -- by the European Commission in the first-half -- later in the first-half of this year. SKYCLARYS in the European Union, of course, we've just achieved, as we announced last night, and the European approval for QALSODY, there is an expected decision by the CHMP and the European Commission in the first half. We have regulatory submissions coming up, as you know, with the subcutaneous formulation for LEQEMBI and IV maintenance dosing also for LEQEMBI. And then, as Priya has noted, we have four data readouts expected sometime mid-year for four programs. As I said earlier, I think we are going to be spending an increasing amount of time focusing on our pipeline and building out that pipeline. So Chuck, I turn that back [Technical Difficulty] and see if there\u2019s any questions. Chuck Triano : Right. Thanks, Chris. Katie, could you please open polling for questions? Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with Leerink Partners. Marc Goodman : Yes. Good morning. Can you walk us through just the subcu and the maintenance approvals? Obviously, timelines, I guess, would be around the end of the year, but just talk about the impact into the market. Let's assume Lilly's on the market as well with a -- they're going to get approved soon. So how do you expect this to change the dynamics and the uptake? And just give us a sense of that, please. And then also, maybe you could just talk about the uptake in Japan that you expect? Thanks. Chris Viehbacher : Yes. Thanks, Marc. Priya, you want to just start with kind of the timelines? And I can hit the commercial. Priya Singhal : Sure. Thanks, Marc, for that question. So overall, we shared our six month data for the subcutaneous formulation at CTAD last year. We believe we've achieved the bioequivalence with the IV formulation. Eisai has communicated very recently about the FDA meeting that is on the book to finalize strategy for submission. And currently, the aim is still to file by end of March 2024 for the subcutaneous formulation. In addition, there is data on the potential and need for IV maintenance, and that is also being aimed to file by Q1 2024. So that's the plan currently. I'm going to turn it over to Chris for the dynamics and the commercial implications. Chris Viehbacher : Yes, so Marc, I mean, the main benefit of subcutaneous is going to be convenience for patients. And as we talked about earlier, over time, we're looking at the AHEAD study where we could potentially one day get an indication for much earlier-stage patients. We're looking at maintenance where patients should continue on, if we get approved, to prevent the recurrence of plaque. So the time on drug is expected to expand as we do these studies, and having a subcutaneous formulation at any stage of this disease could be quite beneficial. In terms of the actual competitiveness with donanemab, I think there's going to be a number of points. We do know that physicians are highly sensitive to ARIA and safety, and we have a significantly better safety profile with LEQEMBI than donanemab. There's an interesting thing with donanemab study, which -- their study actually followed patients until there was a decrease in plaques. So where Clarity looked at an endpoint for everybody at the same time point after 18 months, there was a variable endpoint in terms of time on donanemab. And so the stopping criteria are not quite clear. And I think we need to see what those are if you need a PET scan, for instance, that could be quite onerous. Now we don't know whether that's going to be the case or not. But I think we're going to have a number of variables with which we can compete with donanemab. And subcutaneous at some point will be helpful. Obviously, if think it these guidance, looks like donanemab is an indicated is going to be on the market before the subcutaneous formulation is. So we're going to be focused on some of those non-subcutaneous factors and competition. And then once we see the label for Lily, once we see the label for the subcu then we'll develop our commercial strategy accordingly. Chuck Triano : Do you want to comment on Japan? Chris Viehbacher : Oh, Japan. Yes, I think we certainly have a -- Eisai is basically putting all of its field force, not just the ones for LEQEMBI behind this. And you've got a government managed healthcare system. So I think some of the complexity that we have in the United States with reimbursement and different actors could be simpler. We do expect that there will be some of the same constraints in terms of access to neurologists, the PET scans. They'll probably use a lot more of the CSF markers and PET scans in Japan, but I think we could potentially see a faster uptake in Japan than we saw even in the United States, just because of the current system. So we're just out there since January and we'll give an update, obviously, again at first quarter, but certainly from what we're hearing from our own people from the field, that there's been a very positive reception by physicians in Japan. Chuck Triano : Great. Thanks, Chris. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Salveen Richter : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have one with regard to the bottlenecks on the LEQEMBI launch. Could you speak to maybe two of those aspects? One is your expectations for Medicare Advantage to get to the same level of coverage as traditional Medicare and over what timeframe? And then secondly, just an update on the patient access to neurologists. Thank you. Chris Viehbacher : Yes, so I'll have to get back here on the -- I haven't heard anything that Medicare Advantage is any different than Medicare. So I haven't ever asked that question before, but I'll go check. But as far as I know, it's the same. The bottlenecks, I still -- if you think about it, if the data from the patient registries are accurate, and again, we don't have direct access to that, but it suggests that we've got almost twice as many people on the registry as we do on treatment. And so that says that in addition to the bottleneck of getting into the neurologist, that there's -- when you get to the registry, you've got a clear intent to prescribe, because on the registry, at least for CMS, you have to describe how you actually validated the diagnosis. So by then, you've triaged the patient, you've done either the PET scan or the CSF markers, and you're looking for reimbursement. And what we're hearing a little bit is, is that there is some challenge in just scheduling the first MRI, because when we initiate the infusion, you have to have the first MRI within the first two weeks. So people don't want to initiate the infusion until they've got that MRI scheduled. And the MRI -- there isn't an MRI capacity constraint per se, but you are looking for a specific date, and then you have to back up the infusion. So there's just, I think, until people get the hang of this, getting all that coordination, I think that seems to be where the -- where one of the bottlenecks is. Chuck Triano : Great. Thank you, Chris. Let's move to the next question please. Operator : We'll go next to Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I thought I'd ask for something a little different today, your CD40 Phase 3 in lupus. And my question is, two things. One, the trial size, this was shrunk from 450 down to 320. Could you speak to the recruiting challenges and whether they bode well or not well on efficacy? And then secondly, the primary endpoint, this one has three components, but the FDA guidance appears to want one clear index like a BILAG or SELENA-SLEDAI et cetera. Is there alignment with regulator on that? Thank you. Priya Singhal : Thank you, Umer. I'll take that. So just starting off, I think we expect our results from the first Phase 3 mid-2024. We expect that we'll need a second Phase 3, if this is positive, to generate the safety and efficacy to support a Reg filing. We did make a protocol amendment, and this was really working very closely with Biogen and UCB, looking at the study design, balancing our commitment to execute a well-designed, informative study with a desire to potentially expedite the delivery of dapi, if positive, to patients in need. So we do think it's appropriately powered, and we continue with regulatory engagements and facilitate a discussion on the next step. So we think, yes, we -- it is positioned to give us a clear readout on the therapeutic potential as of now. Yes. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Priya. Let's go to our next question, please. Operator : We'll go next to Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Evan Seigerman : Hi, all. Thank you so much for taking my question. Chris, maybe can you walk me through some of the rationale for adding more Biogen resources to the LEQEMBI launch and maybe kind of what's changed or evolved with your partnership with Eisai where you think you needed to add more Biogen resources in the United States? Thank you. Chris Viehbacher : Yes. Thanks, Evan. I mean, to be clear, we're adding both more Biogen as well as more Eisai. A year ago, the CEO of Eisai and I talked about the launch of LEQEMBI, and for the U.S., just discussed the complexity of the launch, and we've been through all that, and I won't necessarily bore everybody again with that complexity, but we just felt that we wanted to really make sure we understood the go-to-market model. In addition to these neurology account specialists, you've got MSLs, you've got some patient care navigators, you've got some people looking after KMEs in the region, and there's probably -- for every NAS, there's another two or three people who are actually out there in the field. And there's an awful lot of coordination that is needed. And even the role of the NAS is quite complex because you've got to go in there, you've got to work with the office around helping them to understand the safety. You have to help them understand what the care pathway is. You have to help them to understand the reimbursement, not just for LEQEMBI, but there is the reimbursement for the PET scans, the MRIs, and for the care. And then finally, there's what people in the field are -- have as a principal objective, why LEQEMBI? So we wanted to make sure we understood all of that. And to be honest, whenever you do these copromotions, they require an awful lot of coordination between the companies. And we just felt that it would be simpler if one company went out at the start. We were sure that we knew exactly how the role of the NAS was going to work in relation to the other accompanying roles that are out there in the field. And we also needed to get a certain number of core IDNs ready and signed up because there's not a lot of point in increasing the number of people out in the field unless you've got enough sites that are activated and ready. So now we're more than six months into the launch. I think we feel very comfortable about how the role of the NAS works. We understand how long it takes between going to visit a neurologist or an IDN and how long it's going to take for them to be activated, because, as I say, there's -- you can put an awful lot of resource out there, but if you're not able to pull the drug through, it's not a very efficient process. So that's just where we are. We're confident in that model. Obviously, it is -- we need to now reach out to more sites. So we're looking at this from both a geographic expansion, but also, I think, even within certain geographies, perhaps reducing the territory side, because when these NASs go in, they spend quite a long time with the specialists. So it was always the agreement between the two CEOs that when we scale up that Biogen would come in, but we both -- our objective is to make the joint venture as efficient as possible. And so we just felt that the efficiency at the start would be maximized if we just had one company on the field. Now, we've obviously learned from that, and that's what also gives us the confidence to put two companies out into the field immediately in Japan, for example, because while there are differences in the market, a number of the dynamics would be the same pretty much in those markets. So it is an increase. Eisai is increasing their resource and so -- and Biogen will be out there as well. And that could still evolve over time. We're going to be in this business together for many years to come. Chuck Triano : Right, thanks, Chris. Now let's move to our next question, please. Operator : We'll go next to Paul Mattias with Stifel. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is James on for Paul. Thanks for taking our question. Just one more on the lecanemab subcu and specifically in treatment-naive patients. Just wondering if you're confident that you have enough data from a regulatory perspective here, if you've aligned with regulators, you and Eisai aligned with regulators and specifically, if you have enough safety data in that treatment-naive patient population? Any color there would be great. Thanks. Priya Singhal : So yes, overall, this has been a topic that we've discussed Eisai and Biogen have discussed with the FDA. And just to step back, the design was to add a sub-study, a subcutaneous sub-study in the Phase III CLARITY study open-label extension, and the cohort that was treatment naive from lecanemab was about 72 patients. And then there was a whole cohort of 322 additional patients that provided safety and tolerability. So this was -- the 72 patients is the premise for the PK/PD and bioequivalents. But there's a larger subset of data that speaks to the safety data. So yes, discussions are ongoing, but overall, these have been discussed with regulators prior to starting them. Thank you. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Priya. Next question, please. Operator : We'll go next to Phil Nadeau with TD Cowen. Phil Nadeau : Good morning. Question on SKYCLARYS following last night's approval in the EU. Chris highlighted the importance of the U.S. markets. Could you discuss the expected cadence and trajectory of SKYCLARYS' launch outside the U.S. and Europe, in particular, when will be available in the major territories? And would you expect the uptake in those major territories to be as fast as it has been here in the United States? Thanks. Chris Viehbacher : So there's two aspects, I guess, to the launch. One is the early access programs and the other is the former launch. So for example, we'll be able to launch now in Germany with this approval. So we will -- this will be a formal launch. We still have an early access program and any patients on that will now convert to commercial patients. remembering that actually, the patients in early access programs in Europe are expected to be revenue generating for the most part. We have another program that's up and running in France. And we are negotiating the establishment of early access programs in two other European countries, and there are some early access programs under discussion in countries outside of the EU. And the early access program is important because as we all know, in Europe, getting pricing and reimbursement can take some time. So it\u2019s a little hard to predict just because we have to understand the cadence of these early access programs. So I would expect that it's not going to be quite as fast as it was in the U.S. That said, there is some suggestion that there are some patients, the warehousing effect could well be in Europe, but as I said and as a general matter, just because of the time to get reimbursement all increase in the fact that we are not going to be able to have early access programs in all countries that, that will be a slower uptake than in the U.S. That said, there's also probably more patients actually per capita. Remember, this is a disease that is related to European descent. And so the incidence of Friedreich\u2019's ataxia is slightly higher in Europe than it's in U.S. The next big market opportunity to be Latin America, and we are submitting in Brazil and perhaps, Priya, you can give us an update on the regulatory time lines there. Priya Singhal : Yes. I can comment on the fact that really, we are trying to expedite our regulatory filings in Latin America, Brazil, Argentina. We haven't yet communicated the time lines, but our teams are working very expeditiously, meeting with regulators to really define the pathways that could provide earliest access to patients. Chris Viehbacher : We estimate, it's hard to get the numbers precisely, but we do estimate there's around 2,000 to 4,000 patients in Latin America. So -- and when we look at the experience of SPINRAZA, we are expecting particularly Latin America to contribute substantially to our revenue outlook as well. As you know, there are very few patients in Asia just because of the genetics. So we don't intend to be filing or launching in Asia. Chuck Triano : Great, thank you. Next question, please. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Yee with Jefferies. Michael Yee : Thanks. We had a question on SKYCLARYS. Can you may be shed some more light on the dynamics of 800 patients to 1,000? And then the trajectory as we go forward into 2024, I know you mentioned there's about 4,000 patients, but how many of those are actually identified. Do you expect growth to moderate just from an expectation standpoint? Talk a little bit about the complexities in 2024 that you commented about. Thank you. Chris Viehbacher : Yes. Thanks, Michael. Certainly, the growth is going to moderate. Remember, this was -- when this product was in hands of Reata, they had approval. I think it was back in the first quarter. I think it was February, if I remember accurately. And -- but they were not able to commercially launch because of a manufacturing specification issue. So -- and that did not get cleared until July. So in other words, the market and physicians knew the product would be coming to the market that it was approved, and they were just waiting for product availability. So I think the warehousing effect was even greater than what you would normally see for any rare disease drug. Now we're back into the process of finding the patients. I have to say the Friedreich\u2019's Ataxia Research Alliance, otherwise known as FARA, is an extraordinarily effective patient association and we're working with them to help identify patients. There is a requirement really to diagnose a patient accurately a genetic test. But this genetic test is not sold readily available. And so we're having to look and make sure that the supplier of that test can make the tests readily available. And then we're also doing the contracting really to make sure that as patients have start forms that they can quickly get on drug. So we'll be back to, I think, a regular growth cadence on SKYCLARYS in the U.S. I don't think we're necessarily going to get another 20% this year. but we're growing every month. And certainly, SKYCLARYS is contributing significantly to our return to growth in 2024. Chuck Triano : Great. Thank you, Chris. Let's move to our next question, please. Operator : We'll go next to Colin Bristow with UBS. Colin Bristow : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to clarify something in your slides that says that the subcu that we can be filing is now first-half of \u201824. But in your commentary, it sounds like it's still 24, so if you could just clarify that? And just talk to specifically what FDA is waiting to see, I think it was a 12-month data last time we spoke. What is it within that? And then maybe just as a follow-on, you had three, four, five study, what is the timing or thresholds for any interim analysis there? A - Priya Singhal I can get started. So overall, I think with the subcutaneous, just to be very clear, Eisai has communicated as recently as their earnings a few days ago that we aim to file by Q1 2024, which is end of the first quarter this year. And just shifting gears to AHEAD 3-45, this is really a platform -- a set of platform trials with different amyloid levels for defining preclinical Alzheimer's disease. So at a very high level, A45 is preclinical Alzheimer's disease with an enrollment target of 1,000 patients, and patients need to have an amyloid level of 40 centiloids or more. There's three phases of dosing with different doses, which is titration, induction and maintenance. And in this particular trial, the outcome is a PAC 5, which is a preclinical composite for Alzheimer's disease, where it's sensitive to patients who are still in the preclinical phase. The A3 trial is -- has a target enrollment of about 400 million and the preclinical amyloid cutoff is between 20 and 40 centiloids. And then again, it's got a different holding schedule of titration and then maintenance. Now the primary endpoint for the A3 trial is really a biomarker endpoint. We haven't really communicated exact time lines. These are very large trials. I think the Eisai and Biogen are very pleased with how they are being enrolled. And I think we'll communicate more. There is an opportunity to do an interim analysis and Eisai has spoken to this, but we haven't communicated a time line yet. Chuck Triano : And Colin, just a quick note on slide 28, right. The docs that does show Q1, right? We wording says expected mid-year, if there's something sort of in the middle of the year. So I get the confusion because it says half one, half two, but the dots are kind of at the end of the quarter there. So if you were looking at -- see if there was a disconnect, there's not it is. They have said in the end of March is what we're looking at here. So Priya\u2026 Priya Singhal : I think there was the latter part of the question. I'll just wrap it up that with regards to FDA, I think I mentioned previously, there have been a lot of discussions. Eisai has recently mentioned the scheduling of more meeting another meeting. And so that strategy will be finalized. Looking at the 6-month data, we are very encouraged with what we saw. We believe that the highest threshold, really, the biggest hurdle was to meet bioequivalence, which we believe we've met. So we'll continue to wait for more data. But we are very encouraged with what we've seen so far. Chuck Triano : All right. Thank you, Priya. Let's go to our next questioner. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Chris Raymond : Hey, thanks. I wanted to maybe circle back on the Angelman program, and I wanted to understand a little bit better previous commentary around the program. Can you maybe clarify the calculus that goes into deciding to participate in future development. And obviously, there's a competitive approach with Ultragenyx's program. Curious how you're thinking about approvable endpoints? That's obviously been a big question mark. And how you think this product, if successful, would sort of compare and any sort of commentary there in terms of the competitive set? Thanks. Priya Singhal : Sure, sure. So overall, just to step back, this is a program that Ionis, our partner, is operationalizing and the way the contractual agreements are written, we have the option of opting in to take the data that we see midyear and decide whether we would like to do a pivotal program -- a pivotal study. So that's how it's set up. And then to step back, I described it briefly in my opening remarks that this is a Phase Ib trial. So this is a Phase I trial that's being conducted in patients. It has a multiple ascending dose component for three months, followed by a long-term extension. So we will get data. This is across different age groups and different doses. So we'll get a composite of data. And importantly, we'll be looking or trends on EEG, which we know these patients suffer from the delta waves as I spoke to, the slowing. So we'll be looking at that. as well as clinical endpoints. And very specifically, there are quite a few clinical endpoints. There's the Bayley score, there's the CGI and there's a Vineland. We'll be looking at all of them. Stepping out into what do we feel about the competitive landscape? We feel that this as designed the program is well positioned. Just from an ASO perspective, the backbone of the BIIB121 ASO, we believe, is different. That's 1 from the Ultragenyx ASO. Second, we believe that the dosing may be needed at a quarterly level to really see the PK/PD impact that we need to have -- make an impact in this disease. And we do have a 3 monthly dosing in the LTE. So the MAD is 2 doses being given 1 month apart. And then the third dose, 2 months later, and then patients go into a 3-month dosing. So we are -- we feel that we will have a data set that we can look at and really assess whether we see an adequate signal to really take it into a Phase 3. And with regards to Roche discontinuing their program, we believe, again, that this is a different product, and we believe we may have a competitive advantage. Ultimately, of course, we need to see the data. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Priya. Let's move to the next question, please. Operator : We'll go next to Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Mohit Bansal : Great. Thank you very much for taking mu question. Maybe I can -- if you can comment a little bit on the previous comments you made regarding SPINRAZA returned to growth. What is happening in the market right now? And how do you plan to get back to growth on this product? Thank you. Chris Viehbacher : Sure. So as you know, we have an oral therapy out there. We have a gene therapy, and we have SPINRAZA with the intrathecal. So short term, I think one of the data points that was very important was demonstrating the efficacy of SPINRAZA following Zolgensma because there has been some feeling that Zolgensma wanes over time. So we're getting what we call switch packs, and the other on the oral therapy is that there has sometimes appear to be that the efficacy is limited to certain body weights. So we can actually go after more adult populations. We believe that only about 30% of patients with SMA are actually treated. Clearly, the pediatric patients are screened for and readily identified. But there are a number of adult patients where the disease is manifest, but it is sometimes difficult to diagnose. And so we're back to the rare disease job of hunting for patients. But we think, actually, we will be the most app most appropriate treatment for that patient population. So that's one source of growth. And then longer term, as you know, we have a high-dose SPINRAZA program in development which could, if it's successful, lead to just on intrathecal injection procured. And that would make an enormous difference to patients in terms of patient convenience and make SPINRAZA even more competitive compared to the others. Now that's still going to take a number of years, but we do expect that still to come to market before the patent on SPINRAZA occurs. Mike McDonnell : Yes. And I'll just quickly add to that, Mohit, that in the -- as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, there tends to be some lumpiness quarter-over-quarter, particularly outside of the U.S. with shipments. But overall, when you look at the full-year of 2023, we actually saw modest growth in the U.S., modest decline OUS and overall, moving back toward the modest growth trajectory that we're hoping for, and we are pleased with how that franchise has stabilized over time. Chris Viehbacher : Yes, there's a dynamic as sort of the oral comes into a market at one point or the gene therapy comes into a market. If you have 100% market share and the competitor comes in mathematically, you're going to lose market share. But what we see is that there is some churn for a year or two. And then the markets settle out, and that's when people start focusing on efficacy and patient populations. And as I say, so far, we have been able to maintain leadership in SMA despite the competition. And I think that's where they'll be. There'll be different products for different patients, but there's still enough of a patient population and even with the switchbacks that we can find reservoirs of growth. Chuck Triano : Great, thanks. And operator, can we move to our last question, please. Operator : We'll go next to Jay Olson with Oppenheimer. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys. This is Matt on for Jay. Thanks so much for taking our questions, and Jay sends his regards. So we were wondering, I guess it's still early, of course, but the PPD launch still far, just in terms of any metrics or signals that you see that support your confidence in the launch so far? And of course, over the next few months to quarters, what kind of metrics do you believe will become meaningful and that you might plan to share? And maybe just your overall longer term goals for that PPD launch and your general interest in the psychiatry space would be interesting to hear as well. I really appreciate the question. Chris Viehbacher : Sure. Thanks, stunt double. We -- so there are a number of things that I think are quite encouraging. One is our initial target has been high-prescribing psychiatrists in this space as well as OB-GYNs. And one of the things that we were wondering about is, are the OB-GYNs really going to be willing to prescribe? And so one of the encouraging signs is that they in fact are doing so. So we're seeing quite a high percentage of the prescriptions coming from them. Another has been, I think, as I mentioned earlier, that payers have really wanted to ensure access to patients, and I'm quite thankful to them. I think Medicaid, for example, where 40% of births occur, have moved very quickly on that in a number of states. And some of the large -- at least one of the large commercial insurers is moving much quicker than we expected as well. So I think the reimbursement is a key statistic. Now, personally, I'm interested in knowing how many patients are treatment-naive versus people who have been on treatment. What is interesting is, is there a warehousing effect here as well? There's been an awful lot of media coverage. The product was approved in July. We were not able to launch because of the DEA inspection until the very end of 2023. So what we don't know is, are we seeing a bolus of patients come in because these are patients physicians have been following for some time who've been identified as being particularly important to have ZURZUVAE. So I think we'll need to see a little bit more data about who are the patients and where are they coming from, but as I say, so far, we're running for the first month. I mean, we're certainly doing much better than what we had anticipated. And we'll give you another update at Q1. We'll sit with Sage sometime in March to look at the data and say, what do we see as some of the trends. But so far so good. Chuck Triano : Great. Thanks, Chris. And that will conclude our call. Appreciate you all joining us today. Operator : That concludes today's call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Biogen First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call and Business Update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Triano, you may begin your conference. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Jennifer. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, everyone, and welcome to Biogen's first quarter 2024 earnings call. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the earnings release and related financial tables, including our GAAP financial measures with a reconciliation to the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today are in the Investors section of biogen.com. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2 and Table 4 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe that non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted the slides on our website that will be used during this call. I'd point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our expectations. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I'm joined by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Viehbacher; our Head and President of North-America, Alisha Alaimo; our CFO, Mike McDonnell; and Dr. Priya Singhal, Head of Development is with us and will be available for the Q&A session. Chris, Alisha, and Mike will each make some opening comments and then we'll move to the Q&A session. And to allow us to get through as many questions as possible, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that out of the way, I'll now turn the call over to Chris. Chris Viehbacher : Thank you, Chuck. Good morning, everybody. Well, it is certainly great to be able to announce earnings per share growth in our first quarter. This is the first time in several years that the underlying business performance of Biogen has allowed us to actually demonstrate earnings per share growth, and that's a major achievement. We've clearly still got a lot of work to do, but I think it feels like we're turning the corner in the company. And with that, I'd like to actually take the opportunity to thank my Biogen colleagues. We have instituted an awful lot of change within the company and I'd like to thank them for their commitment, passion, and patience throughout this process. But I think you're seeing some of that change that has occurred now in the numbers. We have tried to bring a lot more focus and discipline to really putting our resources behind those things that do good and drive value. And one of the things that you may not see is that, there is an awful lot of reinvestment going on. One of my early bosses in my career once told me, you can't save your way to prosperity in this business, and that is absolutely true. And that's not really what we set out to do. The Fit for Growth project, which is, as you can see from the numbers, on track to achieve its $1 billion in gross savings and $800 million in net cost savings and by the way, [$100] (ph) million of increased cash flow as well by the end of 2025. But what we really tried to do was redesign the organization. We have been so focused as a business for decades on our multiple sclerosis franchise, and here we are launching four first-in-class new medicines and we really needed to make sure we're supporting those launches. And in fact, despite the cost reductions and margin improvements that Mike is going to go into in more detail, but behind that, there are hundreds of millions of dollars being invested in new launches. And while our overall expense in research and development has decreased, this focus has actually enabled us to increase the investment in those assets where we have the most conviction. So, this is much more than a cost-savings exercise. This has been a redesign and a change in our culture to a degree. So, let's look at some of these new launches. And obviously, the one that everybody is most interested in is LEQEMBI and if we can move to that slide. You can look at this in a number of different layers. Obviously, first, we're seeing really good quarter-on-quarter trends. As you've seen, the number of patients on drug has increased to 2.5 fold compared to where we finished the fourth-quarter. Our in-market revenue almost tripled in Q1 versus Q4 of last year, and that's obviously important. But the thing that really is important to me as I look at this is not so much just that. I've been in this business for 3.5 decades. I've lost count of how many launches I've seen, but this is an extraordinarily difficult launch, really because the amount of change that physicians are facing with this is really profound. And as I go around to hospitals and talk to doctors and talk to those who are seeing other doctors, it really becomes evident that there are an awful lot of challenges to getting that -- even that first patient on treatment. We were at one hospital, it was going to take -- it took them three months to get approval just to hire a nurse to help navigate the system. At another major medical center, they're having to develop a five-year business plan, just to be able to access the infusion beds. And when you look at some of the uncertainty around PET scan reimbursement, and although CMS had clarified that and a lot of the MACs have pulled it through, there was still a lot of difficulty getting that clarity all the way through the channel. You know why I'm really encouraged by when I look at these numbers is, when -- although there are a lot of challenges, it's a lot of time investment for physicians and I think a lot of those physicians to their credit are investing that time and not necessarily getting reimbursed for that, but they're getting it done. They're overcoming these challenges and barriers. And that is, I think, what is so important. They see the need when they look at patients who are accomplished people, who are loved by their families, and seeing this dreaded disease pull the patient away from that on a day-by-day basis. So, I do think we are seeing an awful lot of momentum here. And again, I think there's an awful lot of credit to the neurologists and to these centers to overcoming these challenges and I think that is going to allow us to continue to see quarter-on-quarter growth. It may not be completely linear, and Alisha will go into more detail on that, but it takes time to get these protocols in-place and even when you get the first patient, there has been a tendency that let's have a handful of patients so we get comfortable with the system. But then, once they've done all that, then, we're starting to see volume pull through. And one of the interesting things about this launch is that, generally, we look at revenue as a surrogate for demand. And here there's -- that linkage is not quite so clear because it has taken this upfront time before you see revenue pull through. And I think that's one of the other things we're now seeing in this first quarter is that, we're actually seeing a little bit more of that linkage between demand and revenue. And behind all of this, once those processes are in place, and once physicians are ready, there is clearly an underlying demand behind that. So, I think that has given us a lot of confidence to now invest more, and we have a 30% expansion in our US field force plan. But I would also say, this is a launch that really didn't start until 1st of September. And even then, you could argue we weren't fully in the mode of being able to launch because the PET scan reimbursement hadn't been cleared. But our US teams for both Eisai and Biogen have done an awful lot of work to look at the data from the first seven months of the launch. And really, we're now looking at redeploying some resources here and there as we see what's important and what's not. I think the teams are really working well together. And we have a number of new elements of our promotional mix that will start to come into play as we progress through the second quarter. So, from a Biogen point of view, I think it's too early to put out any forecast. We're going to be looking at those month-over-month new patient starts and the increase in revenue. But I would certainly say I'm extremely encouraged by the progress that has occurred. And if I could switch gears to another key growth driver, which is SKYCLARYS, and Alisha, again, will go into more detail and I think also just show investors how we're progressing versus other analogs because the rare disease market doesn't behave so typically as in other markets. There is always a catch-up population in rare disease. And so, it takes a while for that catch-up population to work through the system and then have a look at what's the underlying demand. Remember that these are not patients sitting in waiting rooms and that there is a huge amount of work that goes into finding patients. And I think that is actually one of Biogen's strengths. That's I think what gives me the confidence to continue to invest more because I do think there is a know-how within Biogen and that's one of the reasons we want to build out a rare disease franchise. But we've got 1,100 patients now on therapy in the US. That's a really significant number. But I'm also really encouraged by the launch in Europe. We've already got -- and remember, this drug was only approved in the -- at the end of January and yet we already have 300 patients on treatment. Now, you all know Europe. We have to go country-by-country to get reimbursement and we have early access programs, some of those we can charge revenue for, some of them we can't, but we have already submitted reimbursement dossiers in five countries in the US. So I think Europe will increasingly add to the revenue. It's probably more of a 2025 story than a 2024. But I think if I'm looking at the acceptance and the uptake, then, that launch is also off to a successful start. And we know that there are an awful lot of patients in Latin America and we've already submitted in Brazil, for example, submitting in Argentina. And I think that actually is going to be a major benefit and opportunity for us as well. Remember, there are no patients in Asia because this is a genetic disease that really affects people of European descent. And in fact, it was quite interesting. I was talking to a key opinion leader in Germany who is actually done genetic studies. And you basically just follow where the explorers went and that's where you're going to find the patients. So I think with that, let's dive in a little bit deeper and I'll turn it over to Alisha. Alisha Alaimo : Thank you, Chris. Good morning to everyone that's able to join the call today. I'm Alisha Alaimo. And as Chuck shared, I lead our business in North America. This is a really unique period in Biogen's history with multiple first-in-class drug launches in the US, which gives us an opportunity to drive our return to growth. And for our team, it's also meaningful to support more people living with Alzheimer's, Friedreich's ataxia, and postpartum depression. We thought it might be helpful to provide a perspective on the market dynamics of the launches and share how we're seeking a tailored approach to help provide patients with access to our therapies. Let me begin with the Alzheimer's market. As Chris mentioned, we are seeing many major health systems across the country take a deliberate staged and phased approach, meaning, they are setting up their pathways to get patients started with diagnosis, treatment and monitoring. We believe we are now seeing a dynamic where some IDNs are turning the page and they are focusing on expanding and extending their model. In Q1, we saw several IDNs across regions scale their patient volume. Among our priority 100 IDNs, units more than tripled in quarter one compared to quarter four, which contributed to the overall estimated patients on therapy increasing approximately 2.5 times in quarter one versus quarter four. We believe this acceleration in new patients really began to emerge at the end of the quarter. For example, more than 20% of new patients since launch were added in March. Today, among our 100 priority IDNs, more than 80% have approved LEQEMBI through their P&T process and nearly 85% of those IDNs with approval have placed an order. Chris also mentioned that we're seeing more physicians gain experience with LEQEMBI. We saw the number of unique prescribers in quarter one double compared to quarter four. We believe that we're still in the early phases of unlocking the potential to treat a high volume of patients at the priority IDNs, and I thought it might be helpful to share some examples of these dynamics at the site level. There is one large health system in the Midwest that added LEQEMBI to its formulary in July of last year. Six months later, entering Q1, this system had ordered only 300 units. However, by the end of March, they had ordered 2,700 units. Similar to the example I just shared, there is also a health system in the Southeast that added LEQEMBI to its formulary in August of 2023. Five months later, entering Q1, this system ordered about 560 units. By the end of Q1, this system ordered more than 1,750 units to treat their patients. For context, a local neurologist network in that same region ordered 3,000 units through the same time period, perhaps because they've been able to scale their processes to treat more patients. However, we believe this well-known Southeast IDN is planning to move beyond their flagship side of care to treat at multiple locations, which is another example of the expand and extend trend at the IDNs. We believe many systems just now appear to be completing the staging phase, and we think the recent trends observed support our continued belief that LEQEMBI represents a significant commercial opportunity over the mid to longer term. With access and infrastructure progressing and patient volume accelerating, we believe this is also the right time to expand the field force. Biogen leaders are working to hire a customer-facing field team, which will join Eisai. Simultaneously, to activate the patient community, Biogen and Eisai have launched new direct-to-patient and caregiver omnichannel marketing campaigns. These digital programs and point-of-care resources are focused on the already diagnosed patients, who we believe are under the care of a neurologist. With these promising signals emerging, we look-forward to providing more updates in the future. Now moving to SKYCLARYS. We believe we're driving strong performance with the launch as we continue to exceed market penetration rates of most rare disease launch analogs. As of April 19, we now have over 1,100 patients on therapy. With an estimated 4,500 addressable Friedreich's ataxia patients in the US, we have achieved 24% market penetration, which exceeds our own strong SPINRAZA launch. As is typical with rare disease launches, we believe we are now moving beyond the catch-up population, to reach additional patients who previously received a diagnosis of, or are suspected to have Friedreich's Ataxia. Though patient numbers may be uneven, we anticipate adding patients each month. Last quarter, we shared how we've integrated some of our sophisticated rare disease capabilities to drive improvements in access, logistics, and patient support. Notably, our market access team continued to make progress by securing favorable policies in quarter one. Today, nearly 80% of all US pharmacy lives now have SKYCLARYS reimbursement. These patient support and access efforts are critical to help patients start therapy as soon as possible, and remain on treatment for the long term. With a meaningful foundation of patients on therapy, we are focusing on two key areas in this next phase of our launch. First, educating community neurologists and PCPs about Friedreich's ataxia and SKYCLARYS, and second, engaging additional appropriate patients. I'll begin with our focus on HCPs. Remember with Friedreich's ataxia, in addition to patients being concentrated at the top centers of excellence, we believe they are also being treated in the community. To support these physicians, we've expanded our field footprint and we are using AI to analyze data to help reach the HCPs who may have untreated patients, with insights into the relevant sites of care and when patients last engaged with their physician, we believe we can help more patients even sooner. And with genetic testing, we anticipate patients can confirm a potential diagnosis and determine if SKYCLARYS is a treatment option. As far as our patient activation focus, we are encouraged by real-world experiences that patients are sharing on social media as, in our experience, these stories can help other diagnosed patients. Many of these stories about the impact of SKYCLARYS include reports of slowing of disease progression and in some cases, even an improvement in their symptoms long term. In addition to these organic stories, we anticipate launching our SKYCLARYS social media campaign soon. So, we believe we're off to a strong start, but we know there are more people living with Friedreich's ataxia that we can help, and we look forward to supporting them, which now brings me to ZURZUVAE. As Chris mentioned, we are encouraged by the performance of the launch to date, and we think we are seeing several positive trends with providers, patient experience, and reimbursement. First, let me begin with providers. Across multiple physician types, we believe many providers are demonstrating an urgency to treat. Notably, OB-GYNs led overall prescribing in quarter one, which we believe is encouraging as they are often the first to see PPD patients. Furthermore, breadth of adoption has continued to grow. In March, nearly double the number of HCPs prescribed ZURZUVAE compared to just January. We've seen that some early prescribers require only a few calls before they treat. Keep in mind that ZURZUVAE is a scheduled product available through a specialty pharmacy. While we believe psychiatrists are generally familiar with working with specialty pharmacy, this could be a new process for many OB-GYNs. We're working to educate these providers on the steps required, so that they can support their appropriate patients. Second, some HCPs have early experience with ZURZUVAE, have shared that some of their patients reported significant improvement in depressive symptoms within days of starting treatment. Several patients are sharing their personal 14-day treatment experiences on platforms like TikTok, and we believe their courage to tell their story will help educate other women living with postpartum depression. Third, we believe we're making good progress with government in commercial access. Many payers already have policies in place, the majority of which have been favorable, while some others continue to cover ZURZUVAE, even without formal policies in place. Two of the three national pharmacy benefit managers are providing coverage for ZURZUVAE without overly burdensome restrictions. We are in active discussions with the third national PBM as we await their decision. And while Medicaid tends to take longer, almost half of the states, including several of the largest, accelerated reviews into quarter one, which we believe is unusual for a process that can typically take-up to a year after FDA approval. We are encouraged that approximately two-thirds of Medicaid lives with published policies appear to have minimal access restrictions. We anticipate the remaining states will review coverage throughout 2024, and we will continue to support their reviews as much as possible. Before handing it over to Mike, I want to underscore that we have an important responsibility to help people living with Alzheimer's, Friedreich's ataxia, and postpartum depression. And we are working with urgency to help these patient communities. We believe we're making significant progress in that mission, and we look forward to continuing to share updates with you. With that, I'd like now to pass it over to Mike. Mike McDonnell : Thank you, Alisha, and hello to everyone. I'd like to start with a high-level overview of our financial profile, and how we are seeing this progress in the context of our Fit for Growth program. We maintain a sharp focus on improving profitability as we endeavor to return the company to not just EPS growth, but revenue growth as well. Please note that any financial comparisons that I make are versus the first quarter of 2023. Regarding our top line, our four recent launches contributed revenue in the first quarter, which more than offset the 4% decline in our MS business. And as we noted during our previous earnings call and at a recent webcast investor conference, we expect that this year's revenue will be skewed more towards the second half of the year, and we expect this to be due to both the timing of shipments for SPINRAZA outside the US, as well as the expected growth profiles for our recently launched products. On gross margin, we saw improvement of 5 percentage points in the quarter as our revenue mix has shifted. This is due to increasing high-margin product revenue replacing lower-margin contract manufacturing revenue. We also had $45 million of idle capacity charges in the first quarter of 2023, and none in the first quarter of 2024. Our R&D prioritization and Fit for Growth initiatives had a clear impact on our non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses, which we refer to as core OpEx during the quarter, and that resulted in a 13% decrease year-over-year. These savings contributed to meaningful growth of our non-GAAP operating income of 24% year-over-year. Our operating margin was 31% in the quarter as compared to 23% in the first quarter of 2023. And while these are encouraging improvements so far, we believe there is still more work that can be done to continue to improve these metrics. Now, a bit more color on revenue dynamics during the first quarter. Total revenue was $2.3 billion, which was a decrease of 7% at actual and constant-currency. Our MS franchise revenue declined approximately 4% driven by competition and the usual channel seasonality that we see in the first quarter. Within MS, VUMERITY revenue grew 18% and benefited from global patient growth as well as some favorable channel dynamics during the first quarter. Regarding TECFIDERA in the EU, we have now seen most generics exit the market, which drove ex-US growth of 5% for TECFIDERA this quarter. We continue to believe we are entitled to market protection in the EU until February of 2025. And now, a quick double-click on our rare disease revenue for the quarter. SKYCLARYS delivered $78 million of revenue, including approximately $5 million in Europe, where we have launches in several countries underway. For SPINRAZA in the US, revenue was up 1% in the quarter, and we remain encouraged by the resilience here. SPINRAZA revenue outside the US declined 35%. The majority of this year-over-year decline was due to shipment timing in certain emerging markets. We continue to generally see stable patient numbers globally, and we would expect the shipping dynamic outside the US to largely normalize throughout the remainder of 2024. We also saw some modest negative impacts from competition and foreign exchange in the quarter. For the full year 2024, we expect global SPINRAZA revenue to decline by a low-single-digit percentage. ZURZUVAE delivered $12 million of revenue, which we believe is inclusive of some channel stocking in anticipation of increasing demand, which is common for any new launch. And lastly, contract manufacturing revenue was notably lower year-over-year, and as we reflected in our guidance for the full year, we continue to expect contribution from this line to be significantly lower than last year, due to completing a number of batch commitments in 2023. First quarter non-GAAP cost of sales was 22% of total revenue, and that's an improvement of 5 percentage points. As I previously mentioned, this improvement was driven by a more favorable product mix, as revenue from new product launches replaced lower margin contract manufacturing revenue, and it also was related to having lower idle capacity charges. We did not have any in the first quarter of 2024. First quarter non-GAAP R&D expense decreased $124 million, which was driven primarily by savings achieved from Fit for Growth, where we remain on track to achieve cost savings of $1 billion gross and [$8 million] (ph) net of investment by the end of 2025. We also saw savings as a result of our R&D portfolio prioritization, which has had a meaningful impact as we discontinued some programs and have focused our spend on areas we believe have a higher probability of success. Non-GAAP SG&A expense decreased approximately $33 million in the first quarter, and this was primarily due to $50 million of G&A-related cost reductions, which were realized in 2024 in connection with our Fit for Growth program, and that was offset by an increase in operational spending on sales and marketing activities in support of the LEQEMBI and SKYCLARYS launches. I will also note that the prior year included $31 million related to the termination of a co-promote agreement for our MS project -- products in Japan. All of this together contributed to non-GAAP operating income growing 24%, with non-GAAP operating margin now above 30% and improving and non-GAAP EPS growth of 8%. Next, a brief update on our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $6.5 billion of debt, $1.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, and net debt of roughly $5.5 billion. As of March 31, 2024, the $6.5 billion of total debt included $250 million of the $1 billion 2023 term loan, which was put in place at the time of the Reata acquisition. As of March 31, 2024, we had repaid $750 million of this $1 billion facility. The remaining $250 million is expected to be repaid during the second quarter of this year, so this quarter, earlier than our original expectation, which was by the end of this year. I'd note that this cash and marketable securities figure does not include a $437 million payment from Samsung, which we received earlier this month. We continued to generate strong free cash flow during the first quarter with approximately $507 million of free cash flow. So overall, our balance sheet remains in a strong position, with increasing capacity to invest in growth initiatives. And regarding our strategic review of the biosimilars business, at this point, we have not received an acceptable offer from a third-party. Our process remains ongoing and we will remain disciplined as we continue to explore all options including retaining the business. Next, I'd like to discuss our full year 2024 guidance ranges and assumptions. We are reaffirming our expectation of full-year 2024 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of between $15 and $16, which reflects expected growth of approximately 5% at the midpoint of the range as compared to 2023. All of the previous assumptions to our guidance, including those you see on this slide, remain unchanged. I'd like to remind that we have potential R&D success milestone or opt-in payments associated with the upcoming clinical data readouts, and we have made an allowance for some of these potential payments in our guidance. Of course, whether or not they are paid will be dependent on the data and our resulting decisions. And finally, we just announced the completion of a sale of one of our two priority review vouchers for $103 million. At this point, we expect to earmark these proceeds for business investment, or to support business development opportunities as they arise. And in closing, we remain committed to our number one goal of returning Biogen to sustainable top and bottom-line growth, and creating long-term value for our shareholders. We will now open up the call for questions. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Mike. Jennifer, can we go to questions? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cantor Fitzgerald. Eric Schmidt : Oh, hi. Thanks so much for all the updates and for taking my question. I guess on LEQEMBI and maybe for Priya, we had a couple of updates in the last month or so, the EMA delay on the CHMP recommendation. And also, I know this is your partner's doing, but Eisai announced that they couldn't submit for the subcu approval until they finished the immunogenicity study. I was hoping you could just update us on timelines for both of those initiatives going forward? Thank you. Priya Singhal : Yes. Thanks, Eric. So maybe I can just start off by saying that we are working with Eisai to really provide patients with the optionality of a subcutaneous formulation. Our approach is entirely data driven. So we were very encouraged to see the bioequivalence we met last year and we shared that at CTAD. This was the most important milestone. Thereafter, we've engaged with the FDA. And currently, just to characterize how we are approaching this, we've split our strategy for subcutaneous formulation. First and foremost, we are working to submit a rolling submission for subcutaneous autoinjector for maintenance. This we're going to do at earliest. Eisai has already submitted a fast track application. We're awaiting that. And as soon as we get it, we will make the submission, while we continue to generate the data for the three-month immunogenicity that the FDA has required. Second, because our exposure with subcutaneous formulation was higher than the IV formulation, we believe it's in the interest of patients to optimize dose, and that will lead to more convenience. So, we are optimizing this dose and that is something that is already ongoing and is currently ongoing this year. In terms of timelines, if we get the fast track for subcutaneous maintenance, we will file immediately for rolling review, and that we expect would be in this year even if we don't get the fast track because we have completed the three-month immunogenicity data by Q4. Second, for the subcutaneous induction therapy, we expect that we would file by the first quarter of 2026. That is what Eisai has already communicated in their investor comments early March. I'd also like to remind us that we completed our intravenous maintenance filing by Q1 2024 as we [indiscernible]. Thank you. Chuck Triano : Thank you, operator. Next question, please. Operator : We'll go next to Paul Matteis with Stifel. Paul Matteis : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if we could get your updated perspective on business development as it relates to capacity, therapeutic area, stage of development, or commercial? And just in the context of this, how the kind of uncertain -- promising, but uncertain trajectory of lecanemab influences your appetite to execute on something now versus maybe wait a bit until 2025? Thank you. Chris Viehbacher : Thanks, Paul. I think this year, we're going to be focused on business development to bring in some new assets, both into early-stage research and development. We have always called ourselves a neuroscience company, but the reality of neuroscience is that, this is a high-risk area. We don't always understand the underlying disease biology, the diseases progress slowly, that leads you to some very long and expensive trials. You can't often do a proof-of-concept study in Phase 2. And so, while we remain committed to neuroscience, my personal view is that I think that is to -- that is not diversified enough for a company of our size. And so, already last year, we signaled that we'd like to go into some adjacencies in rare disease. I think we actually have a tremendous commercial capability in rare disease. There are special commercial requirements, the need sometimes to support diagnosis, all of the hurdles with payers that have to be overcome and of course, finding the patients. And there are an awful lot of tools that I think we have to be able to do that. And then immunology, we've been an immunology company since the get-go since some -- MS is really an autoimmune disease. So, I think we'll use the opportunity with licensing collaborations to expand that. I think where our balance sheet is, if something really extraordinary came along, I suppose we look at it, but I don't think where we sit right now, we'd be thinking about doing anything this year on an acquisition front, not certainly of any size. But Mike, maybe you can talk to the balance sheet capability. Mike McDonnell : Yes. So, Paul, I would just comment that our balance sheet is in a very good spot. If you look at our net debt position at the end of the first-quarter, and then you pro forma that for the Samsung payment and the paydown that we'll make in the second quarter on the term loan, it's about $5 billion of net debt. We generate about $3 billion of EBITDA. So, it's only about a -- somewhere between 1.5 turns and 2 turns of leverage. So, we certainly could add another turn of leverage for something that we liked, at least temporarily, and we generate a couple of billion dollars of free cash flow per year. So, I think about it in the context of 2024 as maybe a $4 billion to $5 billion of capacity sort of number for things that we might be really interested in. And then, if you were looking at something more Reata-like, that's probably a little more logical, capacity wise in 2025 or beyond. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Mike and Chris. Can we take the next question, please? Operator : Yes. We'll go next to Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Salveen Richter : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. For SKYCLARYS, could you speak to the 2024 outlook and any bolus dynamics that has impacted this? And specifically, you've talked being 24% US market penetration. How are you thinking about peak penetration in the US and then the expectations for pace of uptake in Europe and net pricing there? Thank you. Chris Viehbacher : Alisha, you want to take US and I can follow up with Europe? Alisha Alaimo : Yes. I think when you look at the US and the market penetration, and you probably saw in the analogs on the slide that the launch has gone very well thus far. And as I also said, we've made it through sort of the catch-up population. We have a lot of really good things in-place right now that we are launching in parallel to identify and hopefully get to the rest of the population. The way in which we think about this market though is, we do have two sets of patients. You have a set that are highly engaged with their physicians, and you have another set who haven't been engaged, probably over the last two to five years. We have enough data and analytics to understand exactly where these physicians are, and how the patients have moved through them. And so, with that, we are now identifying a lot of these offices, especially in the community who could have a patient or two that might be diagnosed with general ataxia, but not Friedreich's. And so, what I referred to earlier on the call is expanding the field force footprint. We have a very targeted approach to these offices in order to, again, increase the market penetration. Now, as you see with something like a SPINRAZA, we've also performed very well, and also have driven quite a good market penetration with that product, even though there's competitors in the marketplace. With SKYCLARYS, with no competitor really in the market, we expect to continue over the next several years to penetrate this for as far as we can go. We know that there are 4,500 approximate patients that could have Friedreich's ataxia. And so, what we're doing is planning everything that we can to get to as many of them as quickly as possible. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Alisha. Chris Viehbacher : Yes. And on Europe, in some ways the single-payer systems actually are really ideal for rare diseases. A lot of patients in the US, even if you have reimbursement, even if you have insurance coverage, there are an awful lot of hurdles that the US healthcare system imposes upon patients. And a lot of those, we don't really see in Europe. And so, I think we're seeing a rapid uptake. Again, there's -- there is a catch-up on population. So there's -- and there's a difference between patients on treatment and revenue-generating patients. So first, we have -- we have actually the commercial launch in Germany because we can get reimbursement relatively quickly. Other countries will come online as we go through the individual country reimbursement processes, but our objective is actually build up the patients. So there's a number who are on free drug at the moment through these EAPs, some of the EAPs you can charge for. So, it's going to be a little lumpy as we look at the revenue line. But I'd say we're extremely encouraged by the uptake of patients. And then, ex-US in Latin America, that could well be a story for 2025. I think you may see our first launch in Brazil in early part of 2025. Chuck Triano : Great. Thanks, Chris. Can we move to the next question, please? Operator : Yes. We'll go next to Umer Raffat with Evercore. Umer Raffat : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have one for Priya, if I may. I know there's the late-stage lupus readout with the CD40 ligand antibody this summer. I also realize the time point on this readout is week 48 instead of week 24. And I guess my question is, knowing that there wasn't a clear dose-response on efficacy in the prior trial, could you speak to how the B cell impact was different between doses and whether the prolonged duration could actually help the B cell impact on this upcoming readout? Thank you. Priya Singhal : Thanks, Umer. We have looked at the Phase 2 study very carefully, and we have decided and we included the 48-week endpoint on BICLA for this Phase 3 study. And ultimately, we're looking for a meaningful change on the primary endpoint, and the key secondary endpoints for SLE such as severe flare prevention and patients achieving low disease activity. We also think that the BICLA is a sensitive, clinically meaningful composite measure of SLE disease activity, and requires disease improvement across all body systems with moderate or severe baseline activity without worsening and the need for escalation in background medications. So we modified the trial, we are -- we have refined the population, and we think that this is going to be really important as we kind of look forward to the readout. The other piece I think here to keep in mind is that we considered how we can modify the population for this study and get to an answer really quickly to bring potentially dapi to patients. So I hope that answers your question. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Priya. Let's go to the next question, please. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Yee with Jefferies. Michael Yee : Hey, guys. Thanks. I wanted to revisit SKYCLARYS comments. I know you said you were planning to add patients month-to-month. Can you just talk about the trajectory of SKYCLARYS this year as it relates to also any offsets like discontinuation rates, et cetera, et cetera, how does that factor into it? And also, will you book Germany revenues this year? So just talk about the dynamics of revenues for SKYCLARYS. And if I may sneak in one clarification. Priya said subcu induction filing for LEQEMBI Q1 2026. I just wanted to clear that's what she said? Thank you so much. Priya Singhal : Yes. The outcome and the filing will be in that period, but we'll communicate more on this once we optimize the dose and we go forward. Michael Yee : Okay. And SKYCLARYS? Alisha Alaimo : Yes. So for SKYCLARYS, it is quite complicated month-to-month, I will say, because you have patients, obviously, that we're getting via the start forms, which I will say for the highly engaged population we are pretty much maxing that out now. We absolutely know who they are and we've captured them through the physicians. But then, you're also going to have a discontinuation rate as you have noted, and you're going to have patients that are being pulled off the start forms, putting on to product. And then of course, you may have them miss a dose or two, right? So then, there's compliance. So month-to-month, it will be lumpy because you can say you add 50 patients, but then you have other dynamics going on in the patient population. But what our outlook is for the year, which I can't give you a specific number, is that we are going to continue to add every single month. We are able to find those patients in the community, and there are other puts and takes in those numbers. But at the end of the day, we will ensure that we are still leading the rare disease analogs and that we're going to generate market penetration. Chris Viehbacher : Yes. And in Europe, we're booking revenue now for Germany and actually -- we've actually launched in Austria and the Czech Republic as well. And in some countries, we're actually able to charge for the early access programs in Europe and some of that revenue will come down too, but you probably see more full EU as a region revenue in 2025, but there will be certainly revenue contributions in 2024 from certain countries in Europe. Chuck Triano : Great. Thanks, Chris. Let's go to the next question, please. Operator : We'll go next to Colin Bristow with UBS. Colin Bristow : Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Maybe one on the LEQEMBI commercial setup. So, one investor concern and important feedback we've been hearing from physicians is around, there being less sales and marketing presence than perhaps had been expected. I heard in your prepared remarks you're saying you expect a 30% increase in the US footprint. Are you able to sort of quantify the current US commercial footprint? And was the 30% increase always planned, or was it based on some review that the current footprint wasn't adequate? Thank you. Alisha Alaimo : Thank you very much for the question. If you really take a step back and look at how we strategically looked at this launch, we always said that we were going to do in a stepwise approach. We knew from the beginning that sites were going to take a while to get up and running. We had to wait for several indicators from CMS giving full approval and NCD being overturned for PET. And so with that being said, we didn't want to go out of the gate with a really huge field force that wasn't able to actually impact or penetrate the market. So instead, what was decided is we went in with a very focused approach. We focused on really the top accounts that we think handle the majority of the diagnosed patients, especially that are under neurology care. And we said once the market gets to a place where we think it's ready for expansion, then we will expand. Now, to your comment about physicians coming back saying they're not seeing a lot of sales efforts, I think, we also have to have really the context of getting these sites up and running takes a lot of effort. And you also don't want to have three, four, five different people going into these accounts to support. And so, we've been very focused on really getting the large IDNs up and running. Some of these centers that have come forward that really could move quite quickly, we got them up and running. And now as you see the expansion take place with the 30%, we are going to focus mainly on the large IDNs that are now opening up their expand and extend satellite offices, where they're now going to allow a larger cohort of patients to come through for diagnosis and treatment. And so, with this next phase of a build, which we believe we've done a lot of analytics behind it, and we've had a lot of third parties weigh-in on what is the appropriate sizing, we and Eisai believe that this is going to be the right footprint to drive the next acceleration of growth. Chuck Triano : And let me just turn it to Priya for a clarification back to Mike Yee's question on subcu. Priya Singhal : Thank you. Thank you. Just wanted to clarify that it's the outcome by fiscal year -- Eisai's fiscal year 2025, which is Q1 2026 for the subcutaneous induction. Of course, that -- it could be a range because it would involve sBLA, a prior -- potentially a priority review and other such aspects, which could shift it, but that is the -- that is what Eisai has communicated. I just wanted to reaffirm that. Thank you. Chuck Triano : So, the outcome and not the filing? Priya Singhal : Yes. Chuck Triano : Obviously earlier? Priya Singhal : Earlier. Chuck Triano : Yes. Priya Singhal : Thank you. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Priya. Let's move to the next question, please. Operator : We'll go next to Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Brian Abrahams : Hi, there. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. With regards to LEQEMBI subcu, on the FDA request for immunogenicity data, I'm curious if you have a sense as to what drove that request. Your level of confidence that the PK will be linear using half the subcu dose? And then, when are you proposing that patients in their course of treatment should transition from an IV to a subcu maintenance? Thanks. Priya Singhal : Sure. Thanks, Brian. So overall, we -- as you know, we had tested the 720 milligrams in the naive patient population that was in the Clarity AD open-label extension sub-study for subcutaneous. Now, from that -- in addition to that, we had modeling data and this is what we are proposing for 360 milligrams to be the weekly maintenance, and the FDA is just requiring additional immunogenicity data. We see this as a reasonable request, and we are already in the process of generating it. So overall, we don't expect that the bioequivalence is going to be in question. This is now really about the immunogenicity and actually generating on patients who would be tested for this. So, that's what we expect with that. Can you remind me what was the second aspect of your question? Brian Abrahams : When are you proposing that patients transition from the IV to the subcu maintenance? Is there data supporting what -- when in the course of treatment that transition should happen? Priya Singhal : Yes. And I think that's important because we have filed for an intravenous maintenance like -- we've already completed this filing Q1 2024, and really that has come from three lines of evidence. The Study 201, which was the Phase 2 study, the GAAP period modeling, as well as open-label extension in the Phase 3. So that's what's informed our maintenance IV filing. And really, it will be decided along with the FDA on what is the appropriate time for transition from IV biweekly to weekly now -- up to four-weekly. And in addition, following that, we'll have the subcutaneous maintenance discussion. So really, it's very systematic and we need to first get through all the IV maintenance. And in parallel, we have the SC maintenance. I hope that makes sense. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Priya. Let's move to the next question, please. Operator : We'll go next to Jay Olson with Oppenheimer. Jay Olson : Oh, hey. Thanks for providing this update. It seems like compared to previous quarters, you're focusing more on your three commercial launches and relatively less on the R&D pipeline. Is there any particular reason for that shift in focus? And how much more work do you plan to do to optimize your R&D portfolio? Thank you. Chris Viehbacher : I'll start. I mean, I think we have first -- four data readouts coming in midyear. So, I think, we felt we'd have more data when we -- it makes sense to bring back the R&D when we've got more data. I would say actually from a prioritization point of view, and Priya, you can weigh-in here, but I think we've largely done the job of having projects that are either projects of conviction, or projects where we're waiting the data outcome. They're in-flight and just given the nature of neuroscience projects, we wait -- we need to wait and see what the data say. I think you're going to find us much more disciplined about whether we progress or not. Our go/no-go decisions, I think have all been clearly defined for those. I think the next job is really now to build out the pipeline, as I talked about earlier, that we want to diversify our business a little bit more than we have in the past. So, Priya is certainly working along with Jane on thinking about what things we can additionally bring into the pipeline from outside. But, Priya, I don't know whether you want to add anything there. Priya Singhal : Thanks, Chris. I think you covered it. That's exactly right. We are very excited about our four readouts. We are preparing for them. We have already worked through go/no-go criteria. And we continue to remain very excited about the rest of the pipeline that's in mid and late-stage, particularly our anti-tau ASO BIIB080, as well as our two Phase 3 programs in SLE, litifilimab as well as dapi that we just talked about, and with litifilimab also in cutaneous lupus. So, we have a number of projects in early phase development, and we're trying to be very disciplined about making sure that we make evidence and data-based decisions. Chuck Triano : Thanks. Thanks, Priya. Next question, please. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Chris Raymond : Thanks. Just maybe a strategic question on your biz dev strategy. So, Chris, I heard your comments around diversifying away from neurology. You guys have been saying that for a while and your deals are focused on areas other than MS. But there is actually, if you look across the industry, some decent early innovation in MS. Even with your business on the decline, our checks still indicate that Biogen remains a trusted company and there's an awful lot of value, I would argue with that market presence. I guess maybe just the question here strategically is, is your activities in business development, is that due to your view of the need to diversify away from MS strategically? Or is it a view that you just haven't seen an early asset worth licensing, or is there some other underlying dynamic of the MS market that has led you guys to prioritize other areas? Thanks. Chris Viehbacher : Yes, well, there's a little bit of a lot of the above in there. I think the first is, we haven't abandoned MS. We do have programs in research early. The unmet need in MS has really narrowed. It's really the progressive form, which is a very tough indication really to go after. But we have programs still in ALS. And in fact, I think the fact that QALSODY was approved has actually proven to be an enormous scientific achievement. It may not be a major financial achievement, but this really opens up the field to having a biomarker where you can tell whether something is working or not in ALS. And so, we have a number of programs in ALS. We're in Huntington's. We have a program in Parkinson's, as you know. We've got TAU, which I think between TAU and lupus, we see as programs of high conviction within the company. So, we feel that -- I think you're right. We are very well-placed. Neurology, I wouldn't just say MS, but neurology. But the reality is that, we sit there with programs that are very difficult to predict, very expensive, very long running. And when you actually look at the ability to do external deals, that field is also very narrow. There's just not that many people working in the CNS space. So we're by no means abandoning it. And in fact, the fact that we go after these really tough diseases is really a source of pride within Biogen. And I have to say, I continue to be amazed at the capability and talent we have within the organization. But the reality is, we need to have more predictable results out of R&D. And I think we do have a lot of that capability within the company. I don't see us ever -- moving -- going left turn into oncology or something like that. But I do think we have a legitimacy and being in rare diseases and expanding into immunology. And in fact, I think what we've been doing in MS and in fact lupus is really an indicator of that. So, I think we're going to continue to branch out, but it also branches out our opportunity set for collaboration, and not just diversifying our portfolio. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Chris. And can we take our last question, please, operator? Operator : Yes. We'll go next to Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a two-part on LEQEMBI. Just wondering, obviously, you talked about the number of unique prescribers more than doubling this quarter. Just wondering how much more breadth you're expecting from the field force expansion here as we think about the forward through 2024? And then, any early insights on duration of treatment that you're seeing so far? Thank you. Alisha Alaimo : Yes. So thank you for the question. My outlook for the rest of the year is, when you really think about the phases that these IDNs are in, and even you see these small accounts that they do move fast out in the community. And if you really take a step back and look in context for the IDNs, we got an approval -- full approval in July. It took about six to eight months for these very large systems to get organized, which is that staged and phased approach I talked about. And the fact that now they're actually opening up these other sites for diagnosing and prescribing, I believe that you're going to also see the number of physicians prescribing increasing, and it will continue to increase throughout the rest of the year. If you look at how many physicians that we are targeting and the numbers that are actually prescribing, we still have a good delta there. And so, I do see that continuing, especially with the field force coming in, if they're covering, our goal is really to drive the acceleration at these large IDNs. I talked to you about the Priority 100, but keep in mind, we actually target quite more than that. I just keep referring to the priority. And there are many other IDNs that are also prescribing and are also expanding and extending. The second part of your question was around -- Chuck Triano : Duration. Alisha Alaimo : Duration. What's interesting with this and there's been a lot of conversations with many of these prescribing sites. Physicians lay very specific and explicit expectations with patients that when they go on this therapy, their expectation is they come in, every two weeks, to get their IV infusion and that they stay on product. And what we've seen thus far, and what we believe to be happening thus far is patients are staying on product. We hear that as feedback from the physicians. We also hear that as feedback from the numbers that we see the data that we see. So, so far with duration, the plan is that they're keeping patients on product. I think there are questions out there as to what to do about duration, but in the absence of any data, physicians are keeping patients on. Chuck Triano : Right. Thanks, Alisha, and thanks to all of you for joining us today for the call and the IR team, of course, is available for follow-ups. Have a good rest of your day.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call and Business Update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Triano, you may begin your conference. Chuck Triano : Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and welcome to Biogen's second quarter 2024 earnings call. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release and other documents related to our results, as well as the reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on the call, can be found in the Investors section at biogen.com. We have also posted the slides on our website that will be used during this call. On today's call, I'm joined by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Viehbacher; our Head and President of North America, Alisha Alaimo; Dr. Priya Singhal, Head of Development; Mike McDonnell, Chief Financial Officer, and we'll be introducing Dr. Travis Murdoch from HI-Bio on the call. We'll make some opening comments and then we'll move to the Q&A session. And to allow us to get through as many questions as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Chris. Chris Viehbacher : Thanks, Chuck. We got a lot to cover this morning, but first, in addition to our regular team of Priya, Alisha, and Mike, I'd like to welcome a new member to our team, Dr. Travis Murdoch. Travis is a physician who trained as a gastroenterologist and then studied immunology as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford. Following a career at McKinsey, Third Rock, and Softbank, he became the founder and CEO of HI-Bio. I'm pleased to welcome Travis and the HI-Bio team to Biogen. We now have, again, a presence on the West Coast. And the HI-Bio team, working in collaboration with their Biogen colleagues on the East Coast, will drive forward the development of felzartamab. So we're announcing really strong quarterly results this morning, but I would say this is really a quarter that has lasted 18 months. I think the results we're presenting really reflect the hard work of team Biogen to transform our company. 18 months ago, we were a company that had been declining for four years in revenue and profit. And we have been working pretty tirelessly for the last 18 months to really turn that around and create a new future for ourselves. At the Q4 earnings in February of 2023, we outlined five priorities. First one was focus on new launches. Second was to reduce our cost base and align resources with growth opportunities. Third was to focus our investments in R&D on the most promising assets and improve the risk/reward profile. Four was to optimize our existing portfolio. And five was external growth. We've had a few setbacks along the way, but nonetheless, I think the results today really show that Biogen has done what it said it would do. And that to me has been always important in business. So if I take each one of those, I think if we look at our new product launches, all of the launches are either in line or ahead of expectations. I'm particularly happy to see the very strong results for LEQEMBI, not only in the US, but there's been a very successful launch in Japan. And the early data from China are also extremely promising, and Alisha will talk more about that. Last year, we set out to reduce our cost base and we are more than on track on delivering on those results and you can see that in the not only the reduction in OpEx but the very strong improvement in margins and Mike will talk about that. But one of the things that you don't see in the P&L that I'm particularly proud of is although we've really reduced our cost base and improved our margins, we have invested massively where we need to for growth opportunities, both in LEQEMBI and the other launches, but also on really trying to turbocharge some of the key assets in R&D. And, Priya will talk more about that, but one of the beneficiaries of that is BIIB080, and another one is litifilimab. We also have -- although we have seen a declining MS portfolio due to increased competition, particularly from biosimilars and from generics, we still had a number of products where we still had long patent protection. And one was SPINRAZA. And I think we've seen some very good performance. This is a very competitive space. And SPINRAZA has been able to hold its own. I think when I first joined the company, most people thought we were predicting the decline of that. Today, I would say the bumpiness tends to be in some countries where we only ship every now and then. I think in Russia, for example, we do one shipment per year. So that business has always been a little bit bumpy. But if you look at market share, I think SPINRAZA has done extremely well. And I'm very pleased to see VUMERITY growing at double digits again now in the US. This is the only patent protected product in the oral segment of MS. We see an awful lot of movement in the injectable part, but the oral segment has stayed pretty much constant and it's a great opportunity and I'm glad to see Alisha and her team really taking advantage of that. And then, we always said we were going to be open to external growth and I think the Reata transaction last year is really starting to pay dividends. We're seeing a very strong launch not only in the US, but now also in Europe. As you know, we tend to get patients on access programs and then the reimbursement follows. But we are expecting to be approved in 20 countries by the end of this year. And I think we're extremely happy with that. ZURZUVAE addresses a huge unmet need and that launch is also well in excess of expectations. So as I sit here today, I would say, the results that you're seeing are not, as I say, just the results of what we've done in the second quarter, but really, I think we're putting up scores on the scoreboard here that really now are starting to demonstrate all of those initiatives that we put in place last year and we're starting to deliver on them. Now of course we're not done yet and I think there's a real opportunity to continue to develop a sustainable growth platform. And we'll do that in two ways. The first is really, now that we have prioritized R&D, I see the Alzheimer's portfolio as being a core franchise for us for the coming years. We're obviously continuing to invest heavily in LEQEMBI with the maintenance indication, the subcutaneous, but also I think the AHEAD study, if we can really get the evidence that it will really demonstrate the importance of early treatment. Priya will talk about it, but the 36-month data that we showed at AAIC this week are extremely important for the future growth of LEQEMBI. But we've always known there will be other modalities, and I think tau is emerging as an extremely important modality for the treatment of Alzheimer's, and I think Biogen is a clear leader in that. And again, Priya will say more about that. We're also seeing an emerging lupus portfolio. We'll have a readout later this year with dapirolizumab that we share with UCB. But we're quite excited about litifilimab, both for SLE as well as cutaneous lupus. And we add another element to the lupus portfolio with felza because that is actually in Phase 1 for lupus nephritis. And to me, and Travis will go into this more, but the acquisition of HI-Bio is extremely important for our longer term growth outlook. This is an opportunity to present a set of opportunities that have a different risk-benefit profile. We have very strong Phase 2 results, which gives us a whole lot more confidence in Phase 3 results than some of the other assets that we have in our portfolio. Neuroscience is an area of a very important unmet need, but it's also one of the riskiest and hardest areas. And so I think we get a little bit more balance in our portfolio by pursuing things in immunology. And so I personally am extremely excited about felza and what Travis and his team can do. The other axis to this is we're going to continue to look at business development. I think you have seen that we're pretty disciplined. I think both of the acquisitions that we've done so far with Reata and HI-Bio will drive an awful lot of shareholder value and that is certainly top of mind as we look at business development. So I think Biogen is in a much different place than we were 18 months ago. We still have a number of challenges like any other company, but I think we're really positioned for longer-term growth now at the company. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Alisha to give us a little more color on the successful launches. Alisha Alaimo : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call today. Today I'll provide our perspective on the progress with LEQEMBI, SKYCLARYS and ZURZUVAE. So I will begin with the Alzheimer's market. We believe we're continuing to build momentum with more health systems across the country, now having the capability to treat a higher volume of Alzheimer's patients. And in Q2, we saw these promising trends continue. Notably, we sustained new patient growth. Nearly 40% of all commercial patients on therapy since launch, started treatment during Q2. The number of physicians prescribing LEQEMBI also grew by 50%. Depth of ordering at our priority 100 IDNs continued to accelerate, and the total order volume more than doubled again in Q2 compared to Q1. It's important to know that based on the data we've seen to date, these trends continued into the first weeks of July, demonstrating that we are sustaining launch progress. We also believe we're seeing positive signals that health system capacity may be increasing. For example, last quarter, I described how some IDNs are expanding and extending their sites of care. Through Q2, nearly 70% of the activated priority 100 IDNs expanded beyond their flagship sites to treat patients at their trial sites. And we have seen this dynamic play out beyond the priority IDNs as well. We believe this growing real world experience with LEQEMBI\u2019s efficacy and safety further strengthens its unique profile in a newly competitive market. Specifically, some HCP share that because LEQEMBI was studied in the broadest and most diverse population of any anti-amyloid drug today, it removed some of the complex considerations about which potential patients are appropriate for Alzheimer's treatments. Alzheimer's is a chronic, degenerative, and fatal disease that does not stop even after plaque is removed. In fact, our long-term data show that patients who stopped LEQEMBI treatment experienced rapid re-accumulation of key plasma biomarkers that indicate Alzheimer's disease biology was returning. Importantly, the rate of decline in most patients who stopped therapy were averted to the rate of decline observed in patients who took placebo, which is why we believe patients deserve a therapy with a benefit-risk profile that enables them to remain on treatment to stay ahead of disease progression, even after removing plaques by preventing ongoing damage and plaque buildup. Recent data that Priya will describe reinforces that in patients with three years of continuous treatment, LEQEMBI showed continued benefits. And finally, though there are no head-to-head studies comparing the available therapies, the FDA has been clear that the incidence and timing of ARIA vary among drugs in this class. Observed ARIA rates in patients who receive LEQEMBI were the lowest reported among any Phase 3 trial for a drug with traditional FDA approval in the class, with LEQEMBI rates nearly 50% lower. To reinforce LEQEMBI's unique profile with our customers, Biogen deployed our expanded field force just last month. This team increases our focus and frequency, engaging with high-value sites, and expands our reach to 30% more HCPs. We've been receiving positive feedback since the launch of this team. Biogen's field force is working even more closely with our partner Eisai, and we believe this is deepening our customer insights and we will enable accelerated growth. We're encouraged by two strong quarters of growth and the sustained progress in July, and we look forward to providing more support to the healthcare community and people living with Alzheimer's disease. Now, moving on to the SKYCLARYS update, where we continue our strong launch momentum reaching more Friedreich's Ataxia patients globally. In the second quarter, we delivered $100 million in revenue globally and remain ahead of our internal expectations. Europe launch is ahead of internal forecast and along with rest of world builds on the success in the US. SKYCLARYS is now available in 12 markets outside the US including the EU where we are initiating new patients in the catch-up population. These patients and their HCPs are highly engaged in their care and often awaiting SKYCLARYS approval, as is typical for rare disease launches. In the US, we have moved beyond the catch-up population as SKYCLARYS has been in market for more than a year. The team continues to leverage our strong rare disease capabilities and we are encouraged by the early results of engaging patients and physicians in this next phase. In Q2, roughly one-third of new patient start forms came from new writers tied to our AI program, which analyzes hundreds of thousands of de-identified patient journeys. This includes a meaningful share from community neurologists and PCPs. Globally, our outlook in FA is promising in both the short and long term. We anticipate driving strong growth by making SKYCLARYS available in additional geographies, potential expansion into pediatric populations, and with our years of experience identifying patients, we believe we can help. Turning to ZURZUVAE, we continue to outperform our expectations in the first six months of launch. We saw strong growth in the second quarter with US revenue growing 19% and patient demand nearly doubling versus the first quarter. OB-GYNs continue to lead prescribing and patients are sharing positive early experiences with their physicians and on social media platforms. Based on our recent market research, we believe we've achieved higher than average aided awareness of ZURZUVAE among providers, outperforming [messaging recall] (ph) analogs in the women's health and psychiatry markets. To achieve the next phase of growth and advance our vision to transform the care of postpartum depression, we are working to more deeply understand how to realize the patient opportunity in this market and drive real behavior change. In conclusion, while each launch is unique, we are pleased that we remain on track or ahead of our expectations across all three therapies. We know we have more work to do to help people living with Alzheimer's, Friedrich's Ataxia, and postpartum depression, and we are working with urgency to help these patient communities. I will now pass to Priya. Priya Singhal : Thank you, Alisha. Over the last year, we have focused heavily on reviewing our existing pipeline with an eye toward improving its risk profile. The focus now is on building the pipeline through a combination of both internal and external opportunities with an eye towards risk diversification and creating value. We also remain focused on investing to win in Alzheimer's disease, where we believe we have a differentiated product in LEQEMBI, as well as an industry-leading R&D pipeline of potential next-generation therapies. Beginning with LEQEMBI. LEQEMBI is the only approved anti-amyloid antibody with, first, a dual mechanism of action targeting both amyloid plaques and highly toxic protofibrils. Second, clinical data across the full early Alzheimer's disease population, including individuals with no and low tau. And third, extensive real-world evidence. Importantly, as Alicia mentioned, Alzheimer's disease is a chronic progressive disease and we believe the dual action of LEQEMBI and the option for continued treatment is a unique advantage for patients looking to maintain or further clinical benefit. To this point, at AAIC earlier this week, Eisai presented three-year data from the Phase 3 CLARITY study and its open-label extension, which shows continued clinical benefit with longer duration LEQEMBI treatment. Shown on the left, this includes data from the early start group or individuals who started LEQEMBI during the 18-month placebo-controlled portion of the study, delayed start group or patients from the placebo arm who switched over to LEQEMBI at the start of the open label extension, as well as a baseline matched natural history cohort from ADNI. The early start group shows that three years of continuous leukemia treatment reduced clinical decline by negative 0.95 on CDR sum of boxes as compared to the natural history cohort, resulting in a clinically meaningful benefit for early AD patients. This represents an expansion of the benefit observed at 18 months. It is very important to keep in mind that a change from 0.5 to 1 on the CDR score domains of memory, community affairs, home and hobbies is the difference between slight impairment and loss of independence. We believe these results are significant as the majority of individuals, approximately 70%, had already successfully cleared plaque by the 18-month time point. Furthermore, data from the lecanemab Phase 2 study, shown on the right, which included a treatment gap of approximately two years on average, shows that Alzheimer's disease continues to progress when treatment is stopped or interrupted even after plaques are removed. Also at AAIC, Eisai presented data which showed that 51% of patients in the Clarity AD study with either no or low tau representing an early stage of Alzheimer's showed improvement from baseline in cognition and function over a three-year period as assessed by CDR sum of boxes. Taken together, these data suggest that earlier initiation of treatment with lecanemab may have a significant positive impact on disease progression and may provide continued benefits to patients with early Alzheimer's disease over the long term. We continue to focus our efforts on LEQEMBI with a goal of characterizing dosing for its long-term benefit, providing optionality with subcutaneous formulation, as well as evaluating its role in preclinical AD population, as Chris mentioned. Lastly, while we were disappointed to learn that lecanemab received a negative opinion from the CHMP, we believe that the clinical data supports a clear favorable benefit risk profile with a meaningful clinical benefit to patients. Furthermore, thousands of patients have now been treated with lecanemab globally, providing further real-world evidence on the efficacy and manageable safety profile. We are continuing to work with Eisai as they plan to request a re-examination of the EU filing as we work to enable access for people suffering from Alzheimer's globally. We continue to also invest in our broader Alzheimer's pipeline, including our investigational anti-tau ASO BIIB080. Based on the encouraging data from the Phase 1b study, we have now implemented a protocol amendment for the ongoing Phase 2 CELIA study with the aim of accelerating a potential proof-of-concept outcome. We are excited that this amendment, combined with the robust enrollment trends observed to date, may enable a readout in 2026. Beyond amyloid and tau and under Jane's guidance in research, we are advancing a preclinical AD pipeline that encompasses diverse targets and modalities, including active transport approaches. As communicated today in our earnings release, we decided to exit the ATV :A\u03b2 collaboration with Denali. We continue to see merit in modalities that can actively transport therapeutic agents into the brain. And we continue to prioritize these efforts as we work to build upon our existing leadership in AD. Looking back over the last few months, while we discontinued three mid-stage programs based on readouts, we continued to make progress across several other areas of our pipeline. The first patient has received a dose of SKYCLARYS in Biogen's Phase 1 dose finding study for pediatric Friedreich's Ataxia. This is the first step in potentially expanding SKYCLARYS access to the pediatric population. And once a dose is identified, we plan to conduct a Phase 3 study to assess the benefit/risk in pediatric patients. We also expect the DEVOTE study evaluating high dose SPINRAZA to readout in this second half of the year. We have also made meaningful progress in immunology where the first patient was dosed in the litifilimab Phase 3 portion of the operationally seamless Phase 2/3 Amethyst study in CLE following the completion of the Phase 2 enrollment. As Chris mentioned, we continue to view immunology as a significant potential driver of Biogen's future growth and the recent acquisition of HI-Bio is an example of this importance. With that, I would like to hand over the call to Travis, who will dive a bit deeper into felzartamab. Travis Murdoch : Thank you, Priya. I'm very excited to be here speaking today as part of the Biogen team. I believe we have a unique opportunity to combine HI-Bio's expertise in immune mediated indications with Biogen's global development and commercial experience in specialized immunology and rare diseases. I believe this synergy will have significant benefit as we work to accelerate our lead asset, felzartamab, or felza, into late stage development. As an anti-CD38 antibody, we believe felzartamab has a differentiated molecular design that specifically targets and depletes plasma cells responsible for producing pathogenic antibodies, while sparing the broader B-cell lineage. This is different from other programs currently in development for antibody-mediated diseases that more broadly impact B cells. Compared to other mechanisms, we believe the specificity of felza's MOA may allow for a differentiated and more desirable clinical profile characterized by more durable efficacy and improved safety profile. As Chris mentioned, one of Biogen's goals is to optimize the risk/reward of the pipeline and I believe the acquisition of felza significantly advances that effort. Through its cell depletion approach, felza has already demonstrated clinical proof of concept across multiple rare immunology indications. Antibody mediated rejection, AMR, IgA nephropathy, IgAN, and primary membranous nephropathy, or PMN, are serious conditions that lead to severe consequences for patients such as transplant failure or end stage kidney disease and available treatment options leave significant unmet need. And so, we see significant potential commercial opportunity here. Now I'd like to briefly review the felza data generated to date across these indications to highlight the potential value we see for patients. AMR is the leading cause of kidney transplant loss in the US, with no approved treatments and prior investigational agents have not demonstrated significant resolution of AMR on biopsy. The consequences here can be dire, ending with graft failure, dialysis, and a need for retransplantation in many cases. In the Phase 2 study, which we published in The New England Journal of Medicine, nine doses of felza IV administered over a five-month period resulted in greater than 80% AMR resolution at week 24 versus 20% for the placebo group. Furthermore, two-thirds of responders maintained AMR resolution out to 52 weeks. So we believe these results, if replicated in a registrational study, are potentially transformative for this disease. Next, I'd like to discuss IgA nephropathy, or IgAN, which is the most prevalent chronic glomerular disease worldwide and another indication where we believe felza has the potential to deliver a treatment option for patients with important differentiation. Felza directly depletes CD38 positive plasma cells, the producers of both galactose-deficient-IgA1 and its autoantibody, which are believed to be the most upstream causes of IgAN. As shown here on the slide, felza treatment resulted in durable reductions in IgA up to 24 months, which is more than 18 months after the last dose. Importantly, this pharmacodynamic effect was selective for IgA, with IgG and IgM levels rebounding to baseline after the completion of the five-month felza treatment. These results, paired with the emerging clinical efficacy data, suggest that felza could have a durable selective effect on IgA and thus impact IgAN disease biology, while potentially allowing for the maintenance of general protective immunity conferred by IgG and IgM antibodies over a prolonged period on therapy. Similar to the effects we saw in IgA, interim results from the Phase 2 IGNAZ study showed a durable reduction in proteinuria as measured by UPCR. Specifically, we saw there was a dose dependent reduction in UPCR, durable out to the 24 month time point. Now in terms of potential differentiation, it's important to note that this improvement is after more than 18 months of being off therapy, supporting the potential for felza to be the first non-chronic treatment option in IgAN. Furthermore, in line with the selective targeting of plasma cells, administration of felza was generally well tolerated with the safety profile consistent with prior studies. We believe these interim results potentially provide for a wide therapeutic window and may ultimately lower the risk of chronic immunosuppression, which could be a significant benefit for IgAN patients. Moving to PMN. So this is a severe antibody mediated disease in the kidney that's a leading cause of nephrotic syndrome, which is a severe syndrome resulting from excretion of too much protein in the urine and which causes symptoms such as swelling and fatigue and increased risk of infection. Current standard of care, which includes immunosuppressive and chemotherapeutic agents, has proven insufficient as up to 40% of patients do not achieve remission and many progress to end stage kidney disease. It's estimated that up to 80% of patients with PMN have auto antibodies against PLA2R, which is a kidney antigen and which provides us with a key biomarker both for patient stratification as well as treatment response. In the Phase 2 M-PLACE study, which evaluated felza in both newly diagnosed and relapsed patients as well as patients refractory to immunosuppressive therapy, a 24-week felza treatment resulted in rapid, deep and durable reduction in anti-PLA2R antibodies in both patient cohorts at the one-year time point. Many patients retained immunologic complete response more than six months after the last dose of felza, which highlights the durability of felza's treatment effect. Importantly, the effect on anti-PLA2R was mirrored when examining reductions in proteinuria. And in line with prior studies of felza, TEAEs were generally mild or moderate in severity. Based on these results, we believe that felza has the potential to provide a meaningful new treatment for patients suffering with PMN. In summary, we believe the data generated to date highlight the potential for felza to be a best-in-class treatment option across multiple serious immunologic diseases with significant unmet need. Phase 2 data across AMR, IgAN, and PMN have provided proof-of-concept and highlighted a potentially differentiated clinical profile on the basis of efficacy, treatment durability and safety. I'm looking forward now to combining the strengths of the joint HI-Bio and Biogen team as we work to incorporate these learnings and further refine our Phase 3 plans. Now we expect to initiate Phase 3 studies across AMR, IgAN, and PMN next year, beginning with AMR in the first half of the year. I'd now like to pass the call over to Mike for a financial update. Mike McDonnell : Thank you, Travis, and good morning, good afternoon to everyone. I'd like to start by acknowledging the entire Biogen team for a strong second quarter. I'm pleased to provide some color on the results and please note that all the comparisons that I will make are versus the second quarter of 2023. Total revenue of $2.5 billion was up marginally versus the prior year at actual currency and grew 1% at constant currency. But importantly, we grew our core pharmaceutical revenue 5% at actual currency and 6% at constant currency. This was driven by the performance of our four recent launches, which more than offset the revenue decline in our MS business. Non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 31% to $5.28 and included a one-time benefit of $0.52 from the sale of one of our two priority review vouchers. Absent the PRV sale, non-GAAP EPS would have grown 18% to $4.76. We also reported a 43% improvement in non-GAAP operating income, which was a 30% improvement excluding the PRV sale. We continue to benefit from our R&D prioritization and fit for growth initiatives, where I'll provide more detail in a moment. We are pleased to be raising our full year 2024 guidance range. And in just a few moments, I will also provide some additional details on our guidance. Now a bit more color on our revenue for the second quarter. Our MS franchise revenue declined approximately 5% in the quarter, and there are a few dynamics in this business that are worth highlighting. First, we continue to see erosion of our interferon business as the entire class is seeing a shift to higher efficacy or oral therapies. Regarding TECFIDERA in the EU, we have now seen most generics exit the market, which helped drive ex-US growth of 11% at actual currency and 12% at constant currency to $208 million this quarter. We continue to believe that we are entitled to market protection in the EU until February of 2025. VUMERITY had its best quarter since launch as global revenue grew 13% at actual and constant currency to $166 million. VUMERITY remains the number one branded oral in terms of share in the United States. US TYSABRI revenue of $249 million declined 4% and benefited from the timing of shipments in the quarter, which was offset by declines due to competition within the high efficacy class. Next, our rare disease franchise produced revenue of $534 million and that represented growth of 22% at actual currency and 25% at constant currency. SKYCLARYS global revenue was $100 million. Global SPINRAZA revenue of $429 million declined 2% at actual currency and was flat at constant currency. US revenue was up 1% to $157 million, and we remain encouraged by the resilience here. And on LEQEMBI, we saw significant sequential growth with second quarter global in-market sales booked by Eisai of approximately $40 million, which included $30 million of US in-market sales. I'll turn now to a few comments on expenses. We continue to see lower non-GAAP cost of sales as a percentage of revenue, which was driven by a more favorable product mix, notably growth in SKYCLARYS replacing lower margin contract manufacturing revenue. We also had no idle capacity charges during the quarter versus $34 million in the second quarter of 2023. As mentioned previously, our R&D prioritization and fit for growth programs have begun to significantly improve our profitability. Second quarter non-GAAP R&D expense decreased from the second quarter of 2023 by $120 million or 21% as we continue to focus our spend on programs with the highest probability of success. Non-GAAP SG&A expense increased 1% in the second quarter. We have significantly reduced selling costs for legacy products and also significantly reduced our general and administrative cost base, which has allowed us to absorb most of the approximately $100 million of Q2 2024 incremental launch costs for LEQEMBI and SKYCLARYS. Now, a brief update on our balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $1.9 billion of cash and marketable securities. As a reminder, we utilized $1.15 billion of this balance in July when we closed the HI-Bio acquisition. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.4 billion of net debt. During the quarter, we fully repaid the remaining balance of the $1 billion term loan that we put in place at the time of the Reata acquisition. And we continue to generate strong cash flow in the second quarter with approximately $592 million of free cash flow, which brings us to approximately $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the first half of 2024. We continue to believe that our balance sheet has the capacity for us to invest in both internal and external growth opportunities. Turning now to guidance. We're pleased that the operating performance of the business year-to-date supports raising our full year 2024 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance from a previous range of $15 to $16 to a new range of between $15.75 to $16.25. This new range reflects expected growth of approximately 9% at the midpoint of the range compared to the full year of 2023. I would like to highlight several important things to remember for the second half of 2024 as you update your models. In terms of revenue, with our key products all performing generally in line or slightly ahead of expectations, there is a slight increase to the previous expectations for the year. We now expect full year total revenue to decline by a low-single-digit percentage when compared to 2023. We also expect core pharmaceutical revenue to be roughly flat year-over-year as recent launches are expected to progress and provide an offset to some key potential dynamics in the second half of the year. These include expected continued pressure on our MS franchise, which incorporates the potential for a biosimilar entrant in the US for TYSABRI, and we continue to monitor the timing of shipments for SPINRAZA in certain ex-US markets. Next, the sale of one of our two priority review vouchers is a non-recurring item. And since we expect to reinvest the proceeds of this sale and growth initiatives later this year, we do not expect this benefit to impact our full year EPS. Also, some key points to consider regarding our operating expenses. In the second half of the year, we expect to continue to ramp launch spending on our new product launches. This will include the 30% increase in the LEQEMBI field force, which is coming online as well as additional spend for some targeted direct-to-consumer campaigns. In addition, we expect incremental OpEx, primarily on the R&D line, of approximately $50 million in the back half of the year related to HI-Bio as we execute plans on three potential Phase 3 starts. We continue to expect full year 2024 combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense of approximately $4.3 billion. We reported approximately $2 billion of spend in the first half of the year, implying higher spend in the second half of the year due to the reasons I just mentioned, along with some typical phasing of expenses throughout the year. I would also note that we now expect 2024 operating income to grow at a mid to high teen percentage versus the previous guide of a low double-digit percent growth. This improvement factors in higher expenses in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year, partially offset by higher revenue due to our new product launches. I would remind you that we expect a reduction in interest income of approximately $20 million for the remainder of 2024, and this is due to lower cash balances and associated lower interest income resulting from the HI-Bio acquisition. As always, our guidance does not consider the impact from any potential acquisitions or large business development transactions or pending and future litigations as these are often difficult to predict. I would refer to you to our press release for other important guidance assumptions. And just before we open it up for Q&A, I wanted to provide a brief update regarding the strategic review of our biosimilars business. After a comprehensive review of potential externalization options compared to retaining the business, we believe that the best value for shareholders going forward is to retain the business within our portfolio and to optimize the business with an aim to maximize profitability. And with that, we will open up the call for questions. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Mike. Operator, can we please poll for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Salveen Richter : Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter. At a high level, there's been significant focus on 2024 as a turning point for the company, both product wise for the launches and operationally, given the cost savings programs and pipeline prioritization. Just given the raised guidance here of 9% year-over-year EPS growth for this year, can you just speak to your confidence around 2023 being the trough year for earnings and what needs to play out from here for clean growth through the end of the decade? Thank you. Chris Viehbacher : Yeah, thank you for the question, Salveen. And our mission at Biogen remains to bring ourselves to sustainable growth on both the top line and the bottom line. Obviously, our original guidance, which implied growth of 5% on the bottom line at the midpoint and now 9% at the midpoint, shows that we've now turned the corner on the bottom line and we're very focused on our cost savings program, which importantly not only improve our operating performance, but also free up capital for growth initiatives. So that's real important. Obviously, we don't guide beyond 2024, but I would say that, when you look at our guidance this year, we're pleased with the fact that we've been able to get our top line somewhat much more stabilized and we've got the bottom line growing again as we look to next year. We're pleased with the progress of the launches. Our ability to restore the top line is going to be somewhat dependent on how those launches continue to perform along with how the MS franchise continues to sustain and be durable. And what I can say is that we're very focused on bringing the company back to growth. And we're certainly hopeful that 2023 was the trough year. And obviously, we're doing a nice job growing the bottom line in 2024 and we'll have more to say about the out-years as we move to the latter part of this year and into early next. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Mike. Can we take our next question, please, operator? Operator : Yes. The next question will come from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is [indiscernible] on for Mohit. Thanks for taking our questions. I had a question on the EMA decision on LEQEMBI. Do you plan to submit additional evidence on efficacy or safety from trials or from real world evidence to reverse this position? And what's your confidence that the decision can be reversed? And what should we think about for timeline for the EMA to reconsider and would a SAG need to be convened for this process? Thanks. Priya Singhal : Thank you. This is Priya Singal. We are very disappointed, along with Eisai, at the outcome of the negative opinion for LEQEMBI. We continue to believe that the benefit/risk is positive and favorable. As you know, it's been approved in major regions of the world like the United States, China, Japan, and recently, we've also communicated approvals in Hong Kong, Israel as well as South Korea. So, yes, we have communicated publicly and I can reaffirm that we will be applying for a reexamination process. The way the reexamination process works is that you can continue to work with a newly appointed rapporteur and co-rapporteur for the process. So, right now, we would wait to receive the assessment report from the CHMP, the new rapporteur and co-rapporteur would be appointed and then we would work with them to understand what are the issues that are driving the decision. And currently, based on the opinion that was rendered, we believe these are addressable with the data that we've generated. Specifically, we have generated long-term data as we shared at AAIC and we would look to be engaging with the EMA and CHMP to see how we can submit additional data and the extensive real-world data that we have in the real world because thousands of patients now have been treated. So we have long-term continued benefit as we showed in the three month -- three year data at AAIC and also long-term safety. So we're continuing to work very closely with Eisai on the reexamination process and strategy. It is possible that a new SAG-N would be appointed and this process would generally move faster than the original application. Chuck Triano : All right. Thanks for the details, Priya. Next question, please. Operator : Yes, that will be from Kevin Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Evan Seigerman : Hi there. It's Evan Seigerman. Question for Priya. Can you walk me through some of the rationale on opting out of the Angelman Syndrome Program with Ionis? How has your approach to evaluating partnerships evolved recently and what aspects of a program do you now more closely scrutinize when you're thinking about what to do with a partner? Priya Singhal : I think just stepping back, I want to point us to comments we've made externally before as well that we have really -- we really looked at our readouts as important inflection points which allow us to double down, accelerate in those programs if the data are objectively clear and compelling. And then the other option would be that we can pivot and pivot to other programs that we may be considering. So overall, our process is that we develop up a priority go/no-go criteria. And based on that, we decide what the probability technical and regulatory success is in a particular program. And that is exactly the approach that we applied with the Angelman Syndrome, the BIIB121 data. That is going to be continuing to be the way that we look at all our readouts and we try to be very disciplined. I think things that we find very compelling are biomarkers, established regulatory pathways, clinical tractability as well as our confidence in regulatory endpoints or on our interact -- based on interactions with regulators. So we look at all of these and that's how we think about investment in Phase 3. Chris Viehbacher : If I could just add, I think, in addition to what Priya said, we're also looking at the ability to launch products globally. And so, we also are interested in the level of evidence and regulatory endpoints as they may be acceptable to payers and regulators around the world and not just in the US. Chuck Triano : Great. Thank you both. Next question, please, operator. Operator : Yes, sir. That next question will come from Michael DiFiore with Evercore ISI. Michael DiFiore : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. So I was wondering if there's any updates on the subcu induction dose optimization work you're doing and whether this could lead to a more optimal risk/benefit ratio that the EMA is looking for? Priya Singhal : Yes. So, overall, as Eisai and Biogen have communicated, we continue to -- we've already filed for the IV maintenance and we have a fast track and a rolling submission in place for the subcutaneous maintenance dosing. With the initiation of subcutaneous dosing, we are looking at optimizing the dose. We're continuing to work with FDA on this effort. And currently, we are on track, as we've communicated, to have an outcome on this from the FDA in the US by Q1, calendar year Q1 2026. Now with regards to your specific question about how this could impact the application in Europe, I just want to be really clear that the application in Europe that's currently -- we're going to pursue re-examination is dependent on the original application, which is really for intravenous LEQEMBI. We would hope that we can get that -- a favorable outcome at the end of the reexamination process. And if so, we would continue down the path of again providing options to patients as well as in Europe with subcutaneous formulation. Chuck Triano : Thank you, Priya. Next question, please. Operator : Yes, that will be from Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Nicole Gabreski : Thanks. This is Nicole Gabreski on for Chris. Maybe just one on LEQEMBI. So some of our survey work we've done recently with neurologists and Alzheimer's specialists has kind of indicated maybe a less favorable view of the risk/benefit and cost/benefit ratios for LEQEMBI in recent quarters. And I guess we're starting to see some feedback from docs also questioning the amyloid hypothesis as a whole. I guess maybe just given this, could you speak to the interactions and/or feedback that reps are having in the field? I guess, are you starting to maybe experience any pushback as you move from HPPs who are sort of ready and waiting to prescribe LEQEMBI soon after approval to those who are in the next wave of uptake? Alisha Alaimo : Thank you for the question. This is Alisha. Whenever we look at market research, I think it's important to understand who you're asking in the market research. And so, when we look at what's happening in the field, at least on the ground, when you're asking the physicians, if you were to parse out market research and ask the physicians who are currently obviously prescribing, and the ones who aren't, the ones who are prescribing are the ones that we've been working really hard on over this past year. They're the ones that understand the data, they've been visited by MSLs, they've been visited by representatives and then it takes them time to obviously get up and running with their facility. You also then see across the board that other physicians see this happening and some in, like, a nearer location will also start obviously picking up the product. And so, on the ground and with our representatives, they go from office to office. We're obviously expanding now as well with the additional field force. And what we've seen is the ones that you call on are the ones that actually start writing. And there's a lot of dynamics at play here. I think that understanding this data is important. I think understanding all the mechanics in order to get a patient diagnosed is important and having them set up their capacity is important. And so, we don't really hear any pushback about cost/benefit. I can say that. And I think more importantly, what we're hearing now is because we are a year out, we're starting to really get the real world experience feedback from physicians on the impact this is having on patients and the caregivers and the families. And I think that alone has really also accelerated some of these physicians to try and treat patients even more quickly. And so, for now, we're not really hearing that pushback. Chris Viehbacher : And if I could just add to that, after decades of this, I tend to pay more attention to what physicians do versus what they say. And this is a very heavy lift for physicians to introduce this treatment into their practices and institutions. And when you look at the number of -- the increase of 50% of physicians writing this and the depth of ordering from the IDNs, we're seeing a lot of physicians investing huge amounts of time and energy to actually get through all of the processes, schedule the PET scans or the lumbar punctures, the MRIs. And to me, you don't do that if you don't have a strong conviction in the importance of this treatment to patients. So, personally, as I look at this, I'm extremely encouraged by where we are. I think now, for the first time since the launch, we can look forward to the growth of this market, not just because of the prescriptions, but I look at the evidence base that we are building with our partners at Eisai on LEQEMBI. It's very clear now from the three year data that it probably is not going to be enough to just remove the plaque. We'll need to continue to treat patients. And again, as I was saying earlier, with the AHEAD study, we hope to show that there is a benefit to treating earlier. So this market is going to grow and the evidence base is going to grow. It is market building that we're doing and that certainly takes time and patience. But as I say -- I've said in the past that it's difficult to predict where we're going to go. With this quarter, I think we're seeing we're on a very solid track. And I think the entry of Lilly will only accelerate the development of this marketplace. Chuck Triano : Thank you. Let's take our next question, please. Operator : Yes, our next question will come from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, everyone. This is Nevin on for Brian here. Congrats on a good quarter and thank you in advance for taking our questions. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the SKYCLARYS dynamics that we're seeing, specifically what you're seeing on patient persistence or potential discontinuation rates there. Some of the educational efforts that you're taking to kind of convince the patients to remain on therapy even if they're not seeing the efficacy of the therapy right away. And maybe if you could speak a little bit more to some of the perceptions that patients and doctors may have on the cardiac safety and benefits there as well. Thanks. Alisha Alaimo : All right. Thank you for the question. This is Alisha. First, we are very pleased with what we're seeing right now, especially globally and in the US with SKYCLARYS. And as I've mentioned before, we're past the catch-up population and we're now really into the patient identification phase. We look at every metric from discon, compliance, adherence, start times. And when it comes to discons, we do not see anything outside of what you see in the clinical trials. And so, the discontinuation rate is not anything more than obviously what we also saw in trials. I think when it comes to efficacy of the patients, physicians have been really good on setting expectations with patients on what to expect from SKYCLARYS. The field teams do a really good job of also educating both physicians and educational materials with patients on what to expect when you start this product. And so, you do see that patients tend to stay on product and physicians are very good also about saying to patients, at least stay on it for a year and let's talk about how you're feeling and where we're going and what we're seeing as adherence has been actually very good. I think the other dynamic that's playing out that you could be referring to is because we're now in the patient identification phase, you are going to see a little bit of difference from week-to-week and month-to-month. And we are adding patients every single week. We're also adding them every single month. And we acquire new data on a regular basis. And what we're seeing, at least recently, and I was sharing this with Chris the other day, we have this new AI engine that we've been deploying and we have identified significant number of additional coded FA patients that we didn't even have at the beginning of launch because we're starting to see that patients are engaging even more with their physicians. And so, now we're able to reach them with more efficiency and with more certainty across the board. And I think it's been very promising as we find new patients to come on. Chuck Triano : All right. Thanks, Alicia. Next question, please. Operator : Yes, that will be from Paul Matteis with Stifel. Paul Matteis : Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. I think over the past year, Biogen's commentary on business development capacity has evolved a couple of times. And more recently, I think you said around $10 billion, maybe minus the HI-iBio deal. I guess just kind of going forward in 2024 or the near to mid-term, what's Biogen's appetite for bigger transactions or Reata-like transaction and what's the updated thinking on specific therapeutic areas or types of assets of interest? Thank you. Chris Viehbacher : Yeah, I'll take that one. I think first in terms of where we're looking, I think we're already long neuroscience. So we're probably looking outside of that space, immunology, rare diseases. As I look at Biogen, I would say we have an extremely high scientific and medical capability within the company. We have been historically a company that is in the low volume, high value area. We really understand the necessity to assist patients and physicians for some expensive products to get through a reimbursement, provide and sponsor genetic testing, for example, thinking about studies and real-world evidence becomes extremely important in this. So I think there's a capability of Biogen in rare diseases. Immunology is really an area we've been in since we started with multiple sclerosis. So I think we have the capabilities to go into those areas. I think where we are now is we're on a growth pattern. If we could find another Reata type acquisition, I think we would look for that. But those come along pretty rarely. It's rare that you can find a company that is that close to the market. In fact, it already launched by the time we actually had acquired that. But acquire that for price that still creates shareholder value. And we will continue to look, but they don't come along every day. And we're not in a position where I think we are desperate to do a deal. So we -- I think if you look at what we've done with HI-Bio, for example, as an alternative to that, being able to launch more products in the sort of 2027 to 2030 timeframe is a priority for us. And that's why we're really also focused on the mid to late stage development process. But we can be picky. I think also where we look is not necessarily where everybody else is looking. You really don't create value if you enter into these auction processes. And so, I think by being able to stick to those areas where we think this is -- this is a really -- this is a space where Biogen can really be a strong player, we'll avoid overpaying. I think the other thing I would say is, Biogen is a nice size. $1 billion moves the needle hugely in our company. There are a lot of bigger companies where $1 billion doesn't move the needle. And so, I think we can look at assets where we have the capital that might be too small for some of the bigger players, but be too expensive for some smaller players. So I think in some ways, we're in a position where we can look for assets and not necessarily be in such competitive places where, again, you risk overpaying. But we're looking. We take a systematic view. We're not going to take any sudden left turns strategically just because I'm not sure that that's really where the sweet spot is for Biogen. But I do think there's a number of opportunities out there. We also are doing a lot more in research on collaborations. And I think one of the things I'd like to see us do is really bring a lot more assets in from an early stage because the earlier you can acquire these assets, the more shareholder value you can create. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Chris. Next question, please. Operator : Yes, that will be from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Michael Yee : Hey, guys. Thank you. Earlier in the call, you commented about an emerging lupus portfolio and I know that you do have some upcoming lupus data. We've looked at the prior data. There are reasons to believe that longer treatment and a bigger study could help here. Can you just speak to your expectations? What are you looking for, what needs to happen to move forward, et cetera, et cetera? Thank you. Priya Singhal : Yes, thank you. This is Priya Singhal. So, overall, we are excited about the readout for dapi. It is upcoming in the next several weeks. This is a partnered program with UCB and the collaboration is in very good -- in a very good place. We are expecting a headline or top line results of the first global Phase 3 trial. And specifically, I want to be clear that this study is investigating, in this very high unmet disease area, the safety and efficacy of dapi as an add-on to standard SLE therapy versus placebo as an add on to standard SLE therapy. We are conducting the study in patients who have persistent active or frequent flaring despite stable standard of care. And very similar to the Phase 1 and Phase 2, we will be looking at efficacy assessed by BILAG based Composite Lupus Assessment, or BICLA, but different than the Phase 2 study, it will take place over the 48 weeks to demonstrate the long-term effect. We also increased the sample size to provide a substantial dataset on safety and efficacy. Eventually and ultimately, we'll be looking for a meaningful change on the primary endpoint and key secondaries such as severe flare prevention, patients achieving low dose activity. And we really think that BICLA is a sensitive clinically meaningful composite for SLE disease activity that requires disease improvement across all body symptoms with moderate or severe baseline activity without the need for escalation in steroids or other background medications as well as without worsening. So we're looking forward to this. In addition to an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, we think this could be really meaningful for patients suffering from SLE. So if the results warrant continuing development, at this point, we expect to have the need to run another Phase 3, but we are planning some of this at-risk right now. Chuck Triano : Thanks, Priya. Next question, please. Operator : Yes, we'll now move to Eric Schmidt with Cantor Fitzgerald. Eric Schmidt : Thanks for taking my question. Maybe for Chris, this call today seems to be like a relative high watermark in your tenure as CEO, given some of the initiatives that are now well in place and all that you've accomplished. And you certainly called that out in your prepared remarks. You also called out that you've got some challenges and you're not done. So what in particular is top-of-mind there? Thank you. Chris Viehbacher : Well, thanks for the question. I would hope it's not the high watermark because we're aiming much higher here, I can tell you. I think, clearly, we've got still an MS franchise that is -- we're not done yet in terms of seeing the competitive threats. There's potentially a biosimilar for TYSABRI, we have an important patent litigation that we'll see in the fall for TECFIDERA in Europe and there is the market exclusivity that expires in February. So shorter term, there's always some chop in the water. But I think where we have an opportunity is, we have an amazing talent base inside of Biogen. As you all know, I've been in this business a long time, seen a lot of companies, I continue just to be impressed by the scientific and medical capability that we have in the company and we've got capital. And so, I think we can do smart things with that capital. We've been busy transforming essentially passive capital into active capital. We had two priority review vouchers sitting on the shelf. The innovative nature of Biogen's products is such that we don't really need those vouchers because of the innovative products we bring to market anyway. So we had this one priority review voucher sitting on the shelf for six years that we've now converted hopefully into an active asset. We sold it, but the objective is to spend that on milestones in business development in the second half. If I look at HI-Bio, we took a year-and-a-half of fit for growth savings out of operating expense and transformed that into a growth opportunity with the acquisition of HI-Bio. So where I see us is, I think we're -- we've been able to change the trajectory of the company. We've been able to release resources from the business and reinvest them intelligently and we've got great people that I think can do that with tremendous results. So, I think as we look towards the future, it's really building out now the R&D portfolio, both internally and externally. I'd like to make sure we are still an innovation company going forward that we're not just acquiring our future, but really investing in that. So I think I'm now focused on the 2025 to 2030 timeframe. I think we're in good shape to grow through that period, but I think we can do more to really take advantage of the capability in R&D. And I think you'll see us continue to deploy capital with a lot of discipline but I think be able to turn passive capital into active capital and then into active growth. Chuck Triano : All right. Thank you, Chris. And thank you, everybody, for joining us today. IR team will remain available for any additional questions. Thank you. Operator : And once again, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Cynthia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call and Business Update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dr. Stephen Amato, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Dr. Amato, you may begin your conference. Stephen Amato : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Biogen's third quarter 2024 earnings call. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release and other documents related to our results as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call can be found in the Investors section of biogen.com. We have also posted the slides on our website that will be used during this call. On today's call, I'm joined by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Viehbacher, Dr. Priya Singhal, Head of Development; Mike McDonnell, Chief Financial Officer; as well as our Head and President of North America, Alisha Alaimo who will be available for Q&A. We will make some opening comments, and then we'll move to the Q&A session. To allow us to get through as many questions as possible, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question. I will now turn the call over to Chris. Chris Viehbacher : Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'll start first by thanking you, Steve for stepping up as Interim Head of IR and done a great job of preparing us for this quarter. Also earlier this week, we announced the retirement plans of our CFO, Mike McDonnell, and also the appointment of his successor, Robin Kramer. But Mike is still very firmly in the saddle as CFO, and we will be recognizing his significant contribution to Biogen with the fourth quarter earnings call later. So I think Biogen has made significant and very strong progress over the last two years. And I do think the company is well positioned for the future. Our launches are progressing well with good sequential quarter-over-quarter growth. Our cost base has been significantly reduced, but more importantly, a value-for-money approach to spending, I think, has been embedded in our culture. The acquisitions we've done to date have been well received and are already creating value. And I think we have a strong late-stage pipeline emerging. So if we turn first to the launches, let's start talking about LEQEMBI. Now although LEQEMBI revenue in the US continues to be below the expectations of our collaboration and the prescriber base is not expanded to the extent that we had anticipated, global revenue still grew by 66% in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter and we've got continued uptake outside the US and new prescriber growth of nearly 40% in the US The collaboration continues to refine the commercial strategy, and we are seeing benefits from an increase in our sales force, really who started out there in the field from first of September. And we continue to evaluate opportunities to potentially accelerate our business. Now we've continued to see some health care systems who are treating expand and extend and extending their treatment sites in the US. And more recently, we're starting to see large infusion networks activating in high-population geographies to help absorb patient demand. We've been encouraged by the rate of uptake outside the US, including Japan, where revenue nearly doubled from the previous quarter. And I think there's been terrific launch activities in particular, Japan and China. It does seem like a single payer system has also enabled that kind of growth. And overall, we expect continued sequential growth quarter-on-quarter for LEQEMBI over the near term. We believe there are a few future potential catalysts that could accelerate uptake, including the potential availability of IV maintenance as soon as next year, a subcutaneous formulation for maintenance and eventually induction, and more widespread utilization of blood-based diagnostics. Just to underline how much of a lift this is for physicians, some of you may have noted an opinion piece in JAMA Neurology, dated October 14, that was written by Katherine Possin of UCSF, Jeff Burns at University of Kansas and Brent Forester at Tufts. They talk about the unprecedented time of advances. But equally, they say the challenge and the importance of translating scientific advances in diagnostics, treatment and care into practice in a timely and equitable manner cannot be overemphasized. Innovation at the clinic healthcare system and policy levels is necessary to equitably translate advances at scale. So we continue to believe that this is going to be an important market. But again, we don't believe that we have a demand issue. It is just taking the healthcare system time to actually adapt to treating this number of patients. Turning to SKYCLARYS. We saw increased demand globally as we broadened our footprint, particularly in Europe. SKYCLARYS is now generating revenue from both commercial and other paid mechanisms in 15 markets outside the US. This includes a number of countries in the EU, where we are seeing increased demand quarter-over-quarter. Now at this point, I'd like to say there is a difference between how we generate revenue in the US and how we're seeing demand develop in Europe. In the US, our revenue is rising at the rate we find patients. In Europe, we are actually already out there commercializing the product. And we have a number of early access programs in place. But the strategy for a lot of products in Europe is to get patients on board while you're negotiating with governments to get reimbursement. And at some point, then the governments reimburse those patients and you have an immediate population of patients ready to go because they are already on treatment. So when you're looking at the progression quarter-on-quarter, the ex-US piece is not going to be a reflection of growing demand, but it's going to be a reflection of at what point in time do we get reimbursement for governments. But I can tell you that we are adding patients every day, every week in Europe at a pace that has exceeded our expectations. Now, we are looking to expand access to more patients, and there are now 11 regulatory filings that have been submitted globally. So we're looking now beyond the US and Europe, and they could start generating revenue as soon as next year. ZURZUVAE continues to outperform our expectations commercially in the US where we saw $22 million of revenue in the third quarter, and that's an increase of 49% over the second quarter, driven in part by a 40% increase in patients this quarter. I think the team has done an outstanding job with this launch. In all of the cases we've been talking about, LEQEMBI, SKYCLARYS and ZURZUVAE, I'd just remind everybody that these are not pre-existing markets. We are building these markets in each case. And that always takes longer than having incremental innovation where you go in and you just are looking to take some market share from a pre-existing market. So if we could change the slide, Steve. Our goal is really for sustainable growth. And there\u2019s short term and there's medium-term growth. When I came to the company, I had really three major objectives. One is to put Biogen back onto a sustainable growth pattern for revenue, to build a pipeline that can sustain that growth for Biogen well into the 2030s and also to build a pipeline of leaders who will take this company to even more success in the 2030s. So as we look at the pipeline, I have to say, I think we are very excited about what we see emerging. Again, we are Biogen. We don't do incremental innovation. But I think there are some really interesting products that we feel very good about because unlike a lot of products in the past with Biogen, where we go into Phase 3, and we don't really know whether they're going to work, I think we've seen an awful lot in biomarkers, in data and other indications that suggest there\u2019s a -- we have a growing conviction in these assets. So BIIB080, one of the things that excites me is that although this is an intrathecal as Priya will say, we recruited early on this one and were finished recruiting. And to me, as someone who's had commercial experience over 35 years, when I see a clinical trial recruiting early, particularly in a competitive space where there are existing therapies, that augurs well for the product downstream. Dapirolizumab, we saw positive Phase 3 results, and I'd like to congratulate Priya because Priya had already thought about this and it's worked with UCB and there's actually a Phase 3 protocol ready to go. And so we'll be starting Phase 3 very soon. Lupus is an area of huge unmet need, and we have not only dapi, but we have litifilimab in two indications. And behind that, we have also felzartamab actually in lupus nephritis. In felza, we had some very encouraging data at San Diego in IgAN, and we've had breakthrough status on AMR. This is a game changer for us in terms of our pipeline because, again, here, we've got Phase 2 data that look very compelling. We all know that there are no guarantees in pipeline development. But at least we have, I think, reason to believe that these products could come to market and make a big difference. And as we start to look at the peak revenue for each of these products, the cumulative of all of these, if they all actually made it to market and got approved, have peak sales cumulatively of about $14 billion. And when you consider that our pharma business today is about $7.5 billion, this late-stage pipeline could really transform Biogen over the longer term. But I shouldn't really be talking about pipeline. The real expert is Priya. And so with that, I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Singhal. Priya Singhal : Thank you, Chris. Over the last two years, we have focused heavily on augmenting our pipeline, as Chris noted, with an eye towards transforming innovation into novel and impactful medicines. As a result, I believe our current pipeline has several programs that are both supported by encouraging clinical data and have the potential to deliver meaningful value to patients. This includes dapi in SLE, litifilimab in both SLE and CLE, Felzartamab in multiple immune-mediated diseases, and our tau ASO BIIB080 in Alzheimer's, as Chris suggested. While advancing these programs remains our top priority, we are also working to implement acceleration strategy across the broader portfolio to expedite decision-making while continuing to focus on execution. An important example of this is BIIB080, where we recently completed enrollment in the amended Phase 2 trial design and now expect a readout in 2026. Additionally, with the positive Phase 3 results last month, we are moving very quickly with our collaboration partner, UCB, to initiate a second Phase 3 study for dapi in SLE this year. We are also implementing innovative new clinical development strategies to enhance clinical execution and accelerate cycle times. This includes initiatives like using AI to help optimize clinical trial participation and site selection. In parallel to these efforts and aligned with our ambition of continuing to build the pipeline, we are working also with our research and corporate development colleagues to evaluate external innovation opportunities across the development stage and several indications. Overall, we believe that through these objectives, we have the opportunity to execute on a meaningful opportunity that Chris has laid out for Biogen. Turning to the quarter. I would like to begin with Alzheimer's, where we are working with Eisai to continue generating important insights on LEQEMBI in early AD. This includes areas like long-term treatment effect and real-world evidence, such as that presented at CTAD, but importantly, we are also working to provide optionality for patients. Encouraged by data showing expanded benefit with continued LEQEMBI treatment and beyond just the removal of plaques, we continue to pursue maintenance storing options. We expect regulatory decisions on maintenance dosing for both the IV and the subcutaneous auto-injector next year in 2025. Furthermore, the AHEAD 3-45 study, evaluating the ability of LEQEMBI to prevent or delay Alzheimer's in preclinical or presymptomatic AD enrolled well, and we just completed enrollment this month in October. I look forward to us providing updates as this trial advances. We are also working to expand our leadership by advancing novel treatment approaches, including shuttles across different disease states and targets such as [Technical Difficulty] with BIIB080. Moving to immunology. We believe we are building an industry-leading late-stage pipeline comprised of programs with established proof of concept. These programs cover a range of immune-mediated diseases that are characterized by significant unmet need. This includes our recent acquisition of felzartamab, where we expect to initiate three Phase 3 studies next year in AMR, IgAN and PMN while continuing to evaluate other indications where this mechanism of action may be relevant. Additionally, we have multiple programs in SLE where it is estimated that over 3 million individuals worldwide are affected and current standard of care are associated with suboptimal efficacy and various treatment-related toxicities, leading to lasting negative consequences such as organ damage. SLE is also the number one cause of death in women aged 15 to 24 in the US and treatment options for before, during and after pregnancy are limited due to safety concerns and contraindications for most common therapies. Underscoring the potential of our immunology pipeline, we are pleased to report that the Phase 3 study of dapi plus standard of care met the primary endpoint, showing a statistically significant greater improvement in disease activity as assessed by the BICLA endpoint at 48 weeks versus placebo plus standard of care. Importantly, we also saw clinical improvements on key secondary endpoints assessing disease activity and flare prevention, two areas that represent key treatment goals for the management of SLE. Following the prior Phase 2 study, Biogen, along with our collaboration partner, UCB, spent time analyzing the results in an attempt to design and derisk a Phase 3 study and demonstrate a potential treatment effect. These learnings, combined with our understanding of the underlying disease biology inform the design of the Phase 3 study which included updated screening criteria to ensure patients had active disease in need of a biologic therapy on top of standard of care. The success of this approach is punctuated by the fact that dapi is only the third molecule to show positive Phase 3 results in a global study in SLE over the last 20 years. We look forward to presenting detailed results from this Phase 3 study as a late breaker at the ACR annual meeting next month and together with UCB, expect to initiate the second Phase 3 study this year. Turning to SMA. Our priority has always been on continuing to improve outcomes for patients. We were pleased to present detailed results from the DEVOTE study evaluating the investigational higher-dose regimen of nusinersen at the World Muscle Society meeting earlier this month. The higher dose regimen consists of 250-milligram loading doses followed by 28 milligrams maintenance doses every four months. This regimen of high dose delivers more drug in the first administration than the entire two-month loading phase of the approved SPINRAZA 12-milligram regimen. Consistent with the more rapid loading regimen, higher-dose nusinersen slowed neurodegeneration faster than SPINRAZA 12 milligrams as measured by neurofilament at day 64, an objective biomarker. The pivotal infantile onset cohort in Part B of DEVOTE met the primary endpoint of change from baseline to six months in the CHOP INTEND compared to the prespecified match sham group, demonstrating a clinically and statistically significant improvement. We also observed trends in reduced risk of death or permanent ventilation versus both sham control and the currently approved regimen. In addition, we shared initial results from the open-label Part C portion of the study with participants aged 4 to 65, transitioning from SPINRAZA 12 milligrams after an average of nearly four years on treatment. This group showed improvement in motor function after transitioning to higher dose. These are exciting results as we seek to help patients currently on disease-modifying therapies. Importantly, the high dose regimen was generally well tolerated and showed a safety profile similar to the approved 12-milligram regimen. We believe these results highlight the unique potential of SPINRAZA to help address remaining unmet need in individuals with SMA, and we aim to submit global regulatory filings later this year. In conclusion, this past quarter, I believe we continued to execute well and achieved several important development milestones that highlight the potential of our pipeline to deliver meaningful new therapies to patients. In addition to late-stage readouts in lupus and SMA, we also submitted ex US filings for zuranolone and PPD and obtained approvals for SKYCLARYS and QALSODY in Switzerland and China, respectively. We also presented new data insights across multiple disease areas, at multiple medical meetings, including Alzheimer's, neuromuscular and renal disease. Today, we believe that the pipeline is well positioned to deliver a regular cadence of pivotal readouts and potential launches. We continue to aspire to bring transformative medicines to patients' lives while we deliver on Biogen's objective of achieving sustainable growth. Furthermore, I believe that the same core capabilities and deep disease area expertise that enabled us to reshape our current pipeline and established leadership foothold in areas like Alzheimer's, immunology and rare disease also uniquely position us to evaluate external innovation as we look for opportunities to augment our pipeline. With that, I would now like to hand the call over to Mike for a financial update. Mike McDonnell : Thank you, Priya, and good morning to everyone. And I'd like to provide some color on our third quarter results and all the comparisons that you'll hear me make are versus the third quarter of 2023, unless you hear me note otherwise. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.5 billion. Both total revenue and core pharmaceutical revenue were down 3%. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $4.08 and that's down 6%. In just a moment, I'll provide some additional detail on some key dynamics to note from the third quarter. Non-GAAP operating income increased 4% versus the third quarter of 2023 as we continue to benefit from our R&D prioritization and Fit for Growth initiatives. We are pleased to again be raising our full year 2024 guidance range. And in just a few moments, I'll provide some additional color on our raised guidance range for 2024. Few comments on revenue for the third quarter. Our MS product revenue declined by approximately 9%, and that was driven primarily by competitive dynamics in the space, along with some channel dynamics. Importantly, we announced last week that the European Patent Office upheld the validity of Biogen's TECFIDERA related patent covering DMF dosing, which expires in February of 2028. We are pleased with the decision. However, generics are challenging this patent, and we do anticipate further challenges. TYSABRI has seen impacts from a biosimilar entrant in Europe, and although a biosimilar is not yet launched in the US, we continue to see increasing competition in the high-efficacy class. Next, our rare disease franchise produced revenue of $495 million, and that represents growth of 10%. The SKYCLARYS launch continues to progress in the US, where revenue of $82 million increased 8% from the second quarter, and that was driven by increased demand. SKYCLARYS is now generating revenue in 15 countries outside the US with third quarter global revenue of $102 million. This was up modestly from the second quarter, driven by an increase in demand, and that was partially offset by some pricing and reimbursement dynamics in some newly launched markets. Global SPINRAZA revenue of $381 million declined $67 million or 15% and that was impacted by the loss of an annual tender in Russia, which resulted in an unfavorable impact of approximately $45 million in the third quarter. It is important to note that this tender which occurs and contributes to revenue only once each year affected Q3 2024 results, but we do not expect further revenue impact for the rest of this year. The global decrease was also impacted by the timing of shipments and some foreign currency. SPINRAZA US revenue was up 2% to $153 million, and we remain encouraged by the performance here. ZURZUVAE delivered $22 million of revenue in the quarter, and that's up 49% from the second quarter, and we continue to be encouraged by an increase in demand. We again saw sequential growth for LEQEMBI with third quarter global in-market sales booked by Eisai of approximately $67 million, and that's up 66% versus the second quarter. LEQEMBI in-market sales in the US were $39 million, that's up 33% versus the second quarter. And finally, contract manufacturing, royalty and other revenue was $250 million. That was notably lower year-over-year as expected due to the completion of certain batch commitments in 2023. Now, I'll turn to a few comments on third quarter expenses. Non-GAAP cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased 2 percentage points, and that was driven primarily by product mix, particularly the year-over-year increase in revenue from new product launches and the decrease in contract manufacturing revenue as well as lower idle capacity charges. Non-GAAP R&D expense decreased $48 million as we continue to see benefits from our R&D prioritization initiatives. Non-GAAP SG&A expense increased 1% in the third quarter as benefits from our Fit for Growth initiative allowed us to absorb most of the $45 million of incremental costs in the third quarter associated with our launches. We continue to believe we can garner $1 billion of gross and $800 million of net savings associated with our Fit for Growth initiative by the end of 2025. Non-GAAP EPS was $4.08 in the third quarter. EPS was unfavorably impacted by certain non-operating items, including a decline of approximately $80 million of net interest income on lower cash balances as a result of the Reata and HI-Bio acquisitions. This was partially offset by some favorable tax items in the quarter, which added about $16 million to our net income. Now a brief update on our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $4.6 billion of net debt. We were able to generate approximately $901 million of free cash flow, and that was our highest free cash flow since the second quarter of 2021. Third quarter 2024 free cash flow benefited in part from some favorable working capital dynamics. We continue to believe that our balance sheet remains strong and provides us the capacity to continue to invest in both internal and external growth opportunities. Turning now to guidance. We're pleased that the business performance year-to-date, again supports raising our full year 2024 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance range from between $15.75 and $16.25 to a new range of between $16.10 and $16.60. This new range reflects expected growth of approximately 11% at the midpoint of the range compared to full year 2023. I'd like to highlight a few of the key assumptions relevant to this guidance. First, on the top line, we continue to expect that our total revenue will decline by a low single-digit percentage. And as we've communicated throughout the year, we expect to continue to ramp investment behind our new product launches and key R&D programs which includes felzartamab following our acquisition of HI-Bio. And lastly, as is typically the case with our business, we expect seasonally higher SG&A spend in the fourth quarter as compared to the rest of the year. I would refer you to this slide as well as our press release for other important guidance assumptions. In closing, we remain focused on advancing our ongoing product launches and key areas of our late-stage pipeline. We believe our efforts in these areas will help position Biogen for long-term sustainable growth, which continues to be our number one goal. And with that, we will open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Brian Abrahams : Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. I'm curious on LEQEMBI, when you might expect to see more pull-through from the expanded commercial efforts, whether you're starting to see any of those signals in October. And you mentioned as well the potential for some other commercial acceleration strategies in your prepared remarks. Can you maybe expand on that a little bit more and characterize your overall alignment with Eisai on the commercial plans? Thanks. Chris Viehbacher : Yeah. I'll take the second part of the question, Brian, and then pass it over to Alisha can give a little more color on the expanded field force. I think we have learned an awful lot really in the year since we launched the product. I mean, the product launch really started really last fall, I mean we had to get all of the commercial team in place, but we also needed clarity around things like reimbursement of the PET scans. So for us, I think this is about the anniversary really of the launch. And there are a lot of things that we are now understanding, the time it can take for IDNs to really get their protocols in place and the care pathways. But there are also a number of things like who's the right patient? And we have also an awful lot more data coming along. We're going to have the subcutaneous formulation, hopefully, next year for maintenance, the IV for maintenance sometime next year. And so it seems opportune for the two partners now to come together and just review what's working well and what could we be doing more. So we'd probably be able to give you some more color on that. I would say the teams are working very well together. We both understand that this is a very complicated launch. I think more complicated than most that I've certainly seen, I think, most people have seen. And yet, we do see a lot of physicians, again, who are really putting an awful lot of work in to make all of this happen to triage the patients as to who's really the right patient, a high percentage of patients coming into the neurologists are not eligible for treatment. Then organizing the PET scans are the lumbar punctures, the MRIs and the infusion beds. So we've seen an awful lot of real effort out there in the marketplace, and we add prescribers every week and we see more sales every week. And so I think that's the way it's going to progress probably until we get the subcutaneous for induction. I think that could be quite a game changer. And again, more use of the blood-based diagnostics in place of the PET scan. Both of those would, I think, dramatically reduce the workload of physicians. But Alisha, maybe you can talk about the expanded field force and anything else you think might be helpful. Alisha Alaimo : Yeah. Thank you, Chris, and thanks for the question, Brian. As all of you have seen in Q3, we did have steady launch progress as we've seen in prior quarters and that's including in the new number of patients. Also encouraging what you don't see in the trends that we're able to see is the total prescribers writing and actually in Q3 the new number of writers increased by 40% versus Q2. So you are seeing these physicians come on every single week, IDNs expanding every single week as well. However, at the end of the day, just like in the beginning of the launch and even today, fast forward after we've been out in the field for a while, what shows up in market research as the key barrier is still these infrastructure challenges, as Chris alluded to. However, now with the new Biogen team on Board, we're also able to confirm that, especially with physicians who haven't written yet, that is really one of their main concerns. Our second concern, of course, is still ARIA, even though it's not as big of a concern as it was prior. However, once they work through some patients and they work out their protocols, you do see that alleviate. However, we now have our full field force out there. And as a reminder, we were very intentional as an organization as to who to hire. We were in a little bit of a luxury situation at the time when we posted these roles, we had over 1,000 applicants and we only had a little over 25 roles that we had posted. So we were really able to pick those individuals who either had history in Alzheimer's disease or a history in these territories and already had built-in relationships. And so now the teams have been out there for several weeks. We are starting to see in the offices specifically where Biogen has overlaid with Eisai. Where we are engaging, we do see a little bit more accelerated growth than what you do see in the rest of the nation, we're able to reach more targets and also, doors are opening up a little more easily for us because, again, those representatives did have prior relationships with physicians. And so in the longer term, we obviously are going to continue with doing frequency in depth. But at the end of the day, for example, we can say in the Pacific Northwest, we had a rep that's been -- had a relationship that actually prior with MS for 17 years, they're able to help the physician right away. Another physician in the Southeast they had a relationship over 20 years. They were able to unlock over 30 patients, I think, in less than a two-week time period. So the relationships we've seen has mattered. Also the history has mattered, and we are starting to see some acceleration, even though they've only been out there fully for about a month or so. Stephen Amato : Thank you, Alisha. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with TD Cowen. Phil Nadeau : Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Chris, you've referenced the subcutaneous formulation a couple of times already this morning. Could you give us a bit more of an update on the status of the subcu filings both for maintenance as well as for induction? Thanks. Chris Viehbacher : Sure. I'll turn that over to Priya. Priya Singhal : Yes, thank you for that question. So we remain on top to really complete our subcutaneous maintenance filing as Eisai has indicated, and we expect that to be imminent. And then moving on to the initiation, we are working to generate the data, analyze the data. This is part of the CLARITY open-label extension study in the subcutaneous sub-study. And as Eisai has indicated, we remain on track to expect a regulatory outcome on subcutaneous initiation therapy by Q1 of 2026 calendar year. Stephen Amato : Thank you, Priya. Next question please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Marc Goodman with Leerink. Marc Goodman : Yes. Could you comment a little bit more on SKYCLARYS OUS. There was a comment in the opening remarks about pricing and reimbursement dynamics. And if you could just give us a little more color there to the challenges. Thank you. Chris Viehbacher : Yeah. So as you know, you get approval in Europe, but then you have to go country by country to negotiate for reimbursement. And basically, what we are already doing is seeing physicians, and we're getting patients on treatment. But the actual revenue generation of those patients varies by country. So there are some countries, for instance, where you can charge for an early access program. There are countries where you can't, there are some countries where you can get reimbursement much earlier than other European countries. So we are in that process. What we have not done is really started the revenue generation -- sorry, the patient demand generation with reimbursement. We are active in all countries and signing up patients. And so we're tracking patient numbers, which are growing considerably every month. What you will see in the quarterly revenue numbers is when those patients convert to revenue-generating patients. And that is, by definition, going to be a little lumpy because the patient demand is actually in advance of when we generate revenue. And on the -- on those programs where you have early access that you can pay for, you have to establish a price. But in some cases, there is a clawback if the reimbursed price is going to be lower than what the prices you're charging. And obviously, as we go into countries and have a better idea where the price point is, we've had to make some adjustments on revenue that we have booked and those programs where we can charge for an EAP. And that's just really a normal process in most launches in Europe. Stephen Amato : Thank you, Chris. Next question, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Salveen Richter : Thank you, good morning. Chris, you spoke to the efforts with regard to the late-stage pipeline in R&D, but you've also noted the lever with regard to business development. Any updated thoughts here as to the strategy for the latter on the [ford] (ph)? Chris Viehbacher : Yeah, I mean we're in one of those classic situations in our industry where we've had a legacy portfolio of assets that is facing increased competition. And on the horizon, we see an extremely promising pipeline and how do you bridge across that. And some companies choose to simply wait that out and wait for the arrival of the pipeline. And our business is likely to grow between now and 2028, but I would say that the growth is not necessarily satisfactory for us. So we are looking and continue to look, I spent personally quite a lot of time on this. Are there assets that we could bring in that could enhance our revenue growth in the near term but also that still create value for shareholders. We're not really interested in just buying revenue. If we can buy growth, and we can make a very good return on investment, then we'll do so. But as you know, assets get pretty highly priced as they get close to the market. So you have to do an awful lot of digging and an awful lot of looking, and that's what we are doing. We have a whole team of people that look at both public and private companies. And I think we still have considerable financial capacity. And Mike, you may want to comment on that. But we are active in that, but we are also disciplined fiduciaries of shareholder money. I've always said we get paid to make our shareholders wealthy, not somebody else's shareholders. Mike McDonnell : Yeah. So, Salveen, just on capacity, just to give you a frame of reference. We ended the quarter with about $1.7 billion of cash on hand. And when you think about our capital structure, about $6.3 billion in total debt on an EBITDA run rate of about $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. So it's below 2 times gross, that's a very modest amount. And when you think about capacity, we're pleased with about $2 billion of free cash flow year-to-date, $901 million in the quarter. So with a couple of billion dollars plus of free cash flow per year and less than two turns of gross leverage, you can see over the next couple of years, if you added a reasonable amount of incremental debt at some point in time plus the free cash flow and the cash on hand, there's comfortably $8 billion to $10 billion of capacity that you've got over the next year or two in order to collaborate and transact and look at acquisitions and other things that we can do to help supplement our growth. Stephen Amato : Thank you, Mike. Next question please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Michael Yee : Thank you, good morning. We noticed that you completed the enrollment of the AHEAD 3-45 study. And I just wanted to ask Priya, if you could remind us what the timeline would look for that, more specifically, if there is a potential for an interim analysis handle what that would be based on? My understanding is that these are pretty early presymptomatic patients. Is there an enrichment of the population? And why would you be expecting that this can be positive? Thank you. Priya Singhal : Thank you, Michael. Yes, we're excited about the fact that AHEAD 3-45 has completed enrollment in October. Just to remind everyone, it's two trials, and one is really looking at early intermediate stages, patients with early intermediate stages of amyloid and the other is with higher load amyloid. And these are very large trials. So it's about 400 patients in the AHEAD 3, which is the earliest intermediate stage and about 1,000 patients in AHEAD 4, 5 and the timeline, the trials have a 216-week time point. Having said that, we are continuing in parallel to engage with regulators and look at all options of when these might be ready to read out. So we'll continue to provide more updates, but we're very excited about having completed enrollment, specifically because the data that we've shared from the CLARITY study shows that treating early and with patients with low tau or no tau, really, you see a lot of benefits in terms of stabilization and actually even clinical improvement. So it continues to really be a very exciting space for patients to have therapies, and that's why we're very excited about where we are today. Stephen Amato : Thank you, Priya. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I thought I'd focus on a slightly different topic for a quick second. It does look like there's a very significant amount of R&D investment going into lupus between your felzartamab, as well as your BDCA molecule and possibly the CD38 as well. And I guess my broader question is this. You hit a Phase 3, which is obviously good news. But separately, we're seeing incredible remission data from some CD19 CAR-Ts, which might even possibly manifest in some CD19 bispecifics as well. So it seems like you have a lot of exposure, not on that area, which is CD19 bispecific. And I guess, how should we weigh by the time you guys do get to this market relative to some of the emerging data from potentially CD19 bispecific or the T cell engagers? Thank you very much. Priya Singhal : Thank you, Umer. Yes, we continue to watch the innovation in the space, and it's exciting for patients. But I think when you step back and you think about the potential, the dapi can offer. And with the data that we shared and we'll be sharing more data at ACR in a few weeks here, and it is embargoed, we're very excited by what we've seen in this moderate to severe population. So just stepping back, when you look at SLE, it is really a chronic disease, very heterogeneous, high global burden of disease, specifically in women and underserved population. And we believe that many options will be required. So I think while the bispecifics and the CAR-Ts may show efficacy in small population, we've got to keep in mind that these are very small data sets and likely may not be relevant to the entire population. And I think that here is where the scientific hypothesis and continuing to generate data sort of in Phase 2 that makes us believe that we could have a high probability of success in Phase 3 becomes really important. And with dapi, we're really addressing and inhibiting the CD40 ligand, which has the ability to reduce B and T cell activation, downregulating interferon pathways. And then with litifilimab, we're going after the Type 1 interferon signature and really looking at inhibiting BDCA2 in the plasma delta itself. So we believe that this is going to be really important and probably many options are required, but we remain really optimistic about the data that we've seen so far and the momentum that we have with our trials. So we continue to be believers in these pathways and these programs. With litifilimab, as you know, we're also addressing cutaneous lupus where really there has been no innovation in 70 years. So again, we have high scientific conviction, as Chris mentioned, and we'll continue to prosecute these. Chris Viehbacher : And I'll just add, Umer, I was at GSK when we were developing BENLYSTA over 15 years ago, and we almost killed that program because of modest efficacy until we realized that everything else was failing, and this was the last product standing. And to date, only two products have been approved. Dapi would be the third. And I can tell you, over the years, we've seen an awful lot of data in small populations as Priya has said. And so I think we have to wait and see who actually gets to the finish line. On CAR-T, some interesting data, but the logistics of CAR-T are not yet such that you're going to be seeing significant numbers of patients being treated in my personal opinion. So I think as Priya said, there's a need there today. We have a product that has demonstrated results we're going full speed ahead. And just given the nature of this disease, I think you're going to find that there's not going to be any one product that ultimately is a winner. It's going to take different approaches. Stephen Amato : Thank you, Chris. Next question please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Olson with Oppenheimer. Jay Olson : Hey, congrats on the quarter, and thank you for taking the question. We're curious about the $14 billion of peak revenue potential from your four key pipeline programs. Can you talk about the relative contribution and timing of the four products in terms of which ones are the largest and nearest term? Thank you. Chris Viehbacher : I don't want to get into giving individual revenue forecast. I think the idea was to give a sense of what's the magnitude of pipeline. We all know that not everything can always succeed. But I do think if you look at where are there going to be significant programs, if you look at BIIB080 in Alzheimer's, we do believe, and I think Biogen is not the only one. I see Lilly and Roche continue to invest significantly. You've seen AbbVie lay out quite an awful lot of money for a very early-stage asset in Alzheimer's. So I think we all believe that as the healthcare system is ultimately able to adapt to the significant demand for treatment that this becomes an important market. And what we can see, and I was just at a major world-class medical school last week, spent a day there with a lot of researchers in Alzheimer's, they are excited about tau in a way that we have not seen always at a beta. Alzheimer's severity really varies with the level of tau and people really believe -- a lot of people in the field really believe that going after tau will really have a significant benefit for patients. So we do think that BIIB080 is certainly a product with a tremendous amount of potential. And as Priya said, we have dapi, but we also have litifilimab and also felza in lupus nephritis. So we do see that lupus is going to be a significant market. And again, you look at you look at BENLYSTA that is selling at about $3 billion a year. And then there's an AstraZeneca product that hasn't done as well, but you look at the numbers of patients, this is still a market where there's considerable room for expansion. In felza, we have three Phase 3 programs going in, and we see all of those three indications as being a significant opportunity. So again, you add them up. 14 is kind of like the top number, but somewhere between 9 and 14 is what our teams have estimated. Again, we have to wait and see what the clinical trial data looks like in the actual profile. But if you look at the potential of these markets and the unmet need and the potential for differentiation, we're becoming increasingly excited about this emerging pipeline. Stephen Amato : Thank you, Chris. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Evan Seigerman : Hi guys. Thank you so much for taking my questions. I know in the past we've talked about the potential for SPINRAZA returning to growth. Given the softer numbers this quarter, can you just talk about how you think that this is achieved. Is it predicated on high-dose nusinersen? Or are there other factors and levers that you can pull to accelerate -- reaccelerate the growth of this product? Thank you. Chris Viehbacher : Well, so globally, actually, if we take out some of the onetime effects of -- or sort of the exceptional effects of the ex US, ex European markets, actually, we did see a growth for SPINRAZA. It's clearly a very competitive marketplace. And -- but it turns out that even though we have an intrathecal administration, that efficacy is really what matters in really severe diseases. And that's what we compete on. We had a study that has demonstrated, for example, the benefit of adding SPINRAZA on to ZOLGENSMA as gene therapy and we know that the oral therapies have limitations in terms of which patients can be treated. I think that our teams believe that DEVOTE is extremely important because we can get to the -- through the loading doses and get to the right level of therapeutic benefit faster than we could previously. And that actually reduces the number of intrathecal injections at least for the loading phase. So I think this is really an efficacy gain, but I'll ask Alisha, at least from a US perspective, how you see that? Alisha Alaimo : Thank you, Chris. And hello, Evan, thank you for the question. SPINRAZA has really been a very strong contributor, especially in the US business. So when you look at rare disease, we believe that SPINRAZA has really set that benchmark for what really excellent efficacy looks like and then it translates down to a patient. And so growth year-over-year, which my team has seen, and even that's during a time we've had two very strong competitors. We had oral launch during stay-at-home orders and the team is still really leading the way with SPINRAZA. And we do believe it's for a few reasons. One, the efficacy of the product is obviously very strong. And a lot of our growth also comes from switchback. There's a lot of patients that are returning back to SPINRAZA once they've switched away to a competitor, and they realize that maybe the efficacy isn't there. And so we do see quite a bit of that in the US. And secondly, you fast forward eight years, we are still finding new patients in this space, and that's with three major biopharma companies putting money into this rare disease. And so you do see new patients still coming online. And we believe at least on the Biogen side, we are very good at patient finding. We're able to find them quite quickly. We have an excellent AI sort of machine that we use along with the field force. We're able to locate them in centers of excellence and physicians are able to reach out and find these patients. And so with high dose coming, one of the pieces of feedback you do get from physicians and patients, as you know, we just wish we had more. And so with that, we're preparing right now for that, obviously, the filing and the potential approval going into label, and we do believe that high dose will also support growth quarter-over-quarter, year-on-year for at least the US organization. Stephen Amato : Thank you, Alisha. Next question please, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Matteis with Stifel. Paul Matteis : Hey, thanks very much for taking the question. In connecting some of the dots here, Chris, as it relates to the hires you've made and some of your portfolio decisions around certain legacy high-risk assets, it feels like more and more Biogen is bolstering its expertise in neurology and maybe shifting away from neurology. Is that the right way we should think about things going forward? In other words, when you look at business development, do you have any appetite any more to take on risk in neuroscience or do you feel like immunology, rare areas that you have a lot of experience with historically are going to be the sweet spot going forward? Thanks. Chris Viehbacher : I would say, first, we're already long in neurology and neuroscience. I mean we have very significant investments, obviously, with the BIIB080 program, continued significant investment in LEQEMBI. We're still spending hundreds of millions of dollars every year on the LEQEMBI R&D. And we have actually a number of programs coming behind that in early-stage development. We're working on brain shuttle technology, but looking at other modalities in Alzheimer's, we still have earlier-stage programs in MS and ALS, a significant program in Parkinson's in partnership with Denali. So I think we see neuroscience as somewhere where we already have a significant commitment. But to me, I think it's not a good idea to just be in one therapeutic area. And in addition, I think we actually already have capabilities beyond neuroscience. The whole MS franchise is really an immunology franchise. You treat MS through the immune system. And I do believe we have an awful lot of immunology capability and that certainly gave us the confidence to do the HI-Bio acquisition. I&I, I go to a number of biotech conferences and venture conferences. I&I has now become the second most important area in R&D after oncology. And so you're going to have an awful lot of emerging opportunities for BD in this space. Biogen has a tremendous capability in small volumes and high-value products, highly differentiated scientific cell. And I think immunology fits that build. Rare disease is really more of a commercial description than a scientific one, but we do have a commercial model in rare diseases that has an awful lot of capability that not everybody does. And so expanding into that area with that commercial model almost being, I would say, indication agnostic is an area that we can go. And I don't think we're stretching our capabilities. There are some capabilities that we have to build. And in some ways, Fit for Growth was as much shifting some of the focus away from a traditional heavy focus on MS and being able to adopt some of these other capabilities. But I wouldn't -- we don't really want to get into those areas where we'd have to go up against really large pharma companies in the commercial model. We're not really into incremental innovation in Biogen. So I feel pretty comfortable that we can expand our horizons in certain areas of immunology, probably more related to rare diseases and neurological conditions in immunology, not necessarily things like RA or atopic dermatitis. But we have a legitimacy to play there, and we have the capability and we can really take advantage of a lot of the really smart people within Biogen. Stephen Amato : Thank you, Chris. Can we move to our last question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Terence Flynn : Thanks for taking the question. Mike, I was just wondering if you can help us think directionally about margins for 2025 and some of the puts and takes. Thank you. Mike McDonnell : Sure. And I'm going to assume, Terence, that you're referring primarily to our operating income margin. But I think we've made really good progress. The improvement in the third quarter, it was a little bit less than what you've seen. There's a little bit of lumpiness to it. And I think it's probably -- and some of that was driven by the revenue dynamics that we talked about in the quarter and some of the higher margin revenue like SPINRAZA, SKYCLARYS. But I think if you look at it on a year-to-date basis, that's probably the best way. We're 7% up year-to-date on the operating income line, a 7 percentage point improvement, I should say, it's 23% growth year-on-year. In our guidance, we talk about mid-single-digit improvement for the full year and high teens growth for full year. And I think that we feel good about the improvement that we've made. We still feel confident that we can garner the $1 billion gross and $800 million net savings, which will continue to help our margins. And we're not guiding beyond this year, but as we exit 2024 and head into 2025, I think it's important to remember that we've said that the $800 million of savings we expected to get half of that by the end of this year and the other half next year. So that will continue to improve our margin profile as we go. Stephen Amato : Thank you, Mike, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Of course, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
